										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.gorgias.com">Gorgias</a> announced today that it has raised $25 million in Series B funding, bringing the startup&#8217;s pre-money valuation to $300 million.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/gorgias-series-a/">the company raised its Series A</a> just over a year ago, CEO Romain Lapeyre (who founded Gorgias with CTO Alex Plugaru) told me that it works with e-commerce businesses to automate responses to their most common customer service questions, while also providing tools that help the support team respond more quickly and even convince customers to buy additional products and services.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gorgias" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gorgias">Gorgias <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says it now supports more than 4,500 stores, including Steve Madden, Timbuk2, Fjällräven, Marine Layer, Ellana, Electrolux and Sergio Tacchini. And revenue has grown 200% this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That may not be surprising, given the overall growth in e-commerce during the pandemic. As Lapeyre put it, merchants saw &#8220;a huge boost&#8221; in online orders, which resulted in a similar rise in customer service requests — so they&#8217;re increasingly turning to Gorgias for help.</p>
<p>Initially, Lapeyre said merchants are just eager to respond to their customers more quickly and to make their support team more efficient. But over time, they become more interested in using customer support &#8220;as way to drive sales.&#8221; In fact, he recalled talking to one business that used to compensate its support team based on response time and now offers them a sales commission.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1916983" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1916983" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1916983" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?w=680" alt="Gorgias screenshot" width="680" height="517" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=300,228 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=768,584 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=680,517 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1916983" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gorgias</p></div></p>
<p>He said he expects these trends to continue after the pandemic ends: &#8220;We just jumped five years into the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gorgias has now raised a total of $40 million. The new round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sapphire-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sapphire-ventures">Sapphire Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from SaaStr, Alven, Amplify Partners, CRV and Greycroft.</p>
<p>Lapeyere said the money will allow Gorgias to continue hiring (it went from a team of 30 people to more 100 people this year), particularly on the engineering side, where it can develop even more automation for the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;As consumers increasingly shop online, the Gorgias platform powers a new breed of customer support for high-growth e-commerce brands,” said Sapphire Ventures Managing Director Rajeev Dham in a statement. “Co-founder and CEO Romain Lapeyre and team have built an incredible product that provides e-commerce merchants with a single app to manage all of their customer communications — ultimately delivering a far better customer experience.&#8221;</p>

Bramble Berry&#8217;s beginners kits are the perfect way to get started and include everything your recipient needs, including safety googles (EXTREMELY important when handling lye) and a digital scale.

<h2>Cricut Explore Air 2</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2085766" style="width: 1035px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085766" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2085766 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg" alt="" width="1025" height="456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg 1025w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg?resize=300,133 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg?resize=768,342 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg?resize=680,303 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085766" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cricut</p></div></p>
<p>Anyone who dabbles in crafting and DIY probably already knows what a Cricut is, but if not: it&#8217;s a robot with a friggin&#8217; knife attached to it.</p>
<p>That oversimplifies things a bit, but the Cricut is a device capable of cutting incredibly intricate designs with high precision, fast. It can handle cuts in a few minutes that would take <em>hours</em> to do by hand (and would totally leave your hand cramping.)</p>
<p>Tired of cutting things out? Swap out the blade for a pen, and have it draw or write, instead, or a scoring tool to prep paper projects for any folding they might need. It&#8217;ll help you make greeting cards, or gift boxes, or custom t-shirts, or stickers, or a mountain of other things. Cricut loaned me (Greg) a machine to check out a few weeks ago and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s been turned off for a full day since.</p>
<p>The Explore Air 2 is the company&#8217;s latest midrange device and can handle cutting paper, vinyl, cardstock, poster board, various fabrics and loads of other thin materials. The free design software that comes with it is way more capable than I expected, and they&#8217;ve got an add-on subscription service that can help you source ready-to-use art until you&#8217;re ready to bring your own. It&#8217;s got built-in Bluetooth for when you want to control it from your iOS or Android device, and can handle materials up to 12&#8243; wide. If you know anyone who already has a Cricut up and running, mats (sticky sheets that hold your material in place while the machine is cutting) and things like vinyl/cardstock are probably welcome stocking stuffers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><em>(And for anyone who&#8217;s ever thought about getting into laser cutting, the fundamentals are incredibly similar. While I hesitate to recommend anyone randomly buy a laser cutter as a gift because they require training to use safely, a lot of the core knowledge you pick up here — working with vector art, efficiently arranging things on your cutting surface, dealing with different materials, etc — will translate quite easily.)</em></p>
<p><b>Price: </b>$180 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078WFWM1F/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B078WFWM1F&amp;linkId=31a863b81c71bbb161857aed4e78307f">from Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Electric Eel Wheel Nano</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2081552" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081552" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2081552" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg" alt="Electric Eel Wheel Nano spinning wheel" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2081552" class="wp-caption-text">Electric Eel Wheel Nano spinning wheel. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dreaming Robots</p></div></p>
<p>Do you know someone who loves knitting, crocheting or weaving? Chances are if they love working with yarn, they might want to level up to spinning their own yarn. If you have a friend who is curious about spinning, but not ready to commit to a full-sized spinning wheel yet, consider gifting them the compact Electric Eel Wheel Nano. Of course, they’ll need fiber to spin. The Woolery’s hand spinner bundle includes five different kinds of wool so they can decide which one they like best.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $110 for the <a href="https://www.dreamingrobots.com/product/eew-nano">Electric Eel Wheel Nano</a> | $70 for <a href="https://woolery.com/hand-spinner-wool-bundle.html">the wool bundle</a></p>
<h2>Caran D’Ache Neocolor II</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2081553" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081553" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2081553" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg" alt="Caran D'Ache Neocolor II water soluble pastels" width="1024" height="876" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg?resize=300,257 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg?resize=768,657 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg?resize=680,582 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2081553" class="wp-caption-text">Caran D&#8217;Ache Neocolor II water soluble pastels. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Caran D&#8217;Ache</p></div></p>
<p>Caran D’Ache Neocolor II water-soluble pastels are extremely satisfying to work with. First, you lay down a light or thick layer of pigment. Then you can smush it around, like with oil pastels. And <em>then</em> you can brush water over everything to turn it into a vibrant painting. Depending on how Neocolor II is used, it works on many different materials in addition to paper, including glass and textiles (cover designs with a piece of scrap fabric and then heat set it with an iron).</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Starts at $14.99 for a box of 10 colors<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009I8LEU/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0009I8LEU&amp;linkId=5e77356554a5b1dcac0aa686a6e1e7c9"> on Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Apple Pencil</h2>
<p><div style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/appleevent_2015_62.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>This one really only works if they&#8217;ve already got a relatively recent iPad (or you&#8217;re looking to buy them one of those, too). But if they do, an Apple Pencil can really help them take things to the next level. From sketching out ideas in Procreate (also a great gift, if they don&#8217;t have it!), to jotting down measurements in the Notes app, to creating vector art for cutting/etching/t-shirt making, a really good stylus is<em> leagues </em>ahead of just poking at the screen with your finger. It can be a<em> little </em>tricky to determine which Pencil is compatible with which iPad, so you might have to do some sleuthing there.</p>

<p>What a week, yeah? Instead of the news cycle slowing as the year races to a close, things are still as hot as ever. We have funding rounds big and small, IPOs, first-day extravaganza and more.</p>
<p>Luckily we had the whole crew around &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">me</a>. Here’s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Career Karma <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/career-karma-series-a/">raised $10 million</a>, and we have thoughts and concerns.</li>
<li>Skyflow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">raised $17.5 million</a> in an effort to try to get the Equity team to understand the nuances of different encryption types.</li>
<li>Calm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/">raised $75 million</a>, which felt pretty reasonable given reports and its fundraising history.</li>
<li>Squire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/squire-series-c/">tripled its valuation</a> in a new round that included $45 million in equity capital along with some debt.</li>
<li>We also talked about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">DoorDash and C3.ai IPO pops</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/airbnb-said-to-price-ipo-between-67-and-68/">where Airbnb priced</a>, and who is coming next.</li>
<li>We rounded off with what&#8217;s up with TikTok stars investing in tech startups. Danny was not a fan.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After pricing above its raised range last night, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbnb">Airbnb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> opened this morning at $146 per share, up around 115% to kick off its life as a public company.</p>
<p>The company is now worth $158 per share. Using its IPO share count inclusive of shares reserved for underwriters, the company is worth $95.1 billion, but on a fully diluted basis, including shares that could be exercised or awarded in the future, Airbnb is worth much more.</p>
<p>The home-sharing unicorn initially targeted $44 to $50 per share in its debut, later raising that range to $56 to $60 before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/airbnb-said-to-price-ipo-between-67-and-68/">pricing at at $68 per share</a>. To open at such a premium is not shocking given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">how the debuts of DoorDash and C3.ai performed earlier in the week</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Taken as a trio, the companies&#8217; amped public debut are stoking concerns of mispriced IPOs.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>However, taken as a trio, the companies&#8217; amped public debut are stoking concerns of mispriced IPOs and, at least in my head, public markets that are more enthusiastic than reasonable.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The explosive debuts of the enterprise AI company, the home-sharing giant and the food-delivery leader were not the first IPOs of 2020 to set off fireworks when trading began. Snowflake, another megadebut, gained more than 100% in its first trading day, despite pricing above its own raised IPO price range.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? Let&#8217;s use Snowflake as a prism through which we can figure it out. Lemonade, the summer insurtech IPO, will also provide some useful guidance.</p>
<h2>Was Snowflake underpriced?</h2>
<p>When Snowflake&#8217;s IPO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/go-public-now-while-software-valuations-make-no-sense-part-ii/">went out with a thunderclap</a>, it was more ammunition for critics of the traditional public offering. <em>The company and its private investors had done so much work to get Snowflake to the public markets,</em> complaints seemed to go, <em>and then some idiot bankers mispriced its debut by 100%, rewarding their clients and screwing the company? Awful!</em></p>
<p>So went the argument. However, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/19/was-snowflakes-ipo-mispriced-or-just-misunderstood/">as I wrote at the time</a>, leaning on the work of Forbes&#8217; excellent reporting, Snowflake&#8217;s CEO was not fully bought into the concept:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alex Konrad at Forbes — a good chap, follow him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/alexrkonrad">here</a> — caught up <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/09/17/snowflake-ceo-frank-slootman-talks-ipo-pop-narrative-of-lost-billions-is-nonsense-talk/#79e69e937d1d">with Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman about the matter</a>. He called the “chatter” that his company left money on the table “nonsense,” adding that he could have priced higher but that he “wanted to bring along the group of investors that [Snowflake] wanted, and [he] didn’t want to push them past the point where they really started to squeal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the &#8220;long-term investor&#8221; argument that you will hear on any call with a CEO on their IPO day. It goes like this: If you want long-term holders of the stock, you have to find a price that they will accept; that price may be different than what retail investors will pay when the company begins to trade. So, the gap, or pop, is fine as you are trading one thing for another.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

			The coronavirus pandemic accelerated America’s addiction to technology, and it’s making us sad, anxious and unproductive.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>My perspective is as a former tech CEO and technology addict. The marketing platform I founded raised over $100 million, grew to 350 employees and sold to a private equity firm last year. Along the way I picked up some terrible tech habits; I checked email constantly and allowed push notifications to interrupt every in-person interaction.</p>
<p>My tech use hit rock bottom last year on a visit with family. I resolved to put down my phone and garden with my mom, who has advanced Parkinson&#8217;s and moves slowly and with intention.</p>
<p>I felt like an addict in withdrawal. My phone was like a magnet pulling me to check for missed work emails or breaking news. Tech overuse had rewired my brain, lowered the quality of everyday consciousness and prevented me from being present.</p>
<p>I stepped down as CEO of my company earlier this year. I’ve spent my time off learning about mindfulness, neuroplasticity and technology addiction. Most importantly, I developed a strategy for managing my tech use that’s made me happier and more productive.</p>
<p>Here’s what I learned.</p>
<h2>Tech firms exploit our brains to capture our attention</h2>
<p>In their quest for our attention, some tech firms target the oldest parts of our brain, what UCLA psychiatrist Daniel Siegel calls the <em>downstairs brain</em>. The <em>downstairs brain </em>includes your brainstem and limbic regions, which control innate reactions and impulses (fight or flight) and strong emotion (like anger and fear). In contrast, your <em>upstairs brain</em>, including your cerebral cortex, is where intricate mental processes take place, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mindsight-New-Science-Personal-Transformation/dp/0553386395">thinking, imagining and planning</a>.</p>
<p>The downstairs brain is reactive. It’s designed to protect us in emergencies; it can make quick judgements, hijack our consciousness and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4678200/">drive action through strong emotion.</a> The downstairs brain is what is targeted by attention-seeking products. Headlines that make us feel outraged and TikTok notifications that make us feel reactive appeal to our downstairs brain.</p>
<h2>Spending time in a reactive state rewires our brains</h2>
<p>Our brains change with training. Research has shown that our brains are reprogrammed with the firing patterns of neurons. Our nervous system can be rewired and transformed through repetitive, focused attention or activity in a process called <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01657/full">neuroplasticity</a>.</p>
<p>Repetitive device usage is a perfect example of neuroplasticity at work. The more time we spend responding to push notifications, watching videos in infinite scroll or looking for social validation from social media, the more our brains will rewire to want the same.</p>
<h2>Our addiction will get worse as firms get better at capturing attention</h2>
<p>While many tech firms acknowledge problems from overusing their products, none will make radical changes needed to decrease their share of the attention profit pool. If they did, someone else would eat their lunch.</p>
<p>These firms are selling us sugary drinks. The taste is improving exponentially and the sweetest drinks haven’t been invented yet. The more we drink, the harder it gets to stop. We need to take control of our consumption and habits — we need to follow a technology diet — or we will suffer the mental equivalent of morbid obesity.</p>
<h2>We can can rewire our brains to be more productive and happier by changing our habits</h2>
<p>If we think of technology consumption as an analog to food consumption, tech products fall into four food groups based on the quality of information and method of delivery. Content quality is important: Some content is valuable (e.g., MIT’s online courseware) or critical (work email), while most is not useful (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiktok">TikTok) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The delivery model is also important. Healthy platforms give agency to the user and allow us to pull content that’s useful when we need it. Conversely, harmful platforms often rely on push, sending us information that’s often not useful at a time when we’re doing something else. Based on my experience, here are three steps we can take to implement a tech diet:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Eliminate products that reinforce your downstairs brain (low-quality content pushed to you)</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion">Willpower is finite</a>. If we don’t want sugary drinks, don’t keep them in the house. We keep the most distracting applications ever developed within arms reach at all times. These applications prey on our downstairs brain, which hijacks our better intentions <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/its-official-more-you-use-facebook-worse-you-will-feel-about-yourself.html">and delivers negative value for most people</a>. I believe our best defense is abstinence; we shouldn’t use these apps.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>I use Apple’s Content Restrictions on the iPhone and MacBook. I added the obvious offenders: TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and some specific to me, which includes <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zillow" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zillow">Zillow, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> StreetEasy and NYPost. My spouse has the override code. I can break it if needed, but the process is hard enough that it doesn’t enter everyday consciousness.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Consume more products that reinforce your upstairs brain (high-quality content that’s available when we need it)</strong></h3>
<p>Good content expands our knowledge and skills and may contribute to rewiring our upstairs brain in a way that adds to our empathy, imagination and mindfulness.</p>
<p>Consuming good content is rewarding but effortful. It requires <a href="http://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/gorilla_experiment.html">uninterrupted focus</a>. Unlike sugary beverages, which we’re wired to consume subconsciously, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555">leafy greens have to be consumed intentionally</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Make a list of your favorite leafy greens. For me, this includes Kindle, Feedly, tech periodicals and my favorite curation platforms: HackerNews and Product Hunt. Calm, one of several booming mindfulness apps, also makes the list. These are the only apps on my home screen, which encourages me to use them more often. Like a food diet, I set attainable goals for “good” consumption and monitor my progress.</p>
<p>I recommend fasting on technology periodically; I leave my phone at home for walks with my son and dinner with friends. I also recommend nontech activities that promote upstairs brain rewiring like an outdoor hike or learning to play an instrument.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Redesign consumption patterns for productivity tools</strong></h3>
<p>Email is required for most people. It has the potential to make us productive. But the average message quality is low, and the always-on, high frequency, push-by-default design <a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/context-switching/">prevents us from doing our best work</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>I’ve turned off notifications on everything that’s not meant for urgent or timely messages (e.g., texts, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lyft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lyft">Lyft, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Tovala oven). <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boomerang-for-gmail/mdanidgdpmkimeiiojknlnekblgmpdll?hl=en">Boomerang’s Chrome Extension</a><sup> </sup>can be set up to deliver all of your emails every hour on the hour. Batch processing email every hour dramatically reduces the volume of interruption without impacting my responsiveness.</p>
<p>We live in relative abundance, with food, goods and security that would make even our recent ancestors envious. But abundance doesn’t make us happy; <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/the-sad-state-of-happiness-in-the-united-states-and-the-role-of-digital-media/">we’re the least happy on record</a>. We seem to be living in a collective state of <em>downstairs brain</em>, a continuous adult temper tantrum focused on strong feelings, emotion and impulsiveness.</p>
<p>But there’s hope.</p>
<p>As individuals, I found that even a few months of technology dieting helped me become less impulsive and more mindful. As employees, we can stop working for companies that profit from the attention economy. As managers, we can insist that our teams turn off their devices at night, turn off their Slack notifications and take real vacations. As parents, we can help our children develop healthy consumption patterns.</p>
<p>Collective action — and rewiring of our brains — could change the course of our politics and our ability to collaborate and solve the most important challenges of the 21st century.</p>
<p>American innovation dominates the attention economy. It’s time for American innovation to dominate the way we use technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of industry heavyweights, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Box, Citrix, Dell, Imprivata, Intel, Okta, RingCentral, Slack, VMware and Zoom, today announced the launch of the <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/moderncomputing/">Modern Computing Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>The mission for this new alliance is to &#8220;drive ‘silicon-to-cloud’ innovation for the benefit of enterprise customers &#8212; fueling a differentiated modern computing platform and providing additional choice for integrated business solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Whoever wrote this mission statement was clearly trying to see how many words they could use without actually saying something.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here is what the alliance is really about: Even though the word <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/chrome-37d2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="chrome-37d2">Chrome <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> never appears on its homepage and Google&#8217;s partners never quite get to mentioning it either, it&#8217;s all about helping enterprises adopt Chrome and Chrome OS. &#8220;The focus of the alliance is to drive innovation and interoperability in the Google Chrome ecosystem, increasing options for enterprise customers and helping to address some of the biggest tech challenges facing companies today,&#8221; a Google spokesperson told me.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bh-QHw71ptg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure why it&#8217;s not called the Chrome Enterprise Alliance, but Modern Computing Alliance may just have more of a ring to it. This also explains why <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> isn&#8217;t part of it, though this is only the initial slate of members and others may follow at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Led by Google, the alliance&#8217;s focus is on bringing modern web apps to the enterprise sector, with a focus on performance, security, identity management and productivity. And all of that, of course, is meant to run well on Chrome and Chrome OS and be interoperable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The technology industry is moving toward an open, heterogeneous ecosystem that allows freedom of choice while integrating across the stack. This reality presents both a challenge and an opportunity,&#8221; Google&#8217;s Chrome OS VP John Solomon writes today.</p>
<p>As enterprises move to the cloud, building better web applications and maybe even progressive web applications that work just as well as native solutions is obviously a noble goal and it&#8217;s nice to see these companies work together. Given the pandemic, all of this has taken on a new urgency now, too. The plan is for the alliance to release products &#8212; though it&#8217;s unclear what form these will take &#8212; in the first half of 2021. Hopefully, these will play nicely with any browser. A lot of these &#8220;alliances&#8221; fizzle out quite quickly, so we&#8217;ll keep an eye on what happens here.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: The industry has a long history of alliances like these. Here&#8217;s a fun 1991 story about a CPU alliance between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/08/business/new-computer-alliance-forms.html">Intel, IBM, MIPS and others</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spotify">Spotify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said it has reset an undisclosed number of user passwords after blaming a software vulnerability in its systems for exposing private account information to its business partners.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20422370-spotify-breach-notice-letter-californiadocx">a data breach notification</a> filed with the California attorney general&#8217;s office, the music streaming giant said the data exposed &#8220;may have included email address, your preferred display name, password, gender, and date of birth only to certain business partners of Spotify.&#8221; The company did not name the business partners, but added that Spotify &#8220;did not make this information publicly accessible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify said the vulnerability existed as far back as April 9 but wasn&#8217;t discovered until November 12. But like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/decoding-data-breach-notice/">most data breach notices</a>, Spotify did not say what the vulnerability was or how user account data became exposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have conducted an internal investigation and have contacted all of our business partners that may have had access to your account information to ensure that any personal information that may have been inadvertently disclosed to them has been deleted,&#8221; the letter read.</p>
<p>Spotify spokesperson Adam Grossberg confirmed that a &#8220;small subset&#8221; of Spotify users are affected, but did not provide a specific figure. Spotify has more than 320 million users, and 144 million subscribers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the second time in as many months that the company has reset user passwords.</p>
<p>Last month security researchers found an unsecured database, <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/reports/2020/11/spotify-resets-some-user-logins-after-hacker-database-found-floating-online/">likely operated by hackers</a>, allegedly containing around 300,000 stolen user passwords. The database was probably used to launch credential stuffing attacks, in which lists of stolen passwords are matched against different websites that use the same password.</p>
<p>Although in that case the exposed data did not come from Spotify, the company reset the passwords on affected user accounts.</p>

<p>Twitter users who are also logged into the Snapchat app on their phone will be able to access the functionality by tapping share on a particular tweet and navigating to the Snapchat icon where they&#8217;ll be able to share and react or comment on a Twitter post and send it to a friend or share on their story. The functionality will notably only work for tweets from public accounts, not protected ones.</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out on iOS for now, with Android integration &#8220;coming soon.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Given how much content across Snapchat, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Facebook and Reddit originates from Twitter, it&#8217;s surprising that this functionality is arriving so deep into Twitter&#8217;s life as a company. They&#8217;ve long had a web embed integration which has allowed reporters to embed tweets into stories, but when it came to sharing on social media, Twitter&#8217;s strategy has deferred to the un-trackable and un-monetizable screenshot.</p>
<p>This has been low-hanging product rollout for Twitter, which will likely be able to coax some non-Twitter users to enjoy content straight from the source, something the company has been vaguely alluding to in marketing campaigns over the years but is just now approaching with a direct integration into another company&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>With Twitter now starting to roll out its Stories product Fleets to users, the company likely feels as though they have more feature familiarity to bring new users onboard from Snap who might not have experimented with the platform previously.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter rolls out Stories, aka &#8216;Fleets,&#8217; to all users; will also test a Clubhouse rival&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/embed/#?secret=wPoYjxTdVn" data-secret="wPoYjxTdVn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The truth is there aren&#8217;t a ton of integrations across social media channels; screen recordings and screen shots tell one platform&#8217;s story in an imperfect way on another&#8217;s. This integration comes as a result of updates made to Snap&#8217;s Snap Kit API and a particular feature called Creative Kit. Snap says that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spotify">Spotify, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Reddit, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/soundcloud" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="soundcloud">SoundCloud, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Sendit, YOLO and GOAT have also created integrations that allow content from those apps to be shared across Snapchat.</p>
<p>Twitter didn&#8217;t rule out the expansion of this feature to other platforms in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;This agreement with Snap was focused on this feature,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We would love to partner with other platforms to enable people to share Tweets more widely. We hope this will be the first of many integrations of its kind.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/donotpay" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="donotpay">DoNotPay, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the consumer advice company that started out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/donotpay-launches-1000-new-bots-to-help-you-with-your-legal-problems/">helping people easily challenge parking tickets</a>, has come a long way since it launched. It&#8217;s expanded to help consumers cancel memberships, claim compensation for missed flights and even sue companies for small claims. In the early days of the pandemic, the startup helped its users file for unemployment, where many state benefit sites crashed.</p>
<p>Now the so-called &#8220;robot lawyer&#8221; has a new trick. The startup now lets you request information from U.S. federal and state government agencies under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>FOIA allows anyone to request information from the government, with some exceptions. But ask anyone with experience in filing FOIAs (hello!) and they can tell you that requesting data requires skill and practice to avoid having the request thrown out for being too broad, or not being specific enough. And when you do eventually get something back, it might <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/15/green-card-immigration/">not be what you expect</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where DoNotPay wants to help. The new feature guides you through how to file a request for information, as well as wrangle the fee waivers and option to expedite processing — which is up to you to convince the government department why you should get the information for free and faster than regular FOIA requests. (In reality, the FOIA system is massively under-resourced, and responses can take months or years to get back.) After asking you a series of questions and what you want to request, DoNotPay generates a formal FOIA request letter using your answers and files it to the government agency on your behalf.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085543" style="width: 927px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085543" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2085543 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Do Not Pay's website." width="917" height="493" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg 917w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg?resize=768,413 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg?resize=680,366 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085543" class="wp-caption-text">Do Not Pay&#8217;s website. (Screenshot: TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>DoNotPay&#8217;s founder and chief executive Joshua Browder said he&#8217;s hoping the new feature can help consumers &#8220;beat bureaucracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hundreds of users have requested a FOIA product, because the government makes it deliberately difficult and bureaucratic to exercise these rights,&#8221; Browder told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Browder said that DoNotPay &#8220;would not exist&#8221; without FOIA laws. &#8220;When we got started appealing parking tickets, we used previous requests to see the top reasons why parking tickets were dismissed,&#8221; he said. Browder said he&#8217;s hoping the feature will help consumers uncover more injustices — just like with parking tickets — to feed his product with more features. &#8220;The overall strategy is to use any interesting FOIA data to build great new DoNotPay products,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>DoNotPay raised $12 million in its Series A earlier this year, led by investment firm Coatue Management, with participation from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Founders Fund and and Felicis Ventures. The startup has 10 employees, including Browder, and is valued at about $80 million, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>The FOIA filing feature is free for academics and journalists, and is included as part of the company&#8217;s subscription service of $3 per month for everyone else.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In North America, shoppers are increasingly turning to online orders to buy their products.</p>
<p>National postal services have seen a significant uptick in parcel volumes; so many that the <a href="https://www.canadapost.ca/web/en/kb/details.page?article=coronavirus_faq&amp;cat=generalinquiries&amp;cattype=kb&amp;subcat=generalinformation">number matches those sent during the Christmas surge</a> — minus the wrapping paper. But although the pandemic has acted as a catalyst for online shopping, it’s part of a continuing trend.</p>
<p>The online sector has slowly been eating up the percentage of sales from retail stores. Virtual shopping’s total share of the global market <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/534123/e-commerce-share-of-retail-sales-worldwide/">has doubled between 2015 and 2019</a>, with the U.S. Department of Commerce reporting that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/02/online-shopping-officially-overtakes-brick-and-mortar-retail-for-the-first-time-ever.html">online retail sales overtook general merchandise stores</a> in the country for the first time in February 2019.</p>
<p>As customers have turned to their web browsers, shop vacancies are on the rise around the world, with big brands <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4e5e1022-8df3-11e9-a1c1-51bf8f989972">deserting even New York’s Fifth Avenue</a>.</p>

		<blockquote>
			&#8220;Within the next five years, I think we&#8217;re going to see that having AR and 3D on your dot-com and beyond will be mandatory.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The high street has been forced into a period of transformation. Now, forward-thinking companies are finding ways to adapt.</p>
<h2>New realities in retail</h2>
<p>In 2019, Charles Bergh, the CEO of Levi’s, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/emerging-technologies/augmented-shopping-3d-technology-retail.html">proclaimed</a> that stock sizes for clothes would be gone within a decade. Body scanning and made-to-order items would replace the letters and numbers found on the labels of clothes, and products would no longer be found by scrolling through images or browsing shop floors. Instead, customers would select their products — a pair of shoes, a new coffee table, a snapback hat — and customize it to their own specifications. These clothes or items would be tried on or placed within a virtual scan of their room, all without leaving the couch.</p>
<p>Using 3D modeling and augmented reality (AR) — a technology that places computer-generated images onto the real world — Bergh’s vision is already possible.</p>
<p>One of the first sectors to take advantage of the nascent technology was the furniture industry. Leading retailers like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wayfair" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wayfair">Wayfair <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and IKEA invested early into 3D and AR, allowing customers to physically visualize their products inside their spaces. For Shrenik Sadalgi, the director of Research and Development at Wayfair Next — the arm of the furniture giant that uses technology to make shopping more seamless — adding the two technologies to its sales arsenal was an obvious choice for the company.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wayfair" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wayfair">Wayfair’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> customers can take advantage of two AR experiences. The first, View in Room 3D, lets users place an accurately sized piece of furniture into their room, twist and move it in the space, and even walk around it in real time. Room Planner 3D goes further, allowing customers to visualize the piece of furniture in their home even when they’re on the go.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re letting customers capture the space first,” Sadalgi says of Room Planner 3D. “So you take a photo, and that photo is a very piece of rich information about your room. At a later point in time — maybe you&#8217;re on the subway, or maybe you&#8217;re at a friend&#8217;s house or whatever — you can pull up your room, and then you can add furniture as if you were there. So you don&#8217;t have to actually be in the space to plan your space.”</p>
<p>It’s not just homeware companies that have embraced the digital option. Augmented reality has found a natural fit in the beauty industry, and like major furniture retailers, bigger brands have been using the tech for several years. The experiences they offer continue to be refined as the technology improves. Leading players like L’Oréal, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sephora" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sephora">Sephora, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Procter &amp; Gamble, and more have been honing their version of the AR over time, offering customers a more interactive shopping experience.</p>
<p>For Lynda Pak, senior vice president at beauty powerhouse Estée Lauder, AR lets shoppers gain a familiarity with many of the products within its portfolio of 29 brands.</p>
<p>“AR is becoming a way for a consumer to be able to engage with a beauty advisor or makeup artist,” she says. “It may be tied in with, let&#8217;s say, a digital consultation. But if the consumer wants no live consultation whatsoever, [they] can just try the various shades on their own as well.</p>
<p>“The AR experiences that we have right now are really around virtual try-on for makeup,” she continues. “That encompasses eye, it encompasses foundation, it encompasses lip, and we also have skin diagnostic capabilities. The calibration that we&#8217;ve done is able to note if you&#8217;ve got some dry patches or red flares, or if you&#8217;re looking a little tired — it will highlight some of those skin concerns. When we go into haircare, we&#8217;re able to view the scalp and the condition of the hair close to the scalp, as well as further down to the ends. You&#8217;re able to see what you look like as a blonde, of what you may look like with an ombre. It&#8217;s a great way to get a sense of what the shade will look like.”</p>
<p>In both of these industries, as well as a number of others that rely on customization or fit, consumers are beginning to shop differently. Companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> have invested heavily in online transactions, encouraging more purchases in the digital realm.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> now boasts its Shopping and Checkout options to allow businesses to advertise and complete transactions through the app, offering an alternative to website- or brand app-based shopping platforms — all with a potential customer base of over a billion. As buyers continue to explore new ways to make their shopping decisions, brands are increasingly focusing on how they present their products digitally.</p>
<h2>Making the digital feel physical</h2>
<p>Changes in retail have always been tied to developments in technology. The advent of the postal service inspired mail-order catalogs. Televisions created shopping channels. The internet ushered in the possibility of online shopping, and mobile phones — with their cameras — have been the launchpad for AR and 3D. Each leap creates more opportunity for shoppers to see the product how it really is — as if it was already on their body or in their homes.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Given how reliant many people have become on rideshare drivers and especially delivery workers during the pandemic, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is pushing for them to get priority access to the COVID-19 vaccine. Today, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi sent a letter to all 50 governors asking them to prioritize giving drivers and delivery workers the vaccine as essential workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last nine months, these workers have been a lifeline to their communities,&#8221; Khosrowshahi wrote in the letter. &#8220;They have transported healthcare workers to hospitals, delivered food to people socially distancing at home, and helped local restaurants stay in business.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the letter, Khosrowshahi argues that the work of drivers and delivery people has become essential. That&#8217;s why Uber wants them to get the vaccine &#8220;quickly, easily and for free,&#8221; he wrote in the letter. Additionally, Uber has offered to help share information about the vaccine and encourage those who are eligible to get vaccinated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;After nine months on the frontlines keeping their communities running, we are asking governors in all 50 states to prioritize drivers and delivery people for early vaccine access,&#8221; Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;Uber stands ready to do everything we can—leveraging our technology, our logistical expertise and our resources—to help protect the people working on our platform and bring vaccines to the public as quickly and efficiently as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi&#8217;s letter to governors is an addition to the one <a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/comment/CDC-2020-0121-0238">Uber sent</a> to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that advocated for the inclusion of non-health essential workers in the priority phase of distribution for the vaccine.</p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s advocating on behalf of workers comes amid an ongoing battle around how to classify rideshare drivers and delivery workers. Uber has long argued that its workers are not employees, while many gig workers have argued they are misclassified as independent contractors and should be entitled to the many labor rights that come with the employee classification.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/accurate-timely-information-covid-19-vaccines/">announced</a> today it&#8217;s introducing a new search feature that will surface a list of authorized vaccines in users&#8217; locations, as well as informational panels about each individual vaccine. The feature is first being launched in the U.K., which earlier this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/the-uk-approves-the-biontech-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-for-emergency-use/">gave emergency authorization</a> to the BioNTech/Pfizer coronavirus vaccine. The company says the feature will roll out to other countries as their local health authorities authorize vaccines.</p>
<p>The feature itself will appear at the top of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.com searches for COVID-19 vaccines and will present the authoritative information in a box above the search results, linking to the health authority as the source. The panel will also have two tabs. One will be the overview of the vaccine, which appears above Top Stories and links to Local and National resources, like government websites. The other will organize news related to the vaccine under a separate section.</p>

<p>Google positioned the new search panels as one way it&#8217;s helping to address vaccine misinformation and hesitance at scale.</p>
<p>However, another arm of the company, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="youtube">YouTube, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> allowed COVID-19 misinformation and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/plandemic-video-judy-mikovits/">conspiracies</a> to spread during the pandemic. While YouTube in April <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52388586">banned &#8220;medically unsubstantiated&#8221; content</a> after earlier <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52198946">banning conspiracies</a> that linked COVID-19 to 5G networks, it didn&#8217;t <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/14/youtube-bans-misinformation-about-covid-vaccinations">ban misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines until October</a>. In other words, it didn&#8217;t proactively create a policy to ban all aspects of COVID-19 misinformation, but waited to address the spread of COVID-19 antivax content until vaccine approvals appeared imminent. This meant that any clips <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-14/youtube-to-pull-clips-questioning-authorities-on-covid-vaccines">making false claims</a> &#8212; like saying vaccines would kill their recipients, cause infertility or implant microchips &#8212; were not officially covered by YouTube&#8217;s policies until October.</p>

<p>And even after the ban, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="youtube">YouTube&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> moderation policies <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/antivaccine-videos-slip-through-youtube-s-advertising-policies-new-study-finds">were found to miss many</a> anti-vaccination videos, studies found.</p>
<p>This is not a new challenge for the video platform. YouTube has struggled to address antivax content for years, even <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-removes-ads-from-anti-vaccination-video-channels/">allowing videos with prohibited antivax content to be monetized</a>, at times.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085578" style="width: 422px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085578" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2085578" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.36-AM.jpg?w=412" alt="" width="412" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.36-AM.jpg 758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.36-AM.jpg?resize=91,150 91w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.36-AM.jpg?resize=182,300 182w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.36-AM.jpg?resize=412,680 412w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.36-AM.jpg?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085578" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Today, Google downplayed YouTube&#8217;s issues in its fight against misinformation, saying that its COVID-19 information panels on YouTube which offer authoritative information have been viewed over 400 billion times.</p>
<p>However, this figure provides provides at look into the scale at which YouTube creators are publishing videos about the pandemic, often with just their opinions.</p>
<p>Google said, to date, it has removed more than 700,000 videos related to dangerous or misleading COVID-19 health information. If the platform was regulated, however, it would not be entirely up to Google to decide when a video with dangerous information should be removed, what constitutes misinformation or what the penalty against the creator should be.</p>
<p>The company also noted that it&#8217;s now helping YouTube creators by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbpi6ZahtOH71a6AQn1p3XGQ2CQSlfPIU">connecting</a> them with health experts to make engaging and accurate content for their viewers, and <a href="https://www.google.com/grants/">donated</a> $250 million in Ad Grants to help over 100 government agencies run PSAs about COVID-19 on the video platform. In April, Google <a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/covid-19-65-million-help-fight-coronavirus-misinformation/">donated</a> $6.5 million to support COVID-19 related fact-checking initiatives, as well, and is now donating $1.5 million more to fund the creation of a <a href="https://health-desk.org/vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://health-desk.org/vaccines/&quot;}">COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As remote work continues to solidify its place as a critical aspect of how businesses exist these days, a startup that has built a platform to help companies source and bring on one specific category of remote employees &#8212; engineers &#8212; is taking on some more funding to meet demand.</p>
<p><a href="https://turing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing</a> &#8212; which has built an AI-based platform to help evaluate prospective, but far-flung, engineers, bring them together into remote teams, then manage them for the company &#8212; has picked up $32 million in a Series B round of funding led by WestBridge Capital. Its plan is as ambitious as the world it is addressing is wide: an AI platform to help define the future of how companies source IT talent to grow.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have a ton of experience in investing in global IT services, companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cognizant-technology-solutions" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cognizant-technology-solutions">Cognizant <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/globallogic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="globallogic">GlobalLogic,&#8221; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said co-founder and CEO Jonathan Siddharth of its lead investor in an interview the other day. &#8220;We see <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/turing-inc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="turing-inc">Turing <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as the next iteration of that model. Once software ate the IT services industry, what would Accenture look like?&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It currently has a database of some 180,000 engineers covering around 100 or so engineering skills, including React, Node, Python, Agular, Swift, Android, Java, Rails, Golang, PHP, Vue, DevOps, machine learning, data engineering and more.</p>
<p>In addition to WestBridge, other investors in this round included Foundation Capital, Altair Capital, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mindset-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mindset-ventures">Mindset Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/frontier-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="frontier-ventures">Frontier Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Gaingels. There is also a very long list of high-profile angels participating, underscoring the network that the founders themselves have amassed. It includes unnamed executives from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Microsoft, Snap and other companies, as well as Adam D’Angelo (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> first CTO and CEO at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/quora" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="quora">Quora), <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/gokul-rajaram" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="gokul-rajaram">Gokul Rajaram, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Cyan Banister and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/scott-banister" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="scott-banister">Scott Banister, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Beerud Sheth (the founder of Upwork), among many others (I&#8217;ll run the full list below).</p>
<p>Turing is not disclosing its valuation. But as a measure of its momentum, it was only in August that the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/turing-raises-14m-to-help-source-vet-place-and-manage-remote-developers-in-tech-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised a seed round of $14 million</a>, led by Foundation. Siddharth said that the growth has been strong enough in the interim that the valuations it was getting and the level of interest compelled the company to skip a Series A altogether and go straight for its Series B.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qxl8gYGeNx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/turing-raises-14m-to-help-source-vet-place-and-manage-remote-developers-in-tech-jobs/">Turing raises $14M to help source, vet, place and manage remote developers in tech jobs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Turing raises $14M to help source, vet, place and manage remote developers in tech jobs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/turing-raises-14m-to-help-source-vet-place-and-manage-remote-developers-in-tech-jobs/embed/#?secret=qxl8gYGeNx" data-secret="qxl8gYGeNx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company now has signed up to its platform 180,000 developers from across 10,000 cities (compared to 150,000 developers back in August). Some 50,000 of them have gone through automated vetting on the Turing platform, and the task will now be to bring on more companies to tap into that trove of talent.</p>
<p>Or, &#8220;We are demand-constrained,&#8221; which is how Siddharth describes it. At the same time, it&#8217;s been growing revenues and growing its customer base, jumping from revenues of $9.5 million in October to $12 million in November, increasing 17x since first becoming generally available 14 months ago. Current customers include VillageMD, Plume, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lambda-school" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lambda-school">Lambda School, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Ohi Tech, Proxy and Carta Healthcare.</p>
<h2>Remote work = immediate opportunity</h2>
<p>A lot of people talk about remote work today in the context of people no longer able to go into their offices as part of the effort to curtail the spread of COVID-19. But in reality, another form of it has been in existence for decades.</p>
<p>Offshoring and outsourcing by way of help from third parties &#8212; such as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/accenture" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="accenture">Accenture <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and other systems integrators &#8212; are two ways that companies have been scaling and operating, paying sums to those third parties to run certain functions or build out specific areas instead of shouldering the operating costs of employing, upsizing and sometimes downsizing that labor force itself.</p>
<p>Turing is essentially tapping into both concepts. On one hand, it has built a new way to source and run teams of people, specifically engineers, on behalf of others. On the other, it&#8217;s using the opportunity that has presented itself in the last year to open up the minds of engineering managers and others to consider the idea of bringing on people they might have previously insisted work in their offices, to now work for them remotely, and still be effective.</p>
<p>Siddarth and co-founder Vijay Krishnan (who is the CTO) know the other side of the coin all too well. They are both from India, and both relocated to the Valley first for school (post-graduate degrees at Stanford) and then work at a time when moving to the Valley was effectively the only option for ambitious people like them to get employed by large, global tech companies, or build startups &#8212; effectively what could become large, global tech companies.</p>
<p>“Talent is universal, but opportunities are not,” Siddarth said to me earlier this year when describing the state of the situation.</p>
<p>A previous startup co-founded by the pair &#8212; content discovery app Rover &#8212; highlighted to them a gap in the market. They built the startup around a remote and distributed team of engineers, which helped them keep costs down while still recruiting top talent. Meanwhile, rivals were building teams in the Valley. “All our competitors in Palo Alto and the wider area were burning through tons of cash, and it’s only worse now. Salaries have skyrocketed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>After Rover was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/23/revcontent-acquires-rover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired by Revcontent</a>, a recommendation platform that competes against the likes of Taboola and Outbrain, they decided to turn their attention to seeing if they could build a startup based on how they had, basically, built their own previous startup.</p>
<p>There are a number of companies that have been tapping into the different aspects of the remote work opportunity, as it pertains to sourcing talent and how to manage it.</p>
<p>They include the likes of <a href="http://remote.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote</a> (raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/remote-raises-35m-to-help-orgs-with-global-workforce-payroll-benefits-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$35 million in November</a>), <a href="http://letsdeel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deel</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/deel-nabs-30m-more-for-payroll-compliance-and-other-tools-to-run-global-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$30 million raised in September</a>), <a href="http://papayaglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Papaya Global</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/papaya-global-raises-40m-for-a-payroll-and-hr-platform-aimed-at-global-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$40 million also in September</a>), <a href="http://lattice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lattice</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/lattice-a-people-management-platform-picks-up-45m-at-a-400m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$45 million in July</a>) and <a href="http://factorialhr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Factorial</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/factorial-raises-16m-to-take-on-the-hr-world-with-a-platform-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$16 million in April</a>), among others.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about Turing is how it&#8217;s trying to address and provide services for the different stages you go through when finding new talent. It starts with an AI platform to source and vet candidates. That then moves into matching people with opportunities, and onboarding those engineers. Then, Turing helps manage their work and productivity in a secure fashion, and also provides guidance on the best way to manage that worker in the most compliant way, be it as a contractor or potentially as a full-time remote employee.</p>
<p>The company is not freemium, as such, but gives people two weeks to trial people before committing to a project. So unlike an Accenture, Turing itself tries to build in some elasticity into its own product, not unlike the kind of elasticity that it promises its customers.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It all sounds like a great idea now, but interestingly, it was only after remote work really became the norm around March/April of this year that the idea really started to pick up traction.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing what COVID has done. It&#8217;s led to a huge boom for Turing,&#8221; said Sumir Chadha, managing director for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/westbridge-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="westbridge-capital">WestBridge Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in an interview. For those who are building out tech teams, he added, there is now &#8220;No need for to find engineers and match them with customers. All of that is done in the cloud.&#8221;</p>

<p>“Turing has a very interesting business model, which today is especially relevant,” said Igor Ryabenkiy, managing partner at Altair Capital, in a statement. “Access to the best talent worldwide and keeping it well-managed and cost-effective make the offering attractive for many corporations.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AT&amp;T <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2020/att_sony_pictures_entertainment_inc_crunchyroll.html">announced yesterday</a> that it&#8217;s selling anime streaming service <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com">Crunchyroll</a> to Sony&#8217;s Funimation for an acquisition price of $1.18 billion.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/crunchyroll" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="crunchyroll">Crunchyroll <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has 90 million registered users and 3 million paying subscribers. The service started in 2006 as a site for fan-uploaded, fan-subtitled (and often pirated) content, but it has increasingly become a home for officially licensed anime, along with games, manga and merchandise.</p>
<p>However, corporate parent AT&amp;T/<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/warnermedia" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="warnermedia">WarnerMedia&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> streaming strategy now seems to be focused solely on its new HBO Max service. It&#8217;s shut down standalone streaming offerings <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/r-i-p-filmstruck/">like FilmStruck</a> while <a href="https://ew.com/tv/dc-universe-infinite-titans-hbo-max/">shifting DC Universe</a> from streaming to digital comics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a result, Funimation is likely to be a better fit. It also specializes in anime distribution, with <a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2017/07_17/073117_funimation.html">Sony acquiring a majority stake in 2017</a>. The company is currently operated as a joint venture between <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sony" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sony">Sony <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Pictures Entertainment and Animplex, a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud to bring Crunchyroll into the Sony family,” said Sony Picture Chairman and CEO Tony Vinciquerra in a statement. “Through Funimation and our terrific partners at Aniplex and Sony Music Entertainment Japan, we have a deep understanding of this global artform and are well-positioned to deliver outstanding content to audiences around the world. Together with Crunchyroll, we will create the best possible experience for fans and greater opportunity for creators, producers and publishers in Japan and elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement also includes a statement from WarnerMedia Chief Revenue Officer Tony Goncalves, who said he&#8217;s &#8220;incredibly proud of the Crunchyroll team and what they have been able to accomplish in the digital media space in such a short period of time.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Expect to keep hearing about insurtech for quarters and quarters to come.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nextinsurance.com/">Next Insurance</a>, a startup that competes in the small business (SMB) insurance market, announced this morning that it has acquired its first company.</p>
<p>Purchasing <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/juniper-labs">Juniper Labs</a> will help the unicorn boost its in-house data science team, and the smaller firm&#8217;s predictive analytics technology may be applied across the acquiring company&#8217;s portfolio of insurance products.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/next-insurance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="next-insurance">Next Insurance <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/next-insurance-lands-250m-series-d/">raised $250 million earlier this year at a valuation of $2 billion</a>, making it one of the richest startups to compete in the broad insurtech niche.</p>
<p>After speaking with Next about its acquisition and digging into its economics and recent growth, The Exchange also examined <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/getsafe-b/">Getsafe&#8217;s recent round</a> (European digital insurance startup), took a look at <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201210005182/en/NOW-Insurance-Closes-2.5-Million-Seed-Round-Enhances-AI-Enabled-Platform">NOW Insurance&#8217;s latest investment</a> (commercial insurance startup) and asked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/noyo-raises-12-5m-series-a-to-keep-building-its-health-insurance-api-business/">Noyo&#8217;s Shannon Goggin</a> to fill us in about the insurtech VC startup market itself, given that her health insurance API company just raised its Series A.</p>

<hr />
<p>The combined picture that appears is one of an active market, likely accelerated by the IPOs of insurtech unicorns Lemonade and Root, Hippo&#8217;s latest megaround and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/metromile" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="metromile">Metromile&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> impending public debut via a blank-check company.</p>

How investors will weigh their new economic profiles is not yet clear.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dig into Next Insurance and then collate a few other recent data points to expand our understanding of one of startup land&#8217;s most interesting genres.</p>
<h2>Next Insurance and friends</h2>
<p>Next Insurance announced its Series D in September of this year, adding $250 million to its accounts at a valuation <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/next-insurance-lands-250m-series-d/">described by Crunchbase News</a> as more than $2 billion. What stood out about the round at the time was not that it was so very large, but that it was the second time in less than a year that the company had announced a $250 million round. Its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/next-insurance-series-c--e5446521">Series C was detailed in October of 2019</a> and was also worth a quarter billion dollars.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

Boeing is the second company selected by NASA to build and qualify a human space launch system for transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station, and it&#8217;s still working toward certifying its vehicle, while <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the other company selected, has already flown its first active service mission.</p>
<p>Boeing originally flew the first version of this mission last December. The company&#8217;s Starliner CST-100 crew spacecraft took off as planned aboard a ULA rocket, which performed its part of the mission perfectly. The capsule encountered an error with its onboard mission timer, however, and due to a momentary blackout in ground communications, it wasn&#8217;t able to be corrected in time to preserve enough fuel to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/boeings-starliner-crew-capsule-fails-to-enter-planned-target-orbit-for-space-station-docking/">keep Starliner on track to rendezvous with the Space Station</a>, which was among the primary goals of the demonstration flight.</p>

<p>Boeing managed to still conduct a successful re-entry, descent and recovery of the Starliner capsule &#8212; all good tests of other key mission goals. But the company and the agency eventually decided that the OFT test would need to be repeated before any final, crewed demonstration mission took place.</p>
<p>After a lengthy and thorough investigation, Boeing and NASA both implemented changes to their software development process and partnership to ensure that future errors like the one that affected the mission timer wouldn&#8217;t take place. The partners had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/boeing-and-nasa-target-december-for-second-try-at-uncrewed-orbital-demonstration-flight/">initially hoped to re-fly this mission sometime this month</a>, approximately a year after the first try, but the timelines have slipped since then and at last mention, the first quarter of next year was the earliest likely window.</p>

<p>NASA hopes to have Boeing&#8217;s spacecraft certified so that it can rely on not one, but two providers of commercial transportation services for astronauts to low-Earth orbit. That diversified provider mix should also help spur increased commercial activity in Earth&#8217;s orbit centred on human spaceflight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the pandemic has raged on, it has shone a spotlight on the importance of procurement, especially in certain sectors. <a href="https://www.fairmarkit.com/">Fairmarkit</a>, a Boston startup, is working to bring a modern digital procurement system to the enterprise. Today, the company announced a $30 million Series B.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ggv-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ggv-capital">GGV Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Insight Partners led the round with help from existing investors 1984 VC, NewStack and NewFund. Today&#8217;s investment brings the total raised to $42 million, according to the company.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fairmarkit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fairmarkit">Fairmarkit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wants to replace large procurement software systems from companies like Oracle and SAP that have been around for decades, says company co-founder and CEO Kevin Frechette. When he looked around a couple of years ago, he saw a space full of these legacy vendors and ripe for disruption.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s more, he says that these systems have been designed to track only the biggest purchases over $500,000 or $1 million. Anything under that is what&#8217;s known as tail spend. &#8220;So procurement really focuses on companies&#8217; biggest purchases, say things over a million, but anything under that size just gets forgotten about and neglected. It&#8217;s called tail spend, and it&#8217;s still 80% of what they buy, 80% of their vendors and 20% of the budget,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>This spending accounts for billions of dollars, yet Frechette says, it has lacked a good tracking system. He saw an opportunity, and he and his co-founders built a solution. Its first customer was the MBTA, Boston&#8217;s mass transit system (a system that could use all the help it can get in terms of getting more efficient). Today the company has more than 50 customers across a variety of industries.</p>
<p>The system acts as a marketplace for vendors and a central buying system for customers where they can find goods and services at this price point below $1 million. It imports a customer&#8217;s vendor data, and then combines this with other data to build a huge database of buying information. From that, they can determine what a customer needs and using AI, find the best prices for a particular order.</p>
<p>Frechette says this not only provides a way to save money &#8212; he says customers have been able to cut purchase costs by 10% with his system &#8212; it also provides a way to surface diverse vendors, whether that&#8217;s businesses owned by women, people of color, veterans, local business or however you define that.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lightyear scores $3.7M seed to digitize networking infrastructure procurement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/lightyear-scores-3-7m-seed-to-simplify-networking-infrastructure-procurement/embed/#?secret=c4UT5BNGkz" data-secret="c4UT5BNGkz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He says too often what happens is that these deals aren&#8217;t put under typical procurement department scrutiny and they just get passed through, but Fairmarkit helps surface these companies and give them a shot at the business. &#8220;So because the core of our technology is a vendor recommendation engine [&#8230;], we can help to invite those diverse vendors and really just give them a fair shot,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company started the year with 40 employees and have added 30 since. The plan is to double that number next year, and as they do, Frechette hopes to reflect the diversity of the company&#8217;s product by building a correspondingly diverse employee base.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really just keeping it at the forefront. We want to make sure that we&#8217;re not just doing surveys around how we are doing for diversity and inclusion, but we&#8217;re putting programs in place to help out with it. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m very very passionate about because it&#8217;s been such a sticking point as well on how we&#8217;re helping diverse vendors,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Frechette says that he has managed to grow the company and build a culture in spite of the pandemic not allowing employees to come into an office. He doesn&#8217;t see a world where the office will be a requirement in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve hit an inflection point this year where there&#8217;s no world where we need everyone to be in an office [&#8230;], which once again only helps to accelerate our business because we&#8217;re not constricted by everyone in this one small [geographical] sector. We can operate across the board [from anywhere],&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With Slack being acquired by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for $28 billion, the world of collaborative tools for teams is on fire right now. Notion is super hot and last year Frame.io raised $50 million and Microsoft has Fluid. Now, after some months in private beta, JetBrains &#8212; which also makes development environments (IDE) for various programming languages &#8212; has publicly launched <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/space/">Space</a>, an all-in-one collaboration platform for creative teams.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/06/move-over-slack-space-is-a-new-project-management-platform-for-developers/">beta</a> since last year, JetBrains says it had more than 35,000 requests from companies to join the beta.</p>
<p>Space combines general collaboration tools: chats, team and project management, meeting scheduling and documents with workflows for specific verticals. It covers the software development cycle and the startup will be adding domain-specific tools for other roles and departments in the future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maxim Shafirov, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/jetbrains" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="jetbrains">JetBrains <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO, said: “JetBrains started as a company of developers but now 40% of our team represent different creative roles: designers, marketing, copywriters and others. We’ve built Space so we could still work together as one team and we believe other companies will benefit from it as well.”</p>
<p>Space provides free tier and subscription options, starting at $8 per active user per month for wider team collaboration. Space is available in the cloud but also will have an on-premise version in the near future.</p>
<p>It includes chats, meetings, calendars, issues, mobile apps, launched documents, issue boards, automation CI/CD, personal to-do lists and added turn-based code reviews.</p>
<p>In the future, Space will have syncing with Google Calendar and Outlook, as well as integrations with other popular tools. In terms of extensibility, the team has introduced HTTP API, webhooks, Space Client SDK, custom fields and automations, and will be adding private and Marketplace applications soon, along with other extensibility features.</p>
