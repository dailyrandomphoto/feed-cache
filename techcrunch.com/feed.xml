										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subscribers of MTN, the largest telecom provider in Nigeria, may soon face service disruption in the West African nation, according to a notice seen by some journalists and outlets. </span></p>
<p>A rise in insecurity challenges in Nigeria is likely to disrupt MTN&#8217;s service, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/mtn-nigeria-comm-security/update-1-mtn-warns-of-service-disruption-in-nigeria-due-to-rising-insecurity-idUSL2N2NX0XR">Reuters</a> and others said, citing an alert from customer service reps. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout this year, Nigerians have had to battle kidnappings, clashes between farmers and herders, mass abductions of students, and armed robberies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we must inform you that with the rising insecurity in different parts of Nigeria, service delivery to your organization may </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">impacted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the coming days. This means that in some cases, our technical support team may not be able to get to your site and achieve </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">optimum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turnaround time in fault management as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as possible,” MTN <a href="https://twitter.com/MuvunyiF/status/1404781767802998787">reportedly</a> said in the message. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MTN didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When MTN Nigeria published its financial report for Q1 2021, it showed strong growth as data revenue grew by 43% year-on-year to N106 billion ($257 million), contributing to 28% of its total revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data revenue growth </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was propelled by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 21% year-on-year jump in active data subscribers to 32.5 million and a 27% year-on-year increase in smartphone penetration to 36.3 million. These numbers reflect MTN&#8217;s dominance in Nigeria. Per data from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the telecom operator </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is responsible for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 43% of Nigeria&#8217;s internet subscribers and 38% of the country&#8217;s mobile subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most network providers in the country, MTN&#8217;s services have been a tale of two experiences: good and subpar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nigerians who spoke with TechCrunch have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the latter these past few weeks following the government&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">decision to ban Twitter</a> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fears of internet restriction.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TAESmeojNH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">Nigeria suspends Twitter operations, says platform &#8216;undermines its corporate existence&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigeria suspends Twitter operations, says platform &#8216;undermines its corporate existence&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/embed/#?secret=TAESmeojNH" data-secret="TAESmeojNH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports from <a href="https://punchng.com/telecoms-services-face-disruption-as-workers-threaten-strike/">local media</a> seem to corroborate Reuters, albeit for a different reason: a union&#8217;s nationwide strike against all network providers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union PTECSSAN (Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria), which comprises senior telecommunications staff in the country, announced that it would be embarking on a three-day industrial strike starting Wednesday to protest the &#8220;arbitrary sack of workers and casualisation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PTECSSAN accused telecommunications companies in Nigeria for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reasons in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. First, breaching freedom of association and right of workers to organise; victimisation of union members; poor and discriminatory </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">remuneration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They also claimed that telecom operators abused expatriate quotas, practised intimidation, and have harassed and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">verbally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> assaulted employees, among other anti-labour practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several MTN customer care agents TechCrunch reached out to were either unaware or refuted the aforementioned message. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to have such network glitches,&#8221; one said. &#8220;Kindly be aware that we dont have any information on any service disruption in the coming days. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we have any information about that, we&#8217;ll let our customers know via messages as soon as possible,&#8221; another agent responded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As an early-stage VC, you spend time with hundreds of fantastic startups, trying to identify potential winners by thinking about market size, business model and competition. Nevertheless, deep down you know that in the long run, it all comes down to the team and the founder(s).</p>
<p>When we look at the most successful companies in our portfolio, their amazing performance is in large part thanks to the founders. However, even after 20 years in the industry, I have to admit that analyzing the team is still the most challenging part of the job. How do you evaluate a young first-time entrepreneur of an early-stage company with little traction?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The best founders are humble and well aware of their weaknesses and limitations as well as the potential challenges for their startup.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.creandum.com/">Creandum</a>, in the past 18 years, we have been fortunate to work with some of Europe’s most successful startup founders such as Daniel Ek from Spotify, Sebastian Siemiatkowski from Klarna, Johannes Schildt from Kry, Jacob de Geer and Magnus Nilsson from iZettle, Emil Eifrem from Neo4J, Christian Hecker from Trade Republic and many more.</p>
<p>After a while, we realized that these incredible entrepreneurs all share some fundamental characteristics. They all have lots of energy, work hard, show patience, perseverance and resilience. But on top of that, all these unicorn founders share five key traits that, as an investor, you should look for when you back them at an early stage.</p>
<h2>They know what they don’t know</h2>
<p>Many people expect a typical startup founder to be very confident and have a strong sales mentality. While they should definitely live up to those expectations, the best founders are also humble and well aware of their weaknesses and limitations as well as the potential challenges for their startup.</p>
<p>They keep wanting to learn, improve and grow the business beyond what average people have the energy and drive to manage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In April, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">announced</a> a slew of new audio products, including its Clubhouse clone, called Live Audio Rooms, which will be available across both Facebook and Messenger. Since May, Facebook has been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/facebook-begins-testing-clubhouse-rival-expanding-audio-suite">publicly testing</a> the audio rooms feature in Taiwan with public figures, but today the company hosted its first public test of Live Audio Rooms in the U.S. The event itself was hosted by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who chatted with fellow execs and creators.</p>
<p>Joining Zuckerberg were Facebook VP and Head of Facebook Reality Labs Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, Head of Facebook App Fidji Simo, and three Facebook Gaming creators, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=stonemountain64">StoneMountain64</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/QueenEliminator">QueenEliminator</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=thefiercediva">TheFierceDivaQueen</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166464" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166464" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2166464" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166464" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook screenshot</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The creators used their time in the Audio Room to talk more about their gaming journeys on Facebook, what kind of games they were streaming and other gaming-related matters. Zuckerberg also briefly teased new gaming features including a new type of post, coming soon, called &#8220;Looking for Players.&#8221; This post type will help creators find others in the community to play games with while they&#8217;re streaming.</p>
<p>In addition, badges that are earned from live streams will now carry over to fan groups, Zuckerberg said, adding that it was a highly requested feature by creators and fans alike.</p>
<p>Fan groups will also now become available to all partnered creators on Facebook Gaming, starting today, and will roll out to others in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166463" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166463" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2166463" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166463" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>The experience of using the Live Audio Room is very much like what you&#8217;d expect on another platform, like Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces. The event&#8217;s hosts appear in rounded profile icons at the top of the screen, while the listeners appear in the bottom half of the screen, as smaller icons. In between is a section that includes people followed by the speakers.</p>
<p>The active speaker is indicated with a glowing ring in shades of Facebook blue, purple and pink. If verified, a blue check appears next to their name.</p>
<p>Listeners can &#8220;Like&#8221; or otherwise react to the content as it streams live using the &#8220;Thumbs Up&#8221; button at the bottom of the screen. And they can choose to share the Audio Room either in a Facebook post, in a Group, with a friend directly, or through other apps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2166468" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png?w=644" alt="" width="644" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png 1269w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png?resize=142,150 142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png?resize=284,300 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png?resize=768,811 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png?resize=644,680 644w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /></p>
<p>A toggle switch under the room&#8217;s three-dot &#8220;more&#8221; menu lets you turn on or off auto-generated captions, for accessibility. From here, you can also report users or any issues or bugs you encountered.</p>
<p>The Live Audio Room today did not offer any option for raising your hand or joining the speakers on stage &#8212; it was more of a &#8220;few-to-many&#8221; broadcast experience.</p>
<p>Before today, TechCrunch received a couple of tips from users who reported seeing the Audio Rooms option appear for them in the Facebook app. However, the company told us it had only tested Live Audio Rooms in the U.S. with employees.</p>
<p>During the test period, Live Audio Rooms are only available on iOS and Android, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg also used today&#8217;s event to talk more broadly about Facebook&#8217;s plans for the creator economy going forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a good vision for the future is one where a lot more people get to do creative work and work that they enjoy, and fewer people have to do work that they just find a chore. And, in order to do that, a lot of what we need to do is basically build out a bunch of these different monetization tools,&#8221; explained Zuckerberg. &#8220;Not all creators are going to have the same business model. So having the ability to basically use a lot of different tools like Fiji [Simo] was talking about &#8212; for some people it might be, Stars or ad revenue share or subscriptions or selling things or different kinds of things like that &#8212; that will be important and part of making this all add up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted also that the tools Facebook is building go beyond gaming, saying that Facebook intends to support journalists, writers, and others &#8212; likely a reference to the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22518571/facebook-substack-bulletin-newsletter-launch">upcoming Substack clone, Bulletin</a>, expected to launch later this month.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg additionally spoke about how the company won&#8217;t immediately take a cut of the revenue generated from creators&#8217; content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having this period where we&#8217;re not taking a cut and more people can get into these kinds of roles, I think is going to be a good thing to do &#8212; especially given how hard hit a lot of parts of the economy have been with COVID and the pandemic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>More realistically, of course, Facebook&#8217;s decision to not take an immediate cut of some creator revenue is a decision it&#8217;s making in order to help attract more creators to its service, in the face of so much competition across the industry.</p>
<p>Clubhouse, for example, is currently wooing creators with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clubhouse-payments/">a payments feature,</a> where creators keep 100% of their revenue. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">it&#8217;s funding some creators&#8217; shows</a>. Twitter, meanwhile, is tying its audio product Spaces to its broader set of creator tools, which now include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/">newsletters</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">tips</a>, and soon, a subscription platform dubbed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">Super Follow</a>.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg didn&#8217;t say during today&#8217;s event when Live Audio Rooms would be available to the public, but said the experience would roll out to &#8220;a lot more people soon.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sunlight is a great source of energy, but it rarely gets hot enough to fry an egg, let alone melt steel. Heliogen aims to change that with its high-tech concentrated solar technique, and has raised more than a hundred million dollars to test its 1,000-degree solar furnace to a few game mines and refineries.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/heliogens-new-technology-could-unlock-renewable-energy-for-industrial-manufacturing/">We covered Heliogen when it first made its debut in 2019</a>, and the details in that article still get at the core of the company&#8217;s tech. Computer vision techniques are used to carefully control a large set of mirrors, which reflect and concentrate the sun&#8217;s light to the extent that it can reach in excess of 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, almost twice what previous solar concentrators could do. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a death ray,&#8221; founder Bill Gross explained then.</p>
<p>That lets the system replace fossil fuels and other legacy systems in many applications where such temperatures are required, for example mining and smelting operations. By using a Heliogen concentrator, they could run on sunlight during much of the day and only rely on other sources at night, potentially halving their fuel expenditure and consequently both saving money and stepping toward a greener future.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Heliogen&#8217;s new tech could unlock renewable energy for industrial manufacturing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/heliogens-new-technology-could-unlock-renewable-energy-for-industrial-manufacturing/embed/#?secret=HpjkO7g7V3" data-secret="HpjkO7g7V3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Both goals hint at why utilities and a major mining and steel-making company are now investors. Heliogen raised a $25M A-2, led by Prime Movers Lab, but soon also pulled together a much larger &#8220;bridge extension round&#8221; in their terminology of $83M that brought in the miner ArcelorMittal, Edison International, Ocgrow Ventures, A.T. Gekko, and more.</p>
<p>The money will be used both to continue development of the &#8220;Sunlight Refinery,&#8221; as Heliogen calls it, and deploy some actual on-site installations that would work in real production workflows at scale. &#8220;We are constantly making design and cost improvements to increase efficiency and decrease costs,&#8221; a representative of the company told me.</p>
<p>One of those pilot sites will be in Boron, CA, where Rio Tinto operates a borates mine and will include Heliogen&#8217;s tech as part of its usual on-site processes, according to an MOU signed in March. Another MOU with ArcelorMittal will &#8220;evaluate the potential of Heliogen&#8217;s products in several of ArcelorMittal&#8217;s steel plants.&#8221; Facilities are planned in the U.S., MENA, and Asia Pacific areas.</p>
<p>Beyond mining and smelting, the technique could be used to generate hydrogen in a zero-carbon way. That would be a big step towards building a working hydrogen infrastructure for next-generation fuel supply, since current methods make it difficult to do without relying on fossil fuels in the first place. And no doubt there are other industrial processes that could benefit from a free and zero-carbon source of high heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re being granted the resources to do more projects that address the most carbon-intensive human activities and work toward our goals of lowering the price and emissions of energy for everyone on the planet,&#8221; Gross said in a release announcing the round(s). &#8220;We thank all of our investors for enabling us to pursue our mission and offer the world technology that will allow it to achieve a post-carbon economy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Senate confirmed big tech critic and prominent antitrust scholar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/lina-khans-timely-tech-skepticism-makes-for-a-refreshingly-friendly-ftc-confirmation-hearing/">Lina Khan as FTC Commissioner Tuesday</a>, signaling a new era of scrutiny for the tech industry. Khan was confirmed in a 69-28 vote, with Republicans joining Democrats in a rare show of bipartisan support for Khan&#8217;s ideas on reining in tech&#8217;s most powerful companies.</p>
<p>An associate law professor at Columbia, Khan&#8217;s star rose with the <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">publication of a landmark paper</a> examining how the government&#8217;s outdated ways of identifying monopolies have failed to keep up with modern business realities, particularly in tech. In Khan&#8217;s view, that regulatory failure has allowed the biggest tech companies to consolidate unprecedented wealth and power, in turn making it even more difficult to regulate them.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m so grateful to the Senate for my confirmation. Congress created the FTC to safeguard fair competition and protect consumers, workers, and honest businesses from unfair &amp; deceptive practices. I look forward to upholding this mission with vigor and serving the American public.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Lina Khan (@linamkhan) <a href="https://twitter.com/linamkhan/status/1404841168182169602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote>

<p>President Biden <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/lina-khan-biden-ftc-antitrust/">nominated Khan back in March</a>, sending an early message that Biden would not extend the warm relationship big tech companies enjoyed with the White House under former President Obama.</p>
<p>Khan&#8217;s confirmation is a sign that the agency will be prioritizing tech antitrust concerns, a priority that will run parallel to Congressional efforts to bolster the FTC&#8217;s enforcement powers. The FTC famously imposed a $5 billion fine on Facebook for privacy violations in 2019, but the record-setting fine was only a glancing blow for a company already worth more than $500 billion.</p>
<p>Last week, Congress revealed a long-anticipated package of bipartisan bills that, if passed, would overhaul tech&#8217;s biggest businesses and redraw the industry&#8217;s rules for years to come.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">previous bill proposed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar</a> would set aside a pool of money that the FTC could use to create a new division for market and merger research, one step toward modernizing antitrust enforcement to keep up with relentless growth from tech&#8217;s most powerful giants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of 200 startup founders, investors, associations and government members are backing a manifesto and a set of recommendations in order to create the next wave of tech giants in Europe. Today, French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting an event in Paris with some of the members of this group called <a href="https://scaleupeurope.tech">Scale-Up Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Companies, investors and associations that signed the manifesto include Alan, Axel Springer, Bpifrance, Darktrace, Deutsche Startups, Doctolib, Eurazeo, Flixbus, France Digitale, Glovo, La French Tech, N26, OVHcloud, Shift Technology, Stripe, UiPath and Wise.</p>
<p>“To achieve all that, I&#8217;ll follow your ambition — 10 technology companies that are worth €100 billion or more by 2030,” Macron said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s an ambitious goal — that’s why Scale-Up Europe has laid out a roadmap and is issuing a <a href="https://sifted.eu/intelligence/reports/scale-up-europe">report</a>. While it is backed by both private actors and public institutions, it could be considered as a sort of lobbying effort for the European Commission and European governments.</p>
<p>There are a handful of key topics in those recommendations. And it starts with funding. In particular, the group thinks Europe is still lagging behind when it comes to late-stage investments. The biggest VC funds aren’t as big as the biggest VC funds in the U.S. or in China.</p>
<p>The French government has been working on a way to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">foster</a> late-stage funds and investments in public tech companies in France. “On funding, we’ve seen the success of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">Tibi initiative</a> at the French level. We think we should follow that model at the European level,” a source close to Macron told me.</p>
<p>It means that Europe should consider using public funding as a multiplier effect for VC funds. The <a href="https://www.eif.org">European Investment Fund</a> is already pouring a lot of money in VC funds. But Scale-Up Europe recommends associating private funds of funds, sharing risk and pooling public investment banks for increased collaboration.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="saFEnqZHny"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">Macron announces €5 billion late-stage investment pledge  from institutional investors</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Macron announces €5 billion late-stage investment pledge  from institutional investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/embed/#?secret=saFEnqZHny" data-secret="saFEnqZHny" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The second topic is foreign talent. Some countries already have a tech worker visa. The group thinks it should be standardized across the European Union with some level of portability for social rights.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, an open letter called <a href="https://www.notoptional.eu/en">&#8220;Not Optional&#8221;</a> also highlighted some discrepancies with stock option schemes. Today’s report states once again that some governments should adopt more favorable rules with stock options.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PJOxDe40uY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/30-european-startup-ceos-call-for-better-stock-option-policies/">30 European startup CEOs call for better stock option policies</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;30 European startup CEOs call for better stock option policies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/30-european-startup-ceos-call-for-better-stock-option-policies/embed/#?secret=PJOxDe40uY" data-secret="PJOxDe40uY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The third topic revolves around Deep Tech startups. According to the report, Europe isn’t doing enough to foster more Deep Tech startups and investors. Recommendations include standardizing patent transfer frameworks. Those schemes are important if you want to turn a research project into a company. It also says that the European Innovation Council could also take on a larger role in defining a Deep Tech roadmap.</p>
<p>Scale-Up Europe then highlights some recommendations to improve relationships between big corporations and startups. These are mostly tax breaks, R&amp;D tax benefits and other fiscal incentives. (I’m personally not convinced there will be more European tech giants if we incentivize acquisitions with tax breaks.)</p>
<p>Finally, the group of investors, founders and government members behind Scale-Up Europe think there should be a European tech mission that works a bit like <a href="https://lafrenchtech.com">La French Tech</a> in France. This tech mission could clear regulatory hurdles, promote startups and more.</p>
<p>Overall, those recommendations are mostly focused on making it easier to create — and grow — a startup in Europe. Investors as well as startup employees who hold stock options will be quite pleased to see that it’ll be easier to make money quickly. It’ll be interesting to see whether the European Commission reuses some of these recommendations.</p>
<p>To be fair, those are actionable recommendations. And yet, building a tech giant is a complicated task. Tech giants tend to control a large chunk of their tech stack, including in areas such as cloud hosting, payments, analytics, advertising and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Many European startups are currently built on APIs, frameworks and platforms that are built in the U.S. or in China. Scale-Up Europe misses the point on this front. Scaling European startups isn’t a gold rush. It’s a long process that requires continuous investments that start from the bottom of the tech stack and moves upward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nintendo defied expectations today with an E3-timed Direct showing off not the hoped-for new Switch hardware but a dozen or so new games — as well as a general release window for the much-anticipated next Zelda game. And to celebrate the original&#8217;s 35th anniversary, it will sell a new Game &amp; Watch featuring the first three games in the series.</p>
<p>Among other things, Nintendo showed off remasters or remakes of titles from the &#8220;Monkey Ball,&#8221; &#8220;Mario Party,&#8221; &#8220;Advance Wars, &#8220;Wario Ware&#8221; and other series, and announced new entries in the &#8220;Mario + Rabbids&#8221; and &#8220;Shin Megami Tensei&#8221; worlds. Other newly announced or teased games will be making it to Switch as well, like the new &#8220;Guardians of the Galaxy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps most surprising was the inclusion of a new side-scrolling Metroid game, the first in nearly 20 years — and in fact, it has been in and out of development for half that time. &#8220;Metroid Dread,&#8221; the fifth in the mainline series that began on the NES, will release October 8, and we&#8217;ll see if Nintendo has managed to keep pace in a genre it pioneered but others have refined.</p>

<p>Everyone was hoping for Zelda news, however, and Nintendo&#8230; only slightly disappointed us. As the announcers noted, it&#8217;s the 35th anniversary of the NES original, and the perfect time to announce something truly special, but they have &#8220;no campaigns or other Nintendo Switch games planned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, they offered an admittedly tempting Game &amp; Watch in the style of the one we saw released last year for the Mario series. I had lots of good things to say about that device, and the new one will no doubt be just as fun. The ability to pause the game and pick it up later (but not rewind or save states) should make for a fun, authentic playthrough of the first three games in the Zelda series: &#8220;The Legend of Zelda&#8221; and &#8220;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&#8221; for NES, and &#8220;Link&#8217;s Awakening&#8221; for Game Boy (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-remake-is-a-classic-well-worth-revisiting/">recently remade</a>).</p>

<p>The last item on the list was a new look at the follow-up to Breath of the Wild, which years after its debut still shines as one of the, if not the, best game on the Switch. Its sequel has a lot to live up to!</p>
<p>While the first trailer was all cinematic, this one showed gameplay and the overworld, including a new level of verticality that brings flying fortresses and castles in the air into play. It certainly looks impressive, but one wonders how much further the company can push its Switch hardware. After all, &#8220;Breath of the Wild&#8221; pushed the system to its limits at its debut, and even then it was not as powerful as its rivals from Microsoft and Sony — both now replaced by a new generation.</p>
<p>One hopes that Nintendo is simply being weird and has a trick up its sleeve, as it has many times before. The Switch was announced out of nowhere, and previous hardware updates have also dropped with little or no warning and seemingly arbitrary timing. What&#8217;s expected is an updated Switch that&#8217;s physically the same dimensions but considerably updated inside and using a larger, better display. Perfect backwards compatibility, like with the 3DS series of handhelds, also seems only logical. But Nintendo has always done its own thing and its fans wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Android shared information today about six features that will roll out this summer. Some of these are just quality of life upgrades, like starring text messages to easily find them later, or getting contextual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/googles-gboard-introduces-emoji-kitchen-a-tool-to-mash-up-emojis-to-use-as-stickers/">Emoji Kitchen</a> suggestions depending on what you&#8217;re typing. But other aspects of this update emphasize security, safety and accessibility.</p>
<p>Last summer, Google added a feature on Android that basically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/google-is-turning-android-phones-into-seismometers/">uses your phone as a seismometer</a> to create &#8220;the world&#8217;s largest earthquake detection network.&#8221; The system is free, and since testing in California, it&#8217;s also launched in New Zealand and Greece. Now, Google will introduce this feature in Turkey, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The company says that they&#8217;ll continue expanding the feature this year, prioritizing countries with the highest earthquake risk.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166404" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166404" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2166404 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.-Earthquake-Alerts.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166404" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google is also expanding on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/google-assistant-can-now-control-android-apps/">another feature released last year</a>, which made Google Assistant compatible with Android apps. In the initial update, apps were supported like Spotify, Snapchat, Twitter, Walmart, Discord, Etsy, MyFitnessPal, Mint, Nike Adapt, Nike Run Club, eBay, Kroger, Postmates and Wayfair. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_OAyYiya40&amp;">Today&#8217;s update</a> mentioned apps like eBay, Yahoo! Finance, Strava and Capital One. These features are comparable to Apple&#8217;s support of Siri with iOS apps, which includes the ability to open apps, perform tasks and record a custom command.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166408" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166408" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2166408 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5.-Voice-Access-Gaze-Detection.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166408" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>When it comes to accessibility, Google is ramping up its gaze detection feature, which is now in beta. Gaze detection allows people to ask Voice Access to only respond when they&#8217;re looking at their screen, allowing people to naturally move between talking with friends and using their phone. Now, Voice Access will also have enhanced password input &#8212; when it detects a password field, it will allow you to input letters, numbers and symbols by saying &#8220;capital P&#8221; or &#8220;dollar sign,&#8221; for example, making it easier for users to more quickly enter this sensitive information. In October, Google Assistant became available on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/google-assistant-comes-to-gaze-powered-accessible-devices/">gaze-powered accessible devices</a>, and in the same month, Google researchers debuted a demo that made it so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/google-research-lets-sign-language-switch-active-speaker-in-video-calls/">people using sign language could be identified</a> as the &#8220;active speaker&#8221; in video calls. Apple doesn&#8217;t have a comparable gaze detection feature yet that&#8217;s widely available, though <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/26/apple-acquires-smi-eye-tracking-company/">they acquired SensoMotoric Instruments</a> (SMI), an eye-tracking firm, in 2017. So, hopefully similar accessibility features will be in the works at Apple, especially as Google continues to build out theirs.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Android update also lets Android Auto users customize more of their experience. Now, you can set your launcher screen from your phone, set dark mode manually and more easily browse content on media apps with an A-Z scroll bar and &#8220;back to top&#8221; button. Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Messages will now be compatible on the launch screen &#8212; proceed with caution and don&#8217;t drive distracted &#8212; and EV charging, parking, and navigation apps will now be available for use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Refraction AI calls itself the Goldilocks of robotic delivery. The Ann Arbor-based company, which recently raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/last-mile-delivery-robotics-company-refraction-ai-raises-4-2m/">$4.2 million seed round</a> and expanded operations to Austin, was founded by two University of Michigan professors who think delivery via full-size autonomous vehicles (AV) is not nearly as close as many promise and sidewalk delivery comes with too many hassles and not enough payoff. Their &#8220;just right&#8221; solution? Find a middle path, or rather, a bike path.</p>
<p>The company’s REV-1 robot, which co-founder and CTO Matthew Johnson-Roberson debuted on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/demo-with-matthew-johnson-roberson-refraction-ai/">TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility stage</a> in 2019, was built on a foundation of a bicycle. At about 4 feet tall and 32 inches wide, the three-wheeled vehicle can travel at up to 15 miles per hour, which means it can stop quickly to avoid obstacles while still being faster than a human.</p>
<p>The intermediate speed also means that the REV-1 doesn’t need to see as far ahead as a full-size AV, which allows it to function well on radars, sensors and cameras instead of requiring expensive lidar, according to the company.</p>
<p>Johnson-Roberson has spent nearly 20 years in academic robotics. Universities are home to many of the advances in field robotics, but the average person doesn&#8217;t see many such applications everyday when they look out their window. This desire to make something that is useful to the general public has been a huge motivator for the academic-turned-founder.</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity. </em></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: You unveiled Refraction AI on the TechCrunch stage two years ago. How has it evolved since?</b></p>
<p><b>Matthew Johnson-Roberson: </b>It&#8217;s been a really exciting ride. At that time, we had one vehicle — the one that we rolled out on stage — and now we have 25 vehicles in Ann Arbor and Austin, which we just announced. So things have changed quite a bit in the intervening years. We had already predicted a lot of changes around food delivery, specifically, and lots of those were accelerated by the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/elisity">Elisity</a>, a self-styled innovator that provides behavior-based enterprise cybersecurity, has raised $26 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The funding round was co-led by Two Bear Capital and AllegisCyber Capital, the latter of which has invested in a number of cybersecurity startups, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/cybersecurity-startup-panaseer-raises-26-5m-series-b-led-allegiscyber-capital/">Panaseer</a>, with previous seed investor Atlantic Bridge also participating.</p>
<p>Elisity, which is led by industry veterans from Cisco, Qualys and Viptela, says the funding will help it meet growing enterprise demand for its cloud-delivered Cognitive Trust platform, which it claims is the only platform intelligent enough to understand how assets and people connect beyond corporate perimeters.</p>
<p>The platform looks to help organizations transition from legacy access approaches to zero trust, a security model based on maintaining strict access controls and not trusting anyone — even employees — by default, across their entire digital footprint. This enables organizations to adopt a &#8220;work-from-anywhere&#8221; model, according to the company, which notes that most companies today continue to rely on security and policies based on physical location or low-level networking constructs, such as VLAN, IP and MAC addresses, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/vpn/">VPNs</a>.</p>
<p>Cognitive Trust, the company claims, can analyze the unique identity and context of people, apps and devices, including Internet of Things (IoT) and operational technology (OT), wherever they’re working. The company says through its AI-driven behavioral intelligence, the platform can also continuously assess risk and instantly optimize access, connectivity and protection policies.</p>

<p>&#8220;CISOs are facing ever-increasing attack surfaces caused by the shift to remote work, reliance on cloud-based services (and often multi-cloud) and the convergence of IT/OT networks,&#8221; said Mike Goguen, founder and managing partner at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/two-bear-capital">Two Bear Capital</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>&#8220;Elisity addresses all of these problems by not only enacting a zero trust model, but by doing so at the edge and within the behavioral context of each interaction. We are excited to partner with the CEO, James Winebrenner, and his team as they expand the reach of their revolutionary approach to enterprise security.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Elisity — whose competitors include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/vectra-ai-picks-up-130m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-for-its-network-approach-to-threat-detection-and-response/">Vectra AI</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/lastline/">Lastline</a> —<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>closed a $7.5 million seed round in August that same year, led by Atlantic Bridge. With its seed round, Elisity began scaling its engineering, sales and marketing teams to ramp up ahead of the platform’s launch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s looking to scale in order to meet growing enterprise demand, which comes as many organizations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/">move to a hybrid working model</a> and seek the tools to help them secure distributed workforces.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;When the security perimeter is no longer the network, we see an incredible opportunity to evolve the way enterprises connect and protect their people and their assets, moving away from strict network constructs to identity and context as the basis for secure access,&#8221; said Winebrenner.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;With Elisity, customers can dispense with the complexity, cost and protracted timeline enterprises usually encounter. We can onboard a new customer in as little as 45 minutes, rather than months or years, moving them to an identity-based access policy, and expanding to their cloud and on-prem[ise] footprints over time without having to rip and replace existing identity providers and network infrastructure investments.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>We do this without making tradeoffs between productivity for employees and the network security posture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elisity, which is based in California, currently employs around 30 staff. However, <a href="https://www.elisity.com/company?#TeamLeadSection">it currently has no women in its leadership team</a>, nor on its board of directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever toured an apartment and fell in love with the model unit?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not alone. Harvard Business School grad Cameron Johnson is a former institutional real estate investor and Greystar exec turned startup founder who realized that very often, “renters would try to rent the model apartment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This got him thinking. People would love to rent a model apartment in a building, and no one likes to move. This spelled opportunity in Johnson’s mind.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2017, he came up with the idea of </span><a href="https://nicksonliving.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nickson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Dallas-based startup that fully furnishes apartments on demand.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166333" style="width: 299px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166333" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2166333" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="289" height="433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg 852w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg?resize=768,1154 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166333" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CEO and founder Cameron Johnson / Nickson</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought ‘What if you gave people the ability to simply rent the model, or the ability to add everything in their space needs with a few clicks, similar to how a cable modem comes to your house,’” CEO Johnson said. “I wondered, ‘Why can&#8217;t we do that for everything else?’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Nickson doesn’t just provide furniture such as beds and sofas, it delivers all the essentials too &#8212; from extension cords to pots and pans to silverware to curtain rods. By partnering with a variety of retailers, the startup claims that it allows users “to make their new spaces move-in ready in as little as 3 hours.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">take a style quiz and share apartment layout details. Nickson’s designers create an initial layout based on the dimensions of an apartment, desired functions (such as work from home) and the volume of furnishings based on a person’s lifestyle. Once the layout is complete, Nickson creates a custom design, including all furnishings and home goods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon signing up, users </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay a one-time installation fee for the furniture-as-a-service offering, and then a monthly subscription charge for the duration of a lease &#8212; starting at $199 a month for a studio to $500 a month for a three-bedroom apartment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also offers concierge services such as a household supply starter kit and maid service, as an add-on to its flat monthly subscription.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nickson is currently only live in the Dallas market, but plans to expand into other cities over the next 12 months, including expanding its beta tests in Austin and Houston. And it’s just raised a $12 million Series A to help it advance on that goal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fund managed by Pendulum Opportunities LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22404557/pendulum-barack-obama-robbie-robinson-startup-founders-diversity">Pendulum Holdings LLC</a>, led the Series A round, which also included participation from Motley Fool Ventures, Revolution’s Rise of the Rest and Backstage Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain, leading to delivery delays for consumers. Nickson has purchased items over time that it stores as local inventory, making it even more attractive to renters who don&#8217;t want to deal with delays and hunting down furniture and essentials, Johnson said. The convenience Nickson offers led to its user base growing 700% in 2020 compared to the year prior, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robbie Robinson, co-founder and CEO of Pendulum, said his firm was drawn to invest in Nickson due to a combination of Johnson’s “vision, secular shifts toward renting and subscription consumption and the company’s disruptive business model.” (Robinson is President Barack Obama’s former financial adviser, and recently founded Pendulum to invest $250 million in founding startups of color).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kabir Ahmed, vice president at Pendulum, added that he believes Nickson’s model is superior to the concept of renting one-off furniture pieces in that it offers an “end-to-end, turnkey solution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This seamless experience is highly differentiated and offers a compelling value proposition for the consumer,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Nickson is not the only company attempting to turn the stodgy furniture rental industry on its head. Other startups offering similar services as Nickson include </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/founded-by-a-former-uber-exec-oliver-space-wants-to-design-and-furnish-apartments-for-busy-professionals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oliver Space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/fernish-lands-15m-in-khosla-led-series-a-for-furniture-rental-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fernish</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/the-landing-is-bringing-shoppable-social-and-collaboration-to-interior-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Landing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>But Nickson claims that it stands out from the competition in that it &#8220;takes care of everything&#8221; beyond furniture (including artwork and toilet brushes) and that it can curate space and bring it all in before a renter even shows up.</p>
<p>&#8220;No other competitor in this space offers this level of service, detail or turnaround,&#8221; Johnson says. &#8220;You can literally arrive at your new home with a suitcase and toothbrush, and it&#8217;s ready to &#8216;live in.'&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526266/facebook-smartwatch-two-cameras-heart-rate-monitor">word got out</a> that Facebook was taking another big step into first-party hardware with the planned launch of its own smartwatch. The most intriguing part of the report was the inclusion of not one but two watches. Other wearable makers have flirted with video and images on wrist-worn devices, but the feature is far from mainstream.</p>
<p>Industry leader Apple certainly doesn’t seem to be rushing into the idea, so Wristcam went and did it for them with the launch of a band sporting its own camera capable of shooting 4K images and 1080p. The product launched late last year, following a successful crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>Now its makers are going a more traditional funding route, announcing a $25 million raise led by Marker LLC. “We will use the funding to scale our team, Wristcam production, go to market, and R&amp;D of our computer vision engine for wearables,” CEO Ari Roisman told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Part of that funding involves effectively doubling the company’s headcount by early next year and helping deliver updates to some of the demands and concerns that have arisen since the product’s “public beta” launch in December.</p>
<p>Among the forthcoming features are live video. The company says it has sold “thousands” of units, which currently retail for $299 through the Wristcam site &#8212; so $20 more than a Watch SE. The company says it ran into COVID-19 supply chain issues earlier this year, but has pushed through and is now fulfilling orders daily.</p>
<p>In spite of Facebook’s apparent interest in wrist-base imaging, Roisman says he’s not concerned about possible Sherlock from Apple.</p>
<p>“I see camera continuing to be a core part of the iPhone strategy, with DSLR quality equivalence, including Pro offerings priced north of $1,000,” the exec says. “Meanwhile, I see continued Apple Watch focus on quantified health and wellness, as opposed to power, data and real estate intensive functionality that could conflict with the iPhone strategy.”</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://bit.ly/DiceSentimentReport">2021 Technologist Sentiment Report</a> — which in the second quarter polled technology professionals who mostly work at bigger organizations — shows 48% of tech professionals expressed an interest in changing companies this year, up from 40% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and a big jump from 32% in the second quarter last year.</p>
<p>It’s a unique moment, one that creates an unusual opportunity for startup founders on the hunt for talent.</p>

			We are amidst a sprawling renegotiation between employers and employees as to the very nature of work, and no one has more leverage than skilled technologists.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Fast-growing upstarts have a lot of advantages. Bigger companies may be more likely to <em>attempt</em> to recreate the office environment of the past — especially if they have leased space and a built environment that will be difficult to unwind. Startups are often nontraditional and may be able to react to create the hybrid work environments many technologists crave as the economy reopens.</p>
<p>While all startups are certainly not focused on being disruptive, they often rely on cutting-edge technology and processes to give their customers something truly new. Many are trying to change the pattern in their particular industry. So, by definition, they generally have a really interesting mission or purpose that may be more appealing to tech professionals.</p>
<p>A migration of tech talent just as the economy is revving up would be disruptive and could also play to startup strengths. The market for tech talent is already strong: Tech hiring has increased every month since November, according to our last <a href="http://bit.ly/DiceQ1TechJobReport">tech jobs report</a> released in May. Great data engineers, developers, business analysts and the like are in red-hot demand, and unemployment in tech is just above 2.4% percent, versus 5.5% percent in the economy overall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Podcasts Subscriptions are now live across more than 170 countries and regions, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-and-channels-are-now-available-worldwide/">announced</a> this morning. First <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">unveiled this spring</a>, subscriptions allow listeners to unlock additional benefits for their favorite podcasts, including things like ad-free listening, early access to new episodes, bonus material, exclusives or whatever else the podcast creator believes will be something their fans will pay for. Channels allow podcasters to group their shows however they like &#8212; for instance, to highlight a set of shows with a shared theme, or to offer different mixes of free and paid content.</p>
<p>The new subscription features were initially set to arrive in May, but Apple later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526186/apple-podcasts-in-app-subscription-launch">emailed creators</a> that the launch was being pushed to June. This was likely due to a <a href="https://podnews.net/article/apple-podcasts-lemon-bugs?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2021-05-28">series of back-end issues</a> impacting the service, including things like delayed episodes and malfunctioning analytics, among other things.</p>
<p>At launch, Apple says there are thousands of subscriptions and channels available, with more expected to arrive on a weekly basis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When listeners purchase a subscription to a show, they&#8217;ll automatically follow the show in the redesigned Apple Podcasts app. The show&#8217;s page will also be updated with a Subscriber Edition label, so they&#8217;ll be able to more easily tell if they have access to the premium experience.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s Listen Now tab will expand with new rows that provide access to paid subscriptions, including their available channels.</p>
<p>In the app, users can discover channels from show pages and through Search, browse through recommendations from the Listen Now and Browse tabs, and share channels with friends through Messages, Mail and other apps.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s delay to invest in the Podcasts market has given its rivals a head start on growing their own audience for podcasts. At the time of the spring announcement of subscriptions, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spotify-podcast-listeners-to-top-apples-for-the-first-time-in-2021-forecast-claims/">an industry report suggested</a> that Spotify’s podcast listeners would top Apple’s for the first time in 2021.</p>
<p>Despite the competition, Apple is betting its massive install base will bring in creators. Those creators agree to pay Apple a 30% cut of their subscription revenue in year one, just like subscription-based iOS apps. That cut drops to 15% in year two. Spotify, by comparison, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/spotify-launches-paid-podcasts-through-new-anchor-feature/">is taking no revenue cut</a> for the next two years while its program gets off the ground. It will then take only a 5% fee.</p>
<p>Based on the debut lineup, it seems many creators and studios believe Apple&#8217;s footprint is worth the larger revenue share.</p>
<p>Early adopters of subscriptions include notable names like Lemonada Media, Luminary, Realm and Wondery; media and entertainment brands, including CNN, NPR, The Washington Post and Sony Music Entertainment.</p>
<p>Other studio participants include Audio Up, Betches Media, Blue Wire, Campside Media, Imperative Entertainment, Lantigua Williams &amp; Co., Magnificent Noise, The Moth, Neon Hum Media, Three Uncanny Four, Wondery, Audacy’s Cadence13 and Ramble, Barstool Sports, Jake Brennan’s Double Elvis, Headgum, iHeartMedia’s The Black Effect, Big Money Players, Grim &amp; Mild, Seneca Women, Shondaland, Relay FM, Tenderfoot TV, Radiotopia from PRX, Pushkin Industries, QCODE and others,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week we announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/carnegie-mellon-university-president-farnam-jahanian-is-speaking-at-techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburgh/">Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian</a> will be speaking at our upcoming City Spotlight: Pittsburgh event. Today, we’re excited to announce another big guest: Mayor Bill Peduto.</p>
<p>The event will be held on June 29. You can <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">register here for free</a> to listen to our conversations with Mayor Peduto and Jahanian, among others.</p>
<p>An alumni of both Carnegie Mellon University and Pennsylvania State University, Peduto served on Pittsburgh’s City Council for a dozen years before being elected mayor in 2014. I’ve spoken with the mayor on numerous occasions, and aside from being one of the city’s biggest cheerleaders, he’s also a staunch proponent of the startup scene bolstered by local universities like CMU.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Having two world-class research universities allows us to draw the companies here in order to be able to utilize that talent. At the same time, that talent is building out the startup community,” Peduto told me in a recent conversation. “The other components of the startup community are now, for the first time, being properly invested in. I think what you’re seeing change over the past five years in Pittsburgh is West Coast VCs aren’t looking to move startups to California. They’re looking to invest in Pittsburgh.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Calling all Yinzers, TechCrunch is (virtually) headed to Pittsburgh!&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/calling-all-yinzers-techcrunch-is-virtually-headed-to-pittsburgh/embed/#?secret=ThjO9gleDg" data-secret="ThjO9gleDg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Having resources like those universities has been instrumental in building out Pittsburgh’s startup community. But the city &#8212; which long bore the scars of rustbelt depression &#8212; has traditionally had difficulty retaining much of its talent, losing out to better-known startup ecosystems in places like New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>But that’s changing &#8212; and the city is changing along with it. Pittsburgh currently has one of the world’s most vibrant robotic startup ecosystems, is at the center of much of the world’s autonomous vehicle research and has birthed successful companies like Duolingo.</p>
<p>Event organizer Matt Burns will be speaking to Mayor Peduto about the challenges and successes in building up such an ecosystem.</p>
<p>We’re still looking for startups to participate in the event. It’s free to register and participate in networking and watch the event (<a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">click here to register</a>). It’s also free to apply to pitch your startup at the event (<a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/F2JkiUKt">click here to apply</a>). We’re looking for early-stage companies from the greater Pittsburgh area that can give a two-minute pitch to a panel of local venture capitalists in exchange for feedback.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It certainly follows then that some leading construction robotics companies are able to strike while the iron is hot with some healthy raises. Today, Bay Area-based Dusty Robotics announced a $16.5 million Series A. Led by Canaan Partners and featuring NextGen Venture Partners, Baseline Ventures, Root Ventures and Cantos Ventures, the round brings the startup’s full funding up to $23.7 million.</p>
<p>“We have an enormous amount of demand from customers across the U.S., and around the world,” founder and CEO Tessa Lau told TechCrunch. “In addition to growing our team, we will be expanding our fleet of robots and building more robots to service this demand.”</p>
<p>Canaan partner Rich Boyle adds that the pandemic has helped accelerate some of the already existing demand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8zE4X06fly8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Both markets are incredibly active and evolving quickly, I believe mostly due to longer-term trends. Those include things like continued improvements in AI and labor shortages in key industries, as well as the decreasing price of robotic hardware. That said, COVID has driven changes in how people are thinking about the design, construction and ongoing utilization of real estate assets, and it&#8217;s driven substantial changes in behavior — how we work, how we live, how we shop, and some of those changes that were accelerated by COVID we think are here to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dusty team is still fairly lean at about 17 employees, largely located in Mountain View. The startup’s first product is the Field Printer, a robot that prints out plans on the floor of construction sites. The company likens the maps to “Ikea Instructions.” The autonomous bot has been used by Swinerton, DPR Construction, Build Group and Pankow Builders, among others.</p>
<p>“We just released our third-generation hardware platform, which was designed from the ground up by our team in Mountain View to be purpose-built for producing accurate and speedy layout on construction sites,” says Lau. “We&#8217;ve been working on this product since fall of 2018 and have incorporated lessons learned from completing over 1 million square feet of production layout into this third-generation design.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nuro, the autonomous delivery startup founded in 2016 by former Google engineers Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, is expanding into parcel logistics through a partnership with FedEx.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">multiyear, multiphased strategic partnership announced Tuesday aims to test and ultimately deploy Nuro&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/nuro/the-world-on-time-with-help-from-robots-announcing-nuros-partnership-with-fedex-32f33b39d36a">next-generation autonomous delivery vehicle</a> within FedEx operations. This bot will follow Nuro&#8217;s more recent R2 bot. Unlike others in the autonomous vehicle industry, Nuro has always focused its </span>efforts on designing a low-speed electric self-driving vehicle that transports packages, not people. But those &#8220;packages&#8221; have been more centered on the delivery of groceries, food and even medical supplies. Nuro has partnered with CVS, Domino&#8217;s and Kroger, for instance.</p>
<p>The deal with FedEx marks its first foray into parcels logistics. The pilot program has already started in Houston. This multiyear commitment will allow Nuro to bring its technology to more people in new ways, and eventually reach large-scale deployment, according to Cosimo Leipold, Nuro&#8217;s head of partnerships.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>FedEx has been working internally on its own autonomous vehicle technology, notably a sidewalk delivery bot. The SameDay Bot, which was named Roxo, was developed in collaboration with DEKA Development &amp; Research Corp. and its founder Dean Kamen, who invented the Segway and iBot wheelchair. FedEx first unveiled its SameDay Bot in February 2019. The FedEx bot is equipped with sensing technology such as lidar and multiple cameras, which when combined with machine learning algorithms should allow the device to detect and avoid obstacles and plot a safe path, all while following the rules of the road (or sidewalk).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Waabi&#8217;s Raquel Urtasun explains why it was the right time to launch an AV technology startup&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/waabis-raquel-urtasun-explains-why-the-time-was-right-to-launch-an-av-technology-startup/embed/#?secret=fJtq4mglYP" data-secret="fJtq4mglYP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company said at the time it planned to work with AutoZone, Lowe&#8217;s, Pizza Hut, Target, Walgreens and Walmart to figure out how autonomous robots might fit into its delivery business. The idea was for FedEx to provide a way for retailers to accept orders from nearby customers and deliver them by bot directly to customers&#8217; homes or businesses the same day. The company has tested the bots in Memphis, Tennessee as well as Plano and Frisco, Texas and Manchester, New Hampshire, according to a spokesperson.</p>
<p>The partnership with Nuro moves away from the sidewalk and onto the road. Nuro&#8217;s R2 is bigger and designed to operate on public roads, allowing it to travel farther distances and carry heavier loads.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">FedEx said it has made a long-term commitment to use Nuro&#8217;s autonomous bots for last-mile delivery at large scale.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;FedEx was built on innovation, and it continues to be an integral part of our culture and business strategy,&#8221; said Rebecca Yeung, vice president, advanced technology and innovation, FedEx Corporation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pitching is the single most important skill a founder needs to refine to be successful in building a startup. You can’t attract a co-founder, teammates, customers or investors without a well-crafted pitch about your product and vision, and so learning how to pitch and communicate effectively tends to be the first gateway to early entrepreneurial success.</p>
<p>While books and talks galore have been published on pitching, the reality is that the art of the pitch deck is a constantly changing fashion. The pandemic last year upended notions of how to draft a deck, given that founders had to pitch virtually on shared screens. As always, those aesthetics continue to change: VCs are busier than ever, seeing more companies than ever, and have to wade through ever more decks in their quest to find the next startups to back.</p>
<p>As we enter a hybrid investing world with a mix of online and in-person pitching, getting the pitch deck right has changed again — and remains just as important as ever.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s why we’re excited to be hosting Mar Hershenson, the founding managing partner of Pear VC, on one of our most perennially popular panels — How to Craft Your Pitch Deck, which will happen on the Extra Crunch stage at the all-virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=Hershensonpost">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> coming up this September 21-23.</p>
<p>Hershenson has been a longtime venture capitalist and has consistently invested at the founding stages of startups. She has backed IPO’d companies like Guardant Health and DoorDash, as well as startups such as Aurora Solar, BioAge and Branch. Perhaps most importantly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/the-vcs-who-founders-love-the-most/">in our survey of founders last year</a>, Hershenson was one of the top-ranked VCs in the world in terms of founder recommendations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="O5UBZwUcdq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/the-vcs-who-founders-love-the-most/">The VCs who founders love the most</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The VCs who founders love the most&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/the-vcs-who-founders-love-the-most/embed/#?secret=O5UBZwUcdq" data-secret="O5UBZwUcdq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Her background is as a technical builder and entrepreneur. In addition to nabbing a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford, Hershenson co-founded three companies before heading into venture: Barcelona Design, Sabio Labs and Revel Touch.</p>
<p>On this panel, Hershenson will discuss what’s changed when it comes to pitch decks in 2021, how she evaluates pitch decks in her day-to-day investing work, and whether and how pitch decks evolve and expand from first connection to final pitch meeting. We’ll also be taking questions from the audience to ensure that we cover all the strategies and tactics you have questions on about this critical skill.</p>
<p>So come <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=Hershensonpost">join Hershenson</a> (and all of our other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=Hershensonpost#eb919231-f3e4-4def-8dd0-afb0bc7c9c6e">fantastic speakers</a>) at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=Hershensonpost">Disrupt 2021 online this September 21-23</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In just one month we kick off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a> (July 8-9). If you’re an early-stage founder (pre-seed through Series A), don’t miss out on this two-day bootcamp. You’ll learn from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#3e01330b-4bf1-4206-b038-769db50898a0">top experts</a> across the startup ecosystem and take away tips and advice that you can implement in your business right now.</p>
<p><strong>Get amongst it:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">Buy your TC Early Stage 2021 pass</a>, and be sure to look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">our jam-packed agenda</a> to start planning your schedule.</p>
<p>When we say this event focuses on information every startup founder needs to build a successful business, we mean it. Case in point: Nate Wright, vice president of product marketing at UserTesting, will hold forth on the topic of customer experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customer experience can make or break any business. Right now — in the early stages of building your startup — is the perfect time to bake an outstanding customer experience into your company’s infrastructure. That means evaluating every touchpoint along the way and implementing policies that ensure a great experience.</p>
<p><strong>Fact:</strong> A great experience leads to happy, loyal customers, and we all know that happy loyal customers deliver better business results.</p>
<p>That’s a subject worth mastering, amirite? Here’s the description of Nate’s presentation, which takes place on July 8 from 12:45 p.m.-1:25 p.m. (EDT).</p>
<p><strong>Iterating More Effectively with Feedback:</strong> A great product alone is not enough. To be successful, early-stage companies need to optimize all phases of the customer journey. This session will include tactics, best practices and case studies on how to use customer feedback to understand customer needs, craft more compelling messaging and improve all phases of the customer experience.</p>
<p>We’ll add more breakout sessions — from Dell, Flatfile and Movile — to the agenda soon. And don’t stress about time conflicts. Your pass includes video on demand, so you can watch any sessions you miss or review sessions to catch any details you might have missed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Solid Power, a solid-state battery developer backed by Ford and BMW, is going public. The company said Tuesday it would head to the NASDAQ via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp III at a post-deal implied market valuation of $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to generate around $600 million in cash, including a $165 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction from investors Koch Strategic Platforms, Riverstone Energy Limited, Neuberger Berman and Van Eck Associates Corporation. Solid Power said in a statement Tuesday that the funds will go toward growth and operations.</p>
<p>Solid state batteries are considered by many as the next long-awaited breakthrough in battery technology. They are so named because they lack a liquid electrolyte, the mechanism that moves ions between the cathode and anode in traditional lithium-ion batteries, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">as Mark Harris explained in an Extra Crunch article</a> earlier this year. By getting rid of this liquid component, developers say SSBs are safer and with far superior energy density. Solid Power said <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001844862/000119312521190525/d124653dex993.htm">in a June 15 investor presentation</a> that its batteries are expected to deliver a nearly 500-mile range on a single charge and more than double a conventional battery&#8217;s 8-year lifespan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ford Motor Company and BMW AG have made it clear they’re bullish on Solid Power’s ability to deliver. The two OEMs led the battery developer’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/ford-bmw-lead-solid-powers-130m-series-b-round/">$130 million Series B</a> in May and signed joint development agreements for automotive-scale batteries from Solid Power’s pilot production line to be delivered in early 2022.</p>
<p>The SPAC transaction will likely be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021, Solid Power said. It’s expected to trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “SLDP.”</p>
<p>Solid Power is just the latest battery company to go public via a SPAC in recent months. One of its main rivals, Volkswagen-backed QuantumScape, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/">went public via a SPAC merger</a> last September at a valuation of $3.3 billion. Earlier this year, European battery manufacturer FREYR and power system developer Microvast <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/battery-companies-are-the-latest-spac-target-as-evs-get-a-huge-regulatory-boost/">also announced mergers</a> with so-called “blank-check” firms.</p>
