										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After months of NFT mania and Facebook&#8217;s recent name change to Meta, it&#8217;s fair to say that &#8220;metaverse&#8221; chatter has reached a fever pitch. And while crypto investors are buying up avatars and digital swaths of land in hopes that a digital universe will spring up around these projects, it&#8217;s unclear which projects &#8212; if any &#8212; will stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Institutional investors are also making their bets on the NFT &#8220;metaverse.&#8221; Crypto startup <a href="https://jadu.ar/nft/hoverboards">Jadu</a>, which has made millions of dollars selling pixelated NFT jetpacks and hoverboards, has scored $7 million in venture funding from General Catalyst with additional funding from Coinbase Ventures, The VR Fund, Sound Ventures and Guy Oseary, among others.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s virtual accessories can be used with other 3D avatars including Larva Labs&#8217; Meebits and other wildly pricey NFTs like CyberKongz and DeadFellaz. The avatars can be viewed and raced around in the company&#8217;s AR app The Mirrorverse, which the company hopes to eventually turn into a full-fledged Pokémon GO-like game.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248461" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the weekend, the company sold 6,666 NFT hoverboards for $4.4 million worth of the Ethereum cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The NFT space has attracted plenty of ridicule throughout the year, though proponents believe that the digital goods are more than meet the eye and allow creators to get attention and bankroll projects that they might otherwise have a tough time financing. Jadu CEO Asad J. Malik says that appetite for NFTs is overwhelming, but that they&#8217;re focused on building their broader platform for the time being.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can milk people right now, like there&#8217;s enough interest if we want we could say we&#8217;re releasing some avatar and we&#8217;re going to do like 1 ETH mints, and we can probably like make $20-30 million like that, but that&#8217;s not sustainable and that&#8217;s distracting,&#8221; Malik tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We have enough money, we&#8217;re going to build out the AR stuff. That&#8217;s really what we want to get ahead of everyone else on, like actual good AR gameplay, and NFTs are just kind of a process of being able to do that.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bessemer's Tess Hatch, Sequoia's Shaun Maguire and Hemisphere Ventures' Lisa Rich shared their thoughts on the active year that just passed and on what's coming next.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors are excited about the opportunities in the space market that are being unlocked by exit events and continued interest and private investment in the biggest and most successful space companies, including SpaceX. During a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> panel discussion on the growth-stage investment outlook for startups, Bessemer&#8217;s Tess Hatch, Sequoia&#8217;s Shaun Maguire and Hemisphere Ventures&#8217; Lisa Rich shared their thoughts on the active year that just passed and on what&#8217;s coming next.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve shared highlights from the discussion below, followed by a video of the full discussion, &#8220;Backing the Brightest.&#8221;</p>
<p>First, in terms of the year that just passed, SPACs obviously played a big role in space startups and generating liquidity for investors.</p>
<p>Hatch:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s bringing liquidity back to the investors that invested in those space companies years ago, I think looking back, Skybox, which was one of the first venture backed companies that had an exit was sold to Google for about half a billion dollars in 2014, after it was created in 2010. And not many venture capitalists were investing in space at the time, but they heard half-a-billion four years later— those are good ROI and a short time horizon for my LPs. Then basically every VC invested in one or two space companies, but from 2014 until this year, there weren&#8217;t many liquidity events in the industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maguire:</p>
<blockquote><p>You know, I think direct IPOs are still the gold standard, and a lot of the most marquee companies will try to do that. But SPACs are a very powerful tool in the toolkit, and it&#8217;s great to have another path toward liquidity. And in general, I think SPACs are better suited for deep tech companies than for like, enterprise SaaS companies, just where there&#8217;s oftentimes it&#8217;s hard to tell long-term stories with a traditional IPO process, whereas it&#8217;s much easier with SPACs.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>And now, there’s the Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobED). The four-wheel, Segway-style device is a platform in the strictest sense. That is to say, it’s open to a wide range of different applications &#8212; and you can also, quite literally, put stuff on top of it. It’s effectively a mobile wheelbase designed for a wide range of environments on which roboticists can build autonomous and controlled robotic applications on top of.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_BI8usSuo7I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Judging from the <a href="https://youtu.be/_BI8usSuo7I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brightly-colored YouTube video</a> the company released ahead of CES (where the system will be on display), potential applications include package delivery, the transportation of small infant humans and teleconferencing. Other potential applications for MobED include mobility for people with walking difficulties.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have developed the MobED platform to overcome the limitations of existing indoor guide and service robots while maximizing its usability in cities by dramatically improving the platform&#8217;s overall mobility,&#8221; Hyundai Motor Group Robotics Lab head <span class="xn-person">Dong Jin Hyun said in a release</span>. &#8220;We are also looking ahead to assess how potential users of MobED will further expand their needs and use for this type of technology.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The system weighs 110 pounds and is capable of speeds up to 19 miles an hour. The built-in battery should last around four hours, per Hyundai’s estimation. The “eccentric” bit reference to the system’s control mechanism.</p>
<p>Per Hyudai:</p>
<blockquote><p>The eccentric mechanism-based posture control system also stabilizes the body attitude by adjusting the height of each wheel according to the ground environment. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The MobED&#8217;s 12-inch pneumatic tires further help to absorb bumps and vibrations. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">More on this &#8212; and other Hyundai robots &#8212; to follow at CES next month.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Wuxiaworld was founded in 2014 by Jingping (JP) Lai, a former American diplomat and passionate fan of Chinese fantasy martial arts novels, or Wuxia, who started translating Chinese martial arts fiction into English out of his love for these works. Wuxiaworld does not have physical offices, although it is headquartered in Hong Kong, Lai said. It will continue operating 100% work-from-home as it has been since its founding, with founder Lai remaining CEO of the Asia fantasy storytelling platform, Lai told TechCrunch. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Wuxiaworld expects to launch more content in its platform with Kakao Entertainment&#8217;s broad access to the best original stories and intellectual properties in Korea&#8217;s fast-growing online serial fiction market and Radish&#8217;s strong marketing team (in the U.S.), Lai said. Wuxiaworld also has partnerships with Chinese digital publishers that can create additional synergies. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Wuxiaworld has millions of page views daily in over 100 countries via its website and app with a majority male audience. In contrast, Radish’s audience is primarily female-driven, which perfectly complements to diversifying Kakao Entertainment’s web fiction portfolio in the U.S. market, according to its statement. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">“Wuxiaworld is a truly gem of a company. Supported by strong word-of-mouth and an active community, 85% of Wuxiaworld’s total revenue comes through content purchased by a monthly subscription model. The company continues to grow impressively, with annual year-over-year profit growth of up to 40%,” said global strategy officer of Kakao Entertainment and CEO of Radish and Seungyoon Lee, who led the acquisition of Wuxiworld. </span></span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wuxiaworld&#8217;s subscription system allows users to read ongoing episodes free, but all completed episodes are paywalled. It also offers a monthly ad-free subscription model that enables users to read various completed series for free each month and a novel-specific sponsorship program that lets readers access the next chapters of ongoing episodes. </span></p>
<p>Kakao Entertainment’s popular martial arts and fantasy fiction contents such as “The Second Coming of Gluttony” and “Overgeared” already account for approximately 5% of the Wuxiaworld library among the top-grossing intellectual properties, driving almost a quarter of its revenue.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Both companies [Kakao Entertainment and Radish] are committed to creating high-quality mobile fiction, which forms the basis for their strong market leadership in the U.S. and Korea,” Lai said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Entertainment, which owns a slew of collections of Korean web fiction, will accelerate its business growth in English-speaking markets with Radish’s expertise in delivering mobile novels to U.S. consumers and Wuxiaworld’s commitment to translation excellence, as per its statement. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Radish and Kakao Entertainment hopes to further realize Wuxiaworld&#8217;s infinite growth potential to reach a new and wider demographic in the U.S. market,&#8221; Lee said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Following the acquisition, Kakao Entertainment now has three storytelling platforms: Radish, Tapas and Wuxiaworld. Having launched across Asia and Europe this year, the company plans to expand further in international markets next year, aiming to triple its transaction from overseas in the next three years. Kakao Entertainment announced last week <a href="https://kr.ambafrance-culture.org/kakao-job/">its webtoon service launch in France</a> as early as this month. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Entertainment opened offices in Thailand and Taiwan earlier this year. It also entered Indonesia in 2017 and Indian in 2020. Its sister company Piccoma, formerly known as Kakao Japan, provides web cartoons and novels in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">South Korea’s two largest internet giants Kakao and Naver compete in the storytelling platform market. In May, Naver has also completed an acquisition of Wattpad, a Canada-based web novel platform.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-0">Electric vehicle startup Canoo is ending its deal with Dutch automotive manufacturing company VDL Nedcar to serve as its contract manufacturer in Europe, according to a <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-065494/ea152435ex99-2_canoo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday</a>. <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-065494/ea152435ex99-1_canoo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A separate filing</a> reveals that Canoo will also be exploring a new deal with VDL Groep, another Dutch auto manufacturing company, to produce vehicles in the U.S.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">“We appreciate the months of effort VDL Nedcar invested to provide us with a contract manufacturing option, but we have concluded that building in America is better aligned with our mission and current focus to invest in the communities and states that are investing in hi-tech manufacturing alongside us, creating American jobs and innovation,&#8221; said Tony Aquila, Canoo&#8217;s CEO, in the filing. &#8220;The support from Oklahoma and Arkansas will allow us to achieve SOP earlier and with less risk on many fronts.”</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">As part of the breakup, VDL Nedcar will return Canoo’s prepayment of $30.4 million, and as part of the new partnership, VDL Groep will purchase $8.4 million of Canoo stock.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">The news comes about a month after<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/canoo-is-setting-up-headquarters-in-walmarts-hometown-picks-panasonic-as-battery-supplier/"> Canoo shared plans to move its headquarters and an advanced manufacturing industrialized facility to Bentonville, Arkansas</a>, where Walmart is also headquartered. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/ev-startup-canoo-is-gearing-up-for-production-in-oklahoma-factory/">During Canoo&#8217;s second-quarter earnings call</a>, Aquila had estimated VDL Nedcar would produce up to 25,000 units of the automaker&#8217;s lifestyle vehicle in 2023, but it appears those vehicles will now be manufactured in Arkansas.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">Canoo is also working on its &#8220;mega microfactory&#8221; in Oklahoma, which is expected to come online in late 2023 and will build Canoo pickup trucks and multipurpose delivery vehicles. Oklahoma committed $300 million in non-dilutive financial incentives to support Canoo&#8217;s facility and the next phase of its manufacturing. Canoo has not replied to requests for information about similar financial incentives offered by Arkansas, but it&#8217;s likely those incentives exist. The SEC filing states that Canoo will be able to better utilize the incentives from Oklahoma and Arkansas now that the startup and VDL Nedcar have ceased contract manufacturing discussions, and that it can better facilitate its ability to deliver vehicles ahed of Q4 without the 25% tariff that would have attached if the vehicles were manufactured in Europe.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">With the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/us/politics/biden-signs-infrastructure-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 trillion infrastructure bill officially signed into law</a>, which includes the Buy American Act, it&#8217;s possible Canoo will be chasing federal government contracts and other government incentives. The act restricts the purpose of non-domestic supplies, stipulates that the end product must be manufactured in the United States and applies to federal government contracts for products used in the U.S.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">“In addition, we will be 100% built in the heartland of America, and we have proudly achieved another major milestone of having sourced 96% of our parts from U.S. and Allied Nations,” said Aquila.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">By choosing a different manufacturing partner, Canoo hopes to reduce supply chain vulnerabilities, increase speed to market, more securely control the creation of additional innovation and IP, increase advanced manufacturing jobs in local communities and save thousands of dollars per unit by &#8220;eliminating warranty risks, tariffs and overseas shipping costs,&#8221; according to the filing.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">On Wednesday, Canoo also shared upgraded guidance on its refined manufacturing strategy and production roadmap for 2022 to 2025. Next year, Canoo aims to produce 3,000 to 6,000 units, up from 500 to 1,000 units. In 2023, it hopes to produce 14,000 to 17,000, up from 15,000 units. And its 2024 and 2025 targets are 40,000 to 50,000 units and 70,000 to 80,000 units, respectively.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/katie-haun-is-splitting-off-from-a16z-to-launch-her-own-crypto-fund/">Katie Haun is leaving a16z:</a> </strong>News is out today that Katie Haun is leaving a16z. She’s best known, TechCrunch notes, for co-leading the investing group’s $2.2 billion crypto fund. What’s she off to do? Starting a new crypto fund, of course, and she’s taking along some of her colleagues in the process. As far as crypto investing goes, this is seismic.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/the-era-of-ultra-rich-software-valuations-could-be-behind-us/">Are rich tech valuations set to fall?</a> </strong>As interest rates rise and are set to further scale next year, valuation pressure evident in the back half of 2021 could grow next year. That could mean lower top-tier revenue multiples for tech’s highest fliers and perhaps compressed valuations for slower-growing public tech companies. For startups, the impact could be constrained comps and lower private-market pricing.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/samsara-prices-at-top-of-range-crashes-through-10b-valuation-mark-in-public-debut/">The final tech IPO of the year:</a></strong> Capping off a busy IPO year, Samsara’s IoT-themed public debut went well. The company priced at the top end of its range and traded up around 5% toward the end of its first day as a public company. Samsara is now worth comfortably more than $10 billion after raising hundreds of millions in its public offering.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>TechCrunch covered far more startup news in the last 24 hours than I can include for you in our normal format. So, I’ve written blurbs for some of the most interesting items of the day, and then included links to others, in case you are diving deep this afternoon.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/crypto-company-anchorage-raises-350-million-at-3-billion-valuation/"><strong>This may be the largest party round we’ve seen:</strong></a> Crypto custody concern Anchorage has raised a $350 million round that values it at more than $3 billion. Everyone and their dog took part in the round, including KKR, Andreessen Horowitz, Goldman Sachs, Apollo (hey, it’s the parents!), Blockchain Capital, BlackRock, PayPal Ventures, Lux Capital and others. Why? “Because Anchorage received a federal banking charter, turning it into a digital asset bank,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/norwest-unveils-a-3-billion-fund-which-is-a-whopping-one-fourth-the-capital-it-has-ever-raised/"><strong>Norwest raises its biggest fund yet:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Speaking of the $3 billion number, that’s also the amount of money that investing group Norwest has raised for its 16th fund. It’s also the largest capital pool that the tenured firm has raised to date. Perhaps we should just call the current venture capital cycle the Super Size Me era.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/hong-kong-hardware-accelerator-brinc-raises-30m-series-b/"><strong>Hong Kong accelerator raises $30M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>While China figures out how to quash democratic voices and sentiment in Hong Kong, the city’s startup scene is not entirely moribund. Evidence of that fact can be found in Brinc’s recent Series B, worth some $30 million. The group is an accelerator that we’re most familiar with for its consumer hardware work, though it has expanded in scope in recent years.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/sqream-acquires-no-code-data-platform-panoply/"><strong>SQream buys Panoply:</strong></a><strong> </strong>SQream is what TechCrunch described as a “well-funded Israel-based data analytics platform.” And it has purchased “no-code data platform Panoply in an effort to expand its cloud services.” Panoply raised $24 million before selling to its new parent company. I would also like 10 points for not using the headline “You SQream, I SQream, we all SQream for startup-to-startup no-code acquisitions.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/us-puts-drone-maker-dji-and-seven-other-chinese-companies-on-investment-blocklist/"><strong>Drone maker DJI makes the U.S. block list:</strong></a> Rising economic tensions between the United States and China are hitting more companies this week, with DJI and a half dozen other companies finding themselves on the U.S. naughty list. Why is DJI in trouble? Per TechCrunch, “alleged involvement in surveillance of Uyghur Muslims.” Seems like a pretty solid reason, frankly.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/swimply-raises-40m/"><strong>Pool sharing makes a splash:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Yep, you read that correctly. A startup focused on pool rentals from the consumer supply, well, pool, just raised a bunch of money. The startup is called Swimply. Presumably the name is a hybrid of “swim” and “simply,” even if it sounds like a neat acne nickname.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Money, money, money:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/ai-powered-vfx-startup-wonder-dynamics-raises-10m-a-round/">AI-powered VFX startup Wonder Dynamics raises $10M A round</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/brazils-olist-gets-its-horn-with-new-186m-funding-round/">Brazil’s Olist gets its horn with new $186M funding round</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/proov-raises-9-7m-series-a-for-at-home-ovulation-testing-platform/">Proov raises $9.7M Series A for at-home ovulation testing platform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/for-course-hero-venture-capital-was-once-an-unobvious-solution/">For Course Hero, venture capital was once an unobvious solution</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/noname-security-unicorn-series-c/">Noname Security hits $1B valuation after $135M Series C raise</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/brazilian-consumer-credit-startup-open-co-raises-115m-in-softbank-led-round/">Brazilian consumer credit startup Open Co raises $115M in SoftBank-led round</a></li>

<p>Launching a startup is inherently risky, but scaling up a company to succeed where others have failed spectacularly is a very bold move.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Ample is partnering with companies that manage EV fleets to swap its modular battery packs in and out of their vehicles. &#8220;Fourteen years ago, Better Place raised nearly a billion dollars to do what Ample’s doing, and it ended up declaring bankruptcy,&#8221; reports Rebecca Bellan.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/amples-john-de-souza-on-the-merits-of-b2b-company-culture-and-investors-who-get-it/">In an extended interview with co-founder John de Souza</a>, she asked about the company&#8217;s go-to-market strategy, its culture and why he&#8217;s certain Ample will succeed where others did not.</p>
<p>&#8220;The economics and operations work very well because you don’t need a large number at a single station to break even. With a small fleet, you’d have it at max 20 cars and it will break even. That’s what makes it so attractive. You don’t need to deploy the stations until you have a customer.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Federal Trade Commission appears to be preparing to consider a rule aimed at digital platforms that either invasively track their users or allow others to do so. The &#8220;Trade Regulation Rule on Commercial Surveillance&#8221; is at a very early stage but could be the first major anti-Big-Tech action by new FTC Chair Lina Khan.</p>
<p>It is currently only described in <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202110&amp;RIN=3084-AB69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Office of Management and Budget summary</a>, after the FTC submitted information to that agency on potential upcoming regulatory actions. According to the listing, the rule would &#8220;curb lax security practices, limit privacy abuses, and ensure that algorithmic decision-making does not result in unlawful discrimination.&#8221; There is no public draft of the rule and no indication of whether the rule-making is more than notional at this point.</p>
<p>An FTC spokesperson offered the following statement, but declined to comment further: &#8220;The FTC is prepared to use all of our tools to combat harmful commercial surveillance practices and protect Americans&#8217; privacy.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248263" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Senator Brian Schatz called attention to the filing, lauding the agency (perhaps a bit prematurely) for taking this on: &#8220;I’m glad to see Chair Khan and the agency take this step to crack down on companies using discriminatory algorithms. It’s crucial that we address this,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The rule-making would use the FTC&#8217;s Section 18 authority to regulate &#8220;Unfair or deceptive acts or practices,&#8221; which is an established source of authority for establishing a variety of requirements and prohibitions.</p>
<p>This rule could potentially be along the lines of the proposed (and discarded) Broadband Privacy Act, among other attempts to shield consumers from the hidden depredations of everything from social media companies to internet providers.</p>
<p>Of course the FTC cannot simply invent rules out of thin air — they do establish rules, but it&#8217;s often when a new or changing industry has managed to circumvent rules that already exist for good reason.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, if a yogurt label says it&#8217;s fat-free and testing shows it has fat, that&#8217;s obviously false advertising. But if a social media company says (as they often do) that you &#8220;own your data&#8221; or some such, but you can&#8217;t download it, prevent them from selling it or completely delete it from their platform, is <em>that</em> false advertising? It might not be until the FTC updates its rules and guidance to include the practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlawful discrimination&#8221; might also occur when an algorithm fed with badly configured data ends up favoring or disfavoring a group of people based on a protected status like religion, race or medical status. At present there is little in the way of formal requirements for vetting algorithms, as they and their sources are often trade secrets or otherwise shielded from public view and inquiry. An FTC rule could help make this a requirement rather than a voluntary action.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Biden elevates tech antitrust crusader Lina Khan to FTC chair&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/embed/#?secret=pUYjnqGfH2" data-secret="pUYjnqGfH2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sometimes these efforts are backed up by legislation or executive action, and Khan certainly has something of a mandate from the White House to rein in Big Tech (her rapid ascendance from legal adviser to top of the heap is a strong endorsement of actions like this potential rule).</p>
<p>To be clear, at this point this is more or less a twinkle in the FTC&#8217;s eye, but the filing with the OMB does establish it as a likely priority in 2022 — an election year when the current administration would like to appear effective. Taking on Big Tech is one of very few bipartisan efforts extant so work on these lines could be a plank in a few political platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What if instead of watching your favorite TikTok star stream on Twitch, you could watch them play video games live on TikTok? For the last few days, according to the platform, TikTok has been testing a Windows program called <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/studio/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Live Studio</a>.</p>
<p>Once downloaded to your desktop, the program allows users to log in with their TikTok account and stream directly to TikTok Live. Within the program, you can communicate with viewers through the chat feature, and you can stream content from your computer, your phone or a gaming console. TikTok told TechCrunch that this program is currently available only in a handful of Western markets for a few thousand users.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>An obvious benefit for TikTok in testing this feature is that creators might be motivated to stay within their app, instead of asking their audience to watch them stream on Twitch or YouTube Gaming. From the look of TikTok&#8217;s promotional images, it seems that the company is catering toward people looking to stream video games. But in its nascent form, TikTok Live Studio lacks the features that seasoned streamers can find on broadcast software like OBS or Streamlabs &#8212; which makes sense, as the product is still in testing. For example, even though you can hook up a video game console to TikTok Live Studio, you can&#8217;t use browser windows as a source, and you can&#8217;t set up in-stream alerts for tips or new follows.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248267" style="width: 2890px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248267" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2248267 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png" alt="" width="2880" height="942" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=300,98 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=768,251 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=680,222 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=1536,502 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=2048,670 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248267" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/studio/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Live Studio </a><span class="screen-reader-text"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/studio/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(opens in a new window)</a></span></p></div></p>
<p>But a goal of this feature test is to see how creators use the software. TikTok Live Studio isn&#8217;t guaranteed to roll out, the company told TechCrunch &#8212; whenever TikTok tests a feature, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s here to stay forever. But if we do see a true launch of TikTok Live Studio, the platform will study what creators are using the software for, then tailor it to better suit those use cases.</p>
<p>Already, creators are using TikTok&#8217;s livestreaming tools to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/tiktok-expands-live-platform-with-new-features-for-creators-and-fans/">monetize</a> and expand their followings. Creators can accept <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/live-gifting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tips</a>, schedule events, use live Q&amp;A tools, go live with other users, filter certain keywords and assign moderators. Right now, TikTok Live Studio allows users to choose whether they want to enable gifting and comments, and they can set up keyword filters. But other existing livestreaming features like assigning moderators and scheduling streams could potentially be incorporated into a future, more robust product.</p>
<p>This streaming software could also mark an opportunity for TikTok to reach more desktop users. For creators, a desktop streaming software is essential, since a smartphone simply isn&#8217;t built to connect to your gaming console and stream at the same time. Though people do watch video game streams on their phones, the user experience is generally better on desktop, which could help users create the habit of using TikTok on their computer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The trend that is instant grocery delivery &#8212; online ordering of essentials with your purchases being delivered to you in under an hour &#8212; continues to proliferate across multiple markets, and in the latest development, Sequoia is leading an investment in one out of Australia.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getvoly." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voly</a>, a five-month-old Sydney-based startup that offers thousands of SKUs and promises deliveries in 15 minutes at a flat fee of A$2.99 ($2.14), has raised A$18 million (just under $13 million at today&#8217;s rates) in a seed round of funding that it will be using to expand its business to cities and towns across the country.</p>
<p>In addition to Sequoia, by way of Sequoia Capital India, other investors in the round include Global Founders Capital (GFC) and Artesian Capital, an Australian firm; the latter two also previously backed Voly in a $1 million pre-seed round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248211" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At a time when the instant grocery market is very crowded in certain regions like Europe &#8212; where a number of local startups are coexisting and competing with some very heavily capitalised players with international ambitions like Gopuff, Gorillas, Flink and Getir &#8212; Voly has picked a ripe moment to ramp up in Australia.</p>
<p>The market for groceries in the country is estimated to be worth some A$90 billion ($64.6 billion) annually, but while there are some services for delivering so-called &#8220;big basket&#8221; purchases that are typically made weekly, the field appears to be pretty open for those offering deliveries in under an hour.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Instant delivery is still very revolutionary here,&#8221; Mark Heath, the co-CEO and co-founder, said in an interview earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were the country that got left behind by the other delivery startups,&#8221; joked Thibault Henry, the other founder and CEO. &#8220;We are a breath of fresh air.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It currently offers some 2,000 SKUs and the plan is to grow that to 3,000, with groceries and essentials also complemented by modular shopping that mimics the concept of meal kits: A customer can select recipes based on preparation time, and then buy the ingredients needed to make them.</p>
<p>Heath said this has helped the company market itself not just to the younger, urban-dwelling millennials that typical are the early adopters of instant grocery services; but also working parents &#8220;who still want to cook tasty food for their families.&#8221; Henry believes the typical Voly user will use its service several times a week.</p>
<p>That lack of competition could be one reason investors have been bullish on Voly; the other might be the track record of the founders.</p>
<p>Heath helped launch Uber in Australia heading up operations and logistics, and then he worked as the country manager for CloudKitchens. Henry, meanwhile founded and ran a last-mile refrigerated delivery startup, Balto Logistics, which racked up a long list of on-demand food delivery brands as customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Australia&#8217;s grocery market, which sees $90 billion in annual spends, is a large and profitable space that continues to be dominated by offline retail,&#8221; said Abheek Anand, MD, Sequoia India, in a statement. &#8220;The Sequoia Capital India team was impressed by the strong consumer love for VOLY, their compelling value proposition, and an impressive team of repeat founders that has blitzscaled businesses in Australia before. With on-demand models traditionally scaling very successfully in the country, the decision to lead their seed round and help them scale their business across Australia was an easy one to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Voly may be a very new and likely very small outfit &#8212; it&#8217;s not disclosing customer numbers but says that right now its growing at a rate of 100% each month &#8212; it&#8217;s indeed the collective experience and network that the two have that&#8217;s helping them build their platform and establish supply chains that don&#8217;t completely kill Voly on margins while still aiming to sell goods at retail, rather than marked-up, prices.</p>
<p class="p1">Another point of distinction in how Voly is growing is that it&#8217;s choosing to make its drivers full-time employees rather than contractors. &#8220;That&#8217;s our choice,&#8221; Heath said. &#8220;Uber and DoorDash are gig economy companies. We&#8217;ve chosen a different model.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ubqmaterials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UBQ Materials</a>, which claims it has developed a plastic-like material made from 100% unsorted household waste, has raised a $170 million funding round led by TPG Rise, TPG’s global impact investing platform, made through TPG Rise Climate, the firm’s dedicated climate investing fund, and The Rise Funds, its multisector impact investing fund.</p>
<p>The financing round also included participation from existing investor, Battery Ventures, and others including M&amp;G’s Catalyst strategy, a U.K.-based investor.</p>
<p>UBQ Materials says it can turn landfill-destined municipal solid waste, including all organics, into recyclable plastic substitute. Its “UBQ” product can then be used both on its own and in conjunction with conventional oil-based resins in construction, automotive, logistics, retail and even 3D printing, it says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248295" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Steve Ellis, co-managing partner of The Rise Funds said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to converting municipal waste into functional thermal plastics, UBQ’s material solution is energy efficient, uses no water and produces no effluents UBQ can be utilized in a broad array of industrial and consumer applications.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company is vague on how it achieves all this but we will be following its claims with interest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year, we&#8217;ve seen plenty of evidence that NFTs can shake up the economics of selling visual art, but there&#8217;s been less activity when it comes to web3 upending the economics of different verticals in the art world, including music.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sound.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sound.xyz</a> is a new startup looking to help recording artists monetize their community through NFTs, as the startup looks to build out a suite of tools designed to bring musicians into the so-called &#8220;web3&#8221; fold. The startup released is first product earlier this month, Listening Parties, which enable artists to sell NFTs tagged to the release of new songs.</p>
<p>The startup tells TechCrunch it has raised $5 million in a seed raise led by Andreessen Horowitz. Other investors in the round include Variant Fund, Weekend Fund, Scalar Capital, Flamingo, Packy McCormick and 21 Savage, among others.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248140" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup is looking to push emerging artists to monetize their work more effectively by leveraging NFTs and help them rise above earning minute fractions of pennies per stream on platforms like Spotify.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building a suite of economic tools to help artists monetize their songs in new ways,&#8221; Sound CEO David Greenstein tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The problems that we want to solve are: Can we get music heard and can we get artists paid?&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup has partnered with a number of &#8220;crypto-friendly&#8221; recording artists that have been engaging with the community. The early drops have been limited to a couple dozen limited-edition NFTs that have sold out instantly.  While selling $10,000 worth of NFTs may not sound too noteworthy in an industry friendly to million-dollar sales, Greenstein says the proceeds make a big difference to artists who might need hundreds of thousands of streams to earn that same amount on Spotify. As the startup gauges demand for NFT drops tied to song drops for certain artists, they have ambition to release more NFTs to the community. The startup notably does not take a commission on the sales and the NFTs.</p>
<p>The team has been experimenting with other features for the drops like enabling NFT holders to leave comments on the streams for artists to read. Down the road, the startup wants to create broader tools that allow musicians to crowdfund from fans to create new works and tackle new projects while also creating new incentive models for curators to discover and showcase new music.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sound is not the only player in the NFT music space. Last month, a16z Crypto backed <a href="https://royal.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Royal</a>, an NFT music platform looking to tokenize royalties and sell them to fans. <a href="https://audius.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audius</a>, a music-streaming platform on the blockchain, has raised over $13.5 million in funding from firms including General Catalyst and Coinbase Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investment from VC and PE into climate tech is booming, reaching $87.5 bilion over H2 2020 and H1 2021, with in excess of $60 billion in the first half of 2021 alone, according to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/climatetech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new report from PWC</a>.</p>
<p>This is a 210% increase from the $28.4 billion invested in the 12 months prior; some 14 cents of every dollar of VC now going to climate tech.</p>
<p>However, not all is rosy. The investment is mostly focused on technology solutions accounting for 20% of emissions reduction potential. So PWC says there is an opportunity to shift the focus to areas and technologies with a more direct impact on emissions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248277" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Despite this overall growth, the number of early VC, seed and Series A investments in climate tech has remained largely stagnant since 2018.</p>
<p>Of 15 solutions analyzed, the top five, representing more than 80% of emissions reduction potential by 2050, received just 25% of the climate tech investment between 2013 and H1 2021.</p>
<p>In other words, VC needs to put more into directly affecting emissions not just SaaS platforms, etc., which track them.</p>
<p>Emma Cox, global climate leader, PwC U.K., said:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The world has 10 years to halve global greenhouse emissions if we are to have hope of achieving net-zero by 2050 …  However, our research has found there is potential to better channel and incentivize investment in technology areas that have the greatest future emissions reduction potential. This raises the question of why these sectors are missing out — are investors missing a valuable opportunity or is there an incentive problem that needs the attention of policymakers?</p></blockquote>
<p>Climate tech encompasses technologies focused on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Climate tech investment plateaued in 2018-2020 but has rebounded in the first half of 2021 — driven by a refreshed focus on ESG in private markets, emerging regulations and standards, and more companies committing to net-zero strategies.</p>
<p>Here are some extracts from PWC’s report:</p>
<blockquote><p>• The average climate tech deal size nearly quadrupled in H1 2021 to US$96M, from US$27M one year prior.<br />
• About 1,600 investors were active in H1 2021, compared to fewer than 900 active investors in H1 2020 as the wider investment community becomes familiar with the opportunities in climate tech as an asset class.<br />
• SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) were tested to further stimulate climate tech’s growth and raised US$25bn in H1 2021, accounting for more than a third of all funding.<br />
• Mobility and Transport continues to receive the lion’s share of climate tech funding as electric vehicles (EVs), micro-mobility and other innovative transit models attract investor attention.  This challenge area raised nearlyUS$58bn between H2 2020 and H1 2021, representing two-thirds of total climate tech funding raised in the period.<br />
• Mobility and Transport, Industry, Manufacturing and Resource management (IM&amp;R) and Financial Services saw the fastest growth year over year between H2 2019 &#8211; H1 2021, each more than 260%, reaching US$58bn, US$6.9bn and US$1.2bn respectively.<br />
• The top five technologies representing over 80% of future emissions reduction potential include: Solar Power, Wind Power, Food Waste Technology, Green Hydrogen Production, and Alternative Foods/Low GHG Proteins.</p></blockquote>
<p>PWC said the United States leads in climate tech investing, attracting nearly 65% of VC investment, $56.6 billion from H2 2020 to H1 2021. China is estimated to have seen $9 billion in climate tech investment in the same period, while Europe totaled $18.3 billionn, driven by a nearly 500% (494%) increase in Mobility and Transport in H2 2020 and H1 2021, compared to the prior 12 month period.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Meta is expanding its bug bounty program to reward researchers who report data scraping. The change will allow researchers to report both bugs that could enable scraping activity, as well as previously scraped data that has already been published online.</p>
<p>In a blog post, Meta says it believes it is the first to launch a bug bounty program to specifically target scraping activity. “We&#8217;re looking to find vulnerabilities that enable attackers to bypass scraping limitations to access data at greater scale than what we initially intended,” Security Engineering Manager Dan Gurfinkle told reports during a briefing.</p>
<p>Data scraping is different than other “malicious” activity Meta tracks as it uses automated tools to mass-collect personal information from users’ profiles, such as email addresses, phone numbers, profile photos and other details. Even though users often willingly share this information on their public Facebook profiles, scrapers can expose these details more widely, such as publishing the information in searchable databases.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248242" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It can also be difficult for Meta to combat this activity. For example, in April the personal information of more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-533-million-user-personal-data-leak-180156777.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><ins>500 million</ins></a> Facebook users was published on a forum. In that case, the actual data scraping had occurred years prior, and the company had already addressed the underlying flaw. But there was little it could do once the data started circulating online. In some cases, the company has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-lawsuit-instagram-profile-scraping-220032564.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><ins>also</ins></a> <a href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><ins>sued</ins></a> individuals for data scraping.</p>
<p>Under the new bug bounty program, researchers will be rewarded for finding “unprotected or openly public databases containing at least 100,000 unique Facebook user records with PII [personally identifiable information] or sensitive data (e.g. email, phone number, physical address, religious or political affiliation).” Instead of its usual payouts though, Meta says it will donate to a charity chosen by the researcher in order not to incentivize the publishing of scraped data.</p>
<p>For reports of bugs that can lead to data scraping, researchers can choose between a donation or a direct payout. Meta says each bug or dataset is eligible for at least a $500 award.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stanford’s made a lot of progress over the years with its gecko-inspired robotic hand. In May, a version of the “gecko gripper” even found its way onto the International Space Station to test its ability to perform tasks like collecting debris and fixing satellites.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.abi9773" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a paper published today in Science Robotics</a>, researchers at the university are demonstrating a far more terrestrial application for the tech: picking delicate objects. It’s something that’s long been a challenge for rigid robot hands, leading to a wide range of different solutions, including soft robotic grippers.</p>
<p>The team is showing off FarmHand, a four-fingered gripper inspired by both the dexterity of the human hand and the unique gripping capabilities of geckos. Of the latter, Stanford notes that the adhesive surface “creates a strong hold via microscopic flaps &#8212; Van der Waals force – a weak intermolecular force that results from subtle differences in the positions of electrons on the outsides of molecules.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248205" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/km_M9KyTpsY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The team refers to the issue at hand as the “heirloom tomato problem.” Specifically, standard grippers are best suited to the repetitive task of picking up similarly sized hard objects, one after another. In tests, FarmHand has worked with bunches of grapes, uncooked eggs, basketballs and plates, among others.</p>
<p>“You’ll see robotic hands do a power grasp and a precision grasp and then kind of imply that they can do everything in between,” said Biomimetics and Dextrous Manipulation Lab grad Wilson Ruotolo. “What we wanted to address is how to create manipulators that are both dexterous and strong at the same time.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online grocery platform Instacart is <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/pressreleases/instacart-expands-ebt-snap-payments-program-and-celebrates-one-year-of-increasing-access-to-food/">expanding</a> its Electronic Benefits Transfer and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (EBT SNAP) payments integration. The company launched EBT SNAP payments in November 2020 and has since expanded the program to include over 40 retailers. Instacart&#8217;s newest partners that accept EBT SNAP payments include Fairplay Foods, PAQ Inc (Food 4 Less California &amp; Rancho San Miguel), Harps, Little Giant Farmer&#8217;s Market and Earthfare.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s other partners that accept EBT SNAP payments include Aldi, Ahold Delhaize USA, Brookshire’s, Food Bazaar, Homeland, My County Market, Price Chopper/Market 32, Publix, Woodman’s Markets and more.</p>
<p>Instacart has also announced that in addition to partnering with traditional grocers, it is now also enabling many of its retailers to accept EBT SNAP payments through its virtual convenience offering, which allows users to place orders for common convenience items, like snacks and essentials, with a faster delivery time. EBT SNAP convenience delivery is now available in partnership with Ahold Delhaize USA banners: Food Lion Now, Giant Instant Delivery, Giant Food Convenience, Hannaford Now, Martin’s Instant Delivery and Stop &amp; Shop Express. These retailers can be found in the &#8220;Convenience Hub&#8221; on Instacart&#8217;s marketplace.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248217" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is also waiving the delivery and pickup fees on all EBT SNAP orders placed from January 1, 2022 through March 31, 2022 for customers using a valid EBT card associated with their Instacart account in connection with their purchase.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Instcart also enabled EBT SNAP payments across its enterprise solutions in partnership with BJ’s Wholesale Club, Brookshire’s, Food Bazaar, Food Lion, Harps Food Stores, Homeland, Publix, The Save Mart Companies, Schnucks, Strack &amp; Van Til, Tops Markets and Wakefern Food Corp.</p>
<p>“We’re proud of the progress we’ve made since launching EBT SNAP payments, and are grateful to our retail and USDA FNS partners for helping us bridge the food accessibility gap for millions of Americans,&#8221; said Instacart CEO Fidji Simo in <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/pressreleases/instacart-expands-ebt-snap-payments-program-and-celebrates-one-year-of-increasing-access-to-food/">a statement.</a> &#8220;Looking ahead, we’re committed to expanding our EBT SNAP offering and investing in additional programs that offer consumers more accessible, affordable and nutritious ways to feed their families.”</p>
<p>Instacart&#8217;s latest expansion comes as the company recently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instacart-rolls-out-reduced-and-free-delivery-option-in-select-markets-deals-tab-and-more/"> rolled out</a> a new &#8220;Deals Tab,&#8221; which includes daily coupons from retailers and companies. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instacart-rolls-out-reduced-and-free-delivery-option-in-select-markets-deals-tab-and-more/">introduced</a> a new “Dollar Store Hub” to allow users to browse dollar store deals from more than 13,000 dollar stores, including Dollar Tree, 99 Cents Only Store, Five Below and Family Dollar. Instacart is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instacart-rolls-out-reduced-and-free-delivery-option-in-select-markets-deals-tab-and-more/">testing</a> a new delivery option, which will reduce or waive the delivery fee on orders placed more than 24 hours ahead of the scheduled delivery. The new delivery option is being tested in select markets, but Instacart hasn&#8217;t specified which ones.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 2021 H-1B lottery process has been quite a rollercoaster! </strong></p>
<p><strong>We sponsored several people in this year’s lottery. One of our registrants was selected in the first round in March, but none were selected in the second round in July. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We just found out another of our registrants was selected in November, however, he’s from South Africa and restricted from traveling to the U.S. due to Omicron. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What should we do? Any suggestions for what to do about our other prospective hires who didn’t get selected?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Eager Employer</strong></p>
<p>Dear Eager,</p>
<p>Congrats on getting two of your registrants selected in the most recent year’s H-1B lottery! Our clients had many candidates who got selected in subsequent selection rounds as well. This year’s H-1B lottery was a drawn-out process, and it’s great to see that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is committed to reaching the 85,000 H-1B cap. I touched on this in a recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/101-the-immigration-outlook-for-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a> in which I talked about immigration changes and trends I expect to see in the year ahead.</p>
<p>I’m anticipating that granting as many of the 85,000 H-1B visas as possible each year will continue to be a priority for the Biden administration. To reduce immigration backlogs, they are working to rebuild resources and staffing levels at USCIS and the U.S. Department of State that had been gutted during the previous four years.</p>

<h2>The new travel ban</h2>
<p>As you know, the Biden administration instituted a travel policy on Nov. 29 due to the Omicron variant. The most recent policy bars individuals who have been in South Africa, as well as Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe within the previous 14 days from entering the United States. U.S. citizens, permanent residents and the spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents are exempted from this new travel ban.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of its recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">2022 lineup</a>, Volvo subsidiary Polestar introduced a new single-motor variant of its Polestar 2 electric sedan. If you were waiting on an EPA estimate before reserving one, wait no more. You can expect to get about 270 miles of range on a single charge from the car’s 75 kWh battery, Polestar announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>That puts the FWD model in the company of vehicles like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Volkswagen ID.4</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-3-2021-refresh-offers-more-range-and-other-improvements-114539380.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Model 3</a>. With the entry-level models of those two cars, you can expect 249 miles and 263 miles of range, respectively. That’s not bad given the Polestar 2’s $47,200 starting price, but not nearly as good as the 303 miles of EPA-rated range Hyundai will offer with the $44,875 version of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-300-mile-ioniq-5-crossover-ev-makes-its-official-north-american-debut-190054008.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Ioniq 5</a>.</p>
<p>The automaker also announced today it’s rolling out an over-the-air update for all Polestar 2 vehicles. The new software allows you to schedule when you want your car to charge, so that you can take advantage of off-peak pricing. The update also includes refinements for the car’s driver-assist systems. In the coming months, Polestar plans to release a software upgrade that will allow owners of the dual-motor Polestar 2 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-over-the-air-update-torque-horsepower-acceleration-151000748.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">unlock additional torque and horsepower</a> from their car for a fee.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248228" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Katie Haun, who co-leads Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s $2.2 billion crypto fund, is splitting off from the firm and taking a number of colleagues with her &#8212; including operating partner Rachael Horwitz &#8212; to start a new crypto-centric fund, <a href="https://www.axios.com/crypto-investor-katie-haun-leave-andreessen-horowitz-e11aa2f2-6ad9-4b27-abb4-b44e461174ec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a> reports.</p>
<p>Haun <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/andreessen-horowitz-has-a-new-crypto-fund-and-its-first-female-general-partner-is-running-it-with-chris-dixon/">joined the firm in 2018</a> after a career as a federal prosecutor for the Justice Department working on cyber crimes. She has been a highly visible public face for the firm&#8217;s crypto efforts, discussing the regulatory landscape of the industry at events like TechCrunch Disrupt.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the firm confirmed the news to TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248185" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz has grown to be a major presence in the crypto investment world as they&#8217;ve rapidly deployed capital into a number of startups in the space. They were an early mover with their first $300 million crypto investment fund in 2018, which they have since followed up with two larger funds, including their current vehicle, the $2.2 billion Fund III.</p>
<p>Haun has co-led the fund alongside longtime a16z GP Chris Dixon. The firm has maintained its edge among legacy firms but is seeing increased competition among a swatch of so-called &#8220;crypto native&#8221; investment funds like Paradigm and Variant Fund. Paradigm recently closed a $2.5 billion crypto fund, the largest of its kind.</p>
<p>Haun currently sits on the boards of Coinbase and OpenSea, among others, where she is expected to retain her board seats. Andreessen Horowitz will be a large limited partner in her fund alongside personal investments from Andreessen, Horowitz and Dixon. Haun notified her colleagues of the departure earlier today.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be forever grateful to Chris, Marc, and Ben for believing in me early on. Our work together and your continued support have been invaluable. Thank you for cheering me on and supporting me in this new chapter,&#8221; an emailed statement from Haun reads, in part.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A team at Google is today launching a new service called <a href="https://qaya.area120.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qaya</a>, which will allow creators to easily set up new web storefronts where they can sell their products and services directly to their audiences. The project is the latest to emerge from Google&#8217;s in-house project incubator, Area 120, which was recently a part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/google-reorg-moves-ar-vr-starline-and-area-120-into-new-labs-team-reporting-directly-to-sundar-pichai/">reorganization</a> at the company that elevated its status after many of its earlier projects exited to different parts of Google, including its Cloud, Search, Shopping and Commerce divisions.</p>
<p>The new project, Qaya, was co-founded by Nathaniel Naddaff-Hafrey, a founder-in-residence at Area 120 who previously worked on <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/03/11/google-area-120-kormo-job-seekers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jobs marketplace</a> Kormo aimed at the &#8220;next billion&#8221; internet users, specifically those in markets like India, Indonesia and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>After hearing from dozens of creators about how difficult and time-consuming it is to build their digital businesses, he got the idea for <a href="https://qaya.area120.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qaya</a>, a service that would allow them to sell directly to fans. Several other members on the Qaya team are also creators, who bring with them their own experiences with existing creator tools. They understood from their own efforts and other creators they spoke to that there&#8217;s demand for a flexible, no-code product that could function as a one stop-shop where creators can make money from their work and better connect with their audience.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248079" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Qaya&#8217;s solution allows creators to build personalized web storefronts featuring their products and services, and other digital downloads, which can then be linked to their YouTube Merch Shelf, and integrated with Google Search and Google Shopping. Through these stores, creators could include things like photos, files or e-books, digital art, photo filters and presets, productivity templates, knitting patterns, fitness videos and much more. The company says up to 1,000 products can be hosted per storefront.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248116" style="width: 363px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248116" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2248116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ProductPage1000x.max-1000x1000-1.png?w=353" alt="" width="353" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ProductPage1000x.max-1000x1000-1.png 519w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ProductPage1000x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=78,150 78w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ProductPage1000x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=156,300 156w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ProductPage1000x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=353,680 353w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ProductPage1000x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, if the creator sells physical goods or services on other platforms, an import function will allow them to feature these items on their Qaya page, complete with their own personal branding.</p>
<p>Each store also gets its own custom URL in the form of qaya.store/your-name or yourname.channel, which could be used in place of the links they place on social media sites created with the &#8220;link in bio&#8221; solutions available today like <a href="https://linktr.ee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linktree</a> or <a href="https://beacons.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beacons</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These services let creators build micro-websites pointing to their various online presences, including social media channels, shops, blogs, music or podcasts, and more.</p>
<p>And like those services, the Qaya stores also allow creators to feature links to their other online profiles, which sit at the top of the page underneath the creator&#8217;s name and bio. But the larger purpose of the site is to connect fans directly to the content the creator has for sale, not just as a landing page to connect fans to the creator&#8217;s profile on other services.</p>
<p>Google Pay is built into Qaya, and supports a variety of monetization types, including subscription, tipping and one-time payments. Qaya also offers insights and analytics about how the creators&#8217; products are performing in terms of sales.</p>
<p>Currently, the product is free to use, with monetization managed on a transactional basis. That is, creators will keep the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of the revenue they generate from products they upload and sell on Qaya, notes Google.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company is now rolling out the YouTube Merch Shelf integrations for eligible YouTube creators who join Qaya&#8217;s beta and, in time, hints that Qaya aims to allow creators to sell even more products, including &#8220;other types of digital goods,&#8221; which sounds like a veiled reference to NFTs, though Google isn&#8217;t yet saying if that&#8217;s the case.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248114" style="width: 564px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248114" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2248114" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png?w=554" alt="" width="554" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png 815w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=122,150 122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=245,300 245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=768,942 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=554,680 554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248114" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google says the new service is launching today into beta testing in the U.S., though non-U.S. users can join a waitlist while they wait for Qaya to roll out to their country. Creators who want to gain access to Qaya&#8217;s beta can request an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrnVCQI8oBzWv3NyQOcSnHBUbFlOgnv25nJx-sXrDxwa63Xg/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invitation</a> from the Qaya website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wonderdynamics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonder Dynamics</a> aims to make &#8220;blockbuster-level&#8221; visual effects achievable by living-room-level creators using AI and cloud services, though it has kept its product closely under wraps. The secretive company, which boasts a star-studded set of advisors, has raised a $10 million A round ahead of a planned launch later in 2022.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Nikola Todorovic and actor Tye Sheridan; they joined forces some years back after working on a film together and finding they shared a belief in democratizing cinema tools. Of course many tools have come down in price and difficulty, such as high-resolution cameras and the computing power to edit and color footage.</p>
<p>But serious VFX are another matter, and the higher fidelity of today&#8217;s cameras and displays demand improved quality in CG, something that has kept the cost and barrier to entry high.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248127" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wonder Dynamics is a VFX platform that utilizes AI and cloud services to make these things easier, though exactly how is still something of a secret.</p>
<p>&#8220;The platform uses a completely new process, and it is an end-to-end solution for content creators who lack the technical knowledge necessary to produce CG and VFX content,&#8221; explained Todorovic. &#8220;For the professional artist, the output is exportable into existing workflow and software (Unreal, Blender, Maya, etc.). It is focused on post-production, but it will drastically reduce the need for hardware, equipment and additional effort in production as it exists today.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="521nwT9hCi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/wonder-dynamics-raises-2-5m-seed-to-equip-indie-filmmakers-with-ai-powered-vfx/">Wonder Dynamics raises $2.5M seed to equip indie filmmakers with AI-powered VFX</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wonder Dynamics raises $2.5M seed to equip indie filmmakers with AI-powered VFX&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/wonder-dynamics-raises-2-5m-seed-to-equip-indie-filmmakers-with-ai-powered-vfx/embed/#?secret=521nwT9hCi" data-secret="521nwT9hCi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll know more when they debut the platform at SXSW in 2022, but until then skeptics might be comforted by the presence of Steven Spielberg and Joe Russo on its advisory board. Both are of course seasoned directors and picky about the looks of their films; Russo (and his brother Anthony Russo) in particular is known for preferring practical effects to CG where the latter is not absolutely required, so his support is notable.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we got deeper into our development we knew that this could be more than just software for Visual Effects,&#8221; said Sheridan in a press release. &#8220;Our platform can be used for film and TV, but also video games, social media content, and even the Metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latter provides additional justification for two of the new investors, Epic Games and Samsung Next. Horizon Ventures led the $10 million round, with seed round investors Founders Fund and MaC Venture Capital returning as well.</p>
