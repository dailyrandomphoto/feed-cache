										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UBITS, a B2B online learning platform for upskilling employees in Latin America, has raised $25 million in funding led by Riverwood Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julián Melo and Marta Forero founded UBITS in Bogota, Colombia, in 2018 after the pair came up with the idea of “creating the Netflix for corporate training for LatAm.” They applied to Y Combinator, raised a seed round, and went back to Colombia to create a program and courses that launched in January 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the beginning, we had 30 to 40 courses and the technically was not that good,” Melo admits. “Today, we have over 750 courses, which we believe is the largest catalog of corporate training available in Spanish today, as well as great features that help students apply what they learn.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257459" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also today has “very powerful dashboard,” according to Melo, where companies can track all the learning analytics and see the number of courses, completion rates, ranking of courses and a number of other metrics. UBITS is also working on further personalizing its offering so that each employee has his/her own training path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We get to help them grow individually and in their career,” Melo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two years, <a href="https://www.ubits.com/">UBITS</a> has grown its revenue by “more than 8x” and now works with hundreds of enterprises such as Mercado Libre, Siemens and Kimberly Clark. In 2021, revenue grew by “2.5x” and more than tripled its number of customers – from 110 to nearly 350. At the end of 2021, almost 100,000 students had used its platform, up from 28,000 the year prior. The startup has also partnered with Coursera to provide access to UBITS courses in the B2C market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to have over 1,000 enterprise and midmarket customers and more than 1 million students using the platform by the end of 2022, ” Melo told TechCrunch.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Riverwood, edtech-focused Owl Ventures (which led its $5 million Series A round last June), Endeavor Catalyst and Roble Ventures also participated in the financing. The company also received a strategic investment from Stanford University. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257465" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257465" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2257465 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> UBITS co-founders Marta Forero and Julián Melo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UBITS offers companies an annual subscription per user so that they pay to give their employees unlimited access to a virtual content library and live sessions. The employees can choose from lessons that focus on a range of skills – from soft to technical, such as leadership, sales and commercial capabilities, technology training and education, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also partners with “top local experts” to offer micro courses and live classes. As mentioned above, companies can then monitor and analyze KPIs and customize their employees’ learning journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re personalizing the experience with algorithms based on AI so that we can recommend adequate courses and content to each person depending on their behavior on the platform,” Melo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, UBITS has expanded to Mexico and Peru and in fact, it now has dual headquarters in Mexico, where its two co-founders now live. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, students have completed over 600,000 courses on its platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital to enhance “its proprietary content” and add more than 2,000 new courses, continue to build out AI-based functionalities and launch in new locations such as Chile, Spain and other Spanish-speaking markets. It also plans to double its team of 280 this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our main goal is to create more content, improve technology and hire more engineers and people creating content, as well as people in product development, sales and customer success. We want to not only bring more customers but also retain and expand them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Francisco Alvarez-Demalde, co-founder and managing partner of Riverwood Capital, believes UBITS has developed a “disruptive employee-centric corporate learning platform with an engaging Spanish language offering that includes much-needed content for employees to advance in their professional journey and grow with their companies, while improving retention, productivity, and business outcomes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federico Storani, executive director of Riverwood Capital, is joining UBITS’ board as part of the financing. He believes that one of the startup’s biggest strengths is that its “upskilling material is approachable and addresses a clear gap in the market for employees of all levels across enterprises and mid-market companies in the region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“LatAm has the largest skills gap in the world. We want to solve this problem to help people grow, so companies will grow, and there will be a better society and economy in the region,” said Melo. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venmo is introducing a new gift-wrapping feature to give users a new way to gift money to friends and family. The new feature is starting to roll out today and gives users access to eight animated gift-wrap designs that can be added to a payment note.</p>
<p>To use the new feature, users need to tap the &#8220;Pay or Request&#8221; button and add the recipient. From there, you can tap the gift-wrap icon and select the gift-wrap you&#8217;d like to send along with the payment. Once you&#8217;ve chosen a gift-wrap, you&#8217;ll have the option to preview the animation before confirming and sending the payment.</p>
<p>The recipient will then get a notification that they&#8217;ve received a gift in the app, where they&#8217;ll be able to unwrap the gift and see the animated design. Venmo says both the sender and recipient can rewatch the animation at any time from the payment details screen. The rollout of Venmo’s new gift-wrapping feature starts today for select customers and will be available for all users in the coming weeks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257406" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2257453" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257453" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2257453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257453" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Venmo</p></div></p>
<p>“The present emoji was one of the top ten emojis that customers used in their payment notes in 2021,&#8221; said Darrell Esch, the senior vice president and general manager at Venmo, in a statement. &#8220;We’re excited to introduce our new gift-wrapping feature to enhance this experience, enabling customers to celebrate with loved ones, no matter how big or small the moment.”</p>
<p>Venmo says 78% of users have indicated that they&#8217;ve sent money as a gift via Venmo or another person-to-person (P2P) payment service in the past year. The company says customers have been increasingly using Venmo to gift payments to others, not just for holidays or special occasions, but also as a way to show they’re thinking of them. It saw this behavior increase especially during the pandemic, as more than half of its customers who have gifted money through Venmo sent payments to say ‘thanks’ or ‘just because.’</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The launch of the new feature comes as Venmo underwent a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/venmo-removes-its-global-public-feed-in-a-significant-app-redesign/">major redesign</a> last year. The company no longer offers a public, global feed of users’ transactions, as part of a significant redesign focused on expanding the app’s privacy controls and better highlighting some of Venmo’s newer features. The company only shows users their “friends feed,&#8221; which is the app’s social feed where you can see just your friends’ transactions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Retailers often build their own “orchestration” platforms for payment processing and routing, but these can be complex to maintain. Spreedly and modo play in this space, and, last year, new startup Gr4vy launched in the US to do this in an even more fleet-of-foot manner, it claimed.</p>
<p>It raised in a $11.1M Series A last year to do that, but today it’s unveiled a further $15M in Series A extension funding, led by March Capital, taking its total Series A stage funding to $27.2M (including previous seed funding). The company claims this has now meant a doubling of its valuation to $115M.</p>
<p>The San Mateo-based startup also attracted participation from Nyca Partners, Activant Capital and Plug and Play Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257452" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Unusually for orchestration platforms, Gr4vy’s cloud-native payment orchestration platform (POP) also offers Instances, which provides merchants infrastructure in the Cloud. It now has partnerships with GoCardless, Banked and Akoova.</p>
<p>John Lunn, founder and CEO of Gr4vy told me: “The pandemic has made things difficult but has also been a massive opportunity because everything went online. A lot of companies and retailers’ systems weren&#8217;t prepared or fit for purpose. They went from processing 5% of their transactions online, and everything else in-store, to suddenly 100% online. So I think there&#8217;s been a huge advantage to the acceleration of digital partially caused by the pandemic.”</p>
<p>McKinsey projects that by 2025 global payments revenue will reach roughly $2.5T, and by 2024 e-commerce retail sales are expected to account for 21.8% of all retail sales worldwide.</p>
<p>Solomon Hailu, Partner of March Capital said: “Digital payments methods today come in more forms than ever before, resulting in merchants feeling overwhelmed… March is excited to partner with John and the Gr4vy team as they help merchants simplify and manage payment infrastructure via a cloud-native, easy-to-use, orchestration platform at a time when ecommerce strategy is mission-critical.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instacart is introducing a new &#8220;Ready Meals&#8221; hub to make it easier for users to discover and order ready-made meals from grocery stores on its app. The on-demand grocery delivery platform has <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/updates/introducing-instacart-meals-a-new-product-for-grocers-consumers/">offered</a> ready-made meals since January 2020 but says the option was not as visible or prominent in its app, which is why it&#8217;s launching the new hub. With the launch of the in-app destination, Instacart is now adding priority delivery to all ready-made meal orders, which means some orders will be delivered from grocery stores in as fast as 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Customers can use the Ready Meals hub to order prepared food from grocery stores like Publix, Giant, Food Lion, Hannaford, Stop &amp; Shop, Martin’s, and Kroger. Ready-made meals from ShopRite will also be featured in the hub in the coming weeks. The prepared meals include salads, sandwiches, soups, sushi, rotisserie chicken and more.</p>
<p>“From fresh soups and salads for a quick lunch to take-and-bake casseroles, pasta dishes and meat and seafood entrees for the family dinner, we’re proud to serve as a powerful enablement partner for retailers, creating new ways for them to give busy people and families across the U.S. more ways to shop smart, eat healthy and feed their cravings faster than ever before,&#8221; said Daniel Danker, the head of product at Instacart, in a statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257065" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement follows Instacart’s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/instacart-is-acquiring-catering-software-company-foodstorm/">acquisition</a> of FoodStorm, a SaaS order management system (OMS) that powers end-to-end order-ahead and catering experiences for grocery retailers. Instacart says that in addition to expanding FoodStorm&#8217;s technology to new partners on the Instacart Marketplace, it also plans to expand the Ready Meals hub to feature more grocers.</p>
<p>The rollout of the Ready Meals hub comes as Instacart <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/updates/introducing-kroger-delivery-now-and-the-instacart-convenience-hub/">launched</a> its Convenience hub in September 2021. The convenience hub allows users to place orders for common convenience items, like snacks and essentials, with a faster delivery time. The company also recently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instacart-rolls-out-reduced-and-free-delivery-option-in-select-markets-deals-tab-and-more/"> launched</a> a new Dollar hub, which allows users to browse dollar store deals from more than 13,000 dollar stores, including Dollar Tree, 99 Cents Only Store, Five Below and Family Dollar.</p>
<p>Instacart says it has ambitious goals for the future and the new year after it had a record year in 2021. The company saw record daily and weekly order volume during the busiest holiday season in its history. Instacart says orders grew by 30% year-over-year and that its convenience business has more than doubled since June. The company says it plans to continue to unlock new ways for retailers to engage users on its platform in the future.</p>

<p>There are a handful of new pet veterinary services out there, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/bond-vet-stitches-up-170-million-from-warburg-pincus/">Bond Vet</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/small-door-the-onemedical-for-pets-launches-nyc-location/">Small Door</a>, and pet food companies have gotten into the mix in a real way, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/the-farmers-dog-a-customized-pet-food-subscription-service-scoops-up-8-1-million/">Farmer&#8217;s Dog</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/spot-tango-with-4-2-million-in-seed-funding-launch-unkibble/">Spot &amp; Tango</a> to name a few.</p>
<p><a href="https://fablepets.com/">Fable</a>, on the other hand, is thinking about the accessories a pup parent needs to stay sane in an urban environment, including collars, leashes, crates, and toys. The company just raised $9 million in Series A, led by 14W, with participation from Female Founders Fund and Slow Ventures. And that fresh cash shows that its plan to build dog accessories that work together as an ecosystem is a smart one.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The New York-based startup is riding the waves of both pandemic-fueled puppy purchasing and the trend in how millennials take care of their pets. Like, you know, living breathing companions.</p>
<p>But rather than focus solely on the pets themselves, Fable also makes a conscious effort to think of the pet parent, as well.</p>
<p>Fables products are all designed to make caring for a pet easier and more aesthetically pleasing, to boot.</p>
<p>The company launched with a collar and a leash, and then evolved to a new kind of hands-free leash called the Magic Link. Anyone who has tried to multitask getting coffee and walking the dog at the same time can quickly realize the value in a hands-free leash.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257431" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257431" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?w=680" alt="Fable Magic Link" width="680" height="454" class="size-large wp-image-2257431" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg 8192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257431" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fable Pets</p></div></p>
<p>Fable then expanded to other use-cases around caring for a dog, including a crate that can double as an side table by the bed, a dog bowl, a poop bag dispenser (that is durable enough to not need replacing after a few months) and, importantly, toys.</p>
<p>In fact, Fable&#8217;s best selling product is a game aptly called The Game. I have one for my puppy that has been an actual godsend.</p>
<p>The Game has a weighted bottom and a silicon frame wherein you can put up to a cup of kibble or treats. Inside, there is a sliding mechanism that lets you set the difficulty for your dog. From there, the pup activates both their play and their prey drive and can stay occupied for quite some time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had other treat-dispensing toys for my puppy, including puzzles and balls, that are either too easy for him (earns me five minutes) or are cheap and super loud. The Game seems to solve for those two problems.</p>
<p>Fable also released a toy called the Falcon, which dispenses treats through a small slot that the puppy has to squeeze to make open. Falcon is good on its own, but you can chain together multiple Falcons to create different, more difficult games for your little gal or guy.</p>
<p>All of these products are designed to look good in a small space, with matching earth and jewel tone coloring.</p>
<p>This is where the real genius of Fable lies.</p>
<p>One product leads to another. Once you&#8217;ve purchased the essentials &#8212; a collar and leash &#8212; it makes sense to buy a matching toy or poop bag dispenser from a now-trusted brand. If your dog loves The Game, why not buy the Falcon? Why not buy two? And if you have a Falcon, did you know it can hang down on the inside of the Crate so your dog can stay busy and stimulated in there? And while you&#8217;re at it, why not get a matching bowl?</p>
<p>But Fable isn&#8217;t resting there. The company is thinking not only of new use cases to add into the portfolio, but ways to enhance existing products. For example, sibling founders Jeremy Canade and Sophie Bakalar, described plans to sell an add-on to the Crate. (Right now, it has no drawer or compartment for storing human stuff.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257432" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257432" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-1.png?w=680" alt="Fable The Crate" width="680" height="357" class="size-large wp-image-2257432" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-1.png 728w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-1.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-1.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-1.png?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257432" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fable Pets</p></div></p>
<p>Canade also hinted at a different insert for The Game that would change the difficulty of the toy for the dog.</p>
<p>Planned obsolescence isn&#8217;t part of the strategy here, but rather, what else can the company offer to enhance existing products while releasing new ones?</p>
<p>The startup has had quite a bit of success using this strategy.</p>
<p>In 2021, there have been more than 20,000 people on the waitlist for the Crate, and Fable sold a unit of The Game every five to ten minutes over the holidays.</p>
<p>Overall, the business grew approximately 3x year over year, according to the team.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t hurt, either, that people naturally love sharing content around their dogs. The organic marketing around products like the Magic Link and The Game has helped spread the word tremendously, according to Canade and Bakalar.</p>
<p>Fable&#8217;s price point leans more toward the premium end of the Spectrum. The Crate stands out specifically at $395 &mdash; you can pick up a crate on Amazon or PetCo for $40. But Bakalar explained that the pricing depends on how you benchmark the products themselves. The Crate, for example, is also a bedside table, so when comparing it to prices at West Elm or Restoration Hardware, it&#8217;s much more in line.</p>
<p>The Game is $55, the Magic Link is $65, and the Waste Bag Holder is $35, to give you some idea of the range for pricing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those [competing] products are designed to be thrown away in the short term and to be remodeled,&#8221; said Canade. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to actually rethink the products from scratch and make things that are both for the animal and the human. They&#8217;re meant to live in both those worlds simultaneously. Nobody is doing that. Everybody is either designing only for the human, with a quality grade that is not meant to stand up to the wear and tear of a dog, or only for a dog, [that doesn&#8217;t fit into the use cases of a human].&#8221;</p>
<p>(The audio on my transcript was terrible for the end of this quote. Waiting on clarification from Canade and will update when I hear back.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As competition amid digital banks heats up, U.S. fintech <a href="https://current.com/">Current</a> is rolling out a new product designed to make its banking service more appealing. The company announced this morning it&#8217;s launching a new high-yield offering called &#8220;Interest&#8221; that allows any Current account holder to earn a 4.00% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) &#8212; a rate that&#8217;s 60x higher than the national average, it notes.</p>
<p>The Interest offering will be made available to all Current users, including those on Current&#8217;s free Basic plan as well as Premium users who pay to access upgraded features. (The latter group also likely helps Current be able to afford to boost its APY, in fact, as Premium <a href="https://support.current.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408091015195-What-types-of-accounts-does-Current-offer-#basic-account-no-monthly-fee--0-1">subscribers pay</a> $4.99 per month for Current&#8217;s expanded service.)</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s common for neobanks to offer a higher APY than traditional banks, many banking services require users to jump through hoops to reach the higher rate. For example, <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/">One Finance</a> offers a 1.00% APY in its &#8220;Save&#8221; product on funds up to $5,000, but to get its higher 3.00% rate, you have to set up the auto-savings feature. Aspiration and Varo also offer a 3.00% APY, but <a href="https://my.aspiration.com/faq/Spend---Save%3EAspiration-Save%3EWhat-interest-rates-are-offered-for-Aspiration-Save-">have their own requirements</a> around spending, <a href="https://www.varomoney.com/savings-account/">balances, total direct deposits</a>, and more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257375" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Current&#8217;s new offering, however, pays out on funds up to a total of $6,000 annually, the company says. It also notes there is no minimum balance required and no direct deposit or spending requirement. However, what makes its product different is that all members will be able to earn interest on their funds on a daily basis. (Typically, banks pay the interest monthly.)</p>
<p>Plus, the catch on Current&#8217;s product is that the $6,000 total has to be spread across its Savings Pods. So the APY is earned on up to $2,000 per pod. That makes it more of a viable choice for customers just starting to save and who want to organize their money into different groupings, rather than someone looking to park a larger balance.</p>

<p>Current tells TechCrunch it&#8217;s not introducing this high-yield product at a higher rate which it aims to bring down later, over time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not approaching this as a promotional rate,&#8221; explains Current VP of Product, Josh Stephens. &#8220;We&#8217;re approaching it as something that&#8217;s available for the all the foreseeable future&#8230;I think, certainly, you see promotional rates from other folks out there with a lot of bells and whistles attached to it. But this is something that&#8217;s available for anyone, with no balance minimum, no fees,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The company also sees the rate as a way to better promote its banking service in a crowded landscape. Current, which got its start as a teen banking service, expanded over the years to offer a more competitive product for adults &#8212; including those without kids. Like many digital banking services, Current offers perks like fee-free overdrafts, cashback, fee-free ATMs, faster direct deposits, automated savings, money management tools, and more. With Interest&#8217;s launch, it&#8217;s now responding to customer demands for better savings products, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inflation has been rising at one of the highest rates in 40 years over the last couple of months. [The Consumer Price Index] has been rising at the fastest pace since the early 80s,&#8221; says Stephens. &#8220;And for our members &#8212; and for a lot of Americans &#8212; this meant their money just isn&#8217;t going as far as they need. That means they&#8217;re paying more for the same goods and services. It&#8217;s making it harder to put money aside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Current believes the existing options on the market make it difficult for banking customers to meaningfully grow their money.</p>
<p>The change could encourage some banking customers who have their funds parked in savings elsewhere to move over to Current&#8217;s service instead. Over time, they may upgrade to premium Current products and services, making the higher APY worth it from a business perspective.</p>
<p>Today, Current has over 3 million members, free and paid, with an average age of 27 among its member base &#8212; younger than many competitors.</p>
<p>Longer-term, the company plans to roll out more offerings to help these customers further grow their money. It&#8217;s planning to enter the crypto space, having last year <a href="https://current.com/blog/current-acala-announce-partnership-establish-new-category-of-hybrid-finance/">announced a partnership</a> with Acala to create a new category of &#8220;hybrid finance&#8221; which will combine the benefits of traditional banking and decentralized finance. Consumer lending is also on its roadmap.</p>
<p>Current&#8217;s new Interest product will begin to roll out today across iOS and Android.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A New York bill that would ban state law enforcement from obtaining residents&#8217; private user data from tech giants through the use of controversial search warrants will get another chance, two years after it was first introduced.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/A84">Reverse Location Search Prohibition Act</a> was reintroduced to the New York Assembly and Senate last year by a group of Democratic lawmakers after the bill previously failed to pass. Last week, the bill was referred to committee, the first major hurdle before it can be considered for a floor vote.</p>
<p>The bill, if passed, would be the first state law in the U.S. to end the use of geofence warrants and keyword search warrants, which rely on asking technology companies to turn over data about users who were near the scene of a crime or searched for particular keywords at a specific point in time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257402" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For geofence warrants — also known as &#8220;reverse location&#8221; warrants — law enforcement asks a judge to order Google, which collects and stores billions of location data points from its users&#8217; phones and apps, to turn over records on whose phones were in a certain geographical radius at the time of a crime to help identify possible suspects. Geofence warrants are a uniquely Google problem; law enforcement knows to tap Google&#8217;s databases of location data, which the search giant uses to drive its ads business, last year netting the company close to $150 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar process for Google searches; law enforcement asks a judge for a warrant to demand that Google turns over <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/google-is-giving-data-to-police-based-on-search-keywords-court-docs-show/">who searched for certain keywords</a> during a particular window of time. Although less publicly known, keyword search warrants are in growing use and aren&#8217;t limited to just Google; Microsoft and Yahoo (which owns TechCrunch) have <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/10/04/google-keyword-warrants-give-us-government-data-on-search-users/?sh=376f6d797c97">also been tapped</a> for user data using this kind of legal process.</p>
<p>The use of these warrants has been called &#8220;fishing expeditions&#8221; by internet rights groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which recently <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/01/standing-privacy-new-york-state">lent its support</a> to the New York bill, along with <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/en/news/dragnet-warrants-are-trapping-innocent-people">the ACLU</a>. Critics say these kinds of warrants are unconstitutionally broad and invasive because they invariably collect data on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/minneapolis-protests-geofence-warrant/">nearby innocent people</a> with no connection to the crime.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported last year that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/minneapolis-protests-geofence-warrant/">Minneapolis police used a geofence warrant</a> to identify protesters accused of sparking violence in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. Similar encounters reported by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761">NBC News</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/16/geofence-warrants-reverse-search-warrants-police-google">The Guardian</a> revealed how entirely innocent people have been tacitly accused of criminality simply for being close to the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/google-geofence-warrants/">data published by Google</a>, geofence warrants make up about one-quarter of all U.S. legal demands it receives. Since Google became widely known among law enforcement as a source for connecting location data and search terms to real-world suspects, Google processed more than 11,500 geofence warrants in 2020, up from less than a thousand in 2018 when the practice was still in its relative infancy.</p>
<p>New York state accounted for about 2-3 percent of all geofence warrants, amounting to hundreds of warrants in total.</p>
<p>Zellnor Myrie, a New York state senator who represents central Brooklyn and sponsored the senate bill, told TechCrunch: &#8220;In dense, urban communities like the ones I represent in Brooklyn, hundreds or thousands of innocent people who merely live or walk near a crime scene could be ensnared by a geofence warrant that would turn over their private location data. And keyword search warrants would identify users who have searched for a specific term, name or location. Our bill would ban these types of warrants and protect New Yorkers&#8217; privacy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.stoik.io">Stoïk</a>, a new French startup that wants to protect small and medium companies against cybersecurity incidents. The company offers an insurance product as well as a service that monitors your attack surface.</p>
<p>The startup recently raised a $4.3 million (€3.8 million) seed round from Alven Capital, Anthemis Group, Kima Ventures as well as several business angels, such as Raphaël Vullierme, Emmanuel Schalit and Henry Kravis.</p>
<p>Stoïk targets SMEs specifically as they are quite vulnerable when it comes to ransomware and other cyber attacks. And yet, small companies often aren’t doing enough to protect their software infrastructure.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257383" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We’re going to insure you and protect you,” co-founder and CEO Jules Veyrat told me. “But what we’re going to sell is the insurance product. If you get attacked, you have a phone number that you can call 24/7 and all the cost implications are insured.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Stoïk is going to offer monitoring tools so that small companies can fix vulnerabilities in their infrastructure. In that case, incentives between Stoïk and Stoïk’s clients remain aligned.</p>
<p>The team of 15 have already signed partnerships with insurance companies to design the insurance products. Stoïk sells insurance products and charges its clients directly — it takes a cut on each contract. It works with a third-party company called <a href="https://www.inquest-risk.com">Inquest</a> to handle crisis management.</p>
<p>Stoïk works a bit like <a href="https://www.coalitioninc.com">Coalition</a> in the U.S., except that it doesn’t partner with brokers to distribute its insurance product. The French startup wants to build a direct relationship with its customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for the tech product, when you sign up to the service, you enter your domain name and start a scan. Stoïk looks at DNS records, finds IP addresses and scans online databases for password leaks associated with this domain name.</p>
<p>You get a score and several tips to improve that score. For instance, Stoïk can tell you that some services are externally exposed even though they shouldn&#8217;t be. If your score is above a certain threshold and if you generate less than €50 million in annual revenue, you can subscribe to the insurance product.</p>
<p>The company is currently in the pre-launch phase with contracts that range from €50 to €400 per month. Up next, it plans to add more features to its monitoring service. For instance, Stoïk wants to scan internal accounts. You could imagine scanning your Amazon Web Services configuration to spot some vulnerabilities. And that should also help when it comes to closing new contracts with potential customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies use invoices to pay for many of their major costs, ranging from materials to contract work. Most still rely on solutions built on top of bank transfers or credit cards to complete cross-border payments, which </span><a href="https://gocardless.com/en-us/guides/posts/international-bank-transfer-times/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically take 2-5 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to complete and </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/accelerating-winds-of-change-in-global-payments"><span style="font-weight: 400;">represent a $130 trillion global market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise payments startup <a href="https://paysail.us/">Paysail</a> just raised seed funding to build a tool that shortens the cross-border payment process to less than five seconds, the company says. Its solution leverages stablecoins, which it describes as “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price because they are pegged to a commodity or currency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using stablecoins to pay invoices also reduces transaction fees for businesses by removing third-party intermediaries, according to Paysail. Other startups in the space using traditional banking infrastructure to make payments more efficient have hit a ceiling on how fast and cheap they can offer payments because fees charged by these intermediaries, particularly between countries that don’t transact as regularly, Paysail cofounder Nicole Alonso told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2256921" style="width: 376px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256921" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2256921" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="366" height="274" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg 5120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256921" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Paysail cofounders Nicole Alonso and Liam Brennan-Burke. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Paysail</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There have been enormous strides in making payments between, let&#8217;s say, the US and Canada, significantly cheaper and quicker. But if you&#8217;re sending a payment from the US to [a country in] Africa, it could still be really difficult and cost exorbitant fees,” Alonso said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of making a cross-border payment using legacy systems like Bill.com usually includes a transaction fee charged by the third-party intermediary as well as a currency exchange fee. A transfer done through Paysail, in contrast, costs only a “gas fee” it takes for the transaction to be validated on the blockchain, currently less than one-tenth of a cent, Alonso said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paysail is currently using Celo’s CUSD stablecoin, which tracks the price of the U.S. dollar, to enable payments and plans to expand to other stablecoins backed by different countries’ fiat currencies as it grows. It is also evaluating a transaction fee of around 0.9% to generate revenue for the business, which Alonso said could be structured as a tiered offering based on each company’s transaction volume and will ideally “significantly undercut any existing competitors in the non-crypto space” on price. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company announced its $4 million seed round today </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">led by Uncork Capital, with support from Tribe Capital, Pear VC and Mischief Capital. Angel investors Nik Milanović, head of business development and strategy at Google Pay, and Juan Manuel Fernández Lobato, founder and CEO of Ebury, also participated in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paysail’s current users comprise “a small cohort” of companies, most of which are already transacting in cryptocurrency or are familiar with the space, Alonso co-founder Liam Brennan-Burke told TechCrunch. The company wants to fine-tune its solution for crypto-native customers before expanding to those that have no prior crypto experience, Brennan-Burke added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alonso and Brennan-Burke, who launched Paysail after meeting as students at Claremont McKenna College last year, are Paysail’s only full-time employees today. They plan to use their funding to hire a full-time engineering team, as well as legal counsel and eventually a sales team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paysail is building its tech to allow users who don’t have an existing crypto wallet to start transacting on its platform by generating a noncustodial wallet on users’ behalf through a third-party wallet provider. It aims to eventually bring this functionality in-house and add new features within the Paysail wallet like allowing users to earn yield on their stablecoin holdings, Brennan-Burke said. In countries like Nigeria, where local fiat currency depreciation poses a significant risk, companies may prefer to hold their wealth in stablecoins pegged to less volatile currencies and transfer it into local fiat on their own timeline, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The goal ultimately with the platform is to continue making cryptocurrency payments really digestible and easy to use, and not so daunting for those businesses and individuals who don&#8217;t have any prior experience with it,” Brennan-Burke said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As cloud infrastructure projects grow increasingly complex, there&#8217;s been a trend in the industry to launch pre-packaged solutions for specific verticals. Today, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">well-funded</a> data analytics firm Databricks is joining the fray with its first vertical-specific solution: Lakehouse for Retail. The promise here is to offer a fully integrated platform that can help retailers extract value from the vast volumes of data they generate, be that through traditional analytics or by leveraging Databricks&#8217; AI tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an important milestone on our journey to help organizations operate in real-time, deliver more accurate analysis, and leverage all of their customer <span class="il">data</span> to uncover valuable insights,&#8221; said Databricks CEO and co-founder Ali Ghodsi. &#8220;Lakehouse for Retail will empower <span class="il">data</span>-driven collaboration and sharing across businesses and partners in the retail industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the early adopters for the platform include the likes of Walgreens, Columbia and H&amp;M Group. These users get access to the full Databricks platform, but also &#8212; and most importantly &#8212; a set of Lakehouse for Retail Solution Accelerators that offer what Databricks calls a &#8220;blueprint of <span class="il">data</span> analytics and machine learning use cases and best practices&#8221; which can ideally save new users months of development time. These include templates for real-time streaming data ingestion, demand forecasting, recommendation engines and tools for measuring customer lifetime value. It&#8217;s worth noting that Databricks previously offered <a href="https://databricks.com/solutions/accelerators">similar blueprints</a>, but customers had to assemble these for themselves instead of Databricks offering them as part of an integrated solution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257320" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;With hundreds of millions of prescriptions processed by Walgreens each year, <span class="il">Databricks</span>’ Lakehouse for Retail allows us to unify all of this <span class="il">data</span> and store it in one place for a full range of analytics and ML workloads,&#8221; said Luigi Guadagno, Vice President, Pharmacy and HealthCare Platform Technology at Walgreens. &#8220;By eliminating complex and costly legacy <span class="il">data</span> silos, we’ve enabled cross-domain collaboration with an intelligent, unified <span class="il">data</span> platform that gives us the flexibility to adapt, scale and better serve our customers and patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the course of the last few years, Databricks has been trying to popularize the concept of the &#8216;lakehouse.&#8217; which combines the best of data warehouses for analytics and data lakes for storing vast amounts of raw data that has yet to be operationalized.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Serve Robotics, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/uber-spins-out-delivery-robot-startup-as-serve-robotics/">Uber spinout that builds sidewalk delivery robots</a>, is deploying its next generation of robots that are capable of completing some commercial deliveries without a human in the loop, according to the startup. That means in certain operational design domains, or geofenced areas, Serve won&#8217;t be relying on remote operators to teleassist robots or followers to trail behind the robots for safety.</p>
<p>Most companies in the industry, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/driveu-auto-to-power-remote-piloting-of-easymiles-autonomous-shuttles-cocos-sidewalk-robots/">Coco</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/starship-technologies-is-bringing-food-delivery-robots-to-four-more-us-college-campuses-this-year/">Starship Technologies</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/kiwibot-partners-with-hospitality-giant-sodexo-to-bring-food-delivery-robots-to-college-campuses/">Kiwibot</a>, lean on remote operators to monitor autonomous deliveries and take over driving in case the robot stops or needs help, so Serve&#8217;s milestone is indeed a step toward progress in robotic deliveries.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The problem we have solved is that relying on teleoperation for safety means you must count on 100% reliable LTE networks and 100% mistake-free operators, both of which are impossible to achieve consistently,&#8221; Ali Kashani, co-founder and CEO of Serve, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Consider what happens when a safety situation requires human attention, but the video is delayed or the connection has dropped? With Level 4 robots, humans are not needed to be in the loop to ensure safety.&#8221;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257117" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Serve began rolling out its next generation of robots in December and says it recently completed its first delivery at Level 4 autonomy, which <a href="https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-%E2%80%9Clevels-of-driving-automation%E2%80%9D-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAE defines</a> as a system that can drive autonomously as long as certain conditions are met and will not require a human to take over driving. The startup&#8217;s robots currently have L4 capabilities in some neighborhoods in Los Angeles, such as Hollywood, where Serve has been operating since 2018, Kashani said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the robot is in a given area where Level 4 is enabled, <span style="font-weight: 400;">the remote video feed turns off and the robot continues navigating autonomously without requiring a human in the loop,&#8221; Kashani told TechCrunch. &#8220;The robots can always request assistance if in need of one, say if they come across something unexpected. They also turn video on while crossing intersections. But for the majority of the time they operate autonomously.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Until autonomous vehicles reach Level 5 capability, under which the system can operate in all conditions without a human, there will always be a long tail of edge cases that robots are unfamiliar with. Relying on humans for those makes sense from both a safety and commercialization perspective, said Kashani.</p>
<p>Serve&#8217;s new robots are equipped with a range of active sensors, like ultrasonics and lidar sensors from Ouster, and passive sensors like cameras to help navigate busy sidewalks. The startup has developed specific capabilities for its bots, like automatic crash prevention, vehicle collision avoidance and fail-safe emergency braking, according to the company. The computations needed to produce those capabilities in real-time are powered by chip-maker Nvidia&#8217;s Jetson platform, which is designed specifically for robots and other autonomous machines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/uber-spinout-serve-robotics-gets-13m-seed-round-to-expand-sidewalk-robot-deliveries/">a $13 million expanded seed round last month</a>, which it said would be used to fund accelerated expansion plans into new customer segments and geographic areas. In line with those stated goals, Kashani said Serve&#8217;s next steps are to deploy its next-gen robots in more areas, starting with expanding in Los Angeles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we’ve learned in the last few years, ‘human error’-led cyber security breaches are the ones companies often find it hardest to guard against. Surveys suggest some 85% of attacks can be traced back to the human factor. Thus startups built to alleviate this gap — such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/cybsafe-raises-7-9m-series-a-led-by-iq-capital-for-its-behavioral-cybersecurity-platform/">the UK’s Cybsafe</a> which raises $7-9m last year — are proliferating. Addressing human behavior is clearly one of the hottest new areas for cyber.</p>
<p>The latest to scale up in this space is <a href="https://sosafe-awareness.com/">SoSafe</a>. The Cologne-based cybersecurity awareness and testing platform has now raised a $73 million Series B funding round led by growth-capital fund Highland Europe.</p>
<p>Existing investors Acton Capital and Global Founders Capital were joined by SAP Hybris founder and Celonis Advisory Board member Carsten Thoma together with La Famiglia as well as Adjust founder Christian Henschel as participants.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257368" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>SoSafe competes with platforms like Knowbe4 (that went public in 2021) and Cofense which has raised $58M to date.</p>
<p>SoSafe says it takes a user-centered approach to cyber security, using insights from behavioral science to nudge users in the right, and safer, direction, using gamified methods to teach end-users what to look out for in a cyber-attack.</p>
<p>It now has over 1,500 customers including Aldi, Ceconomy AG, Taylor Wessing, Vattenfall and Valtech.</p>
<p>Dr. Niklas Hellemann, co-founder and managing director of SoSafe, said: “Challenging the existing paradigms in security awareness and human risk management, we have seen tremendous adoption of our platform and extraordinary growth.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lead investor Highland Europe has previously backed security companies such as Malwarebytes, Cobalt, and ActiveFence.</p>
<p>Gajan Rajanathan, partner at Highland Europe, said: “SoSafe’s founders have built a trusted cybersecurity awareness and testing platform, underpinned by behavioral analytics and human risk scoring that sustainably protects the most important threat surface in cybersecurity – human security breaches. They have rapidly emerged as one of the leading software scale-ups, experiencing incredible momentum in a short period of time.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting an e-commerce business on one of the large marketplaces, for example, Shopify, can be an easy process, but what the team at <a href="https://www.swell.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swell</a> began to notice was that the model could only take a business so far.</p>
<p>Swell is working in “headless” commerce, which means it is disconnecting the front end of a website, aka the storefront, from the back end, where all of the data lives, to create a better shopping experience and so that anything on the back end can be updated and maintained without disturbing the front end.</p>
<p>The remote-first company offers APIs, storefronts and a dashboard, all tools that can grow with any sized company. The first version of Swell was a pure API for developers, but it wasn’t enabling businesses to get up-and-running quickly, so businesses were turning to marketplaces like Shopify, CEO Eric Ingram told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257099" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The key is getting started quickly, which Shopify is awesome at, but you realize you are stuck when you try to do more than the basic model,” Ingram said. “We needed to build something that was as easy as Shopify, but enabled you to grow. Most people can’t afford to build their own back end, so we also wanted to provide something people could do without spending millions of dollars.”</p>
<p>Swell was an idea Ingram had about a decade ago that stemmed from his experience at e-commerce company Digital River and then building a few of his own businesses, including a clothing company. He and his team got things off the ground in 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/">raising $3.4 million in a seed round</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZJmcujxGcF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/">Headless commerce startup Swell raises $3.4M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Headless commerce startup Swell raises $3.4M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/embed/#?secret=ZJmcujxGcF" data-secret="ZJmcujxGcF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nearly a year later, the company is back again with $20 million in Series A funding, led by VMG Catalyst and Headline, with participation from Bonfire Ventures, Willow Growth, Commerce Ventures and Red Antler. Individual investors include Attentive CEO Brian Long, Gorgias CEO Romain Lapeyre, Remote First Capital and former CTO of Product Hunt Andreas Klinger, Fast.co CEO Domm Holland and Warby Parker’s Brian Magida.</p>
<p>The opportunity for additional funding was somewhat unexpected, according to Ingram, but he feels like Swell’s focus on small and mid-market companies, while building an ecosystem and community, separates it from competitors like Commercetools and Fabric that are targeting larger companies.</p>

<p>“To solve the problem, it has to be something accessible to everyone rather than just big companies with big budgets,” Ingram added. “Some of the platforms are only good at one thing, but there are hundreds of other models out there.”</p>
<p>In the past year, Swell grew five times in revenue and grew its customer base to over 1,000 at the end of 2021 after starting the year with 30 customers. It also created a free community plan, where customers begin paying when they start selling, to go with the standard and enterprise options.</p>
<p>Ingram expects to use the new funding to grow Swell’s team of 30 to 100 in the next 12 months and in product development, including building an app ecosystem. Plans include building out a framework for third parties to build the apps and also for customers to be able to own their own data on the back end and do more with it, something that is difficult for businesses building on marketplaces to do, he said.</p>
<p>“A core feature will be a configurable database that could adapt to new use cases,” he added. “The market is moving fast with integrations and building apps and the community will require 10 times more people to get to the next level.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When the consumer opens an account and hits savings milestones for products they want to buy from their favorite brands, they can receive cash contributions from the brands.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buy now, pay later has grown to be an alternative to credit cards, with the trend generating <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2021/09/07/buy-now-pay-later-the-new-payments-trend-generating-100-billion-in-sales/?sh=451825602ffe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$100 billion in sales last year</a>, more than four times 2020. However, even with the spread out payments, debt accumulation is not easing, causing the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-opens-inquiry-into-buy-now-pay-later-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to now look into the practice</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.accruesavings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accrue Savings</a>, founded in June 2021 by CEO Michael Hershfield, aims to get people saving again with its merchant-embedded shopping experience that rewards consumers for saving up for the things they want to buy.</p>
<p>After raising $4.7 million, the company launched in late 2021 with its product that enables merchants to provide additional payment options. Hershfield told TechCrunch that he isn’t out to replace buy now, pay later (BNPL), but be a way for brands to help people save up for items while also attracting and retaining customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257088" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2257092" style="width: 581px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257092" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2257092 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Michael-Hershfield_Accrue-Savings_CEO-e1642026303914.jpg?w=571" alt="Michael Hershfield, Accrue Savings" width="571" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257092" class="wp-caption-text">Michael Hershfield, CEO of Accrue Savings. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Accrue Savings</p></div></p>
<p>“Brands have tremendous influence, and while there is a deep misnomer that Americans don’t save, our own research shows that people were actually saving more during the pandemic,” he added. “How Americans save can now be tied to a brand. We, as a society, need to offer better savings tools, and it needs to be on a merchant’s website.”</p>
<p>Accrue Savings embeds the savings feature on a retailer’s website, enabling merchants to also put the feature in targeted email or SMS campaigns. When the consumer opens an account and hits savings milestones, they can receive FDIC-insured cash contributions from brands.</p>
<p>Because saving can take time, Hershfield felt it was too early to disclose growth metrics, but said that in its short existence, the company has racked up a customer list that includes Allbirds, Casper, Poly &amp; Bark, Smile Direct Club and Tire Agent. It initially went live with 15 customers, and he teased that the list is expected to double in the coming months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, Accrue Savings announced $25 million in a Series A funding round led by Tiger Global, with participation from Aglaé Ventures and Maple VC, existing investors Twelve Below, Box Group, Red Sea Ventures, Ground Up Ventures, Good Friends and Silas Capital Ventures, and a group of individual investors, including UPS CEO Carol Tomé, Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin.</p>
<p>“Accrue Savings helps brands reach more customers and gives consumers a responsible purchasing option. It’s a win-win,” said Alex Cook, partner of Tiger Global, in a written statement. “Michael and the Accrue Savings team are building a unique platform and we’re thrilled to partner with them on the next stage of the journey.”</p>
<p>The new capital infusion brings the company’s total funding to nearly $30 million to date. Hershfield plans to expand retail partnerships and add employees across all departments, including engineering, sales and marketing. It has 14 employees right now, and he is looking to be around 65 employees by the end of the year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Merchants can add “return assurance” to an order, if it is returned in the next 30 days, Seel, instead of the merchant, will pay for the refund.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Product returns remain a headache for many e-commerce companies. Some have gotten creative in how they approach it — for example, Amazon formed relationships with Kohl’s and Stein Mart for in-person returns, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/paypal-acquires-returns-logistics-business-happy-returns/">PayPal acquired returns provider Happy Returns</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257082" style="width: 568px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257082" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2257082" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Picture1.png?w=558" alt="Seel" width="558" height="525" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Picture1.png 558w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Picture1.png?resize=150,141 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Picture1.png?resize=300,282 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Picture1.png?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257082" class="wp-caption-text">Seel&#8217;s return option example. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Seel</p></div></p>
<p>Aiming to give merchants more control over this, <a href="https://www.seel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seel</a>, which focuses on underwriting e-commerce returns, is leveraging artificial intelligence to build proprietary underwriting software that uses hundreds of signals to predict the probability of return as soon as an order is placed, co-founder Zack Peng told TechCrunch via email.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257072" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After an order is sold, merchants can add “return assurance” to that order and transfer the liability of return to Seel. If the order is returned in the next 30 days, Seel, instead of the merchant, will pay for the refunds, he said. Shoppers themselves can add the assurance for a small fee at checkout to make items, like ones the merchant isn’t offering the service, returnable.</p>
<p>“Merchants typically won’t know their true revenue until the return window expires six to eight weeks after an order is sold,” he said. “That means they often have to reconcile refunds, correct financials and adjust marketing plans for orders sold weeks ago. Instead, they can pay a variable return assurance fee when an order is sold, and instantly lock in the net revenue and streamline a significant amount of revenue operations.”</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/u-s-e-commerce-on-track-for-its-first-1-trillion-year-by-2022-due-to-lasting-pandemic-impacts/">U.S. e-commerce market</a> poised to be a $1 trillion industry by the end of this year, Peng says between 10% and 30% of merchandise is returned, with merchants continuing to take on the financial risk of managing the logistics.</p>
<p>He believes with an industry growing that big Seel could one day underwrite over $100 billion in returns and refunds annually.</p>
<p>The company has been around for two years, and while its private beta started five months ago, Peng said Seel has close to 200 merchants using its software, ranging from boutiques to marketplaces. It is also seeing 20% of shoppers adding the assurance to their orders, which translates to a 5% conversion lift for merchants, he added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257081" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257081" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2257081" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Picture2.png?w=680" alt="Seel" width="680" height="315" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Picture2.png 977w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Picture2.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Picture2.png?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Picture2.png?resize=768,355 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Picture2.png?resize=680,315 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Picture2.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257081" class="wp-caption-text">Seel&#8217;s team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Seel</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It is now launching its Shopify app, buoyed by $17 million in Series A funding led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Existing investors participating include Foundation Capital, Afore Capital and West Loop Ventures.</p>
<p>“Seel sits at the intersection between fintech and e-commerce, and both markets are growing rapidly with strong secular trends,” Peng said. “With Lightspeed being an early and committed investor in Affirm and Justin (Overdorff)’s background from Stripe, the round was a perfect fit. Seel wants to build a strong fintech brand in underwriting the way that Stripe is in payments and Affirm is in credit.”</p>
<p>The new capital will be used to grow the team, strengthen the product and build out its go-to-market strategy. Seel has raised $24 million to date, he added.</p>
<p>Peng said the company grew from five to 25 employees in 2021, and is on track to double that in the coming quarters.</p>
<p>While the company is focused on e-commerce, Peng envisions creating a new category of risk underwriting for everyday consumer activities, for example shopping, working and playing online.</p>
<p>“We believe high-frequency, low-severity risks will become the next big category in underwriting, and Seel is the leader in building toward that future,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over the past two years, since the pandemic hit, there has been a sharp rise in financial crime compliance costs, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lexisnexis-risk-solutions-study-reveals-130000106.html">nearing $50 billion in 2021</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, up 58% compared to 2019, in the U.S. and Canada.  </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.shieldfc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shield</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a Tel Aviv-based startup, built a compliance surveillance platform to enable regulated financial institutions to detect market abuse, gain behavioral analysis, mitigate toxic workplace culture and automate surveillance over employee communication channels.   </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today, the company announced it has closed a $15 million Series A round co-led by <a href="https://www.macquarie.com/au/en/about/company/macquarie-capital.html">Macquarie Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.ourcrowd.com/">OurCrowd</a>, with participation from <a href="https://mindset.ventures/">Mindset Ventures</a>. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup will use the funding to significantly expand its U.S. presence with a New York City office while further establishing itself in markets throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. It will also ramp up the development of its communication compliance platform. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256653" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As remote and hybrid work environments become more permanent, global banks have come to rely upon compliance platforms, co-founder and chief executive officer of Shield Shiran Weitzman said. The capital infusion comes at a time when the industry is actively seeking cloud-based solutions – evidenced by Shield’s recent signing of a tier-one global bank as a client. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its tailored platform applies advanced artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) capabilities through rigorous data enrichment, powerful analytics, enhanced search tools, and proactive surveillance, according to the company. Shield allows organizations of any size and across industries to mitigate risks, escape time-consuming data silos, improve operational efficiency and reduce compliance costs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The ability to access and understand new and evolving communication channels is increasingly becoming a pain point for organizations, no matter the industry, and this funding round is well-timed as it will empower us to scale our technology and enhance our already robust platform that addresses compliance concerns that enterprises deal with daily,” Weitzman said. “As a bootstrapped company, we’ve already proven that our AI platform is unquestionably valuable to banks and financial institutions.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Financial regulations obligate financial institutions to capture every communication channel used for regulated employees such as traders, back-office employees, and others Weitzman told TechCrunch. The employees know that the financial institution monitors specific channels, Weitzman added. Shield takes extra measures to maintain privacy with its proprietary privacy content recognition (PCR) engine that automatically masks personal identifiable information from the communications via emails, chats, fin-chats, and voice recordings. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shield is currently monitoring more than 150,000 regulated employees and analyzes over 53 million interactions in a day, Weitzman said, adding that it has been more than tripling its revenue year to year since established in 2018. Weitzman noted that the company has a year-over-year growth of 200% in customers.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/enterprise-governance-risk--compliance-market-size-worth-96-98-billion-by-2028--cagr-14-1--polaris-market-research-301432800.html">According to Polaris Market Research</a>, the global market for enterprise governance, risk &amp; compliance is projected to reach almost $97 billion by 2028.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“In order to support hybrid working, better manage to change compliance and regulatory requirements and the need to be cloud-native Shield has adopted a new architectural approach to software development. Shield’s leading edged software platform, agile development philosophy and ability to rapidly implement its solution to deliver more immediate benefits to customers positions Shield to be a new market leader” said David Standen, Co-Head Venture Capital Group, Macquarie Capital. “We are excited to be the lead investor and support the aspirations of the very talented team at Shield.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial institutions continue to search for ways to pile into the crypto market, and decentralized finance (DeFi) products are one mechanism that could help them capture share. Investors in DeFi products can earn yield on their capital </span><a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/yield-farming-in-defi-all-you-need-to-know-12011392.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by lending out their cryptocurrency in exchange for interest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But DeFi lending is far riskier than traditional lending, in part because of the volatility of the asset class. Just as “high-yield” bonds compensate investors with more cash for betting on riskier-than-average companies, DeFi lending can offer far higher interest rates than the traditional savings account wherein customers essentially lend their money to a bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.conduit.financial/">Conduit</a> is building a set of APIs that developers can use to build platforms that provide access to DeFi products. As VP of product at crypto wallet BRD, which Coinbase acquired in November last year, Conduit CEO and cofounder Kirill Gertman experienced firsthand the challenges of finding vendors that would provide the backend tools that his team needed to build its user-facing product. After a stint at Arrival Bank and half a year as product head at consumer fintech Eco, Gertman created Conduit to be the backend solution he was looking for but couldn’t find.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257227" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2257231" style="width: 538px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257231" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2257231" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TeamPhoto.jpeg?w=300" alt="Conduit's team" width="528" height="296" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TeamPhoto.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TeamPhoto.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TeamPhoto.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TeamPhoto.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TeamPhoto.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TeamPhoto.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TeamPhoto.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257231" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Conduit&#8217;s team on a video call <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Conduit</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you look at the fintech side of things, there&#8217;s already a huge stack that&#8217;s been built right to support that. You have Stripe, you have Marqeta if you want to issue cards – any use case you can come up with, you have somebody with an API that&#8217;s ready to give it to you,” Gertman told TechCrunch in an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduit aims to be a one-stop shop for neobanks and financial institutions to plug their own products into the DeFi ecosystem, which Gertman said is made easier because Conduit itself is regulated and compliant, taking the compliance burden off of companies using its tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For consumers to earn DeFi yields, their fiat currency is first converted into stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the fiat currency’s value, so it can be invested into various crypto protocols like Compound and AAVE. Conduit offers two solutions to help companies access these yields.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first is its growth earnings account, which neobanks offer to customers so they can invest their fiat currency in DeFi. The second is Conduit’s corporate treasury solution, which offers high-yield DeFi accounts to companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do the ledgering, and we do a lot of stuff that basically creates a very simple bundle for [our clients], so they don&#8217;t have to worry about the complexities,” like how to convert dollars to stablecoins or how to calculate rates, Gertman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gertman declined to name specific Conduit customers, but said they fall into two categories – neobanks and small cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly in regions like Latin America. Its largest clients are in Canada, where its product first launched, and Brazil, and it is looking to expand into markets including the US and Europe next, Gertman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gertman sees two types of benefits from the expansion of DeFi products, he said. The first is access – DeFi protocols are permissionless, allowing any user to lend and borrow funds without needing to provide a credit score, identity verification, or collateral. The second is that DeFi connects users globally, allowing investors in countries with extremely low or negative interest rates to earn higher yield, and making it easier for companies to borrow money at favorable rates by drawing from a global liquidity pool, Gertman added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduit says it plans to triple its headcount, which is fully remote, during the next year across the North America and LatAm regions by hiring engineering, sales, and compliance professionals with localized knowledge. Regulation has played a role in which countries Conduit has targeted, he added, saying that a lack of regulatory clarity from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has slowed Conduit’s entry into the US.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To fuel its global expansion, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduit raised a $17M seed round led by Portage Ventures, with support from Diagram Ventures, FinVC, Gemini Frontier Fund, Gradient Ventures and Jump Capital, the company announced today. A number of fintech executives also participated in the round, from firms including PayPal, Coinbase, Google Pay, and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduit bears high legal expenses to ensure it is compliant in all its markets, so Gertman decided the company needed to raise a “larger-than-average seed round,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Obviously, the market conditions helped us, and we took advantage of that, and I&#8217;m not going to hide that…Even if there will be a crypto winter or something like that, we can survive that,” Gertman said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tencent has invested in Easy Transfer, a startup that aims to make tuition payments less stressful for hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese students.</p>
<p>Tencent declined to comment for the story, but Tony Gao, founder and CEO of Easy Transfer, told TechCrunch that the internet giant now owns about 5% of his company. The investment, which closed in December, is the first tranche of Easy Transfer&#8217;s ongoing Series C funding round. IDG Capital and ZhenFund are early investors in the startup.</p>
<p>Easy Transfer itself doesn&#8217;t handle transactions directly; instead, it works with financial institutions with cross-border payments licenses in China. The startup&#8217;s value-add, Gao said in a previous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/easy-transfer-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a>, is to make remittance hassle-free. In the old practice, parents and students would need to visit a bank, fill out a stack of forms, double-check the routing information is correct, and nervously wait for the tuition to deposit in time into the university&#8217;s account.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257269" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With Easy Transfer, users fill out a straightforward form online and the startup takes care of the rest for a fee of up to 200 yuan ($31).</p>
<p>Through Tencent&#8217;s strategic investment, Easy Transfer hopes to further streamline its user experience. The partners have jointly developed a WeChat-based tuition remittance service called WeRemit. Unlike the millions of third-party lite apps inside WeChat&#8217;s ecosystem, WeRemit is partly operated by WeChat with deep support from the messaging giant.</p>
<p>&#8220;From anti-money laundering, identity verification, to information security, WeChat makes cross-border payment transactions much more secure,&#8221; said Gao. &#8220;The gargantuan amount of user data owned by WeChat allows it to build a robust risk management system that even banks can&#8217;t match.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before moving money around, WeRemit will ask to scan users&#8217; faces to confirm their identity and collect their personal information, data that is already stored on WeChat. Internet platforms in China are required to verify people&#8217;s true identity before enabling core features like mobile payments and content posting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>WeChat&#8217;s AI-based financial compliance system is also at work. Machine learning is used to identify and comprehend documents submitted to WeRemit, like tuition bills, offer letters, and visa information. The system can also flag high-risk transactions for manual review and compare billed amounts to the due numbers to avoid overpayment.</p>
<p>Undergirding WeRemit&#8217;s service is Tenpay, Tencent&#8217;s online payments arm that also powers WeChat Pay, the messenger&#8217;s digital wallet. Upon receiving transactions from users, Tenpay, which holds a cross-border transact-on license, sends the money to one of the 2,000 universities that accepts Easy Transfer.</p>
<p>Teaming up with WeChat, which has a ubiquitous presence in China, could greatly amplify Easy Transfer&#8217;s reach. The startup served 120,000 students in the past year and processed over $2 billion in transactions, according to Gao. It&#8217;s now targeting the 500,000 users that WeChat tags as &#8220;overseas students.&#8221; In all, around 700,000 Chinese students studied overseas in 2019, according to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>For Tencent, a partnership with Easy Transfer could help diversify its breadth of cross-border fintech services beyond targeting outbound tourists. Gao wants to replicate Easy Transfer&#8217;s model in the rest of Asia, especially South and Southeast Asia. The plan is to capture the growing population of overseas students in countries like India, Nepal and Vietnam. Families in these countries have the same pain points in tuition transfer and are even more price sensitive, said the founder.</p>
<p>Overseas expansion has proven challenging for Tencent, and the firm has largely relied on strategic investments to extend its influence abroad. Case in point is its massive portfolio of video games companies. Tencent had backed multiple fintech service providers across Asia including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/03/go-jek-tencent-1-2-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grab.</a> Tencent could hook Easy Transfer with the right local partner with the necessary license for sending money overseas, said Gao, and Easy Transfer will focus on building a local team and an easy-to-use product like WeRemit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over 30 civil society organizations, pro-privacy tech businesses and European startups are making a last ditch pitch to try to convince EU lawmakers to put stricter limits on surveillance advertising as a major vote looms on an update to the bloc&#8217;s digital rules.</p>
<p>The European Parliament will vote shortly to confirm its negotiating position on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Services Act</a> (DSA) &#8212; and the 30 signatories to the joint statement on &#8220;surveillance-based advertising&#8221; are urging MEPs to back amendments to the DSA to tighten the rules on how people&#8217;s data can be used for targeting ads.</p>
<p>In a nutshell they argue that inferred personal data (aka what a platform can learn/guess about you by snooping on your digital activity) should be out of bounds for ad targeting &#8212; and that advertisers should only be able to use information that has been consciously provided to them for targeting their marketing by the individuals in question.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257319" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>An example of how that could work might be that a platform periodically asking a user to select a few categories of goods/interests for which they&#8217;re happy to receive marketing offers &#8212; such as, say, beauty products, hiking/outdoors gear, holidays, or culture/art.</p>
<p>They would then only be able to use such signals for ad targeting, making it contextual, rather than creepy.</p>
<p>This is not so very radical a suggestion.</p>
<p>Regulators in the region have in fact been warning that tracking based ads are on borrowed time for years, given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">systemic breaches</a> of EU privacy laws. Though actual regulator enforcement against adtech has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">harder to spot</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qbxsZ8BroI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">Behavioural advertising is out of control, warns UK watchdog</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Behavioural advertising is out of control, warns UK watchdog&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/embed/#?secret=qbxsZ8BroI" data-secret="qbxsZ8BroI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Most recently the outgoing UK data protection commissioner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/">urged the industry to reform</a> &#8212; and move away from the current paradigm of tracking and profiling &#8212; saying the future must be about providing Internet users with a genuine choice over how they are targeted with marketing messages.</p>
<p>The signatories to the statement calling for parliamentarians to get behind this kind of ad targeting reform argue it would have major benefits &#8212; preventing problems associated with the covert surveillance of web users which can lead to abusive ads that manipulate and exploit.</p>
<p>The theories of harm around microtargeted ads have been much discussed in recent years &#8212; with risks of behavioral targeting being linked to discrimination, exploitation of vulnerable people/groups, and democracy-denting election interference, to name a few.</p>
<p>Surveillance advertising&#8217;s problem is that it can&#8217;t be publicly accountability because it lacks genuine transparency.</p>
<p>Yet there are other ways to target ads that don&#8217;t require creepy snooping and behavioral profiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are convinced that targeted digital ads can be delivered effectively and with respect for users’ choice and privacy (i.e. without covert surveillance practices), provided that exclusively data specifically provided by users for that purpose is processed, in a transparent and accountable manner,&#8221; the signatories write.</p>

<p>The statement dubs the use of &#8220;inferred data, which reveals users’ vulnerabilities and, by definition, is collected or generated without their awareness and control&#8221; as &#8220;a particularly problematic practice in digital advertising&#8221;, arguing: &#8220;It is time to end this practice as it causes significant harm on an individual and societal level, as evidenced by extensive academic research and recent revelations including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">the Facebook Files</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-european-parliament/">whistleblower Frances Haugen’s testimony</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/youtubes-recommender-ai-still-a-horrorshow-finds-major-crowdsourced-study/">Mozilla’s YouTube Regrets study</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in the best interest of companies engaging in digital advertising to respect users’ choice, autonomy, and expressed (not inferred) preferences,&#8221; they go on, pointing to <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/do-people-really-want-personalised-ads-online/">survey results</a> which found that 75% of social media users in France and Germany are not comfortable when their behavioural data is used to target them with advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;While small and medium-sized businesses legitimately use online advertising to reach their clients, they do not need to rely on intrusive surveillance as a means to that end,&#8221; they further argue.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The statement suggests that the main beneficiaries of current adtech&#8217;s &#8216;surveillance free-for-all&#8217; &#8212; and the pervasive, covert massive tracking of Internet users &#8212; are likely to be US tech giants.</p>
<p>While progressive European startups &#8212; which have been trying for years to scale alternative, privacy respecting approaches for ad targeting &#8212; are being competitively disadvantaged by the rights-violating data abuses of US giants.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only actors who benefit from exploitation of users’ vulnerabilities and cross-site tracking are US-based large online platforms, with an interest to preserve their dominant position in the digital advertising market,&#8221; the statement argues, calling for &#8220;regulatory incentives&#8221; so that &#8220;progressive&#8221; privacy-focused startups can scale their rights-respecting services and make them more accessible for small brands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Putting an end to the most invasive practices will strengthen small European brands and GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] compliant digital services, as well as local media as it would promote fair competition in digital advertising and reinstate the power of quality.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an argument that should &#8212; in theory &#8212; play well with Europeans elected representatives in the parliament.</p>
<p>However in recent years US tech giants &#8212; led by Google and Facebook &#8212; have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/us-giants-top-tech-industrys-100m-a-year-lobbying-blitz-in-eu/">pouring millions into lobbying efforts in Brussels</a> in a bid to steer lawmakers away from policies that could damage their surveillance-based business models. So this is in no way a fair fight.</p>
<p>Key among the tech giant lobbying claims has been the suggestion that tougher rules on targeting will hit Europe&#8217;s small businesses. Indeed, Facebook (now Meta) has gone so far as to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">claim that banning surveillance ads would decimate the bloc&#8217;s economy</a>.</p>

<p>An earlier push by a number of MEPs towards the end of last year<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/"> to get an outright ban on surveillance-based ad targeting</a> included in the DSA did not prevail.</p>
<p>Although a parliamentary committee did back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">tightening restrictions on tracking-based advertising</a> in another draft package of EU legislation that will apply to the most powerful Internet gatekeepers (so plenty of US giants), aka the Digital Markets Act (DMA) &#8212; by beefing up consent requirements for ad targeting and adding a complete prohibition on behavioral targeting of minors.</p>
<p>But the 31 signatories to today&#8217;s statement argue that the IMCO tweaks do not go far enough against the data industrial surveillance complex, writing: &#8220;We urge Members of the European Parliament to support plenary amendments to Article 24 of the DSA which go beyond the existing IMCO compromise and rule out surveillance practices in digital advertising &#8212; such as the use of inferred data &#8212; while supporting users’ genuine choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karolina Iwańska, a lawyer and policy analyst for the Panoptykon Foundation, also told us: &#8220;Unfortunately the compromise around ads in the IMCO committee is very weak and largely maintaining status quo&#8221; &#8212; adding that: &#8220;Big tech&#8217;s &#8216;SME&#8217; lobbying was very successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that a <em>true</em> compromise between a full ban on the use of personal data (unrealistic at this point) and status quo (everything allowed if consent is collected) is possible &#8212; but has sadly been ignored in the parliament,&#8221; she added, saying the anti-surveillance campaigners are now hoping to convince MEPs to back reform of personalized ads by limiting targeting to expressed preferences &#8212; which they believe will give Internet users &#8220;genuine control&#8221;.</p>

<p>The effort will need to work fast if it&#8217;s to achieve its aim.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Per Iwańska, the campaigners have drafted an amendment &#8212; but have yet to get backing from MEPs to submit it so that the parliament as a whole would be able to vote on it at the plenary. Clearly it&#8217;ll be crunch time for this push over the next few days.</span></p>
<p>Under the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process the Commission proposes legislation and that&#8217;s then followed by a process of wider negotiations between Member States and the European Parliament on the policy detail &#8212; with the chance for upcoming EU rules to be reworked and reshaped before they&#8217;re finally adopted.</p>
<p>Both the DSA and the DMA were proposed at the end of 2020 by the European Commission, with the DSA aimed at updating the bloc&#8217;s ecommerce rules and dialling up accountability on digital businesses by widening requirements to define areas of additional responsibility around content.</p>
<p>While the DMA targets the competition- and consumer-crushing market power of Internet giants, with a set of ex ante rules aimed at preventing abusive practices.</p>
<p>Trilogue negotiations on the DSA are due to start soon &#8212; once the parliament confirms its position in next week&#8217;s plenary vote. And &#8212; ultimately &#8212; there will need to be another plenary vote in the parliament on the final text. So campaigners against surveillance advertising may have other points in the process to try to push strategic amendments.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: The lobbying will continue throughout this year.</p>
<p>Any restrictions on ad targeting in the EU will still also have to wait for the legislation to be adopted and come into force &#8212; with EU lawmakers set to apply a grace period for digital businesses to come into compliance. So any rule changes won&#8217;t bite for many months more at least.</p>
<p>While the DMA &#8212; which appears to be moving pretty speedily through the co-legislative process &#8212; could get up and running relatively quickly, perhaps in 2023, the DSA looks likely to take longer before it comes into force; perhaps not until 2024.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the tracking and targeting continues&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EV charging continues to be a high-growth business, for obvious reasons. Since 2007, one of the largest players has been ChargePoint, the floated US company which with a widespread EV charging network. But plenty of startups are snapping at its heels.</p>
<p>One of them is Germany-based <a href="https://www.heycharge.com/">HeyCharge</a>, which realised there was a problem with how EVs could be charged in underground carparks, where roughly 80% of all EV charging activity generally happens. The problem is that normal smart charging infrastructure needs an internet connection, but underground that’s not possible. So HeyCharge has a solution&#8230;</p>
<p>This is no doubt why it’s now raised a $4.7m Seed round led by BMW i Ventures (also a an early investor in Chargepoint and Chargemaster), the venture capital arm of BMW Group. Also participating was Statkraft Ventures, the venture capital arm of Statkraft, a large European generator of renewable energy.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257329" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We covered HeyCharge when it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">part of YC’s 2021 batch</a>.</p>
<p>HeyCharge’s solution is aimed at apartment buildings, offices, hotels and other underground infrastructure for EVs. Its SecureCharge technology doesn’t require an on-site internet connection, connecting over Bluetooth instead, in a plug-and-play setup.</p>
<p>Chris Carde, CEO of HeyCharge, said: “With 40% of Europeans and 37% of US renters living in apartment buildings, there is a large section of the population for whom going electric is too difficult because they can’t charge at home. HeyCharge’s solution makes EV charging not just scalable but also more cost-effective and accessible so that you can EV charge wherever you live or work.”</p>
<p>Kasper Sage, Managing Partner, BMW i Ventures, said: “The rapid growth of the electric vehicle market in coming years will necessitate greater infrastructure build-out of charging solutions around the globe. HeyCharge is the first company to enable EV-charging without internet connection, which is a key enabler to cover untapped white-spots.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>HeyCharge was founded by Chris Carde and Dr. Robert Lasowski in March 2020, who previously worked at Mercedes-Benz, Google, BMW and SIXT.</p>
