										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mealco.co">Mealco</a>, a startup promising to help chefs launch new restaurants designed around delivery, is announcing that it has raised $7 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably not news to anyone reading this that opening a restaurant can be an expensive, risky proposition — and of course, many restaurants have gone out of business during the pandemic.</p>
<p>But founder and CEO Daniel Simon (who was previously a developer and product lead at Applicaster, and has also worked with Tel Aviv restaurant group R2M) said that even in the best of times, it can take $1 or $2 million to get started, and &#8220;if you want to hit the ground running, 98% of your focus is not on the food or the customers.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Mealco, on the other hand, there&#8217;s no upfront cost for the chefs, and they get to focus on actually creating the dishes and the menu. Mealco locally sources the ingredients, which are then cooked using the startup&#8217;s kitchen infrastructure and offered for delivery via the standard delivery apps — Uber Eats, DoorDash, Postmates and Seamless.</p>
<p>Simon said that with Mealco, the process of getting a new restaurant up and running only takes six to eight weeks: &#8220;We tell [the chefs] they don’t need to chop any more onions or tomatoes. There&#8217;s Mealco software that can tell employees at the Mealco kitchen how to prepare [each dish].&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100860" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100860" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2100860" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?w=680" alt="Cayenne" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100860" class="wp-caption-text">Cayenne</p></div></p>
<p>Mealco also provides support around branding, marketing and social media, and gives chefs data how about the business is performing. The chef, he said, can &#8220;manage the restaurant from their mobile phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup has already launched two restaurants delivering in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens — Mexican restaurant <a href="https://tributo.com">Tributo</a> and Nashville hot chicken restaurant <a href="https://eatcayenne.com">Cayenne</a> (the latter with chef Hillary Sterling). And it says there are 50 chefs on the waitlist.</p>
<p>Asked whether any of Mealco&#8217;s partners mind being separated from the food preparation and the dining experience, Simon said it depends on the chef.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to open a single location and be in the kitchen every morning,&#8221; then he said Mealco isn&#8217;t for you. &#8220;That not wrong or right, it&#8217;s a preference &#8230; But most chefs are creators, they&#8217;re artists. They express themselves through food.&#8221; And in his view, Mealco allows them to focus on that creativity.</p>
<p>Rucker Park Capital led the round with participation from FJLabs. Simon said the plan is to launch throughout New York City and surrounding areas this year, before moving on to new cities next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past few years, we had the opportunity to see the evolution of the food ecosystem firsthand,&#8221; said Rucker Park Capital founder Wes Tang in a statement. &#8220;We believe the opportunity was ripe for someone to launch new brands in a new format. In Mealco, we found the most compelling model and novel mission.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today is <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/introducing-the-new-academic-research-product-track/148632">rolling out</a> a new product track on its API platform, as part of its ongoing efforts to <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2020/introducing_new_twitter_api.html">rebuild the Twitter API</a> from the ground up. The track, which aims to serve the needs of the academic research community&#8217;s efforts, offers broader access to the Twitter archive and fewer restrictions on tweet retrievals, so researchers can access the entire history of the public conversation on Twitter&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>In addition to gaining access to all the Twitter API v2 endpoints released to date and elevated access, researchers will gain access to more precise filtering capabilities.</p>
<p>Specifically, they&#8217;ll be able to access the full-archive search endpoint, which offers access to everything being said on Twitter. They can narrow searches for these historical tweets using start time and end time parameters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2100706" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100706" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2100706" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg 2694w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=768,449 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=1536,899 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1198 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100706" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Researchers will also gain a significantly higher monthly cap on the number of tweets they can pull using the Twitter API v2. While on the Basic level of API access, this cap is set to 500,000. The Basic level of access on the Academic Research track is an initial monthly cap of up to 10 million tweets. This applies to the Recent Search, Filtered Stream, Full-archive search, and user tweet and mentions timelines endpoints, Twitter says.</p>
<p>The Academic Research track will gain access to certain operators that aren&#8217;t otherwise available, too, with the goal of helping them pull more precise user data. Today, these include: <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">$ (aka cashtag), bio, bio_name, bio_location, place, place_country, point_radius, bounding_box, -is:nullcast, has:cashtags and has:geo. </span></p>
<p>Researchers can also add 1,000 concurrent rules when using the filter stream endpoint, instead of the limit of 25 available in the Standard track. Queries in the recent search endpoint can be 1,024 characters long, compared with 512 characters in the Standard track.</p>
<p>Because of the elevated levels of access, those who want to gain access to the Academic Research product track have to first <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/use-case">submit an application</a>.</p>
<p>All applicants have to either be a master’s student, doctoral candidate, post-doc, faculty or research-focused employee at an academic institution or university. They will also <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research/application-info">need to have</a> a clearly defined research objective and must be able to detail their specific plans for how they intend to use, analyze and share Twitter data from their research.</p>
<p>Plus, the data used from the Academic Research product track can&#8217;t be used for any <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/commercial-terms">commercial</a> purposes, Twitter notes.</p>

<p>Academic researchers have been taking advantage of the Twitter API since its first introduction in 2006 and have used the data to study a variety of topics, Twitter says, like <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">​<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/disclosing-removed-networks-to-our-archive-of-state-linked-information.html">state-backed efforts to disrupt the public conversation</a>​, ​<a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/use-cases/success-stories/uc-davis-max-planck-institute">floods and climate change</a>, ​<a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/use-cases/success-stories/penn">attitudes and perceptions about COVID-19​</a> and​ ​<a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/use-cases/success-stories/hatelab">efforts to promote healthy conversation online</a>​.</span></p>
<p>However, the earlier version of the Twitter API didn&#8217;t make it easy for researchers to gain access to Twitter data &#8212; something the company wanted to correct with API v2.</p>
<p>Twitter to date has catered to the research community in other ways, with additions like a website dedicated to academic research, updates to its developer policy to make it easier to reproduce and validate others&#8217; research, and even special endpoints, like <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2020/covid19_public_conversation_data.html">the COVID-19 stream endpoint</a> released in April 2020. But it hasn&#8217;t fully thought through, until the API v2, how it could build tools that would actually aid researchers in doing their work, instead of the researchers having to figure out ways to work around Twitter&#8217;s limitations.</p>
<p>The Academic Research product track was tested in private beta starting in Oct. 2020, and now this is being opened more broadly, where it will be made freely available.</p>
<p>Twitter says it&#8217;s planning to add higher levels of access across all its product tracks in the future, including this one, in time. The later levels will help researchers who need even more data than what&#8217;s being offered with today&#8217;s launch. Twitter also noted it&#8217;s looking into adding flexible access as well, which would help account for times when developers were consuming more or less data throughout the year.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many stats to back up the underrepresentation of women </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">starting a company, raising money and general involvement in technology where the global tech workforce comprises 28.8% women</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a male-dominated space, programs geared toward supporting female entrepreneurs have emerged to close the gap on all fronts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for those centered around female founders, most are quick to offer mentorship and training but tend to ignore the importance of raising money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.firstcheck.africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FirstCheck Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a female-focused angel fund that launched yesterday, is hoping to address this challenge</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to its website, &#8220;fixing capital access for female tech entrepreneurs in Africa needs an intentional, female-led approach</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FirstCheck Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span> <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/elohogm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eloho Omame</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/odunayoeweniyi"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odunayo Eweniyi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omame is the MD of </span><a href="https://endeavornigeria.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nigeria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a program for high-impact entrepreneurs, and Eweniyi is the co-founder and COO of </span><a href="https://www.piggyvest.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piggyvest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Nigerian fintech startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omame&#8217;s experience working with founders and managing a VC firm (Amari Ventures) and Odunayo&#8217;s as a founder will prove vital to what FirstCheck Africa hopes to achieve: Making it easy for African women to raise capital and invest in tech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund will provide between $15,000 to $25,000 in six women this year in exchange for modest equity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FirstCheck Africa plans to see each woman or female-led team through the ideation stage to a significant pre-seed round within 12 months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We know we can generate solid long-term returns by investing in women, so we&#8217;ll write female founders&#8217; first checks and be their earliest believers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We&#8217;re not afraid to invest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ridiculously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> early in great women,&#8221; an excerpt in the statement<a href="https://firstcheckhq.medium.com/announcing-firstcheck-africa-dbc72b1f7180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund also specifies that it is open to investing in mixed co-founder teams, with at least one woman. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the caveat is &#8220;only where it’s clear that the woman is a true partner and decision-maker, with a significant, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">equitable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> split of the founder equity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already, FirstCheck has received over 600 applications from African female-led startups, Omame told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she iterates that while only six will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be selected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, FirstCheck is in no hurry to announce the deals when asked how soon the firm expects to write its first check</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’ve been transparent with our investment goal as we’re backing up to six women-led, technology-driven businesses this year,&#8221; she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Outside that, there’s little interest from Odun or me to rush to announce deals. The work we’re doing is important and necessary, but it will take time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you think about it, backing six startups in its first year is an impressive goal. For context, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/early-stage-african-vc-firm-microtraction-reports-portfolio-boom-despite-the-weight-of-covid-19/">Microtraction, an already established early-stage VC firm</a>, invested in seven startups last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> achieve that, FirstCheck will need to garner support from local and international investors that are intentional about closing the gender funding gap on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Without providing specifics around how much the fund is looking to raise, Omame says this is already happening</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, FirstCheck will be building a female-led investor community for women interested in backing startups by writing smaller checks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notion behind this is to create opportunities for women around the continent to invest at more comfortable levels. And f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or African female entrepreneurs who need pre-seed and seed funding, the launch of FirstCheck is a plus to their selection pool</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm now joins Rising Tide Africa and SA-based Dazzle Angels among others as one of the few angel funds targeted to African female-led startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Facebook and Apple begin to fire up more projects in the AR/VR world, Google has spent the last year shutting down most of their existing projects in that space.</p>
<p>Today, the folks at Google announced they had ended active development of Tilt Brush, a VR painting app that was one of virtual reality&#8217;s early hit pieces of software. The app allowed users to use virtual reality controllers as brushes to construct digital sculptures and environments.</p>
<p>While the company will not be pushing any new updates to the app, they did announce that they will be open sourcing the code on github for developers to build their own experiences and customizations. Google also notes that the app will continue to be available in the app stores on VR headsets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;[W]e want to continue supporting the artists using Tilt Brush by putting it in your hands,&#8221;a blog post from Google reads. &#8220;This means open sourcing Tilt Brush, allowing everyone to learn how we built the project, and encouraging them to take it in directions that are near and dear to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google acquired the small studio behind Tilt Brush called Skillman &amp; Hackett back in 2015.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Tilt Brush co-creator Patrick Hackett announced he was leaving Google and would be joining the studio I-Illusions, the game studio behind VR title Space Pirate Trainer. According to LinkedIn, co-founder Drew Skillman stopped working on the VR project back in 2018 and now is part of the Stadia team at Google.</p>
<p>Last month, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-shutting-down-poly-3d-content-platform/">shut down Poly</a>, its 3D object library which allowed users to share digital art including design made in the Tilt Brush software.</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson declined to comment further.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tula is a new company founded with the specific purpose of developing user-friendly hardware and software for sound capture, and its debut product, the Tula Mic, is now shipping after a successful crowdfunding campaign last year. <a href="https://tulamics.com">Tula Mic</a> is both a USB-C microphone input for computers and mobile devices, and also a dedicated recorder that has built-in storage and its own battery that can provide up to 14 hours of continuous use. It&#8217;s a strong intro offering that fits a lot of user needs at an attractive price point.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>The Tula Mic is small — it&#8217;s definitely best described as &#8220;hand-held,&#8221; taking up roughly the size and surface area of a deck of cards. The physical design includes microphone capsules up top, with control buttons running along either side, and a USB-C charging port in the middle of the back of the hardware. The top-left side also features a standard 3.5mm port, which can be used not only for headphones for monitoring and playback, but also for input for lavalier microphones, effectively turning the Tula into a body pack.</p>
<p>Just below the grill that contains the recording capsule, there are two lights on the face of the Tula Mic. These include a gain/peaking indicator and a recording indicator, providing you with simple but effective visual feedback. There&#8217;s 8 GB of built-in memory on board, and that built-in rechargeable battery offers up to 14 hours of continuous recording. Inside, there are not just one, but two recording capsules, including one with a cardioid recording pattern for capturing audio from one user speaking toward the mic, and one with an omni pickup pattern for recording room sound, best for events or interviews.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Tula Mic comes with a stand attached, which folds up and attaches magnetically to its midsection for easy transport. This is also removable and can be swapped out for a standard microphone-mount threaded attachment point. It&#8217;s a simple and elegant design that proves very handy in active use, but the proprietary mounting method here means that if you ever lose one or the other of these accessories, you can&#8217;t just pick up a generic one like you could if they&#8217;d used a standard tripod thread instead, for instance.</p>
<h2>Design and performance</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2100814" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100814" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2100814" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tula-mic.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="685" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tula-mic.jpg 1598w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tula-mic.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tula-mic.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tula-mic.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tula-mic.jpg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tula-mic.jpg?resize=1536,1028 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tula-mic.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100814" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Darrell Etherington</p></div></p>
<p>The Tula Mic&#8217;s design definitely conveys retro aesthetics, and its flat-sided oval shape is immediately eye-catching and recognizable. The unique look also provides great hand-holdability, and when used in stand mode, it&#8217;s immediately clear how a user should address the mic in use. The flip-down stand is elegant and keeps the mic firmly in place, thanks to its weighted metal construction.</p>
<p>The controls located down either side of the Tula Mic are each labelled, but I found that I definitely had to repeatedly reference the included user guide before I could consistently remember what each of them did. The icons are helpful, but not necessarily immediately intuitive. It&#8217;s nice to have physical controls, however, rather than touch sensitive surfaces or a screen for input.</p>
<p>The most important thing to note about the Tula Mic&#8217;s performance is that it sounds great, in both wired USB-C and standalone recorder mode. Having the ability to switch between omni and cardioid pickup patterns is also immensely useful in terms of the mic&#8217;s versatility as a one-size-fits-most solution, since you can use it for podcasting, for recording a class or lecture, and for recording a two-person interview all with equal ease and very high-quality results.</p>
<p>Lastly, Tula includes a built-in local noise cancellation algorithm, which allows you to capture a brief recording of room tone in order to automatically remove it from your subsequent recording. It&#8217;s a very handy and surprisingly effective feature, and one that should provide big benefits in terms of later using recordings from the mic with transcription services like Otter.ai.</p>
<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>At $199, the <a href="https://tulamics.com">Tula Mic</a> is already priced to match many of the leading USB microphones on the market today. The fact that it&#8217;s also a full-featured standalone digital recorder, many of which are also priced at or near that mark, really makes it an obvious choice for anyone looking for portable recording flexibility in a compact package.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Plastic-free grocery-delivery startup <a href="https://www.zerogrocery.com/">Zero</a> is gearing up to launch in Los Angeles on February 10, after solely operating in the San Francisco Bay Area. Zero works directly with suppliers to sell food and other household items in jars, boxes and other types of sustainable packaging, and offers next-day delivery.</p>
<p>Zero works with both big-name brands like Sightglass Coffee, Annie&#8217;s and Newman&#8217;s Own, as well as emerging vendors that are focused on sustainability, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/with-another-2-5-million-in-funding-julia-collins-planet-fwd-launches-climate-friendly-snack-brand/">Planet FWD, founded by Zume co-founder Julia Collins</a>.</p>
<p>Zero members pay $25 per month to access discounted prices on food along with free deliveries. Zero is also available without a subscription, but prices on individual items cost a bit more, and delivery costs $7.99.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve used Zero a couple of times and overall had a pleasant experience. The selection of food is pretty good, but I wasn&#8217;t able to find certain types of items like tortilla chips and mandarin oranges. On the plus side, Zero sells my favorite candy of all-time, Tony&#8217;s Chocolonely.</p>
<p>In total, Zero founder and CEO Zuleyka Strasner says there are just over 1,100 different items available in the store.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s partly because of the leg work that&#8217;s required to ensure the food manufactures are meeting Zero&#8217;s internal standards for packaging. In the case of chicken, Zero has worked directly with butchers to ensure they package it in compostable paper, which then goes into a compostable resealable bag, Strasner said. That took a lot of time, effort, energy and technology, she said.</p>
<p>Zero does allow plastic at some point in the supply chain process but ensures that plastic is not passed on to consumers. Using chicken as an example again, the chicken starts at the farm and then must travel to one of Zero&#8217;s butcher networks and then to a facility to get packaged and processed.</p>
<p>&#8220;So those farms and those parts of that transportation process do oftentimes involve plastic in there,&#8221; Strasner said. &#8220;And as the company grows, we get involved more and more and more into changing more and more of the processes and removing more and more of the plastic for each of our new manufacturing suppliers. So it&#8217;s always a journey for each farm, to start with that product going out to the customer plastic-free and then working backwards backwards backwards to removing more and more and more plastics.&#8221;</p>
<p>While it would be ideal for all of Zero&#8217;s partners to operate fully plastic-free, Strasner said it was important to make it as easy as possible for farms, suppliers and other stakeholders to get on board, &#8220;rather than setting up a set of rules and regulations that say either you&#8217;re plastic-free from the minute the chicken gets slaughtered all the way to getting it to the customer,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would not create the shift in the industry that we&#8217;re looking to create.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2100243 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zero-Photography-8-e1611603840201.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zero-Photography-8-e1611603840201.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zero-Photography-8-e1611603840201.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zero-Photography-8-e1611603840201.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zero-Photography-8-e1611603840201.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zero-Photography-8-e1611603840201.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zero-Photography-8-e1611603840201.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zero-Photography-8-e1611603840201.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>The idea for Zero started to come into fruition for Strasner<strong> </strong>during her honeymoon in the Corn Islands in Nicaragua. During her trip, she was shocked at how much single-use plastic washed up on the shore, she told TechCrunch. Meanwhile, she had seen the zero-waste, anti-plastic movement growing and began to wonder what would happen if she went plastic-free. Going plastic-free made her think more about the supply chain and how foods are packed in the country, she said.</p>
<p>Given her background in technology, she began to think about how technology could be applied to the problem of plastic waste, &#8220;which must be solved within the next seven to 10 years,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Time is truly finite here and that&#8217;s the mission I decided to undertake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zero began testing in 2018 and officially launched in November 2019. The majority of Zero&#8217;s customers are members and, overall, the company has &#8220;many, many thousands of customers,&#8221; Strasner said.</p>
<p>To date, Zero has raised $4.7 million in funding from investors like Precursor Ventures, Backstage Capital, 1984 and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aim to be and we will be the largest sustainability platform in this country,&#8221; Strasner said. &#8220;So whatever you need and desire &#8212; food, homewares or otherwise, certainly plastic-free but also just sustainable in general &#8212; you would come to us. Zero really is a movement beyond just food.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re working for a company that handles a ton of data, chances are your company is constantly moving data from applications, APIs and databases and sending it to a data warehouse or a data lake. There are a few well-known platforms to extract, load and transform data, such as <a href="https://fivetran.com">Fivetran</a> and <a href="https://www.stitchdata.com">Stitchdata</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://airbyte.io">Airbyte</a> is building an open-source data pipeline platform. An open-source alternative to Fivetran or Stitchdata is interesting because building and maintaining connectors require a ton of resources. If you’re just starting out with your data pipeline and you don’t have a big team, it creates a barrier to entry.</p>
<p>Sure, existing data pipeline platforms already provide dozens of integrations with popular sources and destinations. Popular sources include Salesforce, Stripe, Marketo, SendGrid, etc. Popular destinations include Redshift, Snowflake and BigQuery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But there are a ton of small services that aren’t supported on traditional data pipeline platforms. If you can’t import <em>all</em> your data, you may only have a partial picture of your business.</p>
<p>A lot of companies end up building custom connectors for their applications. With this open-source approach, Airbyte thinks it can foster a community of users to build and maintain thousands of open-source connectors. When a company builds a custom connector, another company can use it, improve it and give back to the community.</p>
<p>“The open-source approach is the right approach,” co-founder and CEO Michel Tricot told me. “If somebody using a connector realizes that it’s broken, they can fix it for the entire community.”</p>
<p>The team behind Airbyte originally started with a product focused on marketing data. They attended Y Combinator and later pivoted because of the coronavirus outbreak. “In a COVID world, there’s no marketing budget,” co-founder John Lafleur told me.</p>
<p>Airbyte connectors run in Docker containers, which means they all operate independently from each other. You can schedule updates, refresh your connectors manually and monitor them individually.</p>
<p>Right now, there are <a href="https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/docs/integrations/connector-health.md">46 connectors</a> — Airbyte is currently working on certifying them to make sure they’re production-ready. 250 companies are currently using Airbyte.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Speculation around the Qualtrics public offering is nothing new. All the way back in 2016, CEO Ryan Smith was dropping not-so-subtle hints about his intentions to file for IPO. After a decade bootstrapping, and growing to $50 million in annual revenue, the company was swayed into taking outside capital from Sequoia, and then again from Sequoia, Accel, and Insight Venture Partners.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has written about the entire journey, and considering the unusual circumstances of the public offering paired with Qualtrics&#8217; position outperforming its peer group, we thought it smart to take a look back at how the whole thing came together.</p>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align: center;">2017</h2>
<p>After years of dodging the question, or offering up vague answers, Smith said the following in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/is-qualtrics-about-to-go-public-a-chat-with-founder-ryan-smith-on-the-ipo-question/">interview with TechCrunch back in 2017</a>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>We know that there’s a huge opportunity here and we’re being very thoughtful about it because it’s not about going public. Going public is super easy to do. Just file the S-1 and we’re out,” Smith told [TechCrunch]. “It’s about being public and how that works and getting the house in order to make sure that that’s the case. We’re going to be a great public company. We’re going public.</p></blockquote>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Is Qualtrics about to go public? A chat with founder Ryan Smith on the IPO question&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/is-qualtrics-about-to-go-public-a-chat-with-founder-ryan-smith-on-the-ipo-question/embed/#?secret=TnO1Ipyxxi" data-secret="TnO1Ipyxxi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Just a couple days later, literally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/qualtrics-waits-on-that-ipo-raises-180-million-at-a-2-5-billion-valuation-instead/">Qualtrics raised $180 million at a $2.5 billion valuation</a>, again from Sequoia, Accel, and Insight Venture Partners. At the time, it was the biggest investment Accel had ever made. The growth of the company was staggering — the experience management startup had gone from $50 million in revenue in 2012 to $250 million in revenue in 2017.</p>
<p>TechCrunch and many others speculated that the massive raise may not signal a delayed IPO, but rather a final financial push before listing on the public markets.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="l1cmVXAYs8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/qualtrics-waits-on-that-ipo-raises-180-million-at-a-2-5-billion-valuation-instead/">Qualtrics waits on that IPO, raises $180 million at a $2.5 billion valuation instead</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Qualtrics waits on that IPO, raises $180 million at a $2.5 billion valuation instead&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/qualtrics-waits-on-that-ipo-raises-180-million-at-a-2-5-billion-valuation-instead/embed/#?secret=l1cmVXAYs8" data-secret="l1cmVXAYs8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Smith was coy about whether that speculation was warranted:</p>
<blockquote><p>We raised the money because we can. An IPO isn’t an exit. It should be the beginning and we wouldn’t be going out if we didn’t think that more wealth could be created post-IPO.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company also launched its XM platform in 2017, an experience management platform that Smith implied would one day be as ubiquitous as Workday or Salesforce software in every office, but for managing internal feedback and helping organizations uncover key business drivers, predict future customer needs, and retain employees.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital partner Bryan Schreier said at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Qualtrics is an outlier. They have delivered outstanding, accelerating growth at nine-digit revenue numbers all while staying cash flow positive. That is practically unheard of. It’s an incredible sign of confidence in Qualtrics’ continued growth trajectory and the huge market for its new XM Platform that all of its investors have come back to buy as many shares as they could at this new valuation.</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align: center;">2018</h2>
<p>In October of 2018, Qualtrics filed its S-1, which included <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/utah-nicorn-qualtrics-updates-its-ipo-filing-with-strong-q3-results/">third quarter results for the firm</a>. Revenue was more than $100 million (up $8 million from the quarter before) and nearly 75 percent of that was gross profit. It was a strong quarterly performance and the perfect primer for a public offering.</p>
<p>The original plan was to sell 20.5 million shares in its debut for $18 to $21, which would have grossed up to $495 million, putting its valuation between $3.9 billion and $4.5 billion.</p>
<p>And then the unexpected happened.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">SAP swooped in with an $8 billion acquisition offer.</a> An offer that Qualtrics did not refuse. Its public offering was delayed (or scrapped, depending on how you look at it) yet again.</p>
<p>The idea was that SAP&#8217;s operational data combined with Qualtrics&#8217; customer and user data would be a devastating blow to the competition and give the duo an unmatched level of power. Think Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of Instagram. Think Eye of Sauron.</p>
<p>SAP CEO Bill McDermott said at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>The legacy players who carried their ‘90s technology into the 21st century just got clobbered. We have made existing participants in the market extinct.</p></blockquote>
<p>If it wasn&#8217;t clear, he was talking about competitors like Oracle, Salesforce, Microsoft and IBM.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xDbZSXakDL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">SAP agrees to buy Qualtrics for $8B in cash, just before the survey software company&#8217;s IPO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SAP agrees to buy Qualtrics for $8B in cash, just before the survey software company&#8217;s IPO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/embed/#?secret=xDbZSXakDL" data-secret="xDbZSXakDL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As part of the acquisition announcement, Qualtrics offered yet another revenue update, saying it expected excess of $400 million in revenue for 2018 and a forward growth rate of more than 40 percent, synergies from the acquisition notwithstanding.</p>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align: center;">2020</h2>
<p>Post-acquisition Qualtrics was a quieter Qualtrics, so we&#8217;ll skip past 2019 to 2020. Just 20 short months after being acquired, another twist in the plot: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/sap-will-spin-out-its-8b-spin-in-qualtrics-acquisition/">SAP announced it would spin out Qualtrics in a new IPO</a>.</p>
<p>Noting the company&#8217;s cloud growth had been in excess of 40 percent, SAP said the company would continue to be run by founder Ryan Smith and, interestingly, mentioned that Smith intends to be Qualtrics&#8217; largest individual shareholder. SAP, of course, would retain majority ownership of the company.</p>
<p>Though the announcement lacked much meat with its potatoes, it implied that Qualtrics could grow even more rapidly if not encircled by SAP&#8217;s corporate arms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="S1jDeoZEqQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/sap-will-spin-out-its-8b-spin-in-qualtrics-acquisition/">SAP will spin out its $8B spin-in Qualtrics acquisition</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SAP will spin out its $8B spin-in Qualtrics acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/sap-will-spin-out-its-8b-spin-in-qualtrics-acquisition/embed/#?secret=S1jDeoZEqQ" data-secret="S1jDeoZEqQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The spin-out strategy was a rare move for a company like SAP.</p>
<p>As my colleague Danny Crichton wrote at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>While private equity firms will take a company private and sometimes quickly turn it around in an IPO, it is rare to see a large company like SAP make such a dramatic last-minute bid for a company only to reverse that decision just months later.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here at TechCrunch we were excited about the impending IPO. Here was a company that had nearly gone public, now going public again.</p>
<p>And just as the year was coming to a close, Qualtrics dropped its first (second, technically) S-1 filing. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/unpacking-qualtrics-brand-new-s-1-filing/">digging through the numbers</a> this was our takeaway from the data:</p>
<blockquote><p>Qualtrics is growing at over 30%, and after enduring some post-acquisition costs that appear at least partially related to how SAP handled equity compensation, is back to a more acceptable level of losses on a GAAP basis and is doing perfectly fine when we observe its adjusted (non-GAAP) results.</p></blockquote>
<p>As often happens when a company goes public while having a large corporate owners, Qualtrics&#8217; accounting was harder to parse the second time around, but the bones of a nicely growing software company at scale were still there. How investors would value Utah&#8217;s giant was the next question.</p>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align: center;">2021</h2>
<p>A few weeks later, Qualtrics dropped what would prove to be its first IPO pricing interval, targeting a range of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/a-first-look-at-qualtrics-ipo-pricing/">$22 and $26</a> per share, giving the company a far larger value than it had targeted during its first run at the public markets.  Of course, Qualtrics was not only benefiting from its own growth and whatever boost it received from synergies with SAP, but also from frothy SaaS valuations and a frenetic public market.</p>
<p>At that price, with 50 million shares up for grabs, the target raise was north of $1 billion. If that sounds high recall that Qualtrics posted a revenue run rate of around $800 million. The company&#8217;s growth has kept up as well, with the company&#8217;s Q4 2020 midpoint revenue expanding more than 23% compared to its Q4 2019 performance.</p>
<p>All said and done, the S-1/A pegged Qualtrics&#8217; early 2021 valuation at anywhere from $11.2 billion to $13.3 billion. Alex Wilhelm is much better at breaking down the numbers than me (or anyone, really) so I urge you to take a look at his coverage.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="glXJa2iOif"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/a-first-look-at-qualtrics-ipo-pricing/">A first look at Qualtrics&#8217; IPO pricing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A first look at Qualtrics&#8217; IPO pricing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/a-first-look-at-qualtrics-ipo-pricing/embed/#?secret=glXJa2iOif" data-secret="glXJa2iOif" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Wilhelm was also astute enough to recognize that the share pricing for Qualtrics&#8217; IPO would likely be adjusted higher. And it was!</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/qualtrics-raises-ipo-pricing-ahead-of-debut/">Qualtrics raised its share price from $22 &#8211; $26 to between $27 and $29</a>, putting the valuation range between $13.8 billion to $14.8 billion. Yowzah!</p>
<ul>
<li>New Qualtrics low-end IPO run rate multiple: 16.2x.</li>
<li>New Qualtrics high-end IPO run rate multiple: 17.4x.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wilhelm noted that the Qualtrics share price may go up yet again, but also explained that while the multiples in play may feel low, it&#8217;s tough to be certain:</p>
<blockquote><p>Those do not seem to be particularly high multiples for Qualtrics, given recent market norms. However, trying to decipher the public market lately has been similar to reading the Rosetta Stone, but written in Wingdings. While on acid. So, you never know what is going to happen when a company starts to trade.</p></blockquote>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hK89Y0apap"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/qualtrics-raises-ipo-pricing-ahead-of-debut/">Qualtrics raises IPO pricing ahead of debut</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Qualtrics raises IPO pricing ahead of debut&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/qualtrics-raises-ipo-pricing-ahead-of-debut/embed/#?secret=hK89Y0apap" data-secret="hK89Y0apap" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There is one thing we know for sure: Qualtrics has showed growth in revenue and more profitability than most software companies during its entire existence. We&#8217;ve been waiting for this IPO for years now, literally, and while many pieces of the puzzle are uncertain, we&#8217;ll get our answers soon enough.</p>
<p>Unless of course some giant firm swoops in with a $20 billion acquisition offer. Now wouldn&#8217;t that be fitting?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.clubfeast.com/">Club Feast</a>, a startup with a more affordable approach to meal delivery, is announcing that it has raised $3.5 million in seed funding led by General Catalyst.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Atallah Atallah, Ghazi Atallah and Chris Miao. The basic concept is pretty simple: Restaurant delivery that only costs $5.99 per dish — cheaper than almost anything you&#8217;d find on other delivery services. (The startup also charges diners a $2 delivery fee, as well as a $1 fee for single meal orders.)</p>
<p>Atallah Atallah, who previously co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/restaurant-rewards-booking-app-seated-nabs-30m-acquires-venuebook-to-add-events/">restaurant rewards company Seated</a> and serves as Club Feast&#8217;s CEO, said the startup works with restaurants to select a few meals that they can afford to offer at the $5.99 price. Diners, meanwhile, sign up for a weekly meal plan and place their orders at least 24 hours ahead of time. The restaurant then knows exactly how much of a dish will be purchased, so they can plan ahead and cook in an efficient and economical way.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We really work with them to create a meal that they can make at a price that works for their users,&#8221; Atallah said. Plus, he noted that with all the orders placed ahead of time, Club Feast and its partners can plan the best routes without having to build sophisticated algorithms for optimizing on-demand deliveries: &#8220;Sometimes the best solutions are the simplest ones.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100785" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100785" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2100785" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Atallah-Atallah-.jpg?w=449" alt="Club Feast CEO Atallah Atallah" width="449" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Atallah-Atallah-.jpg 1057w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Atallah-Atallah-.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Atallah-Atallah-.jpg?resize=198,300 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Atallah-Atallah-.jpg?resize=768,1163 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Atallah-Atallah-.jpg?resize=449,680 449w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Atallah-Atallah-.jpg?resize=1015,1536 1015w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Atallah-Atallah-.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100785" class="wp-caption-text">Club Feast CEO Atallah Atallah. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Club Feast</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, that requires more planning and upfront commitment from diners. However, Atallah noted that while meal credits are purchased via weekly subscription, they can be paused or spent at any time. He also suggested that he doesn&#8217;t see Club Feast as a direct competitor to on-demand food delivery — instead, he suggested that he continues to use DoorDash and Uber Eats for spur-of-the-moment orders or special occasions, while Club Feast is a more affordable option for regular meals.</p>
<p>&#8220;With our price point, our average user orders eight times a month,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why not make the pie much bigger?&#8221;</p>
<p>Atallah added that Club Feast is diversifying the food options on the platform by adding side dishes and desserts. And it could eventually introduce higher prices for fancier meals, but he said, &#8220;We want to make sure that does not affect the $5.99 concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup currently makes deliveries in San Francisco and San Mateo, where it works with restaurants including The Halal Guys, Kasa Indian Eatery, HRD and Kitava. With the new funding, it plans to expand throughout the Bay Area and into New York City.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic exposed significant gaps in the food delivery industry, and we’re proud to support Club Feast on their mission to make the experience more affordable for both restaurants and consumers,&#8221; said General Catalyst Managing Director Niko Bonatsos in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced that <a href="https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp">BeyondCorp Enterprise</a>, the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3247848/what-is-zero-trust-a-model-for-more-effective-security.html">zero trust</a> security platform modeled after how Google itself keeps its network safe without relying on a VPN, is now generally available. BeyondCorp Enterprise builds out Google&#8217;s existing BeyondCorp Remote Access offering with additional enterprise features. Google describes it as &#8220;a zero trust solution that enables secure access with integrated threat and data protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the course of the last few years, Google &#8212; and especially its Cloud unit &#8212; has evangelized the zero trust model and built a large partner network around this idea. Those partners include the likes of Check Point, Citrix, CrowdStrike, Symantec and VMWare.</p>
<p>As part of BeyondCorp Enterprise, businesses get an end-to-end zero trust solution that includes everything from DDoS protection and phishing-resistant authentication, to the new security features in the Chrome browser and the core continuous authorization features that protect every interaction between users and resources protected by BeyondCorp.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The rapid move to the cloud and remote work are creating dynamic work environments that promise to drive new levels of productivity and innovation. But they have also opened the door to a host of new security concerns and sparked a significant increase in cyberattacks,&#8221; said Fermin Serna, chief information security officer at Citrix. &#8220;To defend against them, enterprises must take an intelligent approach to workspace security that protects employees without getting in the way of their experience following the zero trust model.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a>, the media software maker that&#8217;s expanded into streaming in recent years, is adding to its service once again with today&#8217;s launch of game streaming. Unlike other game streaming efforts from companies like Microsoft or Google, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.plex.tv%2Farcade&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbDBEV1VZWEgxWGRScDhUOW5NcDN2SzBtVDRoZ3xBQ3Jtc0trWjhCMDdhTElBSVduTDQyRDJrSV9IaTVmNklWMmJ0T1hLblh1WTJBYWNuSEFYdHc5OGFPc08xVUhlZmtjclRXQzB2WGdXZXV1WWdlRzlGZVREU2l3cHIwcGJmd1QtNUFMUG12c0VWaFVSRTQtMlA0VQ%3D%3D&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=SYepu_5oSOc">the new &#8220;Plex Arcade&#8221;</a> isn&#8217;t focused on top gaming titles and new releases, but rather on retro games. At launch, the service is offering around 30 games, including titles like Asteroids, Centipede, Missile Command, Adventure and Ninja Golf.</p>
<p>The game streaming service was spun out of Plex&#8217;s in-house incubator, Plex Labs, and represents more of a passion project for the company, rather than some larger shift in direction, we&#8217;re told. The technology to make it available was already 95% built, so the team decided to put together the game streaming service as a surprise for users, as well as a way to expand Plex&#8217;s core mission of becoming a broader entertainment platform.</p>
<p>The company says it actually kicked around the idea of adding games to Plex for years, but over the course of 2020 in particular, the team was drawn to the idea even more out of personal interest and a need for a distraction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2100670" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100670" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2100670" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Library-Screen-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Library-Screen-1.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Library-Screen-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Library-Screen-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Library-Screen-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Library-Screen-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Library-Screen-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Library-Screen-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100670" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Plex</p></div></p>
<p>The game service was built with the help of new partner <a href="https://parsec.app/">Parsec</a> and its underlying, low-latency streaming technology, Plex says. This made it possible to bring fully playable game libraries to Plex.</p>
<p>To build the game library, Plex partnered with Atari to license a catalog of classic titles.</p>
<p>At launch, the full list of games include: 3D Tic-Tac-Toe, Adventure, Alien Brigade, Aquaventure, Asteroids, Avalanche, Basketbrawl, Centipede, Combat, Dark Chambers, Desert Falcon, Fatal Run, Food Fight (Charley Chuck’s), Gravitar, Haunted House, Human Cannonball, Lunar Battle, Lunar Lander, Major Havoc, Millipede, Missile Command, Motor Psycho, Ninja Golf, Outlaw, Planet Smashers, Radar Lock, Sky Diver, Sky Raider, Solaris and Super Breakout.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYepu_5oSOc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Due to the partnership and licensing fees involved with the project, Plex Arcade will not be a free addition.</p>
<p>Instead, it will be offered as a separate subscription for $2.99 per month for existing Plex Pass subscribers (Plex&#8217;s existing $4.99/mo plan). For nonsubscribers, Plex Arcade is $4.99 per month. A free, 7-day trial is also available.</p>
<p>Plex Arcade&#8217;s server will require either a Windows or Mac to run (due to Parsec&#8217;s limitations), which means it won&#8217;t work on Linux, NAS devices or NVIDIA Shield. Gameplay, meanwhile, is restricted to iOS, Android (mobile or TV), tvOS and the Chrome web browser.</p>
<p>It will also support Bluetooth and USB game controllers that are compatible with your device, or you can use a keyboard for Chrome-based gaming. Plex recommends the Sony DualShock 4 or Xbox One controller for the best results.</p>

<p>The company is taking a wait-and-see approach to expanding the service over time. If it demonstrates interest and traction in the form of subscriptions, Plex may consider growing it further.</p>
<p>Plex Arcade is the latest addition to what&#8217;s now a growing lineup of entertainment options for Plex users.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, the media software company has moved beyond being a tool to organize home media collections to also allow users to do things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/plex-becomes-a-low-cost-diy-streaming-tv-service/">stream live TV</a> from an antenna <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/plex-launches-a-live-tv-service-with-over-80-free-channels-most-available-worldwide/">or via the web</a>, listen to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/29/plex-teams-with-tidal-to-bring-a-discounted-streaming-music-subscription-to-its-media-app/">music</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/podcasts-are-coming-to-plex-followed-by-web-series-and-other-digital-media/">podcasts,</a> watch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/plex-partners-with-lionsgate-to-expand-its-ad-supported-video-library/">ad-supported movies and TV,</a> watch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/plex-adds-personalized-streaming-news-to-its-media-player-software/">the news</a> and more.</p>
<p>These efforts are slowly paying off in terms of user growth. In 2017, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/plex-acquires-watchup-to-bring-streaming-news-to-its-media-app/">Plex had 10 million registered users</a>. A couple of years later, it had 15 million. Today, Plex says it has 25 million users.</p>
<p>Plex Arcade is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.plex.tv%2Farcade&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbDBEV1VZWEgxWGRScDhUOW5NcDN2SzBtVDRoZ3xBQ3Jtc0trWjhCMDdhTElBSVduTDQyRDJrSV9IaTVmNklWMmJ0T1hLblh1WTJBYWNuSEFYdHc5OGFPc08xVUhlZmtjclRXQzB2WGdXZXV1WWdlRzlGZVREU2l3cHIwcGJmd1QtNUFMUG12c0VWaFVSRTQtMlA0VQ%3D%3D&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=SYepu_5oSOc">available</a> as of today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dallas-based Nomad set out to take an age-old cooking method and modernize it — but not by introducing connected or smart features. Instead, the <a href="https://nomadgrills.com/products/nomad-grill-smoker">Nomad Grill &amp; Smoker</a> takes classic charcoal grilling and relies on clever industrial design to make it packable and portable, while making sure cooks of all expertise levels can make great-tasting food even if they&#8217;re cooking with charcoal for the first time.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>Nomad&#8217;s grill looks like some kind of fancy protective case that you&#8217;d expect to see traveling with a film crew, crossed with maybe a modern Mac Pro. It has an anodized aluminum build that uses a unibody casting in manufacturing, with high external durability and internal heat retention. It measures roughly 2 feet by 2 feet and is around 9.5 inches tall when closed, with a total weight of 28 lbs. including the cast stainless steel grill grate that&#8217;s included in the basic package.</p>
<p>28 lbs. may seem like a lot, but it&#8217;s remarkably light for the cooking surface you get with the Nomad, which adds up to either 212 square inches of space in single-grate closed mode (good for smoking) or up to 425 square inches in open-grill mode, which can double the cooking surface with the purchase of an optional second grate and charcoal placed in either side (better for open-flame BBQing).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The case features a strong and durable dual-latch closure system and a reinforced handle for toting it around. Silicon skids offer protection for surfaces when laying the grill down to cook and there are two magnetic air vents on either side for controlling airflow and flame, which are adjusted simply by manually sliding.</p>
<h2>Design and performance</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2100763" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100763" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2100763" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nomad_Pool2529.jpg-copy.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="422" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nomad_Pool2529.jpg-copy.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nomad_Pool2529.jpg-copy.jpg?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nomad_Pool2529.jpg-copy.jpg?resize=300,124 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nomad_Pool2529.jpg-copy.jpg?resize=768,316 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nomad_Pool2529.jpg-copy.jpg?resize=680,280 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nomad_Pool2529.jpg-copy.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100763" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nomad</p></div></p>
<p>The Nomad design is deceptively simple — at heart it&#8217;s essentially a metal box. But looking below the surface a bit, it actually hides some very advanced construction, including a layered shell design that means the outside never actually gets too hot, which is great not only for chef safety but also for setting it down on a wide range of materials during the actual cooking process. For a portable grill, that&#8217;s a huge benefit.</p>
<p>Looking at the grill grate specifically, it features a honeycomb design that helps better distribute the heat, which is also domed subtly to allow more clearance for the charcoal underneath. It&#8217;s removable, but also snaps into place in the grill itself using magnets, which is great for transport and also for ensuring things don&#8217;t move around with any bumps.</p>
<p>One other huge benefit that seems like a small thing at first glance is a built-in thermometer that&#8217;s molded into the case. This provides you easy, clear temperature readings for the grill, and it&#8217;s analog so there&#8217;s no power required — another big benefit for portability.</p>
<p>In practice, the grill works exactly as you&#8217;d expect a great charcoal grill to work, which is amazing given its size and portability. It should definitely be mentioned that you&#8217;re going to be much happier getting the grill lit if you pick yourself up a charcoal chimney, which eases the lighting process — but that&#8217;s a great accessory regardless of what kind of charcoal grill you&#8217;re using.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100764" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100764" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2100764" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NOMAD-Tailgate-755-lg.jpg-copy.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NOMAD-Tailgate-755-lg.jpg-copy.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NOMAD-Tailgate-755-lg.jpg-copy.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NOMAD-Tailgate-755-lg.jpg-copy.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NOMAD-Tailgate-755-lg.jpg-copy.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NOMAD-Tailgate-755-lg.jpg-copy.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NOMAD-Tailgate-755-lg.jpg-copy.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100764" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nomad</p></div></p>
<p>I was particularly impressed by the Nomad grill&#8217;s performance when it comes to smoking. It maintains an even and consistent temperature with the box closed, and it&#8217;s easy to moderate the temperature with the built-in vents if you need to adjust the cooking intensity. The proximity of the charcoal to the food also imbues it with great flavor.</p>
<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>The Nomad Grill &amp; Smoker is $599, which is a fairly high asking price, but it&#8217;s also unique in the market for the convenience it provides combined with the performance it offers. Whether at home or on road trips, Nomad is a wonderful addition to any home cook&#8217;s arsenal, and an all-in-one supplement that can replace even a dedicated, more fixed installation charcoal grill if that&#8217;s the way you want to go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building a startup is never easy, especially when you’re in the early innings and navigating a huge learning curve. Education, support and sage advice are arguably as essential to startup success as fundraising. Find all that — and connect with your early-founder community — at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/">TC Early Stage 2021</a>.</p>
<p>We’re hosting two of these virtual bootcamps designed for early-stage startup founders and open to investors, later-stage founders and other startup enthusiasts. Early Stage part one focuses on operations and fundraising takes place on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/">April 1-2</a> and Early Stage part two focusing on marketing, PR and fundraising runs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">July 8-9</a>. This is not a lather, rinse, repeat scenario, folks. Each event features a distinct lineup of startup experts, topics, workshops and interactive Q&amp;As.</p>
<p>We’re talking core startup disciplines like building a pitch deck, marketing, term sheets, fundraising, tech stack, operations, product-market fit, content development, growth and lots more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Early-bird pricing:</strong> We offer two pass levels — Founder and Innovator. Plus, don’t miss the sweet discount when you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets">buy a ticket</a> for both events.</p>
<p>Early Stage events offer lots of opportunity for meaningful connection and, because they’re virtual, you can connect with early-stage founders and influencers across the globe. CrunchMatch, our free AI-powered networking platform, helps narrow the field so you connect and schedule meetings with people who align with your specific business goals.</p>
<p>Ashley Barrington, founder of MarketPearl, had this to say about networking at Early Stage 2020:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Early Stage virtual platform lets you network with attendees all over the world, and that was a big benefit. CrunchMatch made it easy to set up short networking sessions with other early-stage founders to learn what they&#8217;re working on, pool resources and connect for potential future opportunities. I also used it to meet founders in adjacent areas like climate or B2B SaaS — interesting people I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have connected with otherwise.</p></blockquote>
<p>At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/">Early Stage 2021</a> you’ll learn from the best experts in the startup ecosystem, develop the essential skills for startup success and tap into a support system to get you through the challenging times.</p>
<blockquote><p>TechCrunch does this thing — and they did it amazingly well in a virtual event — of connecting total strangers to create a genuinely supportive community. We’re all trying to do the same thing, which is bring our idea to life and make it a reality. I loved that unexpected benefit. — Jessica McLean, director of Marketing and Communications, Infinite-Compute.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One big theme in tech right now is the rise of services to help us keep working through lockdowns, office closures, and other Covid-19 restrictions. The “future of work” — cloud services, communications, productivity apps — has become “the way we work now.” And companies that have identified ways to help with this are seeing a boom.</p>
<p>Today comes news from a startup that has been a part of that trend: <a href="http://calendly.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calendly</a>, a popular cloud-based service that people use to set up and confirm meeting times with others, has closed an investment of $350 million from OpenView Venture Partners and Iconiq.</p>
<p>The funding round includes both primary and secondary money (slightly more of the latter than the former, from what I understand) and values the Atlanta-based startup at over $3 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not bad for a company that before now had raised just $550,000, including the life savings of the founder and CEO, Tope Awotona, to initially get off the ground.</p>
<p>Calendly is a freemium software-as-a-service, built around what is essentially a very simple piece of functionality.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a platform that provides a quick way to manage open spaces in your calendar for people to book appointments with you in those spaces, which then also books out the time in calendars like Google’s or Microsoft Outlook — with a growing number of tools to enhance that experience, including the ability to pay for a service in the event that your appointment is not a business meeting but, say, a yoga class. <a href="https://calendly.com/pages/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pricing</a> ranges from free (one calendar/one user/one event) to premium ($8/month) and pro ($12/month) for more calendars, events, integrations and features, with bigger packages for enterprises also available.</p>
<p>Its growth, meanwhile, has to date been based mostly around a very organic strategy: Calendly invites become links to Calendly itself, so people who use it and like it can (and do) start to use it, too.</p>
<p>The wide range of its use cases, and the virality of that growth strategy, have been winners. Calendly is already profitable, and it has been for years. And more recently, it has seen a boost, specifically in the last twelve months, as new Calendly users have emerged, as a result of how we are living.</p>
<p>We may not be doing more traditional “business meetings” per week, but the number of meetings we now need to set up, has gone up.</p>
<p>All of the serendipitous and impromptu encounters we used to have around an office, or a neighborhood coffee shop, or the park? Those are now scheduled. Teachers and students meeting for a remote lesson? Those also need invitations for online meetings.</p>
<p>And so do sessions with therapists, virtual dinner parties, and even (where they can still happen) in-person meetings, which are often now happening with more timed precision and more record-keeping, to keep social distancing and potential contact tracing in better order.</p>
<p>Currently, some 10 million of us are using Calendly for all of this on a monthly basis, with that number growing 1,180% last year. The army of business users from companies like Twilio, Zoom, and UCSF has been joined by teachers, contractors, entrepreneurs, and freelancers, the company says.</p>
<p>The company last year made about $70 million annually in subscription revenues from its SaaS-based business model and seems confident that its aggregated revenues will not long from now get to $1 billion.</p>
<p>So while the secondary funding is going towards giving liquidity to existing investors and early employees, Awotona said the plan will be to use the primary capital to invest in the company’s business.</p>
<p>That will include building out its platform with more tools and integrations — it started with and still has a substantial R&amp;D operation in Kiev, Ukraine — expanding its operations with more talent (it currently has around 200 employees and plans to double headcount), further business development and more.</p>
<p>Two notable moves on that front are also being announced with the funding: Jeff Diana is coming on as chief people officer with a mission to double the company’s employee base. And Patrick Moran — formerly of Quip and New Relic — is joing as Calendly’s first chief revenue officer. Notably, both are based in San Francisco &#8212; not Atlanta.</p>
<p>That focus for building in San Francisco is already a big change for Calendly. The startup, which is going on eight years old, has been somewhat off the radar for years.</p>
<p>That is in part due to the fact that it raised very little money up to now (just $550,000 from a handful of <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/63998-92/company/profile#investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">investors</a> that include OpenView, Atlanta Ventures, IncWell and Greenspring Associates).</p>
<p>It’s also based in Atlanta, an increasingly notable city for technology startups and other companies but more often than not short on being credited for its heft in that department (SalesLoft, Amex-acquired Kabbage, OneTrust, Bakkt, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/atlanta-startups/hub_overview_default/top?tab=top_orgs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many others</a> are based there, with others like Mailchimp also not too far away).</p>
<p>And perhaps most of all, proactively courting publicity did not appear to be part of Calendly’s growth playbook.</p>
<p>In fact, Calendly might have closed this big round quietly and continued to get on with business, were it not for a short <a href="https://twitter.com/genuinfo/status/1329206813611331584?s=20">Tweet</a> last autumn that signaled the company raising money and shaping up to be a quiet giant.</p>
<p>“The company’s capital efficiency and what <a href="https://twitter.com/TopeAwotona">@TopeAwotona</a> has built deserve way more credit than they get,&#8221; it read. &#8220;Perhaps this will start to change that recognition.”</p>
<p>After that short note on Twitter — flagged on TechCrunch’s internal message board — I made a guess at Awotona&#8217;s email, sent a note introducing myself, and waited to see if I would get a reply.</p>
<p>I eventually did get a response, in the form of a short note agreeing to chat, with a Calendly link (naturally) to choose a time.</p>
<p>(Thanks, unnamed TC writer, for never writing about Calendly when Tope originally pitched you years ago: you may have whet his appetite to respond to me.)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">After years of little or no attention, he was getting cold-contacted by me </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/19/calendly-founder-tope-awotona-startup-unicorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and it seems others</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, all of us suddenly interested in him and his company.</span></p>
<p>“It’s been the bane of my life,” he said to me with a laugh about the calls he’s been getting.</p>
<p>Part of me thinks it’s because it can be hard and distracting to balance responding to people, but it’s also because he works hard, and has always worked hard, so doesn’t understand what the new fuss is about.</p>
<p>A lot of those calls have been from would-be investors.</p>
<p>“It’s been exorbitant, the amount of interest Calendly has been getting, from backers of all shapes and sizes,” Blake Bartlett, a partner at OpenView, said to me in an interview.</p>
<p>From what I understand, it&#8217;s had inbound interest from a number of strategic tech companies, as well as a long list of financial investors. That process eventually whittled down to just two backers, OpenView and Iconiq.</p>
<h2>From Lagos to fixing cash registers</h2>
<p>Yet even putting the rumors of the funding to one side, Calendly and Awotona himself have been a remarkable story up to now, one that champions immigrants as well as startup grit.</p>
<p>Tope comes from Lagos, Nigeria, part of a large, middle class household. His mother had been the chief pharmacist for the Nigerian Central Bank, his father worked for Unilever.</p>
<p>The family may have been comfortable, but growing up in Lagos, a city riven by economic disparity and crime, brought its share of tragedies. When he was 12, Awotona&#8217;s father was murdered in front of him during a carjacking. The family moved to the U.S. some time after that, and since then his mother has also passed away.</p>
<p>A bright student who actually finished high school at 15, Awotona cut his teeth in the world of business first by studying it — his major at the University of Georgia was management information systems — and then working in it, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bawotona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jobs after college</a> including periods at IBM and EMC.</p>
<p>But it seems Awotona was also an entrepreneur at heart — if one that initially was not prepared for the steps he needed to take to get something off the ground.</p>
<p>He told me a story about what he describes as his “first foray into business” at age 18, which involved devising and patenting a new feature for cash registers, so that they could use optical character recognition recognize which bills and change were being used for, and dispense the right amount a customer might need in return after paying.</p>
<p>At the time, he was working at a pharmacy while studying and saw how often the change in the cash registers didn’t add up correctly, and his was his idea for how to fix it.</p>
<p>He cold-contacted the leading cash register company at the time, NCR, with his idea. NCR was interested, offering to send him up to Ohio, where it was headquartered then, to pitch the idea to the company directly, and maybe sell the patent in the process. Awotona, however, froze.</p>
<p>“I was blown away,” he said, but also too surprised at how quickly things escalated. He turned down the offer, and ultimately let his patent application lapse. (Computer-vision-based scanning systems and automatic dispensers are, of course, a basic part nowadays of self-checkout systems, for those times when people pay in cash.)</p>
<p>There were several other entrepreneurial attempts, none particularly successful and at times quite frustrating because of the grunt work involved just to speak to people, before his businesses themselves could even be considered.</p>
<p>Eventually, it was the grunt work that then started to catch Awotona’s attention.</p>
<p>“What led me to create a scheduling product” — Awotona said, clear not to describe it as a calendaring service — “was my personal need. At the time wasn&#8217;t looking to start a business. I just was trying to schedule a meeting, but it took way too many emails to get it done, and I became frustrated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I decided that I was going to look for scheduling products that existed on the market that I could sign up for,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;but the problem I was facing at the time was I was trying to arrange a meeting with, you know, 10 or 20 people. I was just looking for an easy way for us to easily share our availability and, you know, easily find a time that works for everybody.”</p>
<p>He said he couldn’t really see anything that worked the way he wanted — the products either needed you to commit to a subscription right away (Calendly is freemium) or were geared at specific verticals such as beauty salons. All that eventually led to a recognition, he said, “that there was a big opportunity to solve that problem.”</p>
<p>The building of the startup was partly done with engineers in Kiev — a drama in itself that pivoted at times on the political situation at times in Ukraine (you can read a great unfolding of that story <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/19/calendly-founder-tope-awotona-startup-unicorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).</p>
<p>Awotona says that he admired the new guard of cloud-based services like Dropbox and decided that he wanted Calendly to be built using “the Dropbox approach” — something that could be adopted and adapted by different kinds of users and usages.</p>
<h2>Simplicity in the frontend, strategy at the backend</h2>
<p>On the surface, there is a simplicity to the company’s product: it’s basically about finding a time for two parties to meet. Awotona notes that behind the scenes the scheduling help Calendly provides is the key to what it might develop next.</p>
<p>For example, there are now tools to help people prepare for meetings — specifically features like being able to, say, pay for something that’s been scheduled on Calendly in order to register. A future focus could well be more tools for following up on those meetings, and more ways to help people plan recurring individual or group events.</p>
<p>One area where it seems Calendly does not want to dabble are those meetings themselves &#8212; that is, hosting meetings and videoconferencing itself.</p>
<p>“What you don&#8217;t want is to start a world war three with Zoom,” Awotona joked. (In addition to becoming the very verb-ified definition of video conferencing, Zoom is also a customer of Calendly’s.)</p>
<p>“We really see ourselves as a leading orchestration platform. What that means is that we really want to remain extensible and flexible. We want our users to bring their own best in class products,” he said. “We think about this in an agnostic way.”</p>
<p>But in a technology world that usually defaults back to the power of platforms, that position is not without its challenges.</p>
<p>“Calendly has a vision increasingly to be a central part of the meeting life cycle. What happens before, during and after the meeting. Historically, the obvious was before the meeting, but now it’s looking at integrations, automations and other things, so that it all magically happens. But moving into the rest of the lifecycle is a lot of opportunity but also many players,” admitted Bartlett, with others including older startups like X.ai and Doodle (owned by Swiss-based Tamedia) or newer entrants like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/undock-raises-1-6m-to-help-solve-your-group-scheduling-nightmares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Undock</a> but also biggies like Google and Microsoft.</p>
<p>“It will be an interesting task to see where there are opportunities to partner or build or buy to build out its competitive position.”</p>
<p>You’ll notice that throughout this story I didn’t refer to Awotona&#8217;s position as a black founder — still very much a rarity among startups, and especially those valued at over $1 billion.</p>
<p>That is partly because in my conversations with him, it emerged that he saw it as just another detail. Still, it is one that is brought up a lot, he said, and so he understands it is important for others.</p>
<p>“I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about being black or not black,” he said. “It doesn’t change how I approach or built Calendly. I’m not incredibly conscious of my race or color, except for the last few years through he growth of Calendly. I find that more people approach me as a black tech founder, and that there is young black people who are inspired by the story.”</p>
<p>That is something he hopes to build on in the near future, including in his home country.</p>
<p>Pending pandemic chaos, he has plans to try to visit Nigeria later this year and to get more involved in the ecosystem in that country, I’m guessing as a mentor if not more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just know the country that produced me,” he said. “There are a million Topes in Nigeria. The difference for me was my parents. But I’m not a diamond in the rough, and I want to get involved in some way to help with that full potential.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, the increasingly popular <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/">DevOps platform</a>, today announced a major update to its subscription model. The company is doing away with its $4/month Bronze/Starter package. Current users will be able to renew one more time at the existing price or move to a higher tier (and receive a significant discount for the first three years after they do so).</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s free tier, it is worth noting, is not going away and GitLab argues that it includes &#8220;89% of the features in Bronze/Starter.&#8221;</p>
<p>As GitLab founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij told me, this was a difficult decision for the team. He acknowledged that this is a big change for those on the Bronze plan. &#8220;I hope that they see that we did our homework and that we have great legacy pricing,&#8221; Sijbrandij said, and added that the company will listen to feedback from its users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To ease the pain, Bronze users will be able to renew their existing subscription before January 26, 2022 for an additional year at the existing price. They can also opt to move to the Premium tier at a discounted price for the next three years, starting at $6/user/month in Year 1, but that price then goes up to $9/user/month and $15/user/month in Year 2 and 3 respectively. For new users, the Bronze package is no longer available, starting now.</p>

<p>In the end, this was a purely financial decision for GitLab. As Sijbrandij told me, the company was losing money on every Bronze-tier customer. &#8220;The Bronze tier, we were selling at a loss,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We were just losing money every time we sold it &#8212; just on hosting and support. To be a sustainable business, this was a move we had to make. It&#8217;s a big transition for our customers but we want to make sure we&#8217;re a sustainable company and we can keep investing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sijbrandij told me the team looked at increasing the price of the Bronze tier to make it profitable. &#8220;We looked at all options, but in the end, you&#8217;re going to have an offering that is very similar to Premium. It would be too much overlap between the two,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>With this change, GitLab now offers three tiers: Free, Premium and Ultimate (it&#8217;s also doing away with the &#8220;Silver/Premium&#8221; and &#8220;Gold/Ultimate&#8221; naming).</p>
<p>The free tier, which in terms of total users is the most popular plan on GitLab, will remain in place. While it is surely a loss-leader for GitLab, it only comes with limited CI/CD credits and doesn&#8217;t include any support options, so the overall loss here must have been worth it for the company. Sijbrandij also noted that, as an open core company, having a free and open offering is simply a must.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has a vaping problem. Although <a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/retail-sales-tobacco-products/tobacco-21">a 2019 U.S. law</a> made it illegal to sell or market e-cigarettes to anyone under the age of 21, TikTok videos featuring top brands of disposable e-cigarettes and vapes for sale have been relatively easy to find on the app. These videos, set to popular and upbeat music, clearly target a teenage customer base with offers of <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-finalizes-enforcement-policy-unauthorized-flavored-cartridge-based-e-cigarettes-appeal-children">now-unauthorized cartridge flavors</a> like fruit and mint in the form of a disposable vape. Some sellers even promote their &#8220;discreet&#8221; packaging services, where the vapes they ship to customers can be hidden from parents&#8217; prying eyes by being placed under the package&#8217;s stuffing or tucked inside other products, like makeup bags or fuzzy slippers.</p>
<p>Interest in flavored, disposable vapes that appeal to teens and young adults, in particular, has been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/600c4aa443dde043aad6f70a00251fa0">growing in the wake of the FDA&#8217;s Juul crackdown</a>.</p>
<p>In February 2020, the FDA first began to take enforcement action against <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market">illegally marketed</a> e-cigarette devices, including those offering flavors besides tobacco or menthol, as well as those targeted towards minors &#8212; an action that was designed to target Juul.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a result, disposable vapes like Puff Bar were adopted by some young people who were still in search of flavors like bubblegum, peach, strawberry and others. These cheaper disposables were easy to find, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/600c4aa443dde043aad6f70a00251fa0">continued to be available</a> at convenience stores and gas stations.</p>
<p>But they&#8217;re also all over TikTok, ready to be shipped with anyone with a way to pay.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DbfEx4ll2M0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, when this content is reported to TikTok, it&#8217;s not always taken down.</p>
<p>TechCrunch found vape sellers marketing on TikTok who have been using the app to communicate with customers through both videos and comments. They also direct viewers to what appear to be illegally operating websites. Their TikTok videos often show off the seller&#8217;s current inventory of vapes, including disposables like Puff Bar in teen-friendly flavors.</p>
<p>Essentially, the sellers are using TikTok as a way to create vape advertisements they don&#8217;t have to pay for that are capable of reaching young consumers &#8212; an audience whose interest in vaping hasn&#8217;t necessarily declined because of the FDA&#8217;s action.</p>
<p>According to nonprofit tobacco control organization Truth Initiative&#8217;s<a href="https://truthinitiative.org/press/press-release/new-report-shows-youth-e-cigarette-use-remains-epidemic-levels-and-harm"> latest study,</a> use of Juul decreased between 2019 and 2020, but it remains the most popular e-cigarette brand among 10th and 12th graders who were current vapers at 41%. The report also found that disposable products such as Puff Bar (8%) and Smok (13.1%) have gained during this time.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GHGFcBocZls?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Taken together, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6937e1.htm?s_cid=mm6937e1_w">2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS</a>) and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6937e2.htm?s_cid=mm6937e2_w">new e-cigarette sales data</a> report illustrate how the current federal policy enabled youth to quickly migrate to menthol e-cigarettes (especially Juul menthol pods) when mint-flavored products were removed from the marketplace, and for inexpensive, flavored disposable e-cigarettes such as Puff Bar to soar in popularity,&#8221; Truth stated in September 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;With kid magnet names like cotton candy and banana ice, the market share of disposable products nearly doubled in just 10 months from August 2019 to May 2020,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The scale of the problem on TikTok is also significant.</p>
<p>Today, U.S. teens account for an estimated 32.5% of TikTok&#8217;s U.S. active users, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095186/tiktok-us-users-age/">third-party estimates</a> published by Statista. The company has around 100 million monthly active users in the U.S., <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-reveals-us-global-user-growth-numbers-for-first-time.html">it said last year.</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, videos tagged with popular vape and e-cigarette brands and keywords have racked up hundreds of millions of views.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlsCxHPQuhA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>For example, the hashtag for leading vape brand Juul (#juul) has 623.9 million views on TikTok, as of the time of writing.</p>
<p>Puff Bar, the maker of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-02-20/vaping-loophole">a single-use vaping product with Chinese origins</a>, has 449.8 million views for the hashtag #puffbar. Other brands have some traction, as well. #NJOY has 55.3 million views, #smok has 40.1 million views, and British Tobacco&#8217;s #Vuse has 5 million views.</p>
<p>These are just the views associated with the hashtag itself. For every search, there are multiple variations. For instance, #puffbars, #puffbarplus and #puffbardealer have 66.8 million views, 9.6 million views and 8.9 million views, respectively. Tags like #juulgang (590.4 million views) have become popular enough that anti-vaping content creators have adopted them as a means of counter-programming against vaping content.</p>
<p>These trends are particularly concerning given the large, young demographic that uses TikTok. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html">third of its U.S. users</a> may be 14 or under, in fact.</p>
<p>In the U.S. App Store, TikTok is rated for ages 12 and up and on Google Play, its content rating is &#8220;Teen.&#8221; But while TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">has modified the default privacy settings</a> for young people&#8217;s accounts and has been quick to block other controversial hashtags in the past (like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">those around U.S. election conspiracies)</a>, it has allowed vaping-related content to remain easy to find.</p>
<p>In addition to the popular vaping hashtags prevalent on TikTok, we uncovered numerous vape sellers operating under obvious account names such as &#8220;@puffsonthelow,&#8221; &#8220;@PuffUniverse&#8221; and &#8220;@Puffbarcafe,&#8221; for example. Their pages were filled with vape videos boldly marketing their current selections, hashtagged with vape-related terms like #puffbarchallenge, #puffplus, #vapetricks and others.</p>
<p>In some cases, we found vape sellers had even tagged their videos with #kids and other trending tags.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/svYgxMNIpiM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Knowing that their target market is often teenage vapers, many videos depicted how the seller could package the vape inside another product or hide it in the stuffing so parents wouldn&#8217;t find out. We saw videos of vapes packaged underneath candy, inside makeup bags, inside socks, underneath other lager products, and more.</p>
<p>Through links published to the account&#8217;s profile or referenced in the videos, TikTok users are redirected to the sellers&#8217; websites or even Discord channels where they would only sometimes be presented with an age verification pop-up.</p>
<p>Often, they could just add items to a basket and check out. Many sellers also directed their customers to pay using PayPal, Venmo and/or Cash App, instead of accepting standard credit card payments.</p>

<p>None of this is legal, according to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, a leading American nonprofit focused on reducing tobacco consumption, particularly among youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s illegal to market these products or to engage in marketing that appeals directly to anybody under the age of 21,&#8221; Matt Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, told TechCrunch. &#8220;And it&#8217;s illegal to actually conduct a sales transaction without age verification.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100366" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100366" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2100366" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7229.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7229.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7229.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7229.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7229.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7229.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7229.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7229.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7229.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100366" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>Plus, he adds, clicking a box on a website that says &#8220;I&#8217;m over 21,&#8221; does not qualify as a legal age verification for making these sales.</p>
<p>The FDA hasn&#8217;t issued specific guidance around online retail, but <a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/retail-sales-tobacco-products/retailer-training-and-enforcement">the law is clear that checking IDs is required</a> to ensure retailers aren&#8217;t selling to underage users. That&#8217;s not happening with a pop-up box, and often there&#8217;s no box at all.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBYw1zNs5Ho?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>In addition, the FDA reminded TechCrunch that <a href="https://vaping.org/press-release/using-covid-19-congress-bans-usps-vape-shipping/">Congress recently </a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://vaping.org/press-release/using-covid-19-congress-bans-usps-vape-shipping/">established new limits</a> on the mailing and delivery of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products through the United States Postal Service and through other carriers, which should limit access to these sorts of products through online retail purchases.</span></p>
<p>Myers, however, points out that the current FDA guidelines have made enforcement of this sort of &#8220;social&#8221; vape marketing more difficult than necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;The images you&#8217;re seeing, the use of influencers, and the kinds of offers you&#8217;re seeing are governed by a federal standard by the FDA, which is very broad and very general,&#8221; Myers says. &#8220;The FDA&#8217;s failure to articulate clear, specific guidelines means that everyone is in a constant what I call &#8216;whack-a-mole.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Enforcement, then, often depends on the FDA stepping in, which Myers says happens &#8220;on a very sporadic basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In many respects, the behaviors, the actions and the things you&#8217;re seeing do violate the law. But the mechanisms for implementing it that were put in place under this past administration are woefully weak and inadequate,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100384" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100384" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2100384" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/puff-plus.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="871" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/puff-plus.jpg 4316w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/puff-plus.jpg?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/puff-plus.jpg?resize=300,131 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/puff-plus.jpg?resize=768,335 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/puff-plus.jpg?resize=680,296 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/puff-plus.jpg?resize=1536,669 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/puff-plus.jpg?resize=2048,892 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/puff-plus.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100384" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> screenshots of TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>Another complicating factor is that public health groups &#8212; like the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, for instance &#8212; don&#8217;t have a relationship with TikTok, as they do with other social networks.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, <a href="https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/press-releases/2019_05_21_socialmedia_advertising">over 100 public health groups came together</a> to ask leading social networks like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat to clamp down on tobacco-related content and the use of influencers in marketing. As a result of these efforts, Facebook and Instagram<a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/helping-creators-turn-their-passion-into-a-living/"> implemented new rules</a> to prohibit social media influencers from promoting tobacco-related products and developed algorithms to pick up on that sort of content.</p>
<p>Overall, the health organizations have reported seeing a reduction in tobacco and vape content on top social platforms, but these efforts have not yet included TikTok.</p>
<p>The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids has not given TikTok a comprehensive review, Myers admits, due to the app still being relatively new.  But from what the organization has seen so far, TikTok is of growing concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen some of the most egregious marketing, use of influencers, direct offers of sale to young people [which] appear to be gravitating over to TikTok,&#8221; Myers says. &#8220;And we don&#8217;t see any evidence that TikTok has actually done anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>TikTok can&#8217;t claim ignorance of the problem, either.</p>

<p>When a vape seller who unabashedly advertised &#8220;no ID check&#8221; was reported to TikTok through its built-in reporting mechanism, TikTok&#8217;s content moderation team said the content didn&#8217;t violate its guidelines. This same response was given when other vape sellers were reported, as well. (See below.)</p>
<p>TikTok claims this shouldn&#8217;t be happening. The company told us that it will remove accounts dedicated to posting vaping or e-cigarette content as soon as it becomes aware of them, and will reset account bios that link to off-platform tobacco or vaping sites.</p>
<p>It also says its <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en#31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang%3Den%2331&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611706307766000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFiaU3GsJCQ_bv3VWQQ6VehcOmA-g">Community Guidelines</a> prohibit content that suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of tobacco by a minor, and content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade tobacco. And it doesn&#8217;t permit tobacco ads.</p>

<p>Reached for comment over whether it was aware of the problems on TikTok, an FDA spokesperson said it does not discuss specific compliance and enforcement activities.</p>
<p>However, the spokesperson said the agency will closely monitor retailer, manufacturer, importer, and distributor compliance with federal tobacco laws and regulations and take corrective action when violations occur. In addition, the FDA said it conducts routine monitoring and surveillance of tobacco labeling, advertising and other promotional activities, including activities on the internet.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s been making matters more confusing is that the FDA has been accepting premarket applications for flavored vape devices, but has so far refused to list which companies &#8212; Puff Bar or otherwise &#8212; may have filed for these. That means health organizations don&#8217;t know which products the FDA has under review.</p>
<p>But the Agency told TechCrunch that regardless of whether a premarket application has been submitted, it&#8217;s enforcing lack of marketing authorization for any product where the manufacturer &#8220;is not taking adequate measures to prevent youth access to these products.&#8221;</p>
<p>That statement would then include these online Puff Bar retailers and their TikTok marketing efforts.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/XJbMIQPKZKk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The FDA added that it has taken action against Puff Bar, specifically, in recent days.</p>
<p>It sent a warning letter to Cool Clouds Distribution, Inc. d/b/a Puff Bar, last July, notifying the company that it was marketing new tobacco products that lacked marketing authorization and that such products, as a result, were adulterated and misbranded.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, as part of an ongoing joint operation with the FDA, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 33,681 units of e-cigarettes, which included disposable flavored e-cigarette cartridges resembling the Puff Bar brand, including Puff XXL and Puff Flow, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>TikTok confirmed the activity we&#8217;re documenting is in violation of its guidelines and policies, but could not explain why there&#8217;s been such a disconnect between that policy and its enforcement actions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are committed to the safety and well-being of our TikTok community, and we strictly prohibit content that depicts or promotes the possession or consumption of tobacco and drugs by minors,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We will remove accounts that are identified as being dedicated to promoting vaping, and we do not allow ads for vaping products.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.setsail.co/">SetSail </a>wants to upend the way sales people get compensated by paying them throughout the sales cycle, rather than a single commission after the sale closes. Today, the startup announced a $26 million Series A.</p>
<p>Insight Partners led the round with participation from existing investors Wing Venture Capital, Team8 and Operator Collective. Today&#8217;s investment brings the total raised to $37 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>SetSail connects to your CRM, email, calendar and other systems that have signals about the progress of a particular sale, and then using machine learning looks at points in the sales cycle where it would make sense to reward the sales person for the progress they are making.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As CEO and co-founder Haggai Levi told me at the time of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/setsail-raises-raises-7m-to-change-how-sales-teams-are-compensated/">startup&#8217;s $7 million seed round</a> in July, the single commission system discourages risk taking:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If I’m closing the deal, I’m getting my commission. If I’m not closing the deal, I’m getting nothing. That means from a behavioral point of view, I would take the shortest path to win a deal, and I would take the minimum risk possible. So if there’s a competitive situation I will try to avoid that,&#8221; he said in July.</p></blockquote>
<p>He said the idea of changing the way we think about compensation resonated with sales executives during the pandemic, especially as everyone&#8217;s role got altered and teams became distributed because of COVID, but he says while rethinking compensation was certainly a big factor so was SetSail&#8217;s ability to connect to all of the sales systems to help build these new approaches to pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s even beyond just compensation. [&#8230;] It&#8217;s also connecting to all of your data using an end-to-end platform that helps you understand what&#8217;s happening between you, your reps and your customers and allowing you to tie that back in using behavioral science to machine learning-based compensation,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>The company began 2020 with five customers, a reasonable start for an early stage startup, but it ended the year with more than 20 including Cisco, Dropbox and HubSpot. It now has over 5000 sales reps using the platform.</p>
<p>In spite of the growing number of users, Levi says they have no plans to aggregate data, leaving each customer&#8217;s data as distinct to build the compensation packages that make sense to them. &#8220;We try not to play kind of the data, aggregator role because we want to make sure that every customer&#8217;s data is encrypted and secured in a completely different container. The trade off between getting knowledge between customers versus receiving their data is is too high in our opinion,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company now has 35 employees with five more hired who will be starting in the next several weeks and plans to reach 70 by the end of the year. They are thinking hard about how to hire a diverse workforce. For starters, Levi says that the company board has two female members. He says hiring in general is a challenge for every CEO, especially early on, and hiring a diverse group even more so, but he says it&#8217;s important to be thinking about this from the start because from a gender perspective at least, you are losing half the talent pool if you ignore it.</p>
<p>When the pandemic is over, he sees having at least some in-person office presence in spite of being spread out across San Francisco, New York and Tel Aviv, but it will be probably be a hybrid approach and not require as much office space as they might have rented prior to COVID.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This is one S-1 that we very much want to read.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last week, independent journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/EricNewcomer">Eric Newcomer</a> reported that Databricks is raising new capital <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/sources-databricks-raising-at-27">at a valuation of &#8220;about $27 billion.&#8221;</a> A few days later, <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2021/01/24/databricks-scores-astronomical-29b-valuation.html">another publication chimed in</a>, saying that they had heard the round could be worth $29 billion at a slightly higher valuation.</p>
<p>Well, well!</p>
<p>Last year, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/databricks-crossed-350m-run-rate-in-q3-up-from-200m-one-year-ago/">covered Databricks&#8217; financial progress</a> as a private company. Databricks, as a refresher, provides its customers with analytics and data science tooling and crossed a $350 million run rate at the end of Q3 2020.</p>
<p>That figure was up from $200 million in the year-ago period. As we wrote at the time, Databricks was &#8220;an obvious IPO candidate&#8221; and a company with &#8220;broad private-market options.&#8221; Reports that it has raised more capital underscore our previous notes.</p>
<p>But we took it all one step further after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-24/microsoft-backed-databricks-is-said-to-plan-2021-stock-listing?sref=gni836kR">news surfaced</a> that Databricks could go public in the first half of 2021, noodling around with all the financial information we could scrape together for the company to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/what-would-databricks-be-worth-in-a-2021-ipo/">come up with a valuation range</a>. Our resulting figures were a bit low compared to recent news, which forms the crux of our work today: <em>Can we come up with a set of numbers that help make sense of Databricks at $27 billion</em>?</p>
<p>Databricks declined to comment. But that won&#8217;t stop us from having fun. So, let&#8217;s remind ourselves of what we know about Databricks&#8217; growth history, economics and scale.</p>
<p>From there we will be able to check our estimates against its purported new valuation range and come up with some implied multiples. Then, we&#8217;ll contrast those with some high-flying public companies.</p>
<p>Do the numbers somewhat fit? Can we see Databricks making sense at more than $25 billion, more than four times its 2019-era private valuation of $6.2 billion? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s it worth?</h2>
<p>In our previous work, we ran a number of growth scenarios to come up with different estimates for Databricks&#8217; current scale. Sparing you several hundred words, given how the company grew from $200 million in annual run rate to $350 million between Q3 2019 and Q3 2020, we estimated that the company would close Q1 2021 with between $425 million and $486.5 million in annualized revenue.</p>
<p>Looking at different data points from the Bessemer Cloud Index at the time while using some flexible-but-not-conservative estimates for Databricks&#8217; revenue quality, we came up with market comps that would have given it a sales multiple of between 20x and 38x. At the high end of our revenue run rate guess for Q1 2021, and top multiple, you get a valuation of $18.5 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Years ago, Uber had a problem. With millions of users and tens of thousands of drivers scattered across a widening expanse of the globe, the fast-growing mobility startup wanted to display more accurate maps to users about where their ride was coming from and where it was intending to go to reach its destination. The challenge is that geospatial datasets can easily reach into the petabytes, so how do you transmit and visualize such data — particularly on mobile?</p>
<p>“We were tasked with this massive planetary dataset,” Sina Kashuk explained about the purpose of Uber’s data visualization team, and “if money wasn’t an object, how would you architect this so that it would have the best performance?” That was the active problem that confronted a quad of engineers and data scientists tasked with solving the problem. Kashuk, Shan He, Isaac Brodsky and Ib Green collectively spent about 16 years at Uber, and they and their teammates at Uber built up what is today Uber’s extensive geospatial data visualization system. He, Brodsky and Green had joined Uber around 2014 and 2015, while Kashuk joined later in 2017.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the code they developed wasn’t locked inside the Uber app — core elements of their engineering were open-sourced into two libraries: <a href="https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl">Kepler.gl</a>, a web application that can take geospatial datasets and visualize them, and <a href="https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl">Deck.gl</a>, which offers an extensible application framework for processing geospatial datasets and preparing them for visualization. According to Kashuk, Green was one of the leaders in the development of <a href="http://Deck.gl">Deck.gl</a>, and He developed <a href="http://Kepler.gl">Kepler.gl</a> a year later using <a href="http://Deck.gl">Deck.gl</a> as a base. Both libraries remain in active development on GitHub and through <a href="https://vis.gl/about">Uber’s Visualization team</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eventually, the quad realized that they could offer services on top of these libraries to other businesses, given some of the interest they were seeing with the open-source projects. “What we realized is that [these libraries] are all mature and they are ready to go to the market [and] there is opportunity beyond usage at Uber, and we thought that we can take these technologies to the next level,“ Kashuk said. The four departed Uber and eventually came together to create <a href="https://www.unfolded.ai">Unfolded.ai</a> in late 2019.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100485" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100485" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2100485" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/founders.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="381" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/founders.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/founders.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/founders.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/founders.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/founders.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/founders.png?resize=1536,861 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/founders.png?resize=2048,1148 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/founders.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100485" class="wp-caption-text">The four founders of Unfolded.ai. Via Unfolded.ai.</p></div></p>
<p>The startup’s main product is called <a href="https://www.unfolded.ai/blog/2021-01-12-introducing-studio/">Unfolded Studio</a>, which acts as a backend-as-a-service for applications built on top of <a href="http://Kepler.gl">Kepler.gl</a> (which is only a frontend library itself) handling components like data management and server communications. In particular, the product is designed to bring different geospatial datasets together and allow them all to interact with each other in one unified view.</p>
<p>The team first funded their operations with some consulting projects, <a href="https://www.unfolded.ai/blog/2020-09-09-google-earth/">including with Google Earth</a>, but now it has raised a seed round to further expand the team and its ambitions. To date according to Kashuk, Unfolded has raised a bit more than $6 million, with a seed round that closed last week led by Shvet Jain at S28 Capital with participation from other firms including Fontinalis Ventures. Auren Hoffman wrote the first personal check into the company, and the first institutional VC was IA Ventures.</p>
<p>Some of the first customers of the Unfolded platform have been in agtech, including a company called <a href="https://www.indigoag.com">Indigo Agriculture</a>, which focuses on helping farmers grow crops and livestock sustainably. Unfolded sees potential in many markets where location data intersects business, but for now, remains mostly heads down building out its platform and readying itself for more customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok, UC Browser, UC News, Baidu Map, Xiaomi’s Video and Community and 53 other Chinese apps that India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned in late June</a> won’t be returning to the country anytime soon, the Indian government has decided, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Last week New Delhi told the parent firms of these apps that the responses it had received so far do not adequately address cybersecurity concerns charged against them, the source said, requesting anonymity as the communication is private.</p>
<p>Citing this reason, New Delhi told the firms that it will retain the ban on their apps, but it is not completely shutting communication channels with the firms, the source said. Indian media reported late last week that the country, which is the world&#8217;s second largest internet market with over 600 internet users, was making the ban permanent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Starting in late June, India ended up blocking over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/india-bans-another-43-chinese-apps/">200 apps including PUBG Mobile</a> that have links to China last year amid geo-political tension between the two neighboring nations. All these apps engaged in activities that posed threats to “national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India,” the nation’s IT ministry has said.</p>
<p>New Delhi has so far only sent feedback about the responses to the apps that were banned in late June.</p>
<p>Among the batch, TikTok has been the most high-profile app to be banned in India. ByteDance’s crown app had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/tiktok-education-edutok-india/">more than 200 million users in India</a> prior to being blocked. Despite the ban, however, the company has retained most of its India-based employees so far.</p>
<p>A source at ByteDance told TechCrunch that the company operates several properties in India including a productivity suite called Lark that remain operational in the country and the team continues to develop these apps. This information has not been previously reported. (UC Browser, too, was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-browser-youve-never-heard-of-is-dethroning-google-in-asia-1514808002">once very popular in India</a>, though the rising popularity of Google&#8217;s Chrome browser put an end to the Chinese app&#8217;s dominance in the country.)</p>
<p>Despite the ban, TikTok and several of the blocked Chinese apps still maintain millions of users in the country who are using specialized software such as VPNs to access them. TikTok had over 5 million active users (MAU) in India last month, and PUBG Mobile over 15 million, according to mobile insight firm App Annie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In a statement, TikTok said it was reviewing New Delhi’s notice. “We continually strive to comply with local laws and regulations and do our best to address any concerns the government may have. Ensuring the privacy and security of all our users remains to be our topmost priority,” a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The ban &#8212; as well as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/u-s-government-appeals-the-injunction-against-its-tiktok-ban/">whole U.S. drama about a potential block</a> &#8212; on TikTok hasn&#8217;t made much impact on ByteDance&#8217;s financials. The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/bytedances-revenue-more-than-doubled-in-2020">reported</a> on Tuesday that ByteDance more than doubled its revenue last year to $37 billion, and increased its operating profit to $7 billion, from $4 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>American and Chinese firms have rushed to India in the past decade in search for their next billion users. But the South Asian nation contributes very little to these firms&#8217; bottom line. Kunal Shah, a serial entrepreneur in India, said at a conference in 2018 that the nation has become an &#8220;MAU farm&#8221; for many companies.</p>
<p>Regardless, since their ban, TikTok and PUBG Mobile have explored ways to make a comeback in India. TikTok engaged in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/bytedance-in-talks-with-indias-reliance-for-investment-in-tiktok/">early investment talks with Reliance Industries</a>, one of India’s largest conglomerates, and PUBG Mobile <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/pubg-cuts-publishing-ties-with-tencent-games-in-india-a-week-after-ban/">cut ties with game publisher Tencent</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/pubg-mobile-announces-return-to-india-new-game-100-million-investment/">pledged to invest $100 million in India</a>.</p>
