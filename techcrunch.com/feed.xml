										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The fundraising continues apace in the go-go world of venture capital. Today, it&#8217;s<a href="https://luxcapital.com/"> Lux Capital </a>&#8212; known for its frontier investing &#8212; that has closed a $675 million early-stage venture fund and an $800 million growth-stage fund from its existing LPs, including many of the foundations, endowments, and family offices that have backed the firm from its start in 2000.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to appreciate why they would re-up. Over the last 12 months alone, a dozen of Lux&#8217;s portfolio companies have either been acquired, gone public, or announced plans to go public, either via a SPAC of the good-old-fashioned way. Among them is Zoox, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-to-acquire-autonomous-driving-startup-zoox/">bought by Amazon</a> last year; Desktop Metal, which <a href="https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/desktop-metal-completes-trine-merger-and-goes-live-on-new-york-stock-exchange-181051/">went public</a> by merging with a blank-check company last December; and Shapeways, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/shapeways-agrees-spac-merger-with-galileo-go-public-2021-04-28/">agreed in April to merge</a> with a blank-check company.</p>
<p>The most recent of Lux&#8217;s portfolio companies to announce a SPAC deal is Bright Machines, a manufacturing software company that two weeks ago <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bright-machines-nears-spac-deal-to-go-public-11621200629">announced a merger</a> with a publicly traded shell company. (Lux also raised its own <a href="https://medium.com/lux-capital/announcing-lux-health-tech-acquisition-corp-2f02fa4b39ba">$345 million blank-check company</a> last fall, one that has yet to identify a target.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, even a firm with Lux&#8217;s track record isn&#8217;t immune to competition in a crowded market. That&#8217;s partly why Lux &#8212; whose last two funds closed with a collective <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/lux-capital-just-closed-on-a-whopping-1-billion-in-capital-doubling-the-amount-of-money-it-manages/">$1 billion</a> in August 2019 &#8212;  has incubated more than a dozen companies of its own, says the firm&#8217;s cofounder, Peter Hebert, who talked with us yesterday from Menlo Park about that approach, along with whether and when he sees a correction coming. Some of that conversation is excerpted below, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What size checks will you be writing from these new funds?</strong></p>
<p>PH: The median investment in this current early-stage fund will be about $25 million over the life of [each] investment, and that could range from $100,000 to something like $50 million. With our opportunity vehicle, that can be up to a $100 million check and also larger, but I would expect there to be at least one investment in that range.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And the opportunity fund can back companies inside of the portfolio or outside it?</strong></p>
<p>PH: That&#8217;s right. I would expect that the majority will be companies where we were an early-stage lead investor, but that there&#8217;s no requirement that it&#8217;s exclusively Lux-seeded or Series-A-backed companies that receive investment. There&#8217;ve been a handful of companies we&#8217;ve backed in the past [that weren&#8217;t earlier bets] including the liquid biopsy company Thrive Earlier Detection [which was <a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/exact-sciences-to-acquire-thrive-earlier-detection-becoming-a-leader-in-blood-based-multi-cancer-screening/">acquired</a> soon after], contract management software maker IronClad [backed<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ironclad-raises-100-million-series-d-funding-round-to-scale-the-new-standard-for-business-contracts-301208177.html"> earlier this year</a>], and the at-home health testing company Everly Health [which Lux <a href="https://luxcapital.com/news/at-home-health-testing-company-everlywell-raises-175-million-series-d-round-at-a-1-3-billion-valuation/">first funded</a> in December].</p>
<p><strong>TC: What startup in your portfolio right now has received the most funding from Lux?</strong></p>
<p>PH: I guess that would be Applied Intuition (which makes  simulation software and infrastructure tools to test and validate autonomous vehicles at scale).</p>
<p><strong>TC: How much do you look to own?</strong></p>
<p>PH: Generally, where we are coming in as the lead institutional investor in a Series A, it&#8217;s 20% to 25%, and that can be higher or lower. In many cases, we will create companies from scratch and more often those can be as high as 50%.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I didn&#8217;t realize that incubating companies was a big part of Lux&#8217;s business.</strong></p>
<p>PH: Yeah, for us, one of the most successful of our investments was a company called Kurion that was a pioneer in nuclear waste remediation that we created based largely on the vision of my cofounder, Josh Wolfe, and his view on the future of alternative energy. We recruited all these great folks out of MIT&#8217;s material science department and built that and owned north of 30% when it was <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/veolia-acquires-nuclear-waste-specialist-kurion-for-350m">acquired</a> by a French waste water company, Veolia, for $400 million in 2016 &#8212; and that [was part of a] $100 million fund.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How active are you on this front right now? Given how heated pricing is out there, I&#8217;d think it&#8217;s a good time to be starting companies in-house.</strong></p>
<p>PH: In the last two to three years, we&#8217;ve been most active in new [company] formation for exactly [those] reasons. It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re just a factory [looking to] churn things out. Inspiration is the starting point. But whether it&#8217;s a market opportunity that we assess,  or whether it&#8217;s interesting science and tech that needs a catalyst to get things off the ground, we&#8217;re happy to play that role.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do you think of what&#8217;s happening in terms of the feverish pace of fundings and how quickly companies&#8217; valuations are soaring? It seems nuts, but it&#8217;s also hard to imagine it ending anytime soon.</strong></p>
<p>PH: I think we&#8217;re uncomfortably optimistic. Structurally, [I&#8217;m optimistic] because the way that science and technology are funded today is so changed. When I got into business in the late &#8217;90s, the venture industry was small, it was provincial, it was people on Sand Hill Road who wouldn&#8217;t talk with anyone who was beyond 10 miles of their office. People were proud to know nothing about the financial markets because there was little connectivity in terms of their impact on [what VCs were doing].</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s global and while some might say the market is frothy, [all that capital is] allowing companies that are really ambitious and that require capital that otherwise might not have [materialized] to [gain momentum], and from the perspective of scientific advancement and technological progress, this is good.</p>
<p>There will certainly be experimentation, people will lose money, there will be hundreds of companies funded and most of them wash out. But there&#8217;s going to be a lot of lasting transformative change that comes out of all of this.</p>

		Henry Shapiro is the co-founder of <a href="http://www.reclaim.ai/">Reclaim.ai,</a> an intelligent calendar assistant platform used daily by over 4,000 companies. Prior to founding Reclaim, Henry led product and marketing at New Relic. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It was August 2019, and the fundraising process was not going well.</p>
<p>My co-founder and I had left our product management jobs at New Relic several months prior, deciding to finally plunge into building <a href="http://reclaim.ai">Reclaim</a> after nearly a year of late nights and weekends spent prototyping and iterating on ideas. We had bits and pieces of a product, but the majority of it was what we might call “slideware.”</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When you can’t raise big on the vision, you need to raise big on the proof. And the proof comes from building, learning, iterating and getting traction with your first few hundred users.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When we spoke to many other founders, they all told us the same thing: Go raise, raise big, and raise now. So we did that, even though we were puzzled as to why anyone would give us money with little more than a slide deck to our names. We spent nearly three months pitching dozens of VCs, hoping to raise $3 million to $4 million in a seed round to hire our founding team and build the product out.</p>
<p>Initially, we were excited. There was lots of inbound interest, and we were starting to hear a lot of crazy numbers getting thrown around by a lot of Important People. We thought for sure we were maybe a week away from term sheets. We <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG_wClmLUh8">celebrated preemptively</a>. How could it possibly be this easy?</p>
<p>Then in July, almost in an instant, everything started to dry up. The verbal offers for term sheets didn’t materialize into real offers. We had term sheets, but they were from investors that didn’t seem to care much about what we were building or what problems we wanted to solve. We quickly realized that we hadn’t really built momentum around the <em>product </em>or the<em> vision</em>, but were instead caught up in what we later learned to be “deal flow.”</p>
<p>Basically, investors were interested because <em>other</em> investors were interested. And once enough of them weren’t, nobody was.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as I write this today, Reclaim has raised a total of $6.3 million on great terms <a href="http://reclaim.ai/about">across a group of incredible investors and partners</a>. But it wasn’t easy, and it required us to embrace our failure and learn three important lessons that I believe every founder should consider before they decide to go out and pitch investors.</p>
<h2>Lesson 1: Build big before you raise big</h2>
<p>In 2019, we were hunting for what some referred to as a “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/seed-stage-funding-deal-trends-2020-12">mango seed</a>” &#8212; that is, a seed round that was large enough that it was perceptibly closer to a light Series A financing. Being pre-product at the time, we had to lean on our experience and our vision to drive conviction and urgency among investors. Unfortunately, it just wasn’t enough. Investors either felt that our experience was a bad fit for the space we were entering (productivity/scheduling) or that our vision wasn’t compelling enough to merit investment on the terms we wanted.</p>
<p>When we did get offers, they involved swallowing some pretty bitter pills: We would be forced to take bad terms that were overly dilutive (at least from our perspective), work with an investor who we didn’t think had high conviction in our product strategy, or relinquish control in the company from an extremely early stage. None of these seemed like good options.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin, the Ford-owned micromobility operator, has added a new CEO, launched a new strategy to capture market share and announced a plan to get back into bike share, although this time with an electric twist. </span></p>
<p>The flurry of moves suggest that Spin is still trying to figure out the best path forward to push past its rivals and become profitable. Under the changes announced Thursday, <span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founder and CEO Derrick Ko is moving to a strategic advisory role, along with the other two co-founders Zaizhuang Cheng and Euwyn Poon. In Ko’s place is Ben Bear, who previously served as CBO of Spin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside the change in leadership, Spin is deploying e-bikes for the first time, expanding to multiple cities in the U.S. and Europe, implementing new technologies and coming for Bird as the Number Two e-scooter company in the country (behind Lime, of course). </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pressure among micromobility operators to actually turn a profit is increasing, so Spin is flexing its compliance record in order to secure those limited vendor permits. The end game is to angle for more exclusive, and perhaps more lucrative, partnerships with cities. Amid all this activity are </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/ford-is-said-to-weigh-exit-of-electric-scooter-unit-spin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Ford might be divesting Spin into a separate company, including a sale or spinoff of the subsidiary. Which leads us to wonder in which direction the new CEO will be steering this ship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re full speed ahead on the hiring front, and we’ve got ambitious growth plans for this year, heading into 2022 and beyond,” Bear told TechCrunch. “We really think the market is reaching a tipping point where cities are more and more moving towards limited vendor permits, which is right where we’re focused and have been focused throughout our history.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Spin would not comment on the reports of Ford divesting the e-scooter company.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most cities have evolved from an unregulated market to an open one, and many, like Atlanta and Washington, D.C., are operating limited vendor permits. Spin is counting on this trend continuing to exclusive vendor permits, similar to the deal Lyft-owned Citi Bike has made with New York City. This might mean going after mid-tier cities that charge Spin less in fees, or even pay them to operate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Bakersfield, we recently received a $1.1 million state grant to install infrastructure and conduct the program, and then $257,000 from the city as well to make sure that the project was supported, and that we&#8217;re able to offer low-cost rides to residents who need that,” said Bear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Grand Rapids, Spin is working with nonprofits to deliver scooters as an addition to public transportation, and in Pittsburgh, the company has integrated with the public transit app to make different types of mobility as frictionless as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We definitely see ourselves as part of that broader ecosystem, which includes public transit,” said Bear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin claims that its win rate on new markets in the U.S. is 85% and its renewal rate is 93%. However, the company has lost a few big permit awards, including New York City and Paris. Of its nearly 100 markets in the U.S., a large majority are made up of mid-tier cities and college campuses. Spin says it will be in up to 25 additional U.S. markets through the rest of the year, with plans to expand to Portugal and Ireland, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of Spin’s nearly 100 markets in the U.S. and Europe, over 70% are limited vendor exclusive, according to Bear. He says Spin’s reputation of ensuring safety, compliance and equitable service for residents makes it a trusted city partner. But if it wants to monopolize the micromobility of cities, it has to provide a multi-modal fleet. Enter electric bikes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin also announced plans to roll out up to 5,000 e-bikes on the streets this year, starting with Providence, Rhode Island on June 14. It will also bring e-bikes, as well as e-scooters, to recently won markets like Fort Collins, Colorado; Bakersfield, California; and Penn State University &#8212; all of which are exclusive partnerships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin was founded as a pedal bike share in 2017, but pivoted to e-scooters the following year. Of the major micromobility companies, Spin is a bit late to the e-bike party. Bear says the company wanted to delay bringing e-bikes to market until the form factor had developed enough to be as compelling as its scooters. This prudence could just as well hurt the success of its e-bike program if Spin isn’t bringing something as good as an e-bike that’s already been through multiple iterations of deployed field use. First-generation hardware is rarely, if ever, perfect out the gate. And since Spin hasn’t run a fleet of e-bikes yet, it might not be the smoothest management transition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, e-bikes aren’t the only iron in Spin’s fire. True to its promise of being what cities want a micromobility operator to be, Spin is thinking strategically about technological add-ons. For example, Spin has partnered with computer vision startup Drover AI to launch its </span><a href="https://blog.spin.pm/spin-insight-building-adas-for-micromobility-98a3d88aa976"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin Insight Level 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or a bundle of sensors, cameras and on-board computing power to detect sidewalk and bike lane riding and validate parking. Spin launched this new capability for the first time on Wednesday, deploying 100 Drover-tech equipped e-scooters in Milwaukee with plans to launch in Miami, Seattle and Santa Monica, as well. Last month, </span><a href="https://dot.la/bird-app-santa-monica-ca-2653017433.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird was booted by the Santa Monica City Council </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in favor of Spin, Veo and Lyft and will have to remove all of its scooters from its own hometown by July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle and Santa Monica, along with Boise, Idaho, will also be seeing some of Spin’s new tech in the form of the S-200, a three-wheeled adaptive sit-down scooter. The vehicle is built in tandem with mobility startup Tortoise, whose repositioning software allows remote operators to move vehicles off sidewalks and into proper parking spots, as well as rebalance them. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has selected 30 startups to receive a share of its $2M Black Founders Fund in Europe, providing these companies with a spot of cash, some valuable cloud services, and a bit of good old-fashioned networking among the Google crew.</p>
<p>The fund was announced last fall as part of a company-wide effort towards &#8220;building a more equitable future for everyone,&#8221; alongside grants and new sponsorships. Over 800 companies applied and Google interviewed 100 of them, ultimately <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/entrepreneurs/funding-europe-black-founders-fund/">winnowing that down to the 30 announced today</a>.</p>
<p>Each company will receive &#8220;up to&#8221; $100K in non-dilutive funding, and up to $120K in Ads grants and $100K in Cloud credits. (I&#8217;ve asked Google for more details on how the fund was divided, and if any company received this full amount. I&#8217;ll update if I hear back.)</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BmyxVnRiVVg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>They&#8217;ll also get access to Google&#8217;s entrepreneurial network, tech support, and some other assets that don&#8217;t have hard numbers associated with them.</p>
<p>All the startups are led by black founders, and 40 percent by women of color. One of the latter is Nancy de Fays, co-founder of <a href="https://linedock.co/">LINE</a>, which makes these cool <a href="https://linedock.co/products/macbook-16in-docking-station">battery-hub combos</a> for the MacBook &#8220;Pro&#8221; that add a ton of ports and battery life and look sweet to boot. I&#8217;ve learned a lot chatting with her at trade shows, and regret that I do most of my work at a desktop so I don&#8217;t have an excuse to use one of the company&#8217;s gadgets.</p>
<p>In response to being selected for Google funding, de Fays <a href="https://linedock.co/blogs/news/black-founders-fund">penned a blog post</a> exhorting corporations to throw their weight around in favor of social change, and for startups to lead the way in diversity and equity.</p>
<blockquote><p>We buy values and standards more than we buy the product itself. We buy ideals of life more than the actual features. Putting the these two parameters in the equation &#8211; the capability of big corps to shout loud, and consumers&#8217; receptiveness to brands values and messages &#8211; it does make sense to me that to drive such a society change, big companies should voice and convey strong messages.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Founders need to build diverse teams without falling into compassion fatigue. They must show empathy and respect and bring onboard the best talents. Period. They need to be outspoken about their values, convey a strong, global mindset and build their organisation around them. And if they find themselves scoring low on diversity along the way, they should question themselves on the why and act on it without doing charity.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s something of a counterpoint to the idea, also commonly expressed these days, that companies should be mission-focused and objective.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo One, the ride-hailing service that uses driverless vehicles in the suburbs of Phoenix, can now be accessed and booked through Google Maps.</p>
<p>This will be the first fully autonomous ride-hailing option available in the app, which will roll out first to Android users, Waymo said Thursday. The team up not only brings together two Alphabet companies, it signals Waymo&#8217;s push to become more visible and accessible to the public.</p>
<p>Waymo has abut 600 vehicles in its U.S. fleet. About 300 to 400 of those are in the Phoenix area, but not all of those are used in the driverless Waymo One fleet. The Waymo One service only uses driverless vehicles, which means that a safety operator is not physically behind the wheel. It also means that if it pops up on Google Maps, users can be assured that it will indeed be driverless. Some vehicles in the Phoenix area are used for testing. Waymo doesn&#8217;t share exact numbers of how many driverless vehicles it operates as part of the service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Waymo One is now in <a href="https://twitter.com/googlemaps?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GoogleMaps</a>. Tap the ride-hailing option when you’re in the Metro Phoenix area, then hail a fully autonomous ride powered by the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WaymoDriver?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WaymoDriver</a>! <a href="https://t.co/ZTxv5IXdzS">pic.twitter.com/ZTxv5IXdzS</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Waymo (@Waymo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Waymo/status/1400484190064422916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The process still requires a bit of app hopping. There isn&#8217;t a direct way to access, book, and pay for the Waymo One rides in Google Maps. Instead, the user is brought over to the Waymo app to complete the booking.  Users first have to input directions to or from a location in Waymo&#8217;s Metro Phoenix territory, which includes parts of Chandler, Mesa, and Tempe, from an Android device. Once the user taps on the ridesharing or transit tab, they will see the estimated price and ETA of their trip with Waymo.</p>
<p>Existing Waymo One riders will be directed to the Waymo app to book the ride, while newcomers will be taken to the PlayStore to download it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX’s Dragon capsule is once again heading to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The company launched its 22nd Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) mission for NASA on Thursday. This is the fifth capsule SpaceX has sent to ISS in the last twelve months, SpaceX director of Dragon mission management Sarah Walker noted in a media briefing Tuesday. It’s also the first launch of the year on a new Falcon 9 rocket booster.</p>
<p>The rocket took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 1:29 PM eastern time, right on schedule despite the threat of storm clouds from the south and east. The first stage separated as planned<strong> </strong>and touched down on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship in the Atlantic Ocean eight minutes after launch. The second stage, which takes the capsule to orbit, separated 12 minutes after launch, also right on schedule.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2161051" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/crs-22-landing.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161051" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2161051" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/crs-22-landing.gif" alt="" width="750" height="422" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2161051" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SpaceX</p></div></p>
<p>The Falcon 9 Rocket launch vehicle is sending more than 7,300 pounds of research materials, supplies, and hardware, including new solar arrays, to the ISS crew. It’s the second mission under SpaceX’s new CRS contract with NASA; the first took place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/06/spacex-launches-new-cargo-dragon-to-space-station-for-100th-successful-falcon-9-flight/">last December</a>.</p>
<p>Dragon is carrying a number of research experiments to be conducted on the ISS, including oral bacteria to test germ growth with Colgate toothpaste; a number of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/Investigation.html?#id=7672">tardigrades</a> (also affectionately called water bears), primordial organisms that will attempt to fare and reproduce in space environments; and an investigation that will study the effects of microgravity on the formation of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/Investigation.html?#id=8439">kidney stones</a> – an ailment that many crew members display an increased susceptibility to during spaceflight.</p>
<p>The capsule is also delivering fresh food, including apples, navel oranges, lemons, and avocados.</p>
<p>Of the over 7,300 pounds of cargo, around 3,000 pounds will be taken up by a new roll-out, &#8220;flex blanket&#8221; solar array developed by space infrastructure company Redwire. As opposed to more traditional rigid paneled solar arrays, flex blanket technology provides more mass and performance benefits, Redwire technical director Matt LaPointe told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The arrays were placed in the Dragon&#8217;s unpressurized trunk. It&#8217;s the first of three missions to send iROSA solar arrays to the station, with each mission carrying two arrays, LaPointe said. Once installed, the six iROSA arrays will collectively produce over 120KW of power. Redwire, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/acquisition-happy-space-infrastructure-company-redwire-set-to-go-public-via-spac/">announced in March</a> that it would go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, says the new iROSA arrays will improve the ISS’s power generation by 20-30%.</p>
<p>The Dragon capsule is set to arrive at the space station at around 5 AM on June 5, where it will autonomously dock on a port of the Harmony module of the ISS. It will spend more than a month with the station before splashing down in the Atlantic with research and return cargo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Supreme Court has ruled that a police officer who searched a license plate database for an acquaintance in exchange for cash did not violate U.S. hacking laws.</p>
<p>The landmark ruling concludes a long-running case that clarifies the controversial Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA, by putting limits on what kind of conduct can be prosecuted.</p>
<p>The court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-783_k53l.pdf">ruled 6-3 in favor</a> of Nathan Van Buren, a former Georgia police sergeant who brought the case. Van Buren was prosecuted on two counts, one for accepting a kickback for accessing the database as a serving police officer, and another for violating the CFAA. His first conviction was overturned, but the CFAA conviction was upheld — until today.</p>
<p>Although Van Buren was allowed to access the license plate database, the legal question became whether or not he had exceeded his authorized access.</p>
<p>In the ruling, the Supreme Court said that the CFAA &#8220;covers those who obtain information from particular areas in the computer — such as files, folders, or databases — to which their computer access does not extend,&#8221; and that while Van Vuren &#8220;plainly flouted&#8221; the police department&#8217;s rules for law enforcement purposes, he did not violate the CFAA, wrote Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who wrote the majority opinion.</p>
<p>The CFAA was signed into law in 1986 to prosecute hackers who gain &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; access to a computer or network. But courts have been split on what &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; means. Legal experts have argued that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/supreme-court-van-buren-hacking/">a broad reading</a> of the law could criminalize violating a site&#8217;s terms of service, such as lying on a dating profile or sharing a password to a streaming service. The court said that the government&#8217;s interpretation of the law &#8220;would attach criminal penalties to a breathtaking amount of commonplace computer activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not all the justices agreed. &#8220;Without valid law enforcement purposes, he was forbidden to use the computer to obtain that information,&#8221; wrote Justice Thomas, who filed a dissenting opinion along with Justice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>
<p>Civil liberties experts said Congress should act to amend the CFAA following the court&#8217;s ruling.</p>
<p>“This is an important and welcome decision that will help protect digital research and journalism that is urgently necessary. But more is needed,&#8221; said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute. &#8220;Congress should amend the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to eliminate any remaining uncertainty about the scope of the statute. It should also create a safe harbor for researchers and journalists who are working to study disinformation and discrimination online. Major technology companies should not have a veto over research and journalism that are manifestly in the public interest.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been a busy week for private equity with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/cloudera-to-go-private-as-kkr-cdr-grab-it-for-5-3b/">Cloudera</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/stack-overflow-acquired-by-prosus-for-a-reported-1-8-billion/">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fireeye-to-sell-products-unit-for-1-2b-to-symphony-led-group/">FireEye</a> coming off the board on Tuesday and Wednesday. Today Blackstone bought media and data company IDG for $1.3 billion. The company had been owned by Oriental Rainbow, LLC, a subsidiary of China Oceanwide Holdings Group, Co. Ltd.</p>
<p>With IDG, Blackstone gets tech analyst firm IDC along with a collection of tech publications that includes CIO, Computerworld, InfoWorld, Macworld, Network World, PCWorld, and Tech Hive. The media publishing arm was once a powerhouse in the 1990s tech publishing world, although its shine has faded in recent years as the publishing industry in general has come under intense pressure.</p>
<p>The company has also been making some additions to the platform more recently with a stronger focus on data and analytics. Last year <a href="https://www.demandgenreport.com/features/news-briefs/idg-agrees-to-acquire-triblio-fusing-martech-with-b2b-media/">it bought Triblio</a>, a marketing data platform to help companies deliver more personalized customer experiences. Last month <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47694321">it acquired Metri</a>, an IT pricing service, which can help with IT budgeting and procurement. The latter could dovetail nicely with IDC&#8217;s consulting services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Company CEO Mohamad Ali is hoping that Blackstone can infuse more capital into the company to keep building on its software services with a data focus. &#8220;Additional capital investment from Blackstone will allow us to cultivate our rich history of innovation and accelerate our product roadmaps to bring our customers the deeper insights and data they need to succeed in today’s rapidly evolving digital economy,&#8221; said in a statement.</p>
<p>That sounds like he wants to increase his data bet. It seems that the data side of the business was particularly attractive to Blackstone as well. &#8220;The high-quality data, analytics and insights IDG delivers to technology leaders are only becoming more critical as the pace of growth and innovation accelerates,&#8221; Peter Wallace, Global Head of Core Private Equity at Blackstone said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company launched in 1964 with the consulting side of the business, but founder Pat McGovern had a broader vision and began the publishing side of the company in 1967 with the launch of Computerworld. The publishing business actually grew to become integral part of the rise of the PC and the technology shift that occurred at a personal and business level in the 80s and 90s. It&#8217;s unclear what this deal will mean for the publishing side of the house or where that would even fit as it continues the push to focus on data and analytics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Verizon Media, which owns this publication along with Engadget, was also<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/"> recently sold to private equity firm</a>, Apollo Global, as the private equity push into all parts of the technology ecosystem continues.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hormones are key to solving many health conditions that disproportionately impact women, from diabetes to infertility to mental health challenges.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gaslighting is a form of psychological abuse, but <a href="https://twitter.com/sequinlabcoat">Elizabeth Ruzzo</a> says she experienced it firsthand after telling a doctor that she suffered from suicidal ideation after taking birth control pills.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Hormonal health sits at the center of conversations around personalized medicine and women’s health: By 2025, women’s health could be a $50 billion industry, and by 2026, digital health more broadly is estimated to hit $221 billion.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Ruzzo’s doctor told her there was no connection between birth control and self-harm, but she decided to stop taking the pill to see if her mental health improved. When it did, Ruzzo grasped the disconnect between women’s unique hormonal makeup and blanket-statement practices from medicine today.</p>
<p>Her realization led her to found <a href="https://www.adyn.com/">Adyn Health</a>, a startup that proactively helps women make health decisions that complement their hormonal state and background. The company started with, of course, helping people pick more personalized birth control.</p>
<p>Ruzzo is part of a group of growing entrepreneurs who are betting that hormonal health is the key wedge into the digital health boom. Hormones are fluctuating, ever-evolving and diverse &#8212; but these founders say they&#8217;re also key to solving many health conditions that disproportionately impact women, from diabetes to infertility to mental health challenges.</p>
<p>Many believe it’s that complexity that underscores the opportunity. Hormonal health sits at the center of conversations around personalized medicine and women’s health: By 2025, <a href="https://ovsecondopinion.substack.com/p/why-were-betting-big-on-womens-health">women’s health could be a $50 billion industry,</a> and by 2026, digital health more broadly is <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/22/2196996/0/en/Global-Digital-Health-Market-Size-Will-Grow-to-USD-220-94-Billion-by-2026-Facts-Factors.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAccording%20to%20the%20research%20report,%25%20from%202019%20to%202026%E2%80%9D.">estimated to hit $221 billion.</a></p>
<p>Still, as funding for women’s health startups drops and stigma continues to impact where venture dollars go, it&#8217;s unclear whether the sector will remain in its infancy or hit a true inflection point.</p>
<h2>The future is proactive</h2>
<p>Ruzzo views Adyn as a precision medicine startup. Its main product is an at-home test that tracks hormone levels, assesses genetic risk for specific side effects, and then gives recommendations for which birth control methods best suits the customer with the fewest side effects.</p>
<p>By Ruzzo’s estimates, 98% of sexually active women use birth control for 30 years of their life. That sort of lifetime value proposition made the company look like a sweet deal to founders, and Adyn raised a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/creating-a-safer-birth-control-adyn-raises-2-5m-seed/">$2.5 million seed in April 2021</a> in a round co-led by Lux Capital and M13.</p>
<p>The moonshot, though, is using that as a way to become a trusted partner in a woman’s life, helping understand baseline hormone levels throughout those 30 years.</p>
<p>“My hope is that we can use precision medicine approaches, including looking at genetic markers to identify reliable diagnostic criteria, that can remove that uncertainty and pain and diagnostic odyssey that people have to go through,” Ruzzo said.</p>
<p>If Adyn becomes a trusted partner with teenage women, it could reach a point where it can detect changes in hormone levels over time.</p>
<p>“The hormone reference ranges that are used [in labs] are too broad to be personalized, let alone prescriptive,” she said. “And so what we&#8217;re hoping to do is correct for things that we know affect hormone levels like age, weight, ethnicity and compare you to your own expectations.”</p>
<p>If the first wave of digital health was a company like <a href="https://ro.co/">Ro</a>, which answers consumers when they have a condition such as erectile dysfunction or hair loss, the second wave will look more like Adyn, which helps consumers navigate their health <em>before</em> getting diagnosed with a condition or experiencing issues.</p>
<p>The industry standard is still to wait for consumers to realize they have a condition, and then go to the doctor to manage their symptoms or look for a cure. A new startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/veera-health-wants-to-help-women-in-india-navigate-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/">recently graduated from Y Combinator</a> is finding its way into hormonal health through that angle.</p>
<h2>One-tenth of all women are impacted by a hormonal condition</h2>
<p>Veera Health is a startup that wants to help women in India manage polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS. The hormonal condition can cause irregular periods, infertility or gestational diabetes in women, as well as acne, weight gain and excessive hair growth. Plus, PCOS is far from rare, impacting <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome">one in 10 women</a>.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Tuesday, September 21</h2>
<p><strong>How to Raise Your First Dollars with Luciana Lixandru (Sequoia), Rebecca Lynn (Canvas Ventures)</strong></p>
<p>Deciding how to go about getting your initial funding is always a tricky subject, as the wrong move could adversely impact your young company. In this session we’ll hear from experts who’ve shepherded multiple companies from the earliest to the latest fundraises.</p>
<p><strong>How to Cultivate a Community for your Company that Actually Lasts with Alex Angel (Commsor), Katelin Holloway (776 Ventures), and Lolita Taub (The Community Fund)</strong></p>
<p>There’s no doubt about it: the word of the year in startupland is “community.” In this panel, Community Fund’s Lolita Taub, Commsor’s Alex Angel, and 776 Ventures’ Katelin Holloway will extract buzz from reality and help founders understand the growing importance of chief community officers in startup culture, and ultimately financial success, today.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsored: The Inaugural Connection I.T. Superheroes Awards Category Winners, Announced live by Jamal Khan, Chief Innovation &amp; Growth Officer of Connection</strong></p>
<p>Connection and TechCrunch have teamed up to celebrate and recognize those IT people who have gone the extra mile, with the inaugural Connection I.T. Superhero Awards. Winners of the 5 category awards will be announced live, presented by Connection’s Chief Innovation &amp; Digital Officer, Jamal Khan. These awards are about people, not products for the many out there deserving recognition for their daily efforts. We think some well-earned awards are a great place to start.</p>
<p><strong>The Subtle Challenges of Assessing Product-Market Fit with Heather Hartnett (Human Ventures), David Thacker (Greylock), and Victoria Treyger (Felicis Ventures)</strong></p>
<p>Product-market fit is the holy grail for founders, and the key to unlocking the next phase of a startup&#8217;s growth. Behind &#8220;product&#8221; and &#8220;market&#8221; though, there are dozens of considerations, from types of users and product offerings to marketing and pricing that determine just how strong a fit a startup has found. Join early-stage investors David Thacker of Greylock, Heather Hartnett of Human Ventures and Victoria Treyger of Felicis as they discuss the subtler challenges in finding and assessing fit.</p>
<p><strong>How to Accelerate Everything with Nik Sharma (Sharma Brands) and speakers to be announced</strong></p>
<p>In the past year, growth marketing exploded as companies doubled down on what’s worked in the past and found new runway inside an increasingly competitive landscape. We brought together some of the best growth marketing minds across verticals to tell you how they conquered growth in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>How to Ditch Traditional Fundraising with Arun Mathew (Accel), Nicholas Tommarello (Wefunder) and Michele Romanow (Clearco)</strong></p>
<p>In 2021, venture capital has never been more plentiful, but some founders still can’t break into networks or have found that traditional fundraising isn’t the best route for their business. Fortunately, alternative fundraising techniques are gathering steam as founders find paths to raise cash that diverge from the startup success stories of the past.</p>
<p><strong>The Pros and Cons (but mostly pros) of a Distributed Workforce with Wendy Nice Barnes (GitLab) and speakers to be announced</strong></p>
<p>Coronavirus has changed so much, but perhaps nothing about our everyday lives has changed quite as much as the way we work. Corporations and small businesses the world over have moved to remote work, and as per usual in a time of change, startups have the advantage. Hear from founders who have cultivated fast-moving, highly productive (yet still culture-conscious) distributed workforces and how they&#8217;ve managed to do so.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Wednesday, September 22</h2>
<p><strong>The Path for Underrepresented Entrepreneurs with Hana Mohan (MagicBell), Leslie Feinzaig (Female Founders Alliance), and Stephen Bailey (ExecOnline)</strong></p>
<p>Being a founder comes with a wide array of challenges, but underrepresented founders unfortunately face an extra layer of bias, both conscious and unconscious. At Disrupt, we&#8217;ll sit down with founders who will share their journey through fundraising and scaling, as well as advocates who can offer tactical insights and advice.</p>
<p><strong>How to Sign Your First Three B2B Customers with Kate Taylor (Notion), Abi Williams (Udemy)</strong></p>
<p>The secret to revenue growth is great sales, but the definition of &#8220;great&#8221; and &#8220;sales&#8221; has changed dramatically post-COVID. Virtual meetings, simple onboarding, product-led growth, and more have upended the traditional approach to sales for enterprise companies, requiring new tactics for founders to get the kind of skyrocketing growth they desire and lock in those first customers. Join Abi Williams of Udemy and Kate Taylor of Notion as we discuss the best practices for handling sales in a re-energized 2021 economy.</p>
<p><strong>So, You Want to Go Public. What’s Next? with Hope Cochran (Madrona Venture Group) and Deena Shakir (Lux Capital)</strong></p>
<p>The path to your startup&#8217;s exit has grown increasingly complex in the last year. Acquisition? SPAC? Traditional IPO. Hear from seasoned tech experts about how to think about your company&#8217;s path to going public and weigh the pros and cons of the various routes.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsored</strong>: <b data-stringify-type="bold">Powering the Small Business Economy with Cloud Technology by Steve Vamos, CEO of Xero </b></p>
<p>Small business is a critical engine of job creation, economic growth, innovation and a driver in our efforts to recover from a global pandemic.

In this panel, a host of experts including EQ Talent Group’s Doris Tong, SignalFire’s Tawni Cranz, and Sequoia’s Jaime Bott &#8211; will discuss how to hire with culture and competence at the core of each decision. And, more importantly, what within your process needs to be scrapped and rewritten for the post-pandemic world.</p>
<p><strong>Where to Cut and Where to Spend in First-Check Fundraising with Nisha Dua (BBG Ventures), Richard Kerby (Equal Ventures), and Henri Pierre-Jacques (Harlem Capital)<br />

<h2>Thursday, September 23</h2>
<p><strong>How Do You Select the Right Tech Stack with Jill Wetzler (Pilot) and speakers to be announced </strong></p>
<p>From day zero, startups have to make dozens of trade-offs when it comes to the infinite variety of tech stacks available to today&#8217;s engineers. Choose the wrong combination or direction, and a startup could be left with years of refactoring to fix the legacy damage. What are the best practices for assessing potential stacks, and how can you minimize the risk of a painful mistake? Top technologists will discuss strategies for improving engineering right from the beginning and at every stage of a startup&#8217;s journey.</p>
<p><strong>How to Build Brand Buzz and Generate Influence in the Creator Economy with Rachel Drori (Daily Harvest) and Julia Munslow (Yahoo News)</strong></p>
<p>Brands are the lifeblood of startups. The name, the design, the feel, and the emotional connection between customers and company can determine the entire trajectory of a business. It&#8217;s a well-trodden field that&#8217;s been upended in recent years thanks to the skyrocketing growth of the influencer and creator economies. What does it mean to build a brand in today&#8217;s competitive marketplace and how can you assess success? Julia Munslow of Yahoo News and Rachel Drori of Daily Harvest will discuss how they built and reshaped brands for 2021, and what tools founders should consider today in designing a compelling brand.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use Customer Feedback and Data Analysis to Iterate Your Product with Eleanor Morgan (InVision) and Jean-Denis Greze (Plaid)</strong></p>
<p>Everyone has an opinion on product changes. Customers complain, NPS scores are calculated, and internal leaders have their own vision on what comes next. Then there are all the people who are silent — including future customers who may not even know a startup exists yet. How do you find signal from all the noise and build a compelling product roadmap that properly calibrates every tradeoff? Jean-Denis Greze of Plaid and Eleanor Morgan of InVision offer their perspectives as product leaders on how to keep a bold perspective in product while getting the details right.</p>
<p><strong>Pitch Deck Teardown with Maren Bannon (January Ventures), Melody Koh (NextView Ventures), and Benjamin Ling (Bling Capital)</strong></p>
<p>An articulate, alluring pitch presentation is a big part of successfully fundraising, and yet it&#8217;s relatively uncommon for founders to get candid feedback on how they communicated the problem, their solution, and their path to success. During the Pitch Deck Teardown, VCs will offer their live feedback on decks submitted by audience members.</p>
<p><strong>How DAOs Could Shake Up VC with David Pakman (Venrock) and speakers to be announced</strong></p>
<p>Investment in blockchain startups and tokens exploded in 2021, and some investors are blowing up the idea of a venture capital firm as they look to back more projects in the crypto world. DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, are starting to pop up more and more, turning traditional VC on its head by building investment organizations on the blockchain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://simplified.co/">Simplified</a>, a marketing-focused design software looking to take on Canva, has raised $2.2 million in seed funding led by Craft Ventures. Superhuman&#8217;s Rahul Vohra and Todd Goldberg, former Uber CPO Manik Gupta, Pelican Ventures Ajay Yadav (also Roomie founder), Form Capital, 8Bit Capital, Early Grey Capital, GFR Fund, MyAsia VC and others participated in the round.</p>
<p>Simplified is aimed directly at marketers, who are inevitably responsible for generating an enormous amount of content across a variety of channels. The platform uses machine learning to automate as much of the content creation process as possible, including copy, imagery, format and sizing, and more.</p>
<p>For example, a marketer could be looking to post an inspirational quote on social media. They can designate that the content is meant for social media, run a search for inspirational quotes and ask the system to automatically provide an appropriate background. From there, the user can tweak whatever they&#8217;d like, like typeface or image cropping, and instantly publish.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Simplified also features collaborative tools that let teams share work and assets across the organization, as well as integrations with stock photo and video services.</p>
<p>The general principle here is to take what has already become a simplified process, through products like Canva, to the next level through machine learning and GPT3.</p>
<p>According to founder KD Deshpande, it&#8217;s all about scale. While it may be easier than ever to create a single piece of content, there is still the matter of volume. Simplified looks to speed up the process of content creation using its machine learning automation algorithms.</p>
<p>This comes in the midst of a massive evolution of the design space over the past several years, with players like InVision, Figma, and Canva leading the charge in providing fresh, new design tools that meet the demands of a new generation of designers and design-oriented organizations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is updating its app to make its audio chat room feature, <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces">Twitter Spaces</a>, a central part of the user experience. Today, the company will begin to roll out a dedicated tab for Twitter Spaces in the main navigation bar of its mobile app, initially on iOS to select users. The feature will see Twitter Spaces gain the middle spot in this bar, in between the Search magnifying glass icon and the bell icon for Notifications. As Spaces is not replacing any other tab, that means the navigation bar will now have to accommodate five icons instead of only four.</p>
<p>Not everyone will see the update immediately. Instead, only around 500 people from the original Spaces beta test will first see the new Spaces discovery tab, as it&#8217;s called, when it rolls out today.</p>
<p>Twitter says the tab will showcase the Spaces being hosted by people you follow, but these won&#8217;t appear like they do on the Fleet line today at the top of the Timeline. Instead, the discovery tab will present Spaces in a more visual format, similar to the promotion cards that appear when you tweet about upcoming Spaces.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2161002" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161002" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2161002" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2161002" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch that, even though Spaces can be fun, it understands the live events have been hard to find and keep track of, given there&#8217;s been no dedicated place where Spaces can be discovered. The new tab aims to change that.</p>
<p>Within the tab, users will be able to see active Spaces with more details, including Space names, hosts, and people you know who are participating. The tab will also allow users to manage reminders for scheduled Spaces so you&#8217;re be notified when they&#8217;re about to begin, and give Twitter feedback about which Spaces you&#8217;d like to see more of.</p>
<p>App researcher Jane Manchun Wong had<a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1372252161363513345"> uncovered Twitter&#8217;s plans</a> to revamp its app to include Spaces on the nav bar last month.</p>
<p>Currently, only Twitter users with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">at least 600 followers</a> have been granted the ability to host Spaces, and Twitter told us that figure has not changed with the launch of the tab. However, the company still has grand plans for the Spaces product, including not only scheduled Spaces which are now becoming easier to find with this discovery feature, but also things like ticketed events, co-hosted events, accessibility improvements and more.</p>
<p>Putting Spaces directly in navigation bar represents a big push for Twitter&#8217;s audio chat rooms, which have otherwise been fairly easy to ignore by those who aren&#8217;t that interested in Twitter&#8217;s Clubhouse competitor. It also arrives at a time when Clubhouse is expanding access to its own social audio app. Following its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/clubhouse-android-worldwide-launch/"> debut on Android</a>, Clubhouse said 2 million Android users have already joined its platform.</p>
<p>Twitter, meanwhile, hasn&#8217;t yet publicized how many users have tested out Spaces at this point, either as a host or an end user.</p>
<p>Alongside today&#8217;s launch, Twitter will also begin to roll out another Spaces feature that was previously being tested: displaying the purple ring around someone&#8217;s profile pictures from the Home Timeline.</p>
<p>Currently, profile pics can be highlighted with a blue ring that takes you to the user&#8217;s Fleets when tapped, but the new purple ring will indicate they&#8217;re actively using Spaces at that time. You can then tap their profile pic to join them. The feature makes it easier to find Spaces while you&#8217;re just scrolling your Twitter Timeline as usual.</p>
<p>After the new Spaces tab is tried out with the original beta test group, it will begin rolling out more people, Twitter says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The agriculture sector is ripe for technological improvements, but beyond <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/spacetech-startup-constellr-that-can-monitor-land-surface-temperatures-raises-e1m-pre-seed-round/">satellite-based crop management</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/beehero-smartens-up-hives-to-provide-pollination-as-a-service-with-4m-seed-round/">bees-as-a-service</a>, the actual people who work in the fields should be benefiting as well. <a href="https://www.ganaz.com/">Ganaz</a>, empowered by a $7M A round, aims to change how people with little documentation and no bank account get paid and send money with a modern workforce stack that embraces low tech as well.</p>
<p>Growers — that is to say, the companies that own and operate the fields and sell the crops — are under pressure from multiple directions as wages rise, regulations increase, and willing workers dwindle. They need to save money to make money, but they can&#8217;t do so by paying less; in addition to being cruel to a marginalized class of people, it would only exacerbate the labor shortage in the sector.</p>
<p>There are plenty of companies out there that help save costs by automating things like payroll and onboarding, but the agriculture business has some unique limitations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still operating like it&#8217;s the &#8217;80s,&#8221; explained Ganaz founder and CEO Hannah Freeman. The number one service these workers rely on is check cashing or payday loans, and fees from these, currency exchange, ATM fees, and remittances eat up a significant portion of each paycheck. &#8220;The workforce in our world definitely doesn&#8217;t have corporate email and rarely uses personal email. They have trouble downloading and using mobile apps, don&#8217;t use usernames. But they&#8217;re very conversant in WhatsApp and SMS — so you have to kind of know how to build for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ecosystem has parallels to other regions that have stuck with older, cheaper technologies instead of adopting the latest and most expensive tech. Entire markets in Africa and South America, for instance, run on text-based commerce taking place on aging and unreliable infrastructure.</p>
<p>Ganaz has opted for a hybrid approach. The company&#8217;s platform offers several services on both the worker and employer side.</p>
<p>Onboarding and basic training can be done simply and intuitively for people who may not be highly literate, via tablets loaded with apps that also operate offline. The most common alternative seems to be file folders served out of a crate in the back of a pickup — that&#8217;s not a dig, it&#8217;s just what has made sense for years for this highly fluid, distributed workforce.</p>
<p>Payment and balance checks all happen over SMS or WhatsApp with workers, but for sensitive information they are shunted to a web app; similarly, integrated remittance partnerships are coming that will keep things simple and reduce fees.</p>
<p>On the employer side, the workers and all their vital stats and documents are tracked centrally in the kind of interface companies have grown to expect. And Ganaz works as an intermediary to send text alerts and questions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160642" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/web-app-messages.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160642" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2160642" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/web-app-messages.png" alt="Diagram showing how employers can send texts to many workers at once." width="1024" height="353" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/web-app-messages.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/web-app-messages.png?resize=150,52 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/web-app-messages.png?resize=300,103 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/web-app-messages.png?resize=768,265 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/web-app-messages.png?resize=680,234 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/web-app-messages.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2160642" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ganaz</p></div></p>
<p>So far Ganaz has 75 employers signed up, one of which is a Costco supplier group, and all told around 175,000 workers on the platform. Their ARR and user count both approximately tripled year over year, so they&#8217;re clearly on to something.</p>
<p>The company has tempered its rapid growth with designation as a public benefit corporation, which emphasizes the intention to do more than grow shareholder value. I asked about the tension between needing to show a profit and working in the service of a marginalized group.</p>
<p>&#8220;This keeps me up at night,&#8221; admitted Freeman. &#8220;We try to make sure to set ourselves up to be true to our mission. That means the folks we hire, our board of directors&#8230; we want to make sure we&#8217;re empathizing and honoring the trust we&#8217;ve built with people.&#8221;</p>
<p>That includes investors as well, and Freeman noted that the company ended up going with Trilogy as lead for this round partly because of that firm&#8217;s experience with Remit.ly.</p>

<p>For instance, Freeman noted, while it would be easy to juice profits by bumping ATM fees, that directly harms the people they&#8217;re trying to help. Instead, when they issue their payroll Mastercard later this year, that will allow workers to skip the check cashing step and its fees, and then Ganaz gets a share of the normal card transaction fee. &#8220;We can be equally successful that way,&#8221; said Freeman, and it doesn&#8217;t just replace another predatory structure.</p>
<p>After the cards the plan is to automate remittances, so a user can easily choose to send money to their family in a way that minimizes handling fees and so on. And there will be other options,m accessible via text, to choose where money goes if not to the card.</p>
<p>Ganaz&#8217;s main market is the U.S. and Mexico, since the agriculture business and workforce are both largely binational, but there are other targets on the horizon. First, though, the company wants to solidify its position and feature set here. &#8220;There&#8217;s no breakaway winner yet, so we want to be that winner,&#8221; said Freeman.</p>
<p>The $7M round also had participation from Bessemer Venture Partners, Founders&#8217; Co-op, Taylor Ventures, AgFunder and Techstars. Rapid expansion and aggressive pursuit of the roadmap are next up for Ganaz.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are conscious of both the huge opportunity ahead of us to digitize billions of dollars in payroll, as well as the responsibility to build inclusive, low-cost, wealth-building tools for workers,&#8221; said Freeman.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google does a lot of things well. But hardware strategy has never really been among them. The last several years have seen the company at least finding some consistency with its Pixel and Nest devices. But the former, in particular, has continued to struggle as the company has worked to find its footing in an already crowded space.</p>
<p>In 2017, the company entered the wireless earbud space with the first-gen Pixel Buds. The product was certainly an original take on the category, both in terms of design and features. Ultimately, however, it fell flat. But an “A” for effort, I guess. The second-gen product, introduced in April of last year, corrected a lot of their predecessor’s problems, mostly by delivering a more straightforward approach.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2158897" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158897" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2158897" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9285.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9285.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9285.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9285.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9285.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9285.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9285.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9285.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9285.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158897" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Announced today, the Pixel Buds A-Series find the company capitalizing on that success with an approach that has worked well for Google’s smartphone line. The first Pixel A arrived just as the company was dealing with the consequences of poor mobile sales. The low-cost approach to the line sold well (by Google smartphone standards), helping deliver positive news for the beleaguered line.</p>
<p>As with the budget phones, the price is, once again, the thing. Here that means $99. It’s a price point that puts it below the new Echo Buds ($119) and Samsung Galaxy Buds ($110), and well under the AirPods 2 ($159). Essentially it’s the low end of the mid-tier of fully wireless earbud pricing. There is arguably even more competition at the really low end, where you can pick up of a pair of Anker earbuds for around $40. But relative to what we’d generally consider brand names, the pricing is quite aggressive.</p>

<p>It’s also a significant reduction from the standard Pixel Buds, which sport an MSRP of $170 (though you can find them quite a bit cheaper with minimal effort). The Series A aren’t replacing the standard Pixel Buds, so much as augmenting them &#8212; similar to what Apple did with AirPods, albeit on the other end of the pricing spectrum. With the new buds on the market, I would anticipate a further narrowing of the price gap between the products on many online retailers. As of this writing, there’s at least one offering the Pixel Buds second gens for $99.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2158892" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158892" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2158892" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9290.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9290.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9290.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9290.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9290.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9290.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9290.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9290.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9290.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158892" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>As you’d expect, the lower cost comes with a bit of corner-cutting &#8212; or at least the removal of some non-essentials. Ultimately the value for a given user comes down to what you’re willing to lose for the sake of a lower price point. The top-level losses here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>No wireless charging</li>
<li>The loss of Attention Alerts (a feature that momentarily reduces volume when things like a siren, baby crying or dog barking are heard), due to lower-cost sensors</li>
<li>The loss of noise reduction for calls and wind</li>
<li>Limited tap gestures</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, the Series A are a lot like the Pixel Buds 2, including a similar 12 mm dynamic speaker driver and a nearly identical design. In fact, I was struck by just how similar they were. The size, the shape &#8212; really, the only immediate distinction here is coloring. It wasn’t broke, so Google didn’t really fix it. Gone are the bolder matte colors of the predecessors. Now the headphones feature two glossy colors: Clearly White and Dark Olive. Google sent the former, which is a bit more off-white than the AirPods (a bit closer to the Echo Buds coloring), paired with a kind of dull gray. If you want bolder colors, you’re going to have to stick with the standard buds, which also feature a striking orange and mint green colors. I prefer the matte coloring of the original, but the company had to do something to set these apart, I suppose.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2158889" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158889" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2158889" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9294.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9294.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9294.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9294.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9294.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9294.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9294.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9294.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9294.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158889" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The case is the same vertically oriented oval design as the earlier version. It’s similar in volume to the AirPods Pro &#8212; so pretty easy to just pop into a pocket. The USB-C charging port is on the bottom; a light up front tips you off on charging status and the sync button is toward the bottom of the back. Flip up the top and reveal two familiar earbuds.</p>
<p>The size and shape are more or less the same as the Pixel Buds &#8212; a good thing, as they’re pretty comfortable over long periods. That’s certainly not something I can say for all of the competition. The silicone tips are user-replaceable for a better fit, but the small silicone ear tip is stuck in there for good. That’s fine for me, but your results may vary.</p>
<p>Like their predecessors, the A Series’ (total side note, but after writing so many funding rounds, I really want to write &#8220;Series A&#8221;) sound falls in the middle of the pack. You can get better quality from higher-end headphones like the AirPods Pro or Sony WF-1000XM3 (talk about being overdue for a refresh), but these are totally capable for day to day listening and making calls, even if the mic has lost a few of its tricks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2158899" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158899" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2158899" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9281.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9281.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9281.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9281.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9281.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9281.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9281.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9281.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9281.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158899" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>There’s no noise canceling here. That’s to be expected, of course, given that the standard Pixel Buds don’t have the feature either. Given that it’s becoming increasingly standardized, it’s probably a no-brainer that the Pixel Buds 3 will offer the feature to further distinguish them from the budget model.</p>
<p>The buds offer five hours on a charge (2.5 hours of talk time) and 12 hours when the case is factored in &#8212; again, same as the Pixel Buds. They also boast the same IPX4 rating for water/sweat resistance. The Bluetooth connectivity is fairly strong. I found I was able to walk over to another room without losing connection, which is often hit or miss on buds.</p>

<p>They’ll pair to either an Android (6.0+) or iOS device. Naturally, of course, they play nicely with the former, using Fast Pair. On an Apple handset, you’ll have to use the pairing button. Google Assistant &#8212; one of the standout features &#8212; also only works with Android devices. It’s handiest for enabling notifications, as well as real-time use of Google Translate.</p>
<p>Nothing about the Pixel Buds A Series is going to set the earbud world on fire. And that’s not really the point. More than anything, the product is an exercise in trimming the fat in order to deliver a solid experience at less than $100. And by that standard, they largely succeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">VC funds <a href="https://www.frst.vc">Frst</a> and <a href="https://www.fabric.vc">Fabric Ventures</a> are teaming up to create <a href="https://www.lecryptofellowship.com">Le Crypto Fellowship</a>. With this program, the two firms want to find the next 10 crypto entrepreneurs in France. And they think they might foster the most promising crypto startups if they don’t have any preconceived idea and team yet.</p>
<p>As Pierre Entremont from Frst writes in <a href="https://medium.com/frstvc/le-crypto-fellowship-by-frst-fabric-10-x-100k-pour-cr%C3%A9er-10-crypto-entrepreneurs-from-d73bd016410f">a Medium post</a>, there are a lot of opportunities if you want to build the next crypto success, but few entrepreneurs are actively looking at this space.</p>
<p>“Nearly all crypto developers and entrepreneurs are already rich and therefore don’t step up their ambition,” he writes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Blockchain development and DeFi projects are nearly always open source. Learning resources are available for free around the web. So it’s not that hard to get started and build a prototype, but you have to get started. Frst and Fabric Ventures think they can create the right framework to incentivize the next generation of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>If you get accepted into the program, the two VC firms will hand you €100,000 in exchange for 7% of your company. Basically, this should cover one year of salary for one person in France with a salary of €50,000, €21,000 in employer contributions and €29,000 in expenses. You can be based in another country as long as it’s in the same timezone and you incorporate your company in France.</p>
<p>This way, you get to play around and think about an ambitious idea without feeling any financial pressure. You’ll join a Discord channel with other fellows and you’ll attend weekly Zoom meetings during the first few months. After that, Fabric Ventures and Frst partners will schedule regular office hours with you to check in on your progress.</p>
<p>If you end up creating a proper company and taking your idea to the next level, the fellowship may later ask to invest an additional €700,000 for a 20% stake in the company.</p>
<p>Candidates can apply until June 15. Le Crypto Fellowship isn’t looking for people who already have an idea or are only available part-time. But if you want to join as a team of 2 or 3, you can. Instead of €100,000, you’ll get €200,000 or €300,000. Working as a team will probably help you remain motivated over the long haul.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first startup mentoring program. The <a href="https://thielfellowship.org">Thiel Fellowship</a> is arguably the most well-known one. But Le Crypto Fellowship doesn’t limit itself to college dropouts and has a different focus. It’s going to be interesting to see if it pans out and if the VC firms will have a second, a third and a fourth batch down the road.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What happens to technology companies with slowing growth and a rising focus on profitability before they reach behemoth scale? How much does the market value hypergrowth?</p>
<p>Just because a technology startup has a hot start, that doesn&#8217;t mean it will grow quickly forever. Most will wind up somewhere in the middle &#8212; or worse. Put simply, there is a larger number of tech companies that do fine or a little bit worse after they reach scale.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what every investor hopes for is the hot company that can keep growth alive even after reaching material scale, running through walls, competitors, economic headwinds and anything else that comes its way. Those companies don&#8217;t end up worth a few hundred million, or a billion, but can end up valued in the dozens of billions or more.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995212" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>In reverse, tech companies &#8212; even those with strong gross margins &#8212; with slipping growth can see their multiples compress rapidly. Then, the vultures circle.</p>
<p>Which explains some of the news we&#8217;ve seen recently in the market. As Dropbox <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/hedge-fund-elliott-management-has-big-dropbox-stake-wsj-2021-06-02/">comes under fresh pressure from external parties</a>, joining its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">erstwhile rival Box in the public-market growth penalty box</a>, we&#8217;re seeing companies like Braze, Gong, Shippo and others rip ahead with rapid-fire funding rounds or public brags about their growth.</p>
<p>While the differential between the two groups is clear, it&#8217;s still worth exploring in more detail. Let&#8217;s talk about the growth dividend. Or, if you&#8217;d prefer, the existential cost of growth deceleration.</p>
<h2>Grow or die</h2>
<p>The news this week that Dropbox has attracted an activist shareholder should not have been a surprise. Its former rival Box is in the midst of a long-running struggle with an activist investor of its own.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Locus (not to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/locus-raises-50-million-for-its-logistics-management-business/">confused with this Locus</a>) is one of those names that’s been popping up a lot in the news &#8212; and this roundup &#8212; over the past year. Last time we spoke to the Massachusetts company, it was around a sizable raise &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/locus-robotics-has-raised-a-150m-series-e/">$150 million to be nearly precise</a>. That effectively valued the company as a unicorn.</p>
<p>Core to the company’s successes are its partnerships (as is the case with any robotics fulfillment company). DHL has been a big (or the biggest) name in the mix since 2017. Amid pandemic lockdowns, the logistic giant signed up for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/dhl-will-deploy-1000-robots-from-locus-robotics-for-delivery-fulfillment/">1,000 robots last year</a> and, as of yesterday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/dhl-will-deploy-2000-locus-robotics-units-by-2022/">is doubling that number</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114223" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114223" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2114223" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114223" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Locus Robotics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DHL is really committing to robotics here. At last count, it said it had deployed around 200,000 across the U.S. alone, which puts its right around the same number as Amazon (which admittedly, hasn’t updated that figure lately). Of course, the big difference there is that Amazon is primarily pulling from in-house systems &#8212; perhaps Locus is a prime acquisition target?</p>
<p>The robotics company’s CEO shot down that suggestion when I spoke to him earlier this year, stating, “We have no interest in being acquired. We think we can build the most and greatest value by operating independently. There are investors that want to invest in helping everyone that’s not named ‘Amazon’ compete.”</p>
<p>When it comes to companies with deep pockets, though, I never say never.</p>

<p>Also out this morning, is a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/realtime-robotics-raises-a-31m-series-a/"> good size round from Realtime Robotics</a>. The Boston-based company is one of a number of startups looking to streamline the process of installing and deploying industrial robotics. The $31.4 million Series A includes participation from (deep breath)  HAHN Automation, SAIC Capital Management, Soundproof Ventures , Heroic Ventures, SPARX Asset Management, Omron Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures, Scrum Ventures and Duke Angels.</p>

<p>There’s no such thing as a small raise, only a small…I’m not sure. Honestly, I didn’t really thing this one all the way through before I started typing. Anyway, here’s an early-stage, pre-seed from a London based startup <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/467073-82#overview">called E-Nano</a>. The company has developed a modular robotics system for monitoring sports turf.</p>
<p>Per a press release on the £100,000 ($141,000) raise, “These robots will eventually be able to assess agricultural land and contribute to landowners growing more sustainably. The team aims to implement 5G connectivity into their robots and platform, using this raise to deliver more immediate, real-time data with high throughput.”</p>

<p>Some good news for DJI comes <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/556370-pentagon-report-clears-use-of-drones-made-by-top-chinese-manufacturer?rl=1">courtesy of The Hill</a>, which reports that the Pentagon has effectively cleared the drone giant in an audit. DJI was one of the names caught up in all of the flagging of Chinese companies that’s occurred over the past couple of years (read: during the Trump administration), which has severely kneecapped brands like Huawei and ZTE. DJI was never banned for sale outright in the States, but this is still a pretty massive relief for its ability to operate in such a large market.</p>
<p>The filing notes that it found “no malicious code or intent” from the company, going so far as “recommend[ing] use by government entities and forces working with US services.” Government use is a nice bonus there.</p>
<p>The company took a victory lap in a comment provided to TechCrunch, noting, “This U.S. government report is the strongest confirmation to date of what we, and independent security validations, have been saying for years – DJI drones are safe and secure for government and enterprise operations.”</p>

<p>Starship Technologies, meanwhile, snagged a high-profile name to lead the delivery robotics firm. Former Alphabet Loon CEO Alastair Westgarth will be taking the same title at his new company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku is expanding its programming for its free content hub, The Roku Channel, with today&#8217;s launch of its own weekly entertainment program called &#8220;Roku Recommends.&#8221; The 15-minute show will leverage Roku&#8217;s data to highlight the Top 5 titles for viewers to stream that week. While not exactly &#8220;original programming&#8221; the way that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/roku-launches-an-original-programming-lineup-fueled-by-quibis-content/">Roku&#8217;s recent additions of its acquired Quibi content</a> is, the series will run only on Roku, where it can be found in The Roku Channel and Featured Free, with new episodes every Thursday.</p>
<p>The series is the first production to emerge from the new Roku Brand Studio &#8212;<a href="https://advertising.roku.com/en-ca/resources/videos/roku-brand-studio"> a studio that aims to produce</a> video ads and other custom branded content for ad partners. The show is produced by Funny Or Die, and Mike Farah, Beth Belew and Jim Ziegler serve as executive producers.</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s co-hosts include entertainment reporter and AfterBuzz TV co-founder Maria Menounos and former NFL player Andrew “Hawk” Hawkins. The duo will present the Top 5 titles to viewers. These recommended shows or movies may come from any of the thousands of channels across the Roku platform, based on data exclusive to the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;According to Nielsen data, the average streamer spends more than seven minutes searching for what to watch next,&#8221; said Chris Bruss, head of Roku Brand Studio, in a statement. &#8220;We are uniquely positioned to use our trending data both to help consumers find incredible movies and shows and to help advertisers go beyond the traditional 30-second ad to entertain streamers who otherwise spend time in ad-free, subscription-only environments,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Roku will launch original programming fueled by Quibi&#8217;s content on May 20&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/roku-launches-an-original-programming-lineup-fueled-by-quibis-content/embed/#?secret=8mpAcjOCmo" data-secret="8mpAcjOCmo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The series will also allow for ad sponsors. The company says it has already signed on several national advertisers, starting with Walmart, to sponsor the program. Advertisers will have access to Roku&#8217;s Measurement Partner Program to determine whether or not their integration reaches subscription video on-demand (SVOD)-only streaming users, as well as view other metrics about their video ad campaign&#8217;s reach, brand perception and impact.</p>
<p>The series comes at a time when the streaming landscape is shifting. Today&#8217;s streaming services regularly serve up recommended content based on what their customers are watching &#8212; Netflix, for example, shows rows of popular and trending content, as well as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/new-netflix-feature-reveals-the-top-10-most-popular-programs-on-its-service/">Top 10 list of newly popular titles.</a> But as the number of available streaming services grows, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/discovery-warnermedia-merger-company-name-1234955035/">larger entities merge</a>, and content jumps around as licensing agreements end and start, consumers may be more in need of a set of current recommendations from across channels and services, not just those isolated inside one service.</p>
<p><a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/introducing-the-all-new-fire-tv-experience-b1ebecbd813">Amazon Fire TV&#8217;s update</a> recently addressed this need with the introduction of a new &#8220;Find&#8221; feature that aims to make it easier for users to search and browse movies, shows and free content across its platform. Roku, however, didn&#8217;t have a recommendation system of its own.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to see that Roku is willing to use its proprietary streaming data in this way &#8212; something it could choose to do more with further down the road to help build out a broader set of recommendations.</p>

<p>Realtime is one of a number of startups building control on top of industrial robotics. Specifically, the startup looks to help companies deploy systems with limited programming, offering adaptable controls that work for multiple systems at once.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This round, which nearly doubles the company’s existing funding, will be used to accelerate its product development and extend its offering to more markets, globally. It comes as interest in robotics have ramped up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/top-vcs-discuss-how-covid-19-is-impacting-robotics/">amid the global pandemic</a>.</p>
<p>“This investment by some of the world’s leading manufacturers and automation providers stands as a testament to our ability to dramatically improve the value proposition for robotic implementations,” CEO Peter Howard says in a release. “Having already realized early deployment success, a broad spectrum of customers and partners are working closely with us to refine features and user experiences, readying our technology for rollouts in their engineering, factory and warehouse operations.”</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s offerings serve a wide range of different industrial robotics tasks, including pick and place machines, packaging and palletizing boxes.</p>
