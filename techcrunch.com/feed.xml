										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid the rise of remote selling due to the pandemic, <a href="http://Walnut.io">Walnut</a>, billing itself as a &#8216;Wix for Sales teams,’ has raised $3.5m from SV Angel (Ron and Topher Conway) and A.Capital by Ronny Conway and former a16z partners. This brings its total amount raised to $6m. Other investors include NFX, Joe Montana, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wix">Wix <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO, Immad Akhund and Kenny Stone.</p>
<p>Walnut is solving the friction between sales and back-end teams and the problem of sales demos that break during calls. A sales rep logs in to the main dashboard/product they are trying to sell and uses Walnut to choose pages and features that will be disconnected from the backend and appear as front-end in Walnut&#8217;s cloud, then edit to match it to the specific client. It&#8217;s like building web pages but for sales pitches.</p>
<p>It’s currently working with enterprise clients like Varonis and Adobe. While it competes with <a href="http://Gong.io">Gong.io</a>, Walnut is hoping that its more technical approach of disconnecting front-end and back-end will aid its progress.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in 2018, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2018/08/29/cncf-receives-9-million-cloud-credit-grant-from-google/">announced</a> that it would provide $9 million in Google Cloud Platform credits &#8212; divided over three years &#8212; to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) to help it run the development and distribution infrastructure for the Kubernetes project. Previously, Google owned and managed those resources for the community. Today, the two organizations announced that Google is adding on to this grant with another $3 million annual donation to the CNCF to &#8220;help ensure the long-term health, quality and stability of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kubernetes" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kubernetes">Kubernetes <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and its ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Google notes, the funds will go to the testing and infrastructure of the Kubernetes project, which currently sees over 2,300 monthly pull requests that trigger about 400,000 integration test runs, all of which use about 300,000 core hours on GCP.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really happy that we&#8217;re able to continue to make this investment,&#8221; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/aparna-sinha" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="aparna-sinha">Aparna Sinha, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a director of product management at Google and the chairperson of the CNCF governing board, told me. &#8220;We know that it is extremely important for the long-term health, quality and stability of Kubernetes and its ecosystem and we&#8217;re delighted to be partnering with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation on an ongoing basis. At the end of the day, the real goal of this is to make sure that developers can develop freely and that Kubernetes, which is of course so important to everyone, continues to be an excellent, solid, stable standard for doing that.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sinha also noted that Google contributes a lot of code to the project, with 128,000 code contributions in the last twelve months alone. But on top of these technical contributions, the team is also making in-kind contributions through community engagement and mentoring, for example, in addition to the kind of financial contributions the company is announcing today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Kubernetes project has been growing so fast &#8212; the releases are just one after the other,&#8221; said <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/priyanka-sharma-2" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="priyanka-sharma-2">Priyanka Sharma, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/priyanka-sharma-takes-over-the-leadership-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation/">General Manager of the CNCF</a>. &#8220;And there are big changes, all of this has to run somewhere. [&#8230;] This specific contribution of the $3 million, that&#8217;s where that comes in. So the Kubernetes project can be stress-free, [knowing] they have enough credits to actually run for a full year. And that security is critical because you don&#8217;t want Kubernetes to be wondering where will this run next month. This gives the developers and the contributors to the project the confidence to focus on feature sets, to build better, to make Kubernetes ever-evolving.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that while both Google and the CNCF are putting their best foot forward here, there have been some questions around Google&#8217;s management around the Istio service mesh project, which was incubated by Google and IBM a few years ago. At some point in 2017, there was a proposal to bring it under the CNCF umbrella, but that never happened. This year, Istio became one of the founding projects of Open Usage Commons, though that group is mostly concerned with trademarks, not with project governance. And while all of this may seem like a lot of inside baseball &#8212; and it is &#8212; but it had some members of the open-source community question <a href="https://thenewstack.io/googles-management-of-the-istio-service-mesh-raises-questions-in-the-cloud-native-community/">Google&#8217;s commitment to organizations like the CNCF</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google contributes to a lot of open-source projects. [&#8230;] There&#8217;s a lot of them, many are with open-source foundations under the Linux Foundation, many of them are otherwise,&#8221; Sinha said when I asked her about this. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing new, or anything to report about anything else. In particular, this discussion &#8212; and our focus very much with the CNCF here is on Kubernetes, which I think &#8212; out of everything that we do &#8212; is by far the biggest contribution or biggest amount of time and biggest amount of commitment relative to anything else.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> today announced that it is doing away with all non-essential cookies on its platform. Thanks to this, starting today, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/github" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="github">GitHub <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.com and its subdomains will not feature a cookie banner anymore, either. That&#8217;s one less cookie banner you&#8217;ll have to click away to get your work done.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one likes cookie banners,&#8221; GitHub CEO Nat Friedman writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;But cookie banners are everywhere!&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason for that, of course, is because of regulations like GDPR in the U.S. and the EU&#8217;s directive to give users the right to refuse the use of cookies that reduce their online privacy. The result, even though these regulations have the users&#8217; best interest in mind, is the constant barrage of cookie banners you experience today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At <span class="il">GitHub</span>, we want to protect developer privacy, and we find cookie banners irritating, so we decided to look for a solution. After a brief search, we found one: just don’t use any non-essential cookies. Pretty simple, really,&#8221; Friedman writes.</p>
<p>To be fair, for a service like GitHub, it may be a bit easier to do away with cookies than for most sites &#8212; and especially content sites (and yes, I&#8217;m well aware that you probably had to click away from a cookie popup when you came to TechCrunch, too. Feel free to tell me about the irony of that in the comments). GitHub, after all, has a paid product and an audience that likely uses extensions to block trackers and unnecessary cookies anyway. Because of this, the tracking data it gathered was probably not all that useful anyway. GitHub is one of the first large sites to make this move, though, and may be able to set a bit of a trend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, day one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/#tickets">TC Sessions: Space 2020</a>, was (brace yourself) out of this world. Bad puns aside, today’s lineup promises even more in-depth interviews, Q&amp;As and breakout sessions with the top experts in the space industry.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Businesses today feel, more than ever before, the imperative to have flexible e-commerce strategies in place, able to connect with would-be customers wherever they might be. That market driver has now led to a significant growth round for a startup that is helping the larger of these businesses, including those targeting the B2B market, build out their digital sales operations with more agile, responsive e-commerce solutions.</p>
<p><a href="http://spryker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spryker</a>, which provides a full suite of e-commerce tools for businesses &#8212; starting with a platform to bring a company&#8217;s inventory online, through to tools to analyse and measure how that inventory is selling and where, and then adding on voice commerce, subscriptions, click &amp; collect, IoT commerce, and other new features and channels to improve the mix &#8212; has closed a round of $130 million.</p>
<p>It plans to use the funding to expand its own technology tools, as well as grow internationally. The company makes revenues in the mid-8 figures (so, around $50 million annually) and some 10% of its revenues currently come from the U.S. The plan will be to grow that business as part of its wider expansion, tackling a market for e-commerce software that is estimated to be worth some $7 billion annually.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series C was led by TCV &#8212; the storied investor that has backed giants like Facebook, Airbnb, Netflix, Spotify and Splunk, as well as interesting, up-and-coming e-commerce &#8220;plumbing&#8221; startups like Spryker, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/retail-technology-platform-relex-raises-200m-from-tcv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relex</a> and more. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/spryker-announces-22-million-growth-capital-investment-677062933.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Previous backers</a> One Peak and Project A Ventures also participated.</p>
<p>We understand that this latest funding values <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/berlin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="berlin">Berlin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-based Spryker at over $500 million.</p>
<p>Spryker today has around 150 customers, global businesses that run the gamut from recognised fashion brands through to companies that, as Boris Lokschin, who co-founded the company with Alexander Graf (the two share the title of co-CEOs) put it, are &#8220;hidden champions, leaders and brands you have never heard about doing things like selling silicone isolations for windows.&#8221; The roster includes Metro, Aldi Süd, Toyota and <a href="https://spryker.com/en/customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many others</a>.</p>
<p>The plan will be to continue to support and grow its wider business building e-commerce tools for all kinds of larger companies, but in particular Spryker plans to use this tranche of funding to double down specifically on the B2B opportunity, building more agile e-commerce storefronts and in some cases also developing marketplaces around that.</p>
<p>One might assume that in the world of e-commerce, consumer-facing companies need to be the most dynamic and responsive, not least because they are facing a mass market and all the whims and competitive forces that might drive users to abandon shopping carts, look for better deals elsewhere, or simply get distracted by the latest notification of a TikTok video or direct message.</p>
<p>For consumer-facing businesses, making sure they have the latest adtech, marketing tech, and tools to improve discovery and conversion is a must.</p>
<p>It turns out that business-facing businesses are no less immune to their own set of customer distractions and challenges &#8212; particularly in the current market, buffeted as it is by the global health pandemic and its economic reverberations. They, too, could benefit from testing out new channels and techniques to attract customers, help them with discovery and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve discovered that the model for success for B2B businesses online is not about different people, and not about money. They just don&#8217;t have the tooling,&#8221; said Graf. &#8220;Those that have proven to be more successful are those that are able to move faster, to test out everything that comes to mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spryker positions itself as the company to help larger businesses do this, much in the way that smaller merchants have adopted solutions from the likes of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shopify">Shopify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>In some ways, it almost feels like the case of Walmart versus <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> playing itself out across multiple verticals, and now in the world of B2B.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our biggest DIY customers [which would have previously served a mainly trade-only clientele] had to build a marketplace because of restrictions in their brick and mortar assortment, and in how it could be accessed,&#8221; Lokschin said. &#8220;You might ask yourself, who really needs more selection? But there are new providers like <a href="https://www.manomano.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mano Mano</a> and Amazon, both offering millions of products. Older companies then have to become marketplaces themselves to remain competitive.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems that even Spryker itself is not immune from that marketplace trend: part of the funding will be to develop a technology AppStore, where it can itself offer third-party tools to companies to complement what it provides in terms of e-commerce tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We integrate with hundreds of tech providers, including 30-40 payment providers, all of the essential logistics networks,&#8221; Lokschin said.</p>
<p>Spryker is part of that category of e-commerce businesses known as &#8220;headless&#8221; providers &#8212; by which they mean those using the tools do so by way of API-based architecture and other easy-to-integrate modules delivered through a &#8220;PaaS&#8221; (clould-based Platform as a Service) model.</p>
<p>It is not alone in that category: There have been a number of others playing on the same concept to emerge both in Europe and the U.S. They include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/italys-commerce-layer-raises-6m-led-by-benchmark-for-its-headless-e-commerce-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commerce Layer</a> in Italy; another startup out of Germany called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/commercetools-raises-145m-from-insight-for-shopify-style-e-commerce-apis-for-large-enterprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commercetools</a>; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/shogun-raises-35m-to-help-brands-take-on-amazon-with-faster-and-better-sites-of-their-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shogun</a> in the U.S.</p>
<p>Spryker&#8217;s argument is that by being a newer company (founded in 2018) it has a more up-to-date stack that puts it ahead of older startups and more incumbent players like SAP and Oracle.</p>
<p>That is part of what attracted TCV and others in this round, which was closed earlier than Spryker had even planned to raise (it was aiming for Q2 of next year) but came on good terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The commerce infrastructure market has been a high priority for TCV over the years. It is a large market that is growing rapidly on the back of e-commerce growth,&#8221; said Muz Ashraf, a principal at TCV, to TechCrunch. &#8220;We have invested in across other areas of the commerce stack, including payments (Mollie, Klarna), underlying infrastructure (Redis Labs) as well as systems of engagement (ExactTarget, Sitecore). Traditional offline vendors are increasingly rethinking their digital commerce strategy, more so given what we are living through, and that further acts as a market accelerant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having tracked Spryker for a while now, we think their solution meets the needs of enterprises who are increasingly looking for modern solutions that allow them to live in a best-of-breed world, future-proofing their commerce offerings and allowing them to provide innovative experiences to their consumers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everything is dumb until it works.</p>
<p>As 2020 comes to a close, the cryptocurrency world is experiencing another <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=bitcoin,ethereum,defi">late-year surge of consumer interest</a> as prices <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/bitcoin-passes-20k-and-reaches-all-time-high/">climb in value</a>. Bitcoin is over $23,000 as I write to you, an all-time high. Ethereum&#8217;s cryptocurrency has recovered sharply as well, returning to mid-2018 prices.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>These gains have created a huge amount of wealth for crypto holders. According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/bitcoin-passes-20k-and-reaches-all-time-high/">CoinMarketCap</a>, after falling under $140 billion in mid-March during the market selloff surrounding the beginning of COVID-19&#8217;s battering of America, the value of all cryptos has surged to nearly $659 billion.</p>

But your Twitter feed is once again rife with notes about crypto and some of your friends have become insufferable once again.</p>
<p>The tweets and the friends have something of a point. This morning I went around the internet with a basket, collecting information about active bitcoin wallets, the distributed app (Dapp) market, the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) space and other aspects to get a picture of what&#8217;s going on beyond mere price records.</p>
<p>After all, the price of every damn thing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/in-public-and-private-markets-cloud-earnings-and-valuations-heat-up/">is inflated today</a>, so seeing bitcoin set an all-time-high felt more appropriate than strange. Does the data show that there&#8217;s activity behind the valuation hype?</p>
<h2>A quick look around the world of crypto</h2>
<p>We have a few metrics to peek at, but let&#8217;s start with some old bitcoin-flavored favorites.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unique bitcoin addresses</strong> used, via Blockchain.info: <strong>Modestly bullish</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Per the charting section of <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-unique-addresses">Blockchain.info</a>, bitcoin unique addresses used &#8212; a proxy for the coin&#8217;s popularity &#8212; is up some in recent weeks, and up more generally in 2020. It remains below historical highs.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever used a Snapchat or Instagram filter, you know that one of the popular use cases for AR (augmented reality) is to change up your appearance with virtual makeup &#8212; like a different shade of lipstick or eyeshadow, for example. Today, Google is moving into this space, as well, with the <a href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/shopping-beauty-product-try-it-google/">launch</a> of an AR-powered cosmetics try-on experience on Google Search. The company is working partnership with top brands like L’Oreal, Estee Lauder, MAC Cosmetics, Black Opal, and Charlotte Tilbury, to allow consumers to try on makeup shades across a range of models with various skin tones or even on themselves using their front-facing camera on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Google created the new feature with help from data partners <a href="https://modiface.com/">ModiFace</a>, which offers AR tech to beauty brands, and <a href="https://www.perfectcorp.com/business">Perfect Corp</a>, makers of the popular YouCam Makeup app and other AR beauty tech.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088571" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088571" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2088571" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/E814_AR_Beauty_Gifs_Eyes_v03.gif?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088571" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, when consumers search for a particular lipstick or eyeshadow product on Google &#8212; like &#8220;L’Oreal’s Infallible Paints Metallic Eyeshadow,&#8221; for example &#8212; they&#8217;ll come across the virtual try-on shopping experience at the top of their search results. From here, they can click through photos of models representing a range of skin tone to help compare the shades and find the right product for you.</p>
<p>To see the product on yourself, another new option will enable you to do so with your phone&#8217;s camera. In this interface, a variety of shades are shown at the bottom of the camera feed for you to tap through &#8212; much like a social media filter would offer. The experience is similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/youtubes-new-ar-feature-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-while-watching-videos/">YouTube&#8217;s AR feature for makeup try-on</a> launched last year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088573" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088573" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2088573" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/E814_AR_Beauty_Gifs_Lips_v02.gif?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088573" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Except in Google&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s not trying to beautify your image for the purposes of social sharing. Its aim is to connect consumers to brands for the purpose of making sales, as part of its overall investment in online shopping and, of course, its broader online advertising business.</p>
<p>However, the AR try-on experience itself is not considered an ad format, Google tells us, and the participating brands are not paying Google to be a part of the feature. Instead, this is a continuation of Google&#8217;s moves to open up the Google Shopping destination to more retailers. In past years, the Shopping tab had been limited to paid product listings. But earlier this year, <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/shopping/bringing-free-retail-listings-google-search/">Google announced</a> it would make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/google-switches-its-shopping-search-service-to-mostly-free-listings/">the majority of its retail listings</a> on the Shopping tab free.</p>
<p>This move came at a critical time for retailers, whose businesses were being significantly impacted by physical retail store closures due to the pandemic. But Google wasn&#8217;t making the shift for altruistic reasons. The reality was that by limiting Shopping to paid ads, Google&#8217;s Shopping search results were limited, too. They also often led to out-of-stock items or had other data quality issues. Meanwhile, Amazon was ramping up its advertising business, threatening to cut into Google&#8217;s ad revenue.</p>
<p>Plus, many younger consumers today don&#8217;t shop on Google at all. They have been finding out about products from social media, then clicking through direct links to retailers to make purchases or even transacting directly on social platforms like Facebook or Instagram without leaving the app.</p>
<p>Google is entering this influencer-driven shopping market today, as well.</p>
<p>In addition to the AR try-on, Google will now show recommendations from beauty, apparel and home and garden enthusiasts and experts, who will talk about their favorite products in videos found in Google Shopping. For example, you can hear from professional makeup artist <a href="https://shopping.google.com/explore/c/JonetWMakeup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://shopping.google.com/explore/c/JonetWMakeup&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608301123572000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUpi8F-XffWVyhxUFsKFabdBsU1w">Jonet</a> about makeup looks or holiday gifts from <a href="https://shopping.google.com/explore/c/Homesick/v/c8dd5becaa6c8a92" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://shopping.google.com/explore/c/Homesick/v/c8dd5becaa6c8a92&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608301123572000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEHTwrpitfw6LJJNAIBnpkGoS0VvQ">Homesick Candles.</a></p>
<p>This feature comes from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/googles-latest-rd-project-is-shoploop-a-mobile-video-shopping-platform/">Shoploop</a>, a product that has now graduated from Area 120, Google&#8217;s in-house incubator. It competes with efforts in video-based shopping from Facebook, Instagram and, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">more recently, TikTok.</a></p>
<p>The launches arrive at a time when beauty brand <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/beauty-stocks-face-new-reality-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-11598952600">sales have been depressed</a> by the pandemic, not only because of store closures and a work-from-home lifestyle, but also because it doesn&#8217;t make as much sense to wear makeup when half your face is under a mask.</p>
<p>The new AR try-on and the influencer videos are available in the Google app on iOS and Android.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europe has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2484">greenlit</a> Google&#8217;s $2.1BN acquisition of fitness wearable maker Fitbit, applying a number of conditions intended to shrink competition concerns over letting it gobble a major cache of health and wellness data following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/google-fitbit-deal-to-be-scrutinized-in-europe-over-data-competition-concerns/">months of regulatory scrutiny of the deal</a>.</p>
<p>While <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced its plan to buy Fitbit over a year ago, it only notified the transaction to the Commission on June 15, 2020 &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s taken half a year to be given a caveated go-ahead by Europe. It is also now<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/"> facing formal antitrust charges on its home turf</a> &#8212; from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">more than one angle</a> (though not related to Fitbit).</p>
<p>Under the terms of the EU&#8217;s clearance for &#8216;Gitbit&#8217;, Google has committed not use the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fitbit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fitbit">Fitbit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> data of users in the European Economic Area for ad targeting purposes for a ten year period.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It says it will maintain a technical separation between health and wellness data collected via Fitbit wearables in a data silo kept separate from other Google data.</p>
<p>It has also committed to ensuring that regional users have an &#8220;effective choice&#8221; to grant or deny the use of health and wellness data stored in their Google Account or Fitbit Account by other Google services &#8212; such as Google Search, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and YouTube. But it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how much dark pattern design gets applied there.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Commission says it <em>may</em> decide to extend the duration of the decade-long Ads Commitment by <em>up to</em> an additional ten years &#8212; if such an extension can be justified.</p>
<p>It further notes that clearance is conditional upon full compliance with all the commitments &#8212; the implementation of which will be monitored by a trustee, who must be appointed before the transaction can close.</p>
<p>This yet-to-be-appointed-person will have what the Commission couches as &#8220;far-reaching competences&#8221; &#8212; including access to &#8220;Google&#8217;s records, personnel, facilities or technical information&#8221;.</p>
<p>So EU regulators are taking a &#8216;trust but verify&#8217; approach to letting this big tech merger steamroller on.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google gobbling Fitbit is a major privacy risk, warns EU data protection advisor&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/google-gobbling-fitbit-is-a-major-privacy-risk-warns-eu-data-protection-advisor/embed/#?secret=N5yLFtRvtZ" data-secret="N5yLFtRvtZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There are further competition focused commitments, too.</p>
<p>Here, Google has agreed to maintain access to Fitbit users&#8217; data via a web API without charging third party developers for the access (of course subject to user consent).</p>
<p>It has also agreed to a number of commitments related to rival wearable makers&#8217; access to Android APIs &#8212; saying it will continue free licensing for all core functionality competing devices need to plug into its dominant smartphone OS, Android.</p>
<p>Improvements in device functionality are covered under the agreement, per the Commission, so it&#8217;s intended to allow rival wearable makers to continue to be able to innovate without the risk of making a better/more capable device resulting in them being shut out of the Android ecosystem.</p>
<p>Google must also maintain API support in the Android Open Source Project version of its mobile platform.</p>
<p>Another concession the Commission has extracted from Google during this half year of investigation and negotiation is to say it won&#8217;t seek to circumvent the requirement to support rivals&#8217; kit accessing Android via the API by degrading the user experience (such as by displaying warnings or error messages).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s &#8212; frankly &#8212; a pretty dysfunctional signal for a regulatory clearance to have to send. And it highlights the level of mistrust that has built up about how Google&#8217;s business operates.</p>
<p>Which in turn raises the existential question for EU regulators of why they are allowing themselves to bend over and let Google-Fitbit go ahead. Unsurprisingly, then, the Commission&#8217;s PR sounds a tad defensive &#8212; with EU lawmakers writing that the decision &#8220;is without prejudice to the Commission&#8217;s efforts to ensure fair and contestable markets in the digital sector, notably through the recently proposed <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/proposal-regulation-single-market-digital-services-digital-services-act_en.pdf">Digital Markets Act</a>&#8221; (DMA).</p>
<p>It also notes that the monitoring trustee will be entitled to share reports that it provides to the Commission with Google&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor, the Irish Data Protection Commission. (Though given the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/">massive big tech-related case backlog on its desk</a> &#8212; including a number of investigations into other elements of Google&#8217;s business &#8212; that&#8217;s unlikely to cause Mountain View any extra sleepless nights.)</p>
<p>The Commission does also say that commitments secured from Google include &#8220;a fast track dispute resolution mechanism that can be invoked by third parties&#8221;. So it&#8217;s clearly trying to go the extra mile to justify greenlighting further consolidation in a consumer digital services space that Google already massively dominates &#8212; at a time when US lawmakers are headed in the opposite direction. So, um&#8230;</p>
<p>Civil society in Europe (and beyond) has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/europe-urged-to-block-google-fitbit-ahead-of-major-digital-policy-overhaul/">raising a massive clamour</a> about the Google-Fitbit acquisition ever since it was announced &#8212; urging the bloc&#8217;s regulators to stop the tech giant from gobbling Fitbit&#8217;s cache of health data, unless or until <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/no-google-fitbit-merger-without-human-rights-remedies-says-amnesty-to-eu/">human rights protections</a> can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Today the Commission has sidestepped those wider rights concerns.</p>
<p>At best it believes it&#8217;s kicked the can down the road a decade or, max, two. And by 2030 (or 2040) it will hope that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/"> rules it&#8217;s just proposed</a> to put strictures on digital gatekeepers like Google will be in a position to prevent future abuse in check.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s oft stated preference is to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/dont-break-up-big-tech-regulate-data-access-says-eu-antitrust-chief/">regulate tech giants, not to break up their empires</a> &#8212; or, as it turns out, stand in the way of further empire expansion.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Google-Fitbit clearance in a statement, Vestager said: “We can approve the proposed acquisition of Fitbit by Google because the commitments will ensure that the market for wearables and the nascent digital health space will remain open and competitive. The commitments will determine how Google can use the data collected for ad purposes, how interoperability between competing wearables and Android will be safeguarded and how users can continue to share health and fitness data, if they choose to.”</p>
<p>Taking questions from a European parliament committee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/europe-urged-to-block-google-fitbit-ahead-of-major-digital-policy-overhaul/">last week</a>, Vestager signalled the inexorable looming clearance of Gitbit &#8212; saying the US and Europe have a different approach to dealing with market-dominating tech giants. “In Europe we do not have a ban of monopolies,&#8221; she told MEPs. &#8220;They have a different legal basis in the U.S. We would say you’re more than welcome to be successful but with success comes responsibility — which is why we have article 102 [against abusing a dominant position].&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also why the Commission has felt the need to propose new regulation to strengthen competition enforcement in digital markets &#8212; though it&#8217;ll most likely be years before the DMA is adopted.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile EU regulators are letting Google expand its dominance of people&#8217;s private information by bagging up Fitbit&#8217;s treasure trove of sensitive health data &#8212; for full exploitation later.</p>
<p>In any case, as Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/europe-urged-to-block-google-fitbit-ahead-of-major-digital-policy-overhaul/">warned last week</a>, surveillance capitalism&#8217;s business ambitions now scale far beyond mere targeted ads. The goal is to use data &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">for the sake of predictions that become more lucrative as they approach certainty&#8221;, as she put it &#8212; warning society must intervene in the public interest to put a stop to the tech giants&#8217; &#8220;epistemic coup&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Accurate predictions generated off of health data could be very lucrative indeed for Google (which has been ramping up its focus on the health sector in recent years). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Whether that&#8217;s net good or bad for humanity remains to be seen &#8212; which isn&#8217;t the kind of major gamble regulators should be comfortable with. </span>So plenty will say the Commission is just fiddling round the margins while giving big tech a handy bypass for competition enforcement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While 2020 won&#8217;t be remembered fondly by many of us for much of anything, it was a blockbuster year for enterprise M&amp;A with the top 10 deals totaling an astounding $165.2 billion.</p>
<p>This is the third straight year I&#8217;ve done this compilation. Last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/01/these-ten-enterprise-ma-deals-totaled-over-40b-in-2019/">the number was $40 billion</a>. The year prior <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/these-ten-enterprise-ma-deals-totaled-over-87-billion-this-year/">it was $87 billion</a>. Those numbers pale in comparison to 2020’s result.</p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s biggest deal &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/salesforce-closes-15-7b-tableau-deal/">Salesforce buying Tableau</a> for $15.7 billion &#8212; would have only been good for fifth place on this year&#8217;s list. And last year&#8217;s fourth largest deal, where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/vmware-acquires-carbon-black-for-2-1b-and-pivotal-for-2-7-billion/">VMware bought Pivotal</a> for $2.7 billion, wouldn&#8217;t have even made this year&#8217;s list at all.</p>
<p>The 2020 number was lifted by four chip company deals totaling $106 billion alone. Consider that the largest of these deals at $40 billion matched last year&#8217;s entire list. But let&#8217;s not forget the software company acquisitions, which accounted for the remainder, three of which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/private-equity-firms-can-offer-enterprise-startups-a-viable-exit-option/">were via private equity</a> deals.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the $165.2 billion figure doesn&#8217;t include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/oracles-tiktok-and-zoom-deals-wont-move-cloud-market-share-needle-significantly/">the Oracle-TikTok debacle</a>, which remains for now<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/tiktok-timeline/"> in regulatory limbo</a> and may never emerge from it. Nor does it include two purely fintech deals &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/robinhood-profiles-morgan-stanley-etrade/">Morgan Stanley acquiring E-Trade</a> for $13 billion or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/intuit-credit-karma/">Intuit snagging Credit Karma</a> for $7.1 billion &#8212; but we did include the $5.3 billion Visa-Plaid deal because as it involved an enterprise-y API company we felt like it fit our criteria.</p>
<p>Keep in mind as you go through this year&#8217;s list that it appears to be an outlier year in terms of total deal flow. Most years have maybe one or two megadeals, which I would define as over $10 billion. There were six this year. And there were a host of unlisted deals worth between $1 billion and $3.2 billion, several of which would have made it to the list in quieter years.</p>
<p>Without further adieu, here is this year&#8217;s Top 10 deals in M&amp;A organized from smallest to largest:</p>
<h2>10. Vista snags Pluralsight for $3.5B</h2>
<p>This deal happened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/vista-acquires-it-education-platform-pluralsight-for-3-5b/">just this week</a> as we were writing the story, vaulting into 10th place past the $3.2 billion Twilio-Segment deal. Vista has been active as always and it has added Pluralsight, an online education platform for IT pros with plans to take it private again. At a time when more people are online, this deal seems like a wise move.</p>
<h2>9. KKR acquires Epicor for $4.7B</h2>
<p>This was one of those <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kkr-to-sell-epicor-software-in-47-billion-deal-4-years-after-buying-the-company-2020-08-31">under-the-radar private equity deals</a>, but one with a bushel of money changing hands. Epicor, hardly a household name, is a mature ERP company dating back to the early 1970s. The company has been on a rocky financial road for much of the 21st century. This could be one of those deals where KKR sees a way to squeeze life from maintenance contracts. Otherwise this one is hard to figure.</p>
<h2>8. Insight Partners nabs Veeam for $5B</h2>
<p>In yet another private equity deal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/09/insight-partners-acquires-data-management-company-veeam-for-5b/">Insight acquired Veeam</a>, a cloud data backup and recovery startup based in Switzerland for $5 billion. This one was one of the earliest deals of 2020 and set the tone for the year. The firm had previously invested $500 million into Veeam and apparently liked what it saw and bought the company. Unlike the Epicor deal, Insight probably plans to invest in the company with an end goal of going public or flipping it for a profit at some point.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been an eventful fall for <a href="https://www.getperigee.com/">Perigee</a> CEO and founder Mollie Breen. The former NSA employee participated in the TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield in September, and she just closed her first seed round on Thanksgiving, giving her a $1.5 million runway to begin building the company.</p>
<p>Outsiders Fund led the round with participation from Westport, Contour Venture Partners, BBG Ventures, Innospark Ventures and a couple of individual investors.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/perigee" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="perigee">Perigee <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wants to secure areas of the company like HVAC systems or elevators that may interact with the company&#8217;s network, but which often fall outside of the typical network security monitoring purview. Breen says the company&#8217;s value proposition is about bridging the gap between network security and operations security. She said this has been a security blind spot for companies, often caught between these two teams. Perigee provides a set of analytics that gives the security team visibility into this vulnerable area.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Breen explained when we spoke in September <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/perigee-infrastructure-security-solution-from-former-nsa-employee-moves-into-public-beta/">around her Battlefield turn</a>, the solution learns normal behavior from the operations systems as it interacts with the network, collecting data like what systems and individuals normally access it. It can then determine when something seems off and cut off an anomalous act, which may be indicative of hacker activity, before it reaches the network.</p>
<p>She says that as a female founder getting funding, she is acutely aware how rare that is, and part of the reason she wanted to publicize this funding round was to show other women who are thinking about starting a company that it&#8217;s possible, even if it remains difficult.</p>
<p>She plans to grow the company to about six people in the next 12 months, and Breen says that she thinks deeply about how to build a diverse organization. She says that starts with her investors, and includes considering diversity in terms of gender, race and age. She believes that it&#8217;s crucial to start with the earliest employees, and she actively recruits diverse candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;I write a lot of cold emails, particularly around hiring and that&#8217;s partly because with job listings it&#8217;s all inbound and you can&#8217;t necessarily guarantee that that is going to be diverse. And so by writing cold emails and really following up with those people and having those conversations, I have found a way of actually making sure that I&#8217;m talking to people from different perspectives,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As she looks ahead to 2021, she&#8217;s thinking about the best approach to office versus remote and she says it will probably be mostly remote with some in-person. &#8220;I&#8217;m really balancing at this point in time, how do we really make the connections, and make them strong and genuine with a lot of trust and do that with balancing some elements of remote, knowing that is where the industry is going and if you&#8217;re going to be a company and in a post-2020 world, you probably need to adopt to some element of remote working,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Royalties aside, songwriters are often unsung heroes of music making. Sure, some &#8212; like Carole King and Jimmy Webb &#8212; become well-known in their own right, but more often than not, names are relegated to the liner notes.</p>
<p>A new feature in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spotify">Spotify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> seeks to correct that &#8212; or at least offers listeners a way to take deeper dives into the catalogues of the people behind their favorite songs. Songwriter Hub is a new offering that aggregates information about some of the industry’s biggest and most prolific songwriters. Some are big names in their own right. Others not so much.</p>
<p>Accessible via the Browse tab, the Hub features songwriter playlists, podcasts and devoted songwriter pages. That last bit includes the likes of Gregg Wattenberg, Ant Clemons, Noonie Bao, Sia, Bebe Rexha, Irving Berlin, Ashley Gorley, Meghan Trainor, Fraser T Smith, Missy Elliott, Teddy Geiger, Ben Billions and Justin Tranter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Having a hub for songwriters is extremely important because people need to know who these people are who are helping create the soundtrack to our lives,” Ariana Grande/Cardi B/Meek Mill writer Nija says in a press release tied to the news. “Songwriters deserve to be praised for their contributions just as much as artists &amp; producers. A lot of times we get the short end of the stick, so I’m glad that there’s a place where people can see who’s writing their favorite songs.”</p>
<p>The feature arrives today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adobe is launching <a href="https://blog.adobespark.com/2020/12/17/introducing-thousands-of-design-assets-for-every-mood">an update</a> to its <a href="https://spark.adobe.com/">Spark social media design tool</a> today that will bring more than 10,000 new design assets to the service. This update, which follows the launch of animations in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/adobe-spark-adds-support-for-animations-to-its-social-media-graphics-tool/">Spark in September</a>, also brings a small UI change with it to accommodate this new feature, but for the most part, you can think of design assets as an extension to what a lot of users were already doing with icons in Spark.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088336" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088336" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2088336" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2088336" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;For our users, who are everyday entrepreneurs and marketers, they want to create professional-looking content &#8212; and they certainly don&#8217;t have design experience,&#8221; Adobe Spark product manager Justin Church told me. &#8220;The rollout of these tens of thousands of new design assets that we&#8217;re coming up with will really empower them to create standout social posts and things like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> stories that are more original and creative than they&#8217;ve ever been able to so far.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Church noted, a lot of users opt for working with Spark&#8217;s templates to get started, but there&#8217;s also a large set of users who start from scratch and they will especially benefit from the ability to quickly pull in frames, illustrations, brushes and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088299" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/adobe_spark_design_assets.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088299" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2088299" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/adobe_spark_design_assets.gif" alt="" width="800" height="800" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2088299" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>Adobe has a large in-house content design team that designed some of its own assets and curated others from outside resources. Those assets were all tagged, to make them discoverable, which now makes it easy to find them in Spark&#8217;s search feature. As of now, these results are not personalized yet &#8212; or set to match with what&#8217;s already in your current design &#8212; but the team is exploring how to use AI to help users find the right assets for their specific designs.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, given the broad range of users, Adobe opted for a very broad range of assets (and styles) with which to start. The plan is to expand this set of assets over time, of course, and the team will look closely at which categories are popular, but the company also plans to release new assets in time for specific holidays and around special events.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.hioscar.com/">Oscar,</a> the New York-based health insurance upstart at the vanguard of a wave of venture capital healthcare investment made in the wake of the Affordable Care Act, has raised another $140 million in financing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new capital means that Oscar has raised what would be the equivalent of $1 million a day for the entirety of 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company&#8217;s last funding round, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/oscars-health-insurance-platform-nabs-another-225-million/">a $225 million haul</a>, came just a few short months ago in June.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Oscar&#8217;s health insurance platform nabs another $225 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/oscars-health-insurance-platform-nabs-another-225-million/embed/#?secret=UsQrEzwEUV" data-secret="UsQrEzwEUV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">Given the list of investors in the round, which was led by Tiger Global Management and includes Dragoneer, Baillie Gifford, Coatue, Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, Lakestar and Reinvent; it&#8217;s likely going to be one of the last times the company taps private markets before an eventual public offering.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Since 2017, Oscar has seen annualized membership growth of more than 70%,” said Mario Schlosser, co-founder and chief executive of Oscar, in a statement. “As we continue to rapidly scale our business, this capital will help us deliver on our commitment to bring accessible and affordable care to even more Oscar members across the country.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Heading into the new year, the company said it will be available in 18 states and 286 counties across its Individual and Family Plans, Medicare Advantage and Small group products. As of September 30, 2020, Oscar had approximately 420,000 members across 15 states, the company said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oscar was one of the first insurers to offer virtual care services (launching the practice as early as 2014). Now nearly half of all Oscar member visits to a primary care practitioner are made with an Oscar-recommended doctor. Roughly 38% of the company&#8217;s subscribing members who have one or more medical visits use the company&#8217;s virtual care services, Oscar said.</p>

The actions at issue occured between 2015 and 2018, with the SEC alleging that the company &#8220;made misleading statements and omissions in customer communications&#8221; about how it generated &#8220;its largest revenue source&#8221; – specifically, payment for order flow.</p>
<p>The SEC also said that the well-funded unicorn &#8220;falsely claimed in a website FAQ between October 2018 and June 2019 that its execution quality matched or beat that of its competitors,&#8221; when it reality it was executing customer trades at &#8220;inferior trade prices that in aggregate deprived customers of $34.1 million even after taking into account the savings from not paying a commission.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/robinhood" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="robinhood">Robinhood <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> did not admit or deny the SEC charges, per the government body.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Robinhood&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer Dan Gallagher said via email that the $65 million settlement &#8220;relates to historical practices that do not reflect Robinhood today.&#8221; The company, in a somewhat rare on-the-record statement added that it has &#8220;significantly improved [its] best execution processes, and have established relationships with additional market makers to improve execution quality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robinhood listed five execution venues in its most recent payment for order flow <a href="https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf">filings</a>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has covered Robinhood&#8217;s payment for order flow incomes in recent quarters, as the company has scaled both its userbase and trading volumes, generating growing revenue from how its customer orders are executed.</p>
<p>In Q2 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/robinhoods-q2-revenue-appears-to-soar/">for example</a>, Robinhood&#8217;s revenues from payment for order flow sources doubled to around $180 million from a Q1 2020 result of around $90 million. Of course, those numbers come several years after the quarters noted in the settlement announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong><em> It&#8217;s worth noting that the SEC news comes less than a day after the Massachusetts Securities Division filed a complaint against Robinhood, alleging that it &#8220;engaged in acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations by aggressively marketing itself to Mass investors without regard for the best interests of its customers and failing to maintain the infrastructure and procedures necessary to meet the demands of its rapidly growing customer base.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>The state is seeking censure of Robinhood, improvement to its governance, along with monetary restitution and other financial penalties. The Massachusetts complaint can be read <a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/sct/current/sctrobinhood/MSD-Robinhood-Financial-LLC-Complaint-E-2020-0047.pdf">here</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Impacts</h2>
<p>Robinhood has had an explosive, if occasionally rocky year. The company has had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/robinhood-etrade-down-stocks-soar/">bouts of downtime</a> during key market moments, had to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/amidst-robinhoods-planned-service-changes-a-tension-between-growth-and-safety/">reform its options-trading service after the suicide of a user</a>, and has seen growth from its incomes from order flow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/">slow</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lC0wETHX1a"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/robinhoods-q2-revenue-appears-to-soar/">Robinhood&#8217;s Q2 soars</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Robinhood&#8217;s Q2 soars&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/robinhoods-q2-revenue-appears-to-soar/embed/#?secret=lC0wETHX1a" data-secret="lC0wETHX1a" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But despite those matters, the company&#8217;s 2020 trajectory has been little short of impressive. Its rapid revenue helped the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/how-robinhood-and-chime-raised-2b-in-the-last-year/">raise hundreds of millions of dollars this year</a> at expanding valuations, and made Robinhood a 2021 IPO candidate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine that today&#8217;s news will fuly derail Robinhood&#8217;s growth; if the charges had dealt with a historical period more close to the current day, perhaps the impact would be larger. Robinhood&#8217;s competitors &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/">Public.com raised $65 million the other day</a> &#8212; could capitalize on the news.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canoo, </span>the Los Angeles-based electric vehicle startup that will make its debut later this month on the Nasdaq as a publicly traded company, revealed Thursday an <span style="font-weight: 400;">all-electric multi-purpose delivery vehicle. </span></p>
<p>The electric delivery vehicle, which includes a high roof height, storage lockers and a software as a service platform to manage fleets, is targeted at<span style="font-weight: 400;"> both small businesses and large last-mile delivery companies such as package delivery fleets, retailers, major corporations and logistics companies.</span></p>
<p>This latest vehicle — its second to debut since 2019 — aims to showcase <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/canoo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="canoo">Canoo&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> flexibility and its intent to produce products for consumers and business-to-business applications. All of Canoo&#8217;s vehicles share that same underlying architecture; it&#8217;s the cabins, or top hats, that differ.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other variations of the multi-purpose delivery vehicle will follow, and Canoo plans to announce a service network at a later date.</span></p>

<p>Canoo started as Evelozcity in 2017, founded by former Faraday Future executives <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/stefan-krause" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="person" data-entity="stefan-krause">Stefan Krause </a> and Ulrich Kranz. The company rebranded as Canoo in spring 2019 and debuted its first vehicle several months later. It was this first vehicle, as well as Canoo&#8217;s plan to offer it only as a subscription, that captured the attention of investors, companies and the media.</p>
<p>The first vehicle, which looks more like a microbus than a traditional electric SUV, is the “skateboard” architecture that houses the batteries and the electric drivetrain in a chassis underneath the vehicle’s cabin. That architecture caught Hyundai’s interest earlier this year. The Korean automaker announced in February plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/hyundai-taps-ev-startup-canoo-to-develop-electric-vehicles/">jointly develop an electric vehicle platform</a> with Canoo, based on the startup’s proprietary skateboard design. The platform will be used for future Hyundai and Kia electric vehicles as well as the automaker group’s so-called “purpose-built vehicles.” The PBV, which Hyundai showcased at CES 2020, is a pod-like vehicle that the company says can be used for various functions in transit, such as a restaurant or clinic.</p>
<p>This new delivery vehicle <span style="font-weight: 400;">will be offered initially in two sizes. Canoo said more variants will follow and that major corporations — or presumably whatever company is willing to put up the money — will have the option to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-develop a custom vehicle with Canoo to meet their specific requirements.</span></p>
<p>The electric delivery vehicle will start at about $33,000. Future customers will have to wait though. Canoo said <span style="font-weight: 400;">availability will begin in 2022, with scaled production and launch planned for 2023. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers can pre-order the multi-purpose delivery vehicle for a refundable deposit of $100 per vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following its U.S. commercial debut, Canoo said it plans to launch the multi-purpose delivery vehicle in other markets such as Canada, Mexico and Europe.</span></p>
<p>The delivery vehicle was designed <span style="font-weight: 400;">with the ergonomics of the driver in mind and with attention to detail to help them be happier and more productive at work, according to Canoo Executive Chairman Tony Aquila, who added that the vehicle is affordable and offers greater cargo capacity than the current electric delivery offerings in its class. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We aim to lower the total cost of ownership and increase return on investment for everyone from local small business owners to large fleets,&#8221; Aquila said in a statement. </span></p>
<p>Indeed, Canoo is promising returns to companies that order one of its delivery vehicles, claiming that customers can<span style="font-weight: 400;"> achieve between $50,000 to $80,000 improvement on return on capital over six to seven years, depending on the use case, as compared to other top selling delivery vehicles.</span></p>
<p>Canoo also pushes the flexibility of its delivery vehicle, noting that it can be built with different workstations, will be offered in several different battery pack sizes that range between <span style="font-weight: 400;">40 and 80 kilowatt-hours, </span>and have <span style="font-weight: 400;">a bi-directional onboard charger, which can be used to power equipment and tools. </span></p>
<p>Canoo also touted the tech in the vehicle, notably an advanced driver assistance system, over-the-air software updates and a <span style="font-weight: 400;">software-as-a-service platform to help fleets manage assets, route plan, run diagnostics and support drivers. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Stripe recently made headlines with its entrance into the banking world with Stripe Treasury. The news follows Google’s banking and payments announcement along with IPO bound companies such as Airbnb, DoorDash and Affirm all mentioning “financial services” in S-1 filings &#8212; a clear signal of how the sector will continue to stay red hot for the coming years.</p>
<p>What do all of these companies have in common? The subtle, almost unnoticeable, embedding of financial services. There has been an influx of new <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aax-b20d">fintechs <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> democratizing how to embed financial services across the spectrum, from investing, insurance, lending to banking. While many of these companies are in their nascent stages, they are achieving increasingly high valuations. Why?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The ability to be at the right place at the right time, supporting consumers and merchants alike, where they want, how they want it and when they want it — cannot be understated.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Because today, customers yearn for greater personalization and less friction while brands are looking for ways to improve monetization seamlessly. The ability to be at the right place at the right time, supporting consumers and merchants alike, where they want, how they want it and when they want it — cannot be understated.</p>
<p>At the heart of embedded finance is the benefit of enabling any brand or merchant to rapidly, and at low cost, integrate innovative financial services into new propositions and customer experiences. To avoid developing noncore product additions in-house, companies will look to “building blocks” (or <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/api-755a" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="api-755a">APIs) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to take advantage of the big opportunity to extend customer lifetime value and address a wider variety of needs in one place.</p>
<p>This holds true for startups, digitally native brands and established brands, online and offline. For fledgling fintech startups or brands that want to provide financial services to their customers, working with APIs are often a no-brainer given the costs associated with building integrations in-house.</p>
<p>But imagine if you are a global airline company and the benefit of not having to staff a know-your-customer compliance or fraud detection team. Or for lenders who can minimize risk and increase speed by not having to request a pay stub or personal information verification?</p>
<p>The end goal is to earn and build customer loyalty while generating new revenue streams. Historically, established brands have been served by banks with co-branded and &#8220;affinity&#8221; programs or partnerships. But this &#8220;offline&#8221; model is usually white-label or very &#8220;human-in-the-loop&#8221; with limited and inflexible capabilities. However, APIs can change this — a great example is Starbucks Rewards, heralded as a successful case of data, rewards and loyalty. No longer are brands just reselling leads, businesses can now directly participate in the product and distribution to improve margins.</p>
<p>Today, embedded finance is being used in a variety of ways: In the product (e.g., Tesla’s insurance offering), in distribution channels (e.g., a startup selling insurance during car purchases), and in the technology layer (or building blocks) to improve the overall functionality (e.g., a lender leveraging a data API for instant underwriting).</p>
<p>We typically separate building blocks into two buckets: providers (&#8220;plug and play&#8221; applications) and enablers (those that help financial services to be offered).</p>

<p>There are many new entrants and it’s not one size fits all. Some have data advantages, some distribution while some enable new greenfield opportunities via delivery of the customer experience. While these &#8220;digital wrappers&#8221; around financial services infrastructure seem to be working, the question remains &#8212; who will become a market leader? Do enablers eventually become providers?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup called <a href="https://www.gawq.com/">Gawq</a> wants to tackle the problem of fake news and the &#8220;echo chamber&#8221; problem created by social media, where our view of the world is shaped by manipulative algorithms and personalized feeds. Through Gawq&#8217;s newly launched mobile news app, it aims to present news from a range of sources, while allowing users to filter between news, opinion, paid content, and more, as well as compare sources, check facts, and even review the publication&#8217;s content for accuracy.</p>
<p>The idea for Gawq comes from Joshua Dziabiak, co-founder and now board member at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/the-zebra-reaches-100m-run-rate-turns-profitable-as-insurtech-booms/">now profitable insurance tech startup The Zebra</a>. Dziabiak stepped down from his day-to-day role this March, and founded Gawq shortly after.</p>
<p>&#8220;It started as a passion project and then it transformed into a business,&#8221; Dziabiak explains. &#8220;I wanted to do something that had a larger social impact. And this idea &#8212; this problem &#8212; has surfaced and been magnified in really big ways over the past year, especially,&#8221; he says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When news is served up through social media channels, people are presented with their own version of reality, as the algorithms begin to filter out the news that doesn&#8217;t engage them and show them more of what does. Over time, this system led some publishers to pursue clicks and outrage with over-the-top, sensational headlines, but it also spawned a network of publications that would slant and bias the news in ways that better connected them with an either right- or left-leaning audience.</p>
<p>As a result, the media environment overall began to center itself around eyeballs and not necessarily news quality, Dziabiak says. While there is still quality journalism being created, it can sometimes be hard to find among all the noise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe journalists and content creators need a new measure for success. One that is based on the core ethics of journalism, and not the number of clicks or shares,&#8221; Dziabiak notes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088148" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088148" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2088148" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Headlines.png?w=336" alt="" width="336" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Headlines.png 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Headlines.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Headlines.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Headlines.png?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Headlines.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088148" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gawq</p></div></p>
<p>The Gawq name is meant to be a reminder of how today&#8217;s headlines often scream for our attention. But it misses the mark for an app about news accuracy. At its core, Gawq is a news aggregator where you are not meant to &#8220;gawk&#8221; at headlines, but actually read and consider the news with a more critical eye.</p>
<p>At launch, the app organizes over 150 different top media sources of all types and sizes, including those that lean one way or the other. The publishers cover topics like U.S. and world news, politics, sports, business, tech, entertainment, science, lifestyle news, and more.</p>
<p>Gawq also organizes the day&#8217;s news without using any sort of algorithms or personalization engines, but instead by topic. As you read, you click to compare coverage of the story with other sources to get a better idea of how different outlets are writing about the same topic. With a clever red and blue slider bar at the top of the screen, you can drag your finger over to the red side to see the coverage from right-leaning sources, or you can drag it to the blue side to see the more left-leaning coverage.</p>
<p>The company says it uses data from three different nonprofits who audit media &#8212; <a href="https://allsides.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://allsides.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608230325669000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrDhcWMqJ3xWYIXv3q-60ykFgs9g">AllSides</a>, <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608230325669000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHler-diWLauaCEqdyKX8yODQQR6Q">Media Bias Fact Check</a>, and <a href="https://adfontesmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://adfontesmedia.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608230325669000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqKv2YDOhK6IBKiGWtmLBv9w3QkA">Ad Fontes Media</a> &#8212;  to determine if sources are &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;left.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088147" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088147" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2088147" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Compare-Coverage.png?w=336" alt="" width="336" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Compare-Coverage.png 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Compare-Coverage.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Compare-Coverage.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Compare-Coverage.png?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Compare-Coverage.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088147" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gawq</p></div></p>
<p>Just below the slider bar are the related fact checks to the topic at hand, for easy reference.</p>
<p>While Gawq will allow users to toggle some news sources on or off within the app&#8217;s settings, it uses language that deters you from doing so by reminding you that it works best when you maintain a &#8220;diverse set of media.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, Gawq introduces a &#8220;smart labels&#8221; feature to automatically identify and tag non-news &#8212; like op-ed&#8217;s, sponsored content, or even celeb gossip, if you hate that sort of thing. You can toggle these on or off, too, if you want to hide anything that&#8217;s not hard news.</p>
<p>Another nice feature &#8212; for the news consumer at least, if not the publisher &#8212; is that Gawq loads articles by default into a &#8220;reader mode&#8221; that strips the ads and distractions that tend to fill the pages on news websites these days. You can still click to view the article on the website, if you prefer.</p>
<p>While much of the above is related to how the news is presented to the reader, Gawq&#8217;s bigger bet is that it can create a Wikipedia-like community of news reviewers who will rate stories for adherence to journalistic practices. This is a more ambitious and perhaps overly optimistic endeavour.</p>
<p>On every article, users can click a review button that walks them through a short quiz where they&#8217;re asked to rate the story&#8217;s balance, the details provided, and whether the headline was clickbait.

<p>Likely, only a minority of Gawq users would rate the stories. But over time and with scale, the reviews could help give outlets an accurate rating on news accuracy and their tendencies towards sensationalism, in the eyes of news consumers. That data may have external value, but for now, Gawq&#8217;s business model is &#8220;TBD,&#8221; Dziabiak admits.</p>
<p>The problem Gawq aims to tackle is a difficult one. And arguably, those who need to widen their worldview will be least likely to download a new app to do so. They&#8217;re often passive news consumers who have sat back ingesting news (and often, outrage and lies) from ever-personalized social media feeds. They then click on one favorite news TV channel for everything else. But there is a growing number of people who want a more neutral media landscape, and Gawq can help them find it with how it positions news as right, left or centered when comparing sources.</p>
<p>The startup is currently self-funded and has a small team of engineers, mostly working on a contract basis. Gawq has not ruled out future investment, however.</p>
<p>The app is a <a href="https://www.gawq.com/download">free download</a> on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gawq-unbreaking-news/id1514212857">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gawq">Android</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart and TikTok announced this morning they will be partnering on the first pilot test of a new shoppable product experience on TikTok&#8217;s social video app. Walmart, as you may recall, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/tiktok-deal/">had planned to invest in TikTok</a> when the app was being threatened with a ban from the U.S. market unless it sold its U.S. operations to an American company, per a Trump administration executive order &#8212;  a ban that&#8217;s now<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/second-federal-judge-rules-against-trump-administrations-tiktok-ban/"> on pause after multiple legal challenges</a>. Walmart&#8217;s interest in TikTok, however, has not waned. The retailer, though seemingly an odd fit for a social network, had seen the potential to attract a younger online consumer through video and, in particular, livestreamed video.</p>
<p>This is what the new test on TikTok will involve, as well.</p>
<p>During a Walmart livestream, TikTok users will be able to shop from Walmart&#8217;s fashion items without having to leave the TikTok app, in a pilot of TikTok&#8217;s new &#8220;shoppable product.&#8221; The fashion items themselves will be featured in content from ten TikTok creators, led by host <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@justmaiko">Michael Le, </a>whose TikTok dances have earned him 43+ million fans. Other creators will be more up-and-coming stars, like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@devanondeck">Devan Anderson</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tayhage">Taylor Hage</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@muslimthicc">Zahra Hashimee</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All will be participating in a special event hosted on TikTok called the &#8220;Holiday Shop-Along Spectacular,&#8221; which will take place on Friday, Dec. 18 at 8 PM ET on Walmart&#8217;s TikTok profile.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088386" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088386" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2088386" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088386" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>During this special, the creators will show off their favorite Walmart fashion finds in their own unique ways. For some, that will mean giving fans a peek inside their closet. Others may do a living room runway or even a fashionable &#8220;dance off,&#8221; Walmart says.</p>
<p>There are two ways TikTok users can shop for the fashion items featured.</p>
<p>As products are shown on screen, pins will pop-up which users can tap to add the item to their cart. They&#8217;re then directed to a mobile checkout experience. Alternately, customers can choose to tap on a shopping cart pin at the end of the event to look through all the items featured and select what they’d like to purchase.</p>
<p>And for anyone who misses the event, they&#8217;ll still be able to shop the items from Walmart&#8217;s TikTok profile when the Shop-Along event is over.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re constantly looking for ways to innovate the shopping experience for our customers,&#8221; said Walmart&#8217;s U.S. Chief Marketing Officer, William White, in an announcement. &#8220;We’re moving faster than ever to find new and improved ways to better serve our customers and meet them where they are. We created this event for, about, and by our community, reflecting the lives, passions and styles of a diverse set of creators so everyone watching will feel represented, no matter who they are or how they outfit their closet,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Walmart said the idea to partner on mobile shopping didn&#8217;t emerge as a result of the recent deal talks, as it&#8217;s been an active brand on the platform for over a year. (In fact, it&#8217;s even tasked its employees with making TikTok videos, <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/a-true-influencer-program-inside-walmarts-growing-army-of-employee-tiktokers/">a recent report from ModernRetail detailed</a>.)</p>
<p>The retailer also told TechCrunch there&#8217;s not a revenue share with TikTok on the sales it makes through the app, nor any fees, as this is considered a joint test.</p>

<p>This is not TikTok&#8217;s first foray into shoppable video.</p>
<p>The company has been exploring this space for some time, including with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/tiktoks-new-hashtag-challenge-plus-lets-video-viewers-shop-for-products-in-the-app/">last year&#8217;s launch of the Hashtag Challenge Plus</a> which added a shoppable component to a hashtag, directing video viewers to shop a site from within TikTok. This year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/levis-partnered-with-tiktok-on-social-commerce-and-doubled-its-product-views/">brands like Levi&#8217;s leveraged</a> TikTok&#8217;s &#8220;Shop Now&#8221; buttons that allowed consumers to make purchases through links posted on TikTok. And in a significant deal just this fall, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">TikTok formally partnered with Shopify on social commerce</a> by allowing Shopify merchants to create, run and optimize their TikTok marketing campaigns directly from the Shopify dashboard.</p>
<p>Livestreamed shopping is also a fast-growing and lucrative market, as younger users are turning to influencers and online video to both be entertained and to shop.</p>
<p>All the major tech companies have invested in this space as well, to varying degrees, including not only Facebook (in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/">an aggressive push</a> across <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/facebook-shop-instagram-live-shopping/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/">Instagram</a>), but also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/googles-latest-rd-project-is-shoploop-a-mobile-video-shopping-platform/">Google through its R&amp;D arm</a>, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/08/amazon-live-is-the-retailers-latest-effort-to-take-on-qvc-with-live-streamed-video/">through its QVC-like Amazon Live</a>, Alibaba <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/alibaba-aliexpress-influencer-recruitment/">through AliExpress</a>, JD.com, Pinduoduo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/wechat-livestreaming-china-economy/">WeChat</a>, and even TikTok’s Chinese sister app, Douyin.</p>
<p>The trend is also fueling startups, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/bambuser-live-video-shopping/">Bambuser</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/popshop-live-gets-3-million-to-bring-live-streaming-to-shopping/">Popshop Live</a>, which have raised new rounds in 2020 for their own livestreamed shopping products.</p>
<p>For TikTok, however, is more of a natural evolution of its product where influencers are already showing off their favorite items, their fashion and style.</p>
<p>&#8220;At TikTok, we&#8217;re constantly exploring new ways to inspire creativity, bring joy and add value for our community,&#8221; said Blake Chandlee, Vice President, Global Business Solutions at TikTok. &#8220;Creators and brands have found a creative outlet to connect with audiences through TikTok Live, and we&#8217;re excited to further innovate on this interactive experience to enable our community to discover and engage with the brands they love,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brands have had an incredible impact on the community throughout this year, and we&#8217;re thrilled to see Walmart embrace the creativity of TikTok and this first-of-a-kind experience to meaningfully engage with their community,&#8221; Chandlee said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The idea sounds almost too simple. Create a version of Linkedin that&#8217;s specifically for the healthcare industry, where professionals can find out not just who has what credentials, but also learn about the research those professionals are conducting and the specialties they have.</p>
<p>In the middle of a global pandemic, when industry insiders are all trying to find out who is an expert in particular fields of medicine that are most impacted by a novel virus spreading like wildfire around the world, that simple idea becomes a necessity.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the situation that <a href="https://h1insights.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup which just raised $58 million in new financing, found themselves in as the pandemic hit American shores earlier this year.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/h1-insights-is-giving-the-healthcare-industry-the-ultimate-professional-database/"> only graduated from Y Combinator in January</a>, and now, less than a year later is closing on over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/y-combinator-graduate-h1-closes-on-12-9-million-for-its-professional-healthcare-database/">$70 million in total financing</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9JVZaNFsGK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/h1-insights-is-giving-the-healthcare-industry-the-ultimate-professional-database/">H1 Insights is giving the healthcare industry the ultimate professional database</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;H1 Insights is giving the healthcare industry the ultimate professional database&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/h1-insights-is-giving-the-healthcare-industry-the-ultimate-professional-database/embed/#?secret=9JVZaNFsGK" data-secret="9JVZaNFsGK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Doubling down on its previous investment in the company is <a href="https://www.menlovc.com/">Menlo Ventures</a>, which along with the growth stage investment firm, <a href="https://www.ivp.com/">IVP</a>, co-led the new financing for the company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their rationale for investing can be attributed to H1&#8217;s explosive growth. The company now has 250 employees after launching from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> just 12 months ago. Already a player in the US, H1 is looking to expand to Europe and Asia in 2021 and counts 13 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies as its clients. As of its last tally, the company already had profiles on over 9 million healthcare professionals worldwide.</p>
<p>According to one person with knowledge of the company&#8217;s fundraising history, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/menlo-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="menlo-ventures">Menlo Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was so pleased with the company&#8217;s performance that it offered tens of millions of dollars in pre-emptive financing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have created a platform for the healthcare ecosystem to connect in the same way Linkedin connected professional workers in the early 2000’s. There hasn’t been a global platform like H1 before that has connected industry to the right doctors the way H1 does,” said H1 co-founder and CEO Ariel Katz. “This next round of funding, with our excellent investment group, including Menlo who has been a great partner for us, will help us continue to become the largest healthcare professional platform and ultimately create a healthier future.”</span></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/menlo-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="menlo-ventures">Menlo Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> certainly thinks so.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we started working with H1, we could already see early evidence of product-market fit, including both early &#8216;beachhead&#8217; pharma deals and good logo velocity in smaller biotechs. Feedback from customers was stellar, both in terms of product value and commitment to customer success by the H1 team,&#8221; wrote Menlo Ventures partner Greg Yap and JP Sanday in a blog post. &#8220;One of our diligence intros even turned into a multi-million dollar customer and investor. But H1 was clearly still at an early stage of maturity for supporting large demanding enterprise customers. Now, at the Series B, H1 has ramped up execution, winning 13 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies as customers and meeting top-tier venture metrics in gross retention, net retention, and sales efficiency.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>But now, Cloudflare Pages is live for real. It integrates seamlessly with a Git repository and existing JAMstack frameworks. When you push a new version of your site to your Git repository, Cloudflare automatically starts building and deploying your site on its network.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with JAMstack, it’s a popular way of developing and deploying websites at scale. It lets you take advantage of global edge networks with a focus on performance.</p>
<p>A JAMstack framework lets you decouple the frontend from the backend of your website. Every time you change something to your site, the entire frontend is prebuilt. Your pages are transformed into optimized static pages that can be hosted and cached on a global edge network. This way, pages are served in a few milliseconds across the world.</p>
<p>JAMstack websites don’t have to be 100% static. You can use APIs from popular API-based services, such as Stripe. Payment modules are loaded directly from Stripe’s server when the page is rendered in your web browser. You can also build your own microservices that are loaded on demand and that can scale easily.</p>
<p>Coming back to Cloudflare Pages, it integrates with GitHub and GitLab repositories if you’re hosting your source code on those platforms. Once you your site is configured, you can preview each commit from Cloudflare’s interface — each commit gets its own unique URL and there’s a preview environment.</p>
<p>You can collaborate with other Cloudflare users by inviting them to your Pages project. When your site looks good in the preview branch, you can push it to the production branch.</p>
<p>Cloudflare started working on Pages when people who don’t consider themselves as devops wanted to use Cloudflare. “People on the creative side told us, ‘hey are you interested in building a website builder?’” Prince said. He identified Wix and Squarespace as website builders.</p>
<p>At the same time, Cloudflare noticed that JAMstack was getting quite popular. “A lot of Netlify and Vercel customers actually put Cloudflare in front of their Netlify or Vercel sites,” he added. That doesn’t really make sense when it comes to cost and performance as you’re stacking multiple CDNs.</p>
<p>As Cloudflare already has a huge network of servers around the world, it doesn’t cost them that much money to host JAMstack websites on its edge network — it&#8217;s cheaper than caching content hosted by Netlify. That’s why there’s a generous free tier with unlimited bandwidth and unlimited requests.</p>
<p>“We timed the release intentionally to be this time of the year. We really wanted to give a gift back to the developer community,” Prince said.</p>
<p>The company expects to get a lot of attention with today’s release. It’s going to add a thousand people to the service per day up until January. After that, it’ll open the service to everyone.</p>
<p>Cloudflare thinks you’ll choose Pages for JAMstack projects because of the free tier and its robust infrastructure. But the company also expects users to try out other Cloudflare services down the road.</p>
<p>For instance, if you want to go beyond static websites, Cloudflare offers a serverless platform called <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Workers</a>. You can deploy some code on Workers and use it in your Pages site. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, you can go beyond stateless functions as well.</p>
<p>Similarly, as you start using Pages, you might be interesting Cloudflare’s advanced security features and other Cloudflare products. The company has always been betting on the long tail of developers to find its next customers, and Pages is another example of that strategy.</p>
