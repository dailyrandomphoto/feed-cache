										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Motional will integrate its driverless technology into Hyundai&#8217;s new all-electric SUV to create the company&#8217;s first robotaxi. At the start of 2023, customers in certain markets will be able to book the fully electric, fully autonomous taxi through the Lyft app.</p>
<p>The Hyundai IONIQ 5, which was revealed in February with a consumer release date expected later this year, will be fully integrated with Motional&#8217;s driverless system. The vehicles will be equipped with the hardware and software needed for Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, including LiDAR, radar and cameras to provide the vehicle&#8217;s sensing system with 360 degrees of vision, and the ability to see up to 300 meters away. This level of driverless technology means a human will not be required to take over driving.</p>
<p>The interior living space will be similar to the consumer model, but additionally equipped with features needed for robotaxi operation, according to a Motional spokesperson. Motional did not reveal whether or not the vehicle would still have a steering wheel, and images of the robotaxi aren&#8217;t yet available.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Motional&#8217;s IONIQ 5 robotaxis have already begun testing on public roads and closed courses, and they&#8217;ll be put through more months of testing and real-world experience before being deployed on Lyft&#8217;s platform. The company says it&#8217;ll complete testing only once it&#8217;s confident that the taxis are safer than a human driver.</p>
<p>Motional, the Aptiv-Hyundai $4 billion joint venture aimed at commercializing driverless cars, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/">announced its partnership with Lyft in December</a>, signaling the ride-hailing company&#8217;s primary involvement in Motional&#8217;s plans. The company recently announced that it began testing its driverless tech on public roads in Las Vegas. Hyundai&#8217;s IONIQ 5 is Motional&#8217;s second platform to go driverless on public roads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We now know the names of all four individuals who will fly on the historic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/spacex-is-aiming-to-fly-the-first-all-civilian-human-space-mission-by-the-end-of-2021/">Inspiration4 mission, the first all-civilian spaceflight in history</a>. In addition to previously revealed crew members Jared Isaacman (who&#8217;s footing the entire bill) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/second-crew-member-of-first-all-civilian-spacex-mission-revealed/">St. Jude Children&#8217;s Hospital employee Haley Arceneaux</a>, Inspiration4 <a href="https://www.inspiration4.com/news-release/Final-Crew-Members-Named">will include</a> Dr. Sian Proctor and Christopher Sembroski as the final two civilian astronauts. The mission will use a SpaceX Dragon capsule and is set to fly no earlier than September 15, with a total duration of three days.</p>
<p>Dr. Proctor takes the state reserved for the online business competition portion of the crew selection process, which saw entrants taken from submissions based on people who had created businesses on Isaacman&#8217;s Shift4Shop e-commerce platform. Sembroski won his seat by contributing to the ongoing St. Jude fundraising drive Isaacman is hosting as part of the mission&#8217;s promotional campaign.</p>

<p>Both Proctor and Sembroski have specific sets of skills relative to spaceflight that seem likely to have factored Ito their selection for the crew. Proctor is a trained pilot, for instance, and Sembroski is a veteran aerospace employee, most recently at Lockheed Martin, and also a literal veteran, having served in the U.S. Air Force.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131804" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inspiration4-Crew-Head-Shot-Chris-Sembroski-Image-provided-by-SpaceX.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131804" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2131804" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inspiration4-Crew-Head-Shot-Chris-Sembroski-Image-provided-by-SpaceX.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inspiration4-Crew-Head-Shot-Chris-Sembroski-Image-provided-by-SpaceX.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inspiration4-Crew-Head-Shot-Chris-Sembroski-Image-provided-by-SpaceX.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inspiration4-Crew-Head-Shot-Chris-Sembroski-Image-provided-by-SpaceX.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inspiration4-Crew-Head-Shot-Chris-Sembroski-Image-provided-by-SpaceX.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inspiration4-Crew-Head-Shot-Chris-Sembroski-Image-provided-by-SpaceX.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inspiration4-Crew-Head-Shot-Chris-Sembroski-Image-provided-by-SpaceX.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inspiration4-Crew-Head-Shot-Chris-Sembroski-Image-provided-by-SpaceX.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inspiration4-Crew-Head-Shot-Chris-Sembroski-Image-provided-by-SpaceX.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131804" class="wp-caption-text">Inspiration4 crew member Christopher Sembroski</p></div></p>
<p>As part of this final crew reveal, Inspiration4 also shared how many entries it received in each category. Somewhat surprisingly, the Shift4Shop e-commerce platform competition only drew a total of &#8220;approximately&#8221; 200 entries — and use of &#8216;approximately&#8217; suggests fewer — while the <a href="https://www.stjude.org/get-involved/other-ways/inspiration4.html#fundraise">charity drive drew 72,000 entries,</a> and has raised around $113 million to date. That&#8217;s still short of the campaign&#8217;s $200 million goal, and includes Isaacman&#8217;s personal commitment of $100 million, but the drive continues and there are additional awards to be one, even if the top prize of the trip to space is gone.</p>
<p>This whole mission campaign has honestly been one of the most bizarre stories in spaceflight in recent memory, beginning with the big announcement, which included a press conference with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk joining Isaacman to discuss the flight, and seemingly not being aware of any relevant details about mission specifics. Isaacman also dedicated $100 million of his own money to the charity drive for St. Jude, as mentioned, but clearly donations from the community aren&#8217;t living up to expectations with around 13% of the total target raised from those to date.</p>
<p>That &#8220;approximately 200&#8221; entries in the Shift4Payments build-a-business competition might be the most perplexing, since the award was a free trip to space. In retrospect, this seems like it was the path to space with the most likelihood of working out, even if you had to convince <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/mark-benioff-and-this-panel-of-judges-will-decide-who-gets-one-seat-on-the-first-all-civilian-spaceflight/">an oddly stunt cast panel of judges to select </a><span style="color: #00a562;"><span style="caret-color: #00a562;">yours</span></span> as the winner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LinkedIn, the social network now with 740 million users around the world, has carved out an identity for itself as the place online where professionals go to list their places of work, get headhunted for other work, and look for work. But for years it&#8217;s been looking for ways to better leverage that position to move into a plethora of adjacent areas, such as training and education, professional development, networking with others, and news. Today, the company unveiled a series of new features that it will be rolling out over the coming months to play into that strategy, and also, it hopes, increase engagement on the platform:</p>
<p>&#8212; The company is bringing more video into people&#8217;s profiles, with the launch of a &#8220;video Cover Story&#8221;, short videos that people can make talking about themselves to live on their home pages. And for people to feel more connected with how they are depicted on LinkedIn, it is also adding a pronoun feature.</p>
<p>&#8212; Alongside these, the company is officially launching a new &#8220;Creator&#8221; mode, a more refined but also more democratic version of the company&#8217;s Influencer network (anyone can be a Creator if they so choose, for a start). It&#8217;s also carving out more of a solid place for freelancers on the platform, by way of a new Service page attached to your profile.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8212; LinkedIn&#8217;s educational and training efforts are also getting some boost. The program was originally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/microsoft-to-distribute-20m-in-grants-to-non-profits-offers-free-skills-training-via-linkedin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched in June 2020</a> in the wake of the economic shift that Covid-19 brought on the world with Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, to offer free online training in 10 different professional areas. Now that program is getting extended to the end of this year. The move comes as the companies passed <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/30/building-a-more-inclusive-skills-based-economy-the-next-steps-for-our-global-skills-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 million people in 249 countries using the training service</a>. LinkedIn and Microsoft now hope that the number of companies hiring via the program will reach 250,000.</p>
<p>In another team-up with Microsoft, LinkedIn is also announcing a new Teams-based app called Career Coach aimed at students that use Teams. Using AI tools from LinkedIn, the Career Coach helps its users identify what they are interested in and might like to pursue as a profession, and it uses links through to LinkedIn and Microsoft&#8217;s learning content that could help with that journey.</p>
<p>Taken together, this seemingly disparate set of announcements all lean into an interesting development for LinkedIn. Social media &#8212; whether you are a person posting content, or simply looking at posts from others that you feel speak to your situation in life &#8212; has a strong undercurrent of individual empowerment throughout it. Through these different features and products, LinkedIn is trying in its own way to bring some of that individual identity, voice, and self-advancement, through to its own platform.</p>
<p>Below are some more detailed thoughts about the various new areas.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2131797" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cover-Story-Playback.gif?w=163" alt="" width="163" height="300" />The video-based Cover Story plays on the idea of how people create short videos about themselves that they might post as a status on a more consumer-focused social media platform. If the list of places where you work and have worked or studied tell one kind of story about who you are, the idea is that the video selfie can tell another to fill in more gaps.</p>
<p>As LinkedIn&#8217;s chief product officer Tomer Cohen describes it, you can use the space to give yourself a more human angle, describing something about your interests or aspirations that might not come across in your resume. These also auto play when people come to visit your profile, which Cohen aptly refers to as a &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; effect, in reference to the animated <em>Daily Prophet</em> newspaper in the wizarding world. For now these will only appear in your profile, but in time the animals may also expand to search results.</p>
<p>It all sounds interesting enough, except that it relies quite a lot on people using the format successfully rather than creating something that might actually deter recruiters. Ironically, if the trend is to remove some of what might profile and pigeonhole people too much when job-hunting, adding in these videos could serve to bring some of that kind of judgement back into play. It will depend on how they are adopted and used and viewed, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>LinkedIn&#8217;s focus on video comes as part of the company&#8217;s bigger engagement with the medium over the last several years, adding services like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/linkedin-debuts-linkedin-live-a-new-live-video-broadcast-service/">Live broadcasts</a> into the timeline for example. It&#8217;s no surprise, considering how sticky video has been in the bigger realm of social media across services like TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>That seems to also be playing out at LinkedIn and areas that align more closely with the company&#8217;s business: it said in a survey it conducted, some 61% of job seekers said that recorded video could be the next iteration of the traditional cover letter, and that among hiring managers, nearly <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">80% say video figures strongly in their candidate vetting. So it&#8217;s not a matter of testing the waters, but perhaps just making sure you have the tools to stay afloat.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Video is playing a bigger role beyond just that of helping everyone with profiles. For the most proactive, LinkedIn is launching a Creator mode, where people who already make LinkedIn Live videos and other content can shift over their profiles to becoming Creators instead of ordinary LinkedIn citizens. This is something you choose yourself, unlike the Influencer tag that LinkedIn confers on a smaller subset of thought leaders, and it means you can be &#8220;followed&#8221; on LinkedIn for people to watch and stay up to date with what you post.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s hard to think of who might come to LinkedIn for entertainment in the same way that they might come to Instagram to follow a creator, the idea is that creating content for LinkedIn becomes the end in itself for both the person watching and the person being watched.</p>
<p>It looks like the natural progression of the original content that LinkedIn has been building up through its editorial operation led by Dan Roth &#8212; indeed the company announced the first steps for its Creator product <a href="https://www.axios.com/linkedin-launch-creator-program-cf3b1897-157e-4c8d-9fff-1f1566087c98.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last month</a>, led by Roth. But unlike creators on platforms like Instagram or YouTube or TikTok, for now it doesn&#8217;t look like there are direct routes to monetization when you are a LinkedIn Creator. That might change, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indirectly we’ve been connecting people to opportunities since we first enabled people to share content on LinkedIn.  Our members get leads and grow their business and following on LinkedIn,&#8221; said Keren Baruch, group product manager for <span class="il">LinkedIn</span>’s creator strategy.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Weather intelligence platform <a href="https://www.climacell.co/">ClimaCell</a> today announced that it has raised a $77 million Series D funding round led by private equity firm <a href="https://www.stonecourtlp.com/">Stonecourt Capital</a>, with participation by Highline Capital. This brings the company&#8217;s total funding to about $185 million. In addition to the new funding, ClimaCell announced that it has changed its name to Tomorrow.io, with &#8220;The Tomorrow Companies Inc.&#8221; as its new legal name.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement comes only a month after the company announced that it would launch a fleet of small radar-equipped weather satellites to improve its weather monitoring and forecasting capabilities. That&#8217;s also, at least in part, where the name change comes from.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131492" style="width: 767px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/climacell.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131492" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2131492" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/climacell.png" alt="" width="757" height="436" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/climacell.png 757w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/climacell.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/climacell.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/climacell.png?resize=680,392 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/climacell.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 757px) 100vw, 757px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131492" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ClimaCell/Tomorrow.ai</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Originally, ClimaCell/Tomorrow.io <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/18/climacell-bets-on-iot-for-better-weather-forecasts/">built out a novel technology</a> to collect weather data using wireless network infrastructure and IoT devices. That&#8217;s where the &#8220;cell&#8221; in ClimaCell came from. But as the company&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Shimon Elkabetz told me, while the company isn&#8217;t abandoning this approach, its focus today is much broader.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mission is really to help countries, businesses, organizations, to better manage their weather-related challenges,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the ambition was always to be that largest weather enterprise in the world, the most disruptive, the most industry-defining. And I think this is the perfect timing for us to come up with a new name, not only because of the funding but because we were able to explain to ourselves that really, we&#8217;re helping others take control of tomorrow, today.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s something Stonecourt partner Rock Davis agrees with. &#8220;While the company&#8217;s growth has been tremendous since launch, there is a larger opportunity at play here,” he said. &#8220;What Tomorrow.io is building, corroborated by their recent announcement of launching radar-equipped satellites into space, is only further proof that this company represents the future of weather forecasting for the entire planet. The privatization of the weather industry is now, and that type of vision is what compels the team here at Stonecourt Capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Elkabetz noted, Tomorrow.io isn&#8217;t a typical investment for a private investment firm like Stonecourt. Last year, the firm <a href="https://www.stonecourtlp.com/news/2020/10/6/stonecourt-capital-acquires-365-data-centers">acquired 365 Data Centers</a>, but it is also backing the Denver-based freight rail company Alpenglow Rail, for example.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ka2tk8QZk9I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>And while many of Tomorrow.io&#8217;s customers saw their business decline during the pandemic (the company counts Uber and Delta among its users, for example), Elkabetz tells me that its team focused on diversifying its customer base and managed to sign up a number of large logistics companies, including major railways in the U.S. and Mexico, but also smaller companies in the drone, autonomous driving and electric vehicle space. In total, the company says, it saw a 200% net revenue retention rate and its annual contract value grew 850% during the past two years.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to launch more satellites, but also to improve its overall product and accelerate its go-to-market activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re an interesting company because we&#8217;re a SaaS company that is now going to space,&#8221; Elkabetz said. &#8220;A lot of the Earth observations companies are now scratching their heads and saying, &#8216;Oh, we can&#8217;t just sell observations, it&#8217;s not monetizable or becoming a commodity. We now need to become a software company and build the platform and do the analytics.&#8217; Good luck.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Commercial human spaceflight company Virgin Galactic has unveiled the first ever Spaceship III, the third major iteration of its spacecraft design. The first in this new series is called &#8216;VSS (Virgin SpaceShip) Imagine,&#8217; and will start ground testing now with the aim of beginning its first glide flights starting this summer. VSS Imagine has a snazzy new external look, including a mirrored wraparound finish that&#8217;s designed to reflect the spacecraft&#8217;s changing environment as it makes its way from the ground to space — but more importantly, it moves Virgin Galactic closer to achieving the engineering goals it requires to produce a fleet of spacecraft at scale.</p>
<p>I spoke to Virgin Galactic CEO Michael Colglazier about VSS Imagine, and what it represents for the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can build these at a faster pace,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;These are still relatively slow, versus what we want in our next class of spaceships. But what we do expect to have here is, we&#8217;ve taken all the learnings from [VSS] Unity, and built-in what we need to do so that we can turn these ships at a faster pace, because obviously, the number of flights we can do is the product of how many ships you have, and how quickly you can turn them.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike Unity, which is the spacecraft that Virgin Galactic first flew in September 2016, and that it &#8216;s still using in New Mexico now for its testing and commercial launch preparation program, Imagine has a &#8220;modular design&#8221; that makes it much easier to maintain, and increases the rate at which it can fly subsequent missions. As Colglazier mentioned, there&#8217;s still more work to be done in that regard to get the Spaceship design to the point where it&#8217;s able to support the company&#8217;s target of around 400 flights per year, per individual spaceport, but it&#8217;s a big upgrade, and the company is already beginning manufacturing work on a second Spaceship III-class vehicle, &#8216;VSS Inspire.&#8217;</p>

<p>Imagine and Inspire are technical achievements, to be sure, but Colglazier, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/virgin-galactic-brings-on-disney-parks-leader-michael-colglazier-as-new-ceo/">came to Virgin Galactic from Disney Parks International in July 2020</a>, also emphasized the importance of this spacecraft debut in terms of the company&#8217;s consumer brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you&#8217;re seeing in the images, the choice of the livery, the film that we&#8217;ve put out, is a very clear step, as a consumer brand launch, and as we&#8217;re stepping in and building that, that will build over the course of the summer as we build up towards Richard [Branson]&#8217;s flight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Very purposefully, we&#8217;ve used these lofty words of &#8216;democratizing space&#8217; — but space <em>is</em> meant for everyone. It may take a while, just for everyone to get there, but it&#8217;s coming. And so this was leading with a very consumer facing, &#8216;Why are we doing this?'&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKiLv95mIVo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>In fact, that focus on the consumer side of the business has been a lot of Colglazier&#8217;s work over the past eight months since joining the company. He said that the Virgin Galactic he joined had a &#8220;world-class team&#8221; that had the aerospace pieces completely locked in, but that his particular contribution has been in building up the commercial side of the business to match.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re now bringing some talent in that is used to scaling this kind of a business, so Swami Iyer actually started Monday of last week,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And when you see a guy like Joe Rohde, who came in on the experience side, there&#8217;s no replacement — that&#8217;s additive to building out now the shoulders around this experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iyer joined as President of Aerospace Systems, and brings years of experience in the commercial space and defense industry, across GKN Advanced Defernce Systems, Honeywell Aerospace and more. Rohde, on the other hand, boasts a very different background, as a longtime Disney Imagineer, who joins the company as its first &#8216;Experience Architect,&#8217; focused squarely on defining what the Virgin Galactic experience is for its astronaut customers, their friends and family, and the broader public, too.</p>
<p>Colglazier said that their vision for what the experience will look like will also be different depending on what part of the world you&#8217;re flying from, noting that weather you fly from a spaceport in Europe, Asia, India or Australia should result in something &#8220;dramatically different,&#8221; even if the spacecraft themselves are all used in the same way as they are in New Mexico. That definitely seems like a logical approach from an executive whose prior experience includes leading Disney&#8217;s parks in Burbank, Paris, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131769" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131769" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2131769" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131769" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Virgin Galactic</p></div></p>
<p>In the end, Colglazier said that the core philosophy Virgin Galactic will pursue in terms of consumer brand will be one focused on inclusion, even if the actual &#8216;going to space&#8217; part of its offering remains out of reach for most in the short term.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is for everyone, it has to be for everyone,&#8221; he said. That aspiration may take some number of years to actually be realized, but in the meantime, we have to find a way that our brand and our company can be accessed, that what we do can be accessed by all sorts of people at all different layers of engagement, so we&#8217;re going to be very purposeful about that. You&#8217;re going to hear us talking mostly about, effectively the apex experience — actually taking the new ships to space. But the ability to tier down out of that is really, really important, and the ability for us to be a brand that&#8217;s reaching out to everyone is incredibly important.&#8221;</p>
<p>That begins with the approach to this spacecraft debut today, Colglazier says, and is apparent in the tone of the video the company debuted (embedded above) to mark the reveal. And Virgin Galactic also still has 600 passengers booked and waiting for their own flights, so that&#8217;s obviously a key focus after Branson&#8217;s flight targeted for later this year.</p>
<p>Finally, I asked Colglazier when he himself intends to go up, since he said he definitely plans to when joining the company. Mostly, he said, he doesn&#8217;t want to cut in front of any paying customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, there are 600 or so people that are going to be a little ticked at me, if I jumped the line, so I&#8217;m going to keep focused at the consumer level,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But nobody else is in line yet, so I&#8217;m gonna get in before anybody else comes in line.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more companies become ever more reliant on digital infrastructure for everyday work, the more they become major targets for malicious hackers &#8212; both trends accelerated by the pandemic &#8212; and that is leading to an ever-greater need for IT and security departments to find ways of protecting data should it become compromised. Today, one of the companies that has emerged as a strong player in data backup and recovery is announcing its first major round of funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hycu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HYCU</a>, which provides multi-cloud backup and recovery services for mid-market and enterprise customers, has raised $87.5 million, a Series A that it the Boston-based startup will be using to invest in building out its platform further, to bring its services into more markets, and to hire 100 more people.</p>
<p>HYCU&#8217;s premise and ambition, CEO and founder Simon Taylor said in an interview, is to provide backup and storage services that are as simple to use &#8220;as backing up in iCloud for consumers.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;If you look at primary storage, it&#8217;s become very SaaS-ifed, with no professional services required,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;But backup has stayed very legacy. It&#8217;s still mostly focused on one specific environment and can&#8217;t perform well when multi-cloud is being used.&#8221;</p>
<p>And HYCU&#8217;s name fits with that ethos. It is pronounced &#8220;haiku&#8221;, which Taylor told me refers not just to that Japanese poetic form that looks simple but hides a lot of meaning, but also &#8220;hybrid cloud uptime.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is probably known best for its integration with Nutanix, but has over time expanded to serve enterprises building and operating IT and apps over VMware, Google Cloud, Azure and AWS. The company also has built a tool to help migrate data for enterprises, HYCU Protégé, which will also be expanded.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Bain Capital Ventures, with participation also from Acrew Capital (which was also in the news last week as an investor in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/pie-insurance-raises-118m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$118 million round for Pie Insurance</a>). The valuation is not being disclosed.</p>
<p>This is the first major outside funding that the company has announced since being founded in 2018, but in that time it has grown into a sizeable competitor against others like Rubrik, Veeam, Veritas and CommVault. The Rubrik comparison is interesting, given that it is also backed by Bain (which led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/data-management-startup-rubrik-gets-261m-at-a-3-1b-valuation-as-it-moves-into-security-and-compliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$261 million round</a> in Rubrik in 2019). HYCU now has more than 2,000 customers in 75 countries. Taylor says that not taking funding while growing into what it has become meant that it was &#8220;listening and closer to the needs of our customers,&#8221; rather than spending more time paying attention to what investors says.</p>
<p>Now that it&#8217;s reached a certain scale, though, things appear to be shifting and there will probably be more money down the line. &#8220;This is just round one for us,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>
<p>He added that this funding came in the wake of a lot of inbound interest that included not just the usual range of VCs and private equity firms that are getting more involved in VC, but also, it turns out, SPACs, which as they grow in number, seem to be exploring what kinds and stages of companies they tap with their quick finance-and-go-public model.</p>
<p>And although HYCU hadn&#8217;t been proactively pitching investors for funding, it would have been on their radars. In fact, Bain is a major backer of Nutanix, putting some<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nutanix-announces-ceo-dheeraj-pandey-to-retire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $750 million into the company last August</a>. There is some strategic sense in supporting businesses that figure strongly in the infrastructure of your other portfolio companies.</p>
<p>There is another important reason for HYCU raising capital to expand beyond what its balance sheet could provide to fuel growth: HYCU&#8217;s would-be competition is itself going through a moment of investment and expansion. For example, Veeam, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/09/insight-partners-acquires-data-management-company-veeam-for-5b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Insight last January for $5 billion</a>, then proceeded to <a href="https://www.veeam.com/news/veeam-acquires-kasten-to-accelerate-protection-of-kubernetes-native-workloads-on-premises-and-across-multi-cloud-environments.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquire Kasten</a> to move into serving enterprises that used Kubernetes-native workloads across on-premises and cloud environments. And <a href="https://www.rubrik.com/en/blog/company/20/12/rubrik-expands-unstructured-data-management-capabilities-with-igneous" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rubrik last year acquired Igneous</a> to bring management of unstructured data into its purview. And it&#8217;s not a given that just because this is a sector seeing a lot of demand, that it&#8217;s all smooth sailing. Igneous was on the rocks at the time of its deal, and Rubrik itself had a data leak in 2019, highlighting that even those who are expert in protecting data can run up against problems.</p>
<p>Taylor notes that ransomware indeed remains a very persistent problem for its customers &#8212; reflecting what others in the security world have observed &#8212; and its approach for now is to remain focused on how it delivers services in an agent-less environment. &#8220;We integrate into the platform,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is incredibly important. It means that you can be up and running immediately, with no need for professional services to do the integrating, and we also make it a lot harder for criminals because of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Longer term, it will keep its focus on backup and recovery with no immediate plans to move into adjacent areas though such as more security services or other tools. &#8220;We&#8217;re not trying to be a Veritas and own the entire business end-to-end,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;The goal is to make sure the IT department has visibility and the cloud journey is protected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Enrique Salem, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures and the former CEO of Symantec, is joining HYCU’s board with this round and sees the opportunity in the market for a product like HYCU&#8217;s.</p>
<p>“We are in the early days of a multi-decade shift to the public cloud, but existing on-premises backup vendors are poorly equipped to enable this transition, creating tremendous opportunity for a new category of cloud-native backup providers,” he said in a statement. “As one of the early players in multi-cloud backup as a service bringing true SaaS to both on-premises and cloud-native environments, HYCU is a clear leader in a space that will continue to create large multi-billion dollar companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stefan Cohen, a principal at Bain Capital Ventures, will also be joining the board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eben Bayer has spent the better part of fourteen years proving out the power of the humble mushroom as the world&#8217;s truly functional food. </span></p>
<p>As the chief executive and founder of <a href="https://ecovativedesign.com/">Ecovative Design</a>, Bayer has made replacements for foam packaging, lamps and furniture, leather materials, and even meats like bacon from mighty mushroom mycelia (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUxael8qV78">they even grew a tiny. home</a>).</p>
<p>Now the company has $60 million in financing to create new applications for its mycelial products and scale up existing business units.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The core of Ecovative Design&#8217;s business is in packaging. That&#8217;s where the company has been developing its tech the longest and where its replacements for styrofoam packaging have had the most commercial traction.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s far more to Ecovative&#8217;s mushrooms than that and the company&#8217;s new investors including <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Viking Global Investors, with support from Senator Investment Group, AiiM Partners, Trousdale Ventures and other undisclosed backers want to see just how far the company can go. </span></p>
<p>Part of the money will be used to build out a discovery platform for new materials and new strains in an effort to make Ecovative, the Gingko Bioworks of the mushroom business. While another chunk of change will be used to build out a larger production facility for its mushroom production.</p>
<p>The Gingko analogy may not be that much of a stretch. Using its platform for manufacturing and deep knowledge of fungi, Ecovative has already spun up a food company called <a href="https://www.atlastfood.co/">Atlast</a>, which raised $7 million to begin building a fake meat empire on the back of a mushroom-made bacon substitute.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131774" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131774" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2131774" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chamber.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chamber.jpg 4272w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chamber.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chamber.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chamber.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chamber.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chamber.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chamber.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chamber.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2131774" class="wp-caption-text">A person in a lab coat stands with their back to several trays of Ecovative&#8217;s mushroom material growing in trays. Image Credit: Ecovative Design</p></div></p>
<p>And the company also has fashion on the brain. A licensing agreement between Ecovative and <a href="https://boltthreads.com/">Bolt Threads</a> helped power that massively funded startup&#8217;s push into manufacturing a leather replacement from mushrooms back in 2018.</p>
<p>The deal between the two ended in acrimony and litigation &#8212; and now Ecovative is going it alone, looking to be a provider of bulk leather replacements for anything from shoes to belts, to buckskin jackets.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;It seems like there’s a need for somebody who could not be a branded supplier, but to be someone who can provide scalable mushroom leather,&#8221; said Bayer. </span></p>
<p>Other companies are working on trying to convince consumers to make the switch to mushrooms or other plant-based leather substitutes. Those are businesses like <a href="https://www.mycoworks.com/">Mycoworks</a>, which raised $45 million from a slew of celebrities last year to build out its own commercial scale mycelial manufacturing business. Or <a href="https://www.naturalfiberwelding.com/">Natural Fiber Welding</a>, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/allbirds-is-investing-in-plant-based-leather-substitute-as-it-looks-to-further-green-its-supply-chain/">backed by none other than the omnipresent eco-conscious fashion accessory adorning the feet of almost every venture investor</a> &#8212; Allbirds (or are Atoms the new thing? I can&#8217;t keep up.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The demand for new biomaterials in the fashion industry, such as mycelium, far outstrips the current supply.  Ecovative is tackling this challenge head-on, committing to building a next generation platform capable of producing mycelium at scale,” said Katrin Ley, Managing Director of Fashion For Good, in a statement. </span></p>

<p>While Ecovative makes small batches of products under brands like Atlast, Bayer wants his company to be more of a white-label material provider than a branded business making shoes, packaging, and plant-based meat replacements.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new financing comes on the heels of Ecovative’s partnership with UK packaging licensee Magical Mushroom Company, which recently announced the opening of four more facilities to supply the UK and EU markets with green packaging solutions, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mycelium is a unique material that outperforms other sustainable alternatives in industries as diverse as fashion and food,” said Evan Lodes, Partner at Senator Investment Group, which first backed Ecovative back in 2019. “Ecovative pioneered the field of mycelium materials, and has invested in the research and development necessary to deliver it at the scale and cost necessary to make a significant impact.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Byju’s is eying acquisition of a startup that could help the biggest e-learning Indian firm deepen its footprint in the U.S.</p>
<p>The Indian startup is in talks to acquire online reading platform <a href="https://www.getepic.com">Epic</a>, a startup that offers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/30/epic-raises-8-million-to-keep-kids-reading-in-a-digital-age/">unlimited access to over 40,000 books, videos, and quizzes</a> from more than 250 publishers to kids aged 12 or younger, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The deal values Epic at &#8220;significantly&#8221; over $300 million dollars, according to one person, who like the other requested anonymity as the matter is private. The terms of the deal may change and/or the acquisition may not materialize, people warned.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An Epic spokesperson declined to comment Monday evening, and Byju’s did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Epic, backed by Evolution Media, reaches <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goodnight-ninja-knuffle-blobfish-childrens-books-get-the-algorithm-treatment-11616606893">over 50 million kids</a> in the U.S., a figure that has ballooned from <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200316005813/en/Epic-Announces-Free-Support-for-Educators-Students-and-Families-Impacted-by-COVID-19-School-Closures">20 million last year</a>.</p>
<p>The California-based startup, which has raised over <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/epic/company_financials">$51 million to date</a>, claimed in a press release last year that over 1 million teachers across more than 90% of U.S. elementary schools use Epic.</p>
<p>On Epic, founded by Suren Markosian and Kevin Donahue, children read over <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2021/01/25/reading-platform-epic-had-an-epic-year/?sh=6ddb07a31daf">a billion books last year</a>.</p>
<p>Epic collects and analyzes real-time anonymized and aggregated data on how many children read a book, how deeply they engage with it, and where their interests start to fall off. In a Netflix-like move, the firm now plans to release several print versions of its own original titles at Walmart, Target, and Sam’s Club later this year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131700" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131700" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2131700 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="611" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg?resize=300,153 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg?resize=768,391 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg?resize=680,346 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2131700" class="wp-caption-text">Some original titles released by Epic</p></div></p>
<p>If the deal goes through, the startup’s offerings would align with Byju’s current playbook in the U.S. In 2019, the Indian startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/byjus-buys-osmo-for-120m/">acquired U.S.-based Osmo</a>, which offers “blended learning” apps to integrate offline activities for kids aged between five to 12.</p>
<p>Byju’s is separately in the middle of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-in-talks-to-raise-over-600-million-at-15-billion-valuation/">concluding a new funding round</a> whose size is expected to balloon over $600 million, TechCrunch reported last week. The new round is expected to value Byju&#8217;s at $15 billion.</p>
<p>The new financing round, a major tranche of which has already concluded (about <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/03/exclusive-byjus-raises-450-mn-led-by-mc-global-edtech-investment/">$460 million at a $13 billion valuation, per a filing</a>), will be used to finance the new acquisition, the source said.</p>
<p>The Indian giant, which prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, has witnessed skyrocketing growth amid the pandemic after New Delhi issued a months-long lockdown and closed schools.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s second most valuable startup, which serves over 80 million users, has additionally been aggressively exploring ways to grow inorganically.</p>
<p>Byju&#8217;s, which acquired coding platform aimed at kids <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">WhiteHat Jr for $300 million last year</a>, is conducting due diligence to acquire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/byjus-is-reportedly-buying-indian-brick-and-mortar-institute-aakash-for-1-billion/">decades-old Indian brick-and-mortar institute Aakash</a> and <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/02/exclusive-byjus-set-to-acquire-toppr-in-a-150-mn-deal/">Toppr</a>, another online learning startup in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. These two deals are being financed with the over $1 billion funds Byju&#8217;s raised last year, one person familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>WhiteHat Jr, which sparked controversy last year when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/22/whitehat-jrs-founder-files-2-6m-defamation-suit-against-critic/">sued two critics</a>, currently generates nearly half of its revenue from the U.S.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[MessageBird, the omnichannel cloud communications platform recently valued at $3 billion, is continuing to ramp up its M&#38;A activity. Following last year&#8217;s acquisition of Pusher, a company that provides real-time web technologies, it is announcing that it has acquired &#8220;video-first&#8221; customer engagement platform 24sessions, and customer data platform Hull. Terms of the two new deals [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.messagebird.com/">MessageBird</a>, the omnichannel cloud communications platform recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/messagebird-series-c/">valued at $3 billion</a>, is continuing to ramp up its M&amp;A activity. Following last year&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/push-it-realtime-good/">acquisition of Pusher</a>, a company that provides real-time web technologies, it is announcing that it has acquired &#8220;video-first&#8221; customer engagement platform 24sessions, and customer data platform Hull.</p>
<p>Terms of the two new deals aren&#8217;t being disclosed, although MessageBird founder and CEO Robert Vis tells me the three acquisitions add up to about $100 million in total, and we alreadly know that Pusher&#8217;s acquisition price was $35 million. I also understand that the 24sessions and Hull acquisitions saw both companies&#8217; investors exit entirely.</p>
<p>Originally seen as a European or “rest of the world” competitor to U.S.-based Twilio — offering a cloud communications platform that supports voice, video and text capabilities all wrapped up in an API — MessageBird has since repositioned itself as an “Omnichannel Platform-as-a-Service” (OPaaS). The idea is to easily enable enterprises and medium and smaller-sized companies to communicate with customers on any channel of their choosing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MessageBird acquires real-time notifications and in-app messaging platform Pusher for $35M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/push-it-realtime-good/embed/#?secret=UZx0igMvUg" data-secret="UZx0igMvUg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Out of the box, this includes support for WhatsApp, Messenger, WeChat, Twitter, Line, Telegram, SMS, email and voice. Customers can start online and then move their support request or query over to a more convenient channel, such as their favourite mobile messaging app, which, of course, can go with them. It’s all part of MessageBird Vis’ big bet that the future of customer interactions is omni-channel.</p>
<p>To that end, the acquisition of 24sessions adds another channel: video. This, Vis tells me, is a particularly important channel where in-person interactions are being replicated digitally. However, he says it&#8217;s not just enough to have a video option &#8212; you need one that is compliant and secure. This is especially true for regulated industries such as financial services and healthcare. In addition, 24sessions is web-based, meaning that end-users aren&#8217;t required to install an app.</p>
<p>“Bringing a safe, secure and customizable video platform into the MessageBird family is the next step in our strategic journey,&#8221; said Vis in a statement. “Our portfolio of owned services already includes SMS, voice, email, OTT, social, live chat and push. The addition of 24sessions’ video platform gives us one of the world’s most comprehensive and powerful omnichannel offerings, and is consistent with our having end-to-end control of the stack in order to create magical experiences for our customers&#8221;.</p>
<p>“By joining forces with MessageBird, we’re making a leap forward in our mission to improve personal customer contact and turn it into a smooth digital experience, without losing the human touch,” adds Rutger Teunissen, CEO of 24sessions. “Video has become a more embedded, instant, intelligent, and integrated part of the omnichannel customer experience&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, communicating with customers more efficiently doesn&#8217;t just mean interacting with them on the channels of their choosing and building backend workflows to support this, it also requires a better understanding of the customer and the context of their query. That&#8217;s where the acquisition of Hull, based in France and the U.S., comes into play.</p>
<p>Described as a customer data platform (CDP), Hull&#8217;s team and technology will be deployed to create an &#8220;in-depth analytics layer&#8221; between MessageBird&#8217;s omnichannel offering and the workflow solutions it provides to customers.</p>
<p>“We want to empower clients to have easy, frictionless conversations with customers, so it’s crucial that we understand where those customers are and how they like to communicate,” said Vis. “To do that, it’s crucial that our platform is able to collect, unify and enrich product, marketing, and sales data and synchronize it across the workflow.”</p>
<p>In total, 45 staff will join from 24sessions, and 14 will join from Hull. The combined M&amp;A brings MessageBird’s total headcount to almost 500 people across its nine hubs globally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">User guides, knowledge articles and community discussions form a detailed, yet very fragmented, landscape of information about a company and its products. Today, a company that&#8217;s built a platform both to organize that data, and help those who need it to tap into it more effectively, is announcing a round of funding that underscores the demand it&#8217;s seeing in the market for its technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zoominsoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoomin</a>, an Israeli startup that uses machine learning, natural language processing and some big data magic to help companies build self-service experiences that bring together information and answers pulled from all of the content that&#8217;s being generated by customers and the company itself across various channels, has picked up $52 million in a Series C led by General Atlantic, with previous backers Bessemer Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures and Viola Growth also participating. The company is not disclosing the valuation.</p>
<p>Zoomin will be using the money to continue building out the functionality of its product and to double down on new customer segments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Originally targeting tech companies and the needs of business end users &#8212; early customers included Dell and McAfee, among others &#8212; it&#8217;s found some interesting growth into other sectors like the food industry, where customers include Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes, because, as CEO and co-founder Gal Oron describes it, &#8220;your typical fast food company has a lot of franchises, and they use a lot of operating manuals. Just like ServiceNow or McAfee.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also moving into other sectors like finance and healthcare, he added, and expanding to more than just technical support, which in the B2B world is closely connected to sales support, and sales. That could see Zoomin building products that lay out the information in different ways too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technical content is the new marketing,&#8221; Oron said. &#8220;Companies invest millions in creating marketing material, but they have hundreds of thousands of pages of HTML with all the relevant details, and their customers are interested in technical stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoomin taps into &#8220;content&#8221; &#8212; the source of its answers &#8212; in real time wherever it is being made, and those are also typically the places where Zoomin-generated answers are being delivered, too. Documentation sites, customer service portals, support communities, product applications and anywhere that people are searching for help and chatting are also the typical sources of information that get fed into the Zoomin machine.</p>
<p>The financing underscores how much attention investors (and customers) are giving to business support software these days.</p>
<p>The pandemic led to a major shift in how many of us worked and interacted with services &#8212; many more people started to work remotely and carried out all of their everyday duties online. In terms of needing assistance when something isn&#8217;t going right, all of that has also shifted online, and has put an immense amount of pressure on the infrastructure that had been built to help with that.</p>
<p>Even at the best of times, customer support is in a tough place. It&#8217;s where users go when something isn&#8217;t working correctly or when they have another complaint, so even out of the starting gate, it can be a fraught interaction. And agents don&#8217;t have it much better at the other end, either. On top of the customers and their demands, they&#8217;re also typically working under time, cost, revenue and organizational constraints from the company itself, the classic scylla and charybdis scenario. Given all of that, and the particular circumstances of the last year, tools like Zoomin&#8217;s have come into the foreground for companies as one way to cope with all of that.</p>
<p>This round comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/zoomin-raises-21m-for-a-platform-to-make-fragmented-product-content-troves-easier-to-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just three months</a> after the startup came out of stealth with $21 million disclosed in funding since quietly opening for business in 2019. Oron said that the company has served 60.4 million answers to date to its customers (55 million in 2020): that volume grew 300% last year and its customer base doubled in the same period.</p>
<p>The company is banking on some bigger trends in the industry to see that growth continue. It notes that digital support channels &#8212; those site pages you visit that include either chatbots or intuitive search, dialogue boxes across the site, apps, and other places that don&#8217;t have live agents helping you &#8212; have grown in ubiquity, with some 60% of businesses projected to build self-service portals in the next 12 to 18 months. The proof is in the pudding, so to speak: Zoomin says that the product content that it helps surface can account for up to 70% of a company&#8217;s overall web traffic.</p>
<p>That brings up an interesting parallel between what Zoomin does and one of the major traffic controllers of modern times: the search engine. Google dominates how many of us use and discover things on the internet, and it&#8217;s been getting increasingly specific with the help that it provides to people, giving &#8220;answers&#8221; directly on search result pages &#8212; whether they are answers to questions, shopping suggestions, news, locations, videos, or any other number of end points.</p>
<p>Oron is quick to say that he has no interest in ever expanding what Zoomin does to make it a consumer-facing tool like Google&#8217;s, but it does highlight what a big and tricky problem information organization &#8212; or &#8220;knowledge orchestration&#8221;, as Zoomin refers to it &#8212; can be in our disjointed digital world, and the power of a company that can help bring order to that.</p>
<p>While Zoomin may not be interested in climbing the mountain that is competing with Google on its terms, it would be interesting to see how Google evolves its own work in site search, and whether that becomes a competitor on Zoomin&#8217;s terms. Zoomin&#8217;s terms are to get people to search on company sites themselves, not Google, for answers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first place &#8212; a company&#8217;s site &#8212; is the right location,&#8221; Oron said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all of the &#8220;what ifs&#8221; show is that there is indeed a lot of potential here, one reason you&#8217;re seeing companies like Salesforce investing alongside the big financial backers.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be supporting Zoomin in this important step of their growth story through an investment that marks our third-ever partnership in the burgeoning Israeli tech market. At General Atlantic, we pride ourselves on identifying category builders and growth-oriented disruptors, and view Zoomin as a natural fit given those priorities,” said Alex Crisses, MD, Global Head of New Investment Sourcing and Co-Head of Emerging Growth at General Atlantic, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Having helped build the increasingly important field of knowledge orchestration from the ground up, Zoomin is providing much-needed value to large enterprises,” added Gary Reiner, a current General Atlantic Operating Partner and previous GE Chief Information Officer. “We look forward to partnering with and supporting Zoomin as they continue to innovate the way that customers experience crucial enterprise product content.”</p>

<p>Xiaomi will inject an initial 10 billion yuan ($1.52 billion) into the venture with the total investment amount to reach $10 billion over the next ten years. Xiaomi founder and CEO Lei Jun will serve as the CEO of the new EV venture.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear from the filing whether Xiaomi will sell cars under its own household brand and contract manufacturers to take care of production, as it has done for most of its hardware devices. The company has long billed itself as an &#8220;internet firm&#8221; with a light-asset business model. The goal is to generate a chunk of its profits by selling services powering a myriad of price-friendly hardware products it sells.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A representative from Xiaomi said the company has no further detail to provide beyond the filing.</p>
<p>Xiaomi is the latest Chinese tech company to enter the red-hot EV industry. Chinese search engine giant Baidu recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/baidu-electric-car-making/">announced</a> in January that it would be making EVs with the help of automaker Geely. In November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/alibaba-saic-ev-brand/">Alibaba and Chinese state-owned carmaker SAIC Motor</a> said they had joined hands to produce electric cars. Ride-share leader Didi and EV maker BYD are also co-designing a model for ride-hailing.</p>
<p>The internet behemoths are competing with a raft of more specialized EV startups such as Xpeng, Nio and Li Auto, which have already debuted multiple models and are often compared to Tesla. They strive to differentiate from each other by investing in functions from in-car entertainment to autonomous driving.</p>
<p>For Xiaomi, the obvious advantage in making cars is its vast retail network and international brand recognition. Some of its smart devices, such as smart speakers and air purifiers, could be easily incorporated into its vehicles as selling points. The real challenge, of course, is in manufacturing. Compared to phone making, the automotive industry is more capital-intensive with a long and complex supply chain. We will see if Xiaomi will pull it off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the world&#8217;s largest gaming market, China, console games play a relatively small part as their revenue has been meager compared to mobile and PC games for years &#8212; at least by the official numbers (more on this later). There remains a community of hardcore console lovers, but they are finding it harder to get hold of devices and cartridges recently.</p>
<p>A handful of grey market videogame console vendors on Taobao stopped selling and shipping this week, according to checks by TechCrunch and <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/451888962">online posts by gamers</a>. Before we examine what might be happening here, a bit of industry history is needed.</p>
<p>In 2000, China banned the sale and import of videogame consoles as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-01-30-china-console-ban.html">concerns over addiction in teenagers grew</a>. Even with the ban, imported consoles still existed in <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-buy-games-in-china-1238551167">the grey market</a> targeting a group of loyal players. Meanwhile, the online PC and mobile gaming industry flourished, in part thanks to their affordability and the social experience built into their mechanics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When China finally lifted its restriction on consoles<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-end-ban-on-videogame-consoles-1437813695"> in 2015</a>, giants like <a href="https://nikopartners.com/sony-playstation-china-console-game-market/">Sony and Microsoft</a> quickly responded by releasing Chinese editions of their products through local partners. Nintendo Switch hit the Chinese shelves in 2019 via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/nintendo-switch-china-tencent/">much-anticipated partnership with Tencent</a>, which itself is the world&#8217;s largest gaming firm. But the grey market largely persisted because mainland Chinese versions of the consoles are subject to strict regulatory oversight, which limits users&#8217; choice to a <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/03/20/business/sonys-ps4-hits-china-but-with-few-games/">small friendly range</a> approved by censors.</p>
<p>Many Chinese players thus resort to brick-and-mortar electronics bazaars and online marketplaces to find imported editions of PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, along with their games. These products normally enter China through parallel trading, the import of legitimate goods through unauthorized channels. The games that are brought in normally lack a Chinese gaming license, which is<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/china-restarts-game-approval-process/"> hard to obtain even by local publishers</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131747" style="width: 323px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131747" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2131747" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9141617080420_.pic_-e1617097739362.jpg" alt="" width="313" height="442" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9141617080420_.pic_-e1617097739362.jpg 747w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9141617080420_.pic_-e1617097739362.jpg?resize=106,150 106w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9141617080420_.pic_-e1617097739362.jpg?resize=212,300 212w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9141617080420_.pic_-e1617097739362.jpg?resize=481,680 481w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9141617080420_.pic_-e1617097739362.jpg?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2131747" class="wp-caption-text">Several major videogame console importers on Taobao have suspended business. Screenshot: TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how many imported consoles and console games were taken down from Taobao and what triggered the purge. Tgbus, one of the largest console game sellers on Taobao with 462,000 followers, currently has zero product listing. When asked by TechCrunch, a customer service staff said the store has temporarily halted shipping due to &#8220;a water leak in the warehouse.&#8221; When we pressed further, the person said it was due to &#8220;an electrical-equipment failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other vendors keep their responses vague, citing &#8220;special reasons&#8221; for the suspended services. One seller named the &#8220;Shanghai Gaming Console Store&#8221; said it suspended its business at the request of Taobao, without elaborating further.</p>
<p>Alibaba could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>The incident appears to inflict mostly console sellers with a sizable business at this moment. Imported cartridges and console devices can still be found on smaller Taobao stores and alternative platforms like Pinduoduo by searching the right keyword.</p>
<p>Some users see the move as China further tightening its grip on what gamers get to play. Over the past year, Apple&#8217;s China App Store <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/over-2500-games-removed-from-apples-china-app-store-in-early-july-as-crackdown-begins/">removed thousands of games</a> to wipe out games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/china-roundup-apple-closes-app-store-loophole/">without China&#8217;s official greenlight</a>. Other motives are politcal. Animal Crossing was pulled from grey market stores on Taobao and Pinduoduo after one of Hong Kong&#8217;s most well-known pro-democracy activists <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nintendo-china-animalcrossing/nintendo-game-pulled-from-chinese-platforms-after-hong-kong-protest-idUKKCN21S11F">used the game as his protest ground</a>.</p>
<p>Other users point out that customs officers regularly clamp down on parallel trading, which is designed to evade import tax because goods are carried by traders who appear as regular travelers. This isn&#8217;t the first time the console grey market has been hit, either. Some grey goods manage to fly under the radar before they attract critical sales. There are signs that the new Monster Hunter Rise, a Nintendo-Switch exclusive which isn&#8217;t available on the Chinese console edition, is stoking much interest among local players in recent weeks and may have driven some imports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/patreon-and-acast-partner-for-patron-only-podcast-distribution/">partnering with Patreon last year</a> to support patron-only podcasts, <a href="https://www.acast.com/en">Acast</a> has developed a full suite of subscription tools called Acast+.</p>
<p>The company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/acast-access/">experimented with paywalled podcasts</a> beyond Patreon in the past, but Acast+ appears to be its most comprehensive offering yet. Podcasters who run ads from Acast will be able to introduce a variety of other paid options, such as ad-free streams, exclusive episodes and early access to content.</p>
<p>Listeners will be able to access this content from the podcast players of their choice, including Apple Podcasts and Google Podcasts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In exchange, Acast will take a cut of subscription revenue — Vice President of Product Matt MacDonald described this as &#8220;part of the overall package of using Acast,&#8221; with podcasters benefiting from having the full monetization experience managed within Acast. That means they can upload and manage access to all their content from a single system (rather than having separate paid and free feeds) while also getting the &#8220;full revenue picture&#8221; of both their advertising income and subscription income.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wypxVUZ5bR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/acast-acquires-radiopublic/">Acast acquires podcasting startup RadioPublic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Acast acquires podcasting startup RadioPublic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/acast-acquires-radiopublic/embed/#?secret=wypxVUZ5bR" data-secret="wypxVUZ5bR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>MacDonald said it&#8217;s also crucial that Acast is supporting subscription access across podcast players, rather than creating a listening app or destination of its own.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;That’s a really clear distinction,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to make sure the podcaster’s listeners are their listeners. We&#8217;re just giving them a financial tool to help them build a relationship with the listeners that are supporting their show.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acast co-founder Johan Billgren also noted that podcasters can customize the experience down to the names of the subscription tiers and even what subscribers are called. He also said that after the launch of Acast+, the company will continue working with Patreon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to give the most options to the creator,&#8221; Billgren said. &#8220;They are in charge of their relationship, and if Patreon is the best option for them, we want to give them that option.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131603" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131603" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2131603" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?w=680" alt="Acast+" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg 13578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2131603" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Acast</p></div></p>
<p>More broadly, he suggested that Acast+ reflects &#8220;a big shift&#8221; as podcasts go from from being &#8220;completely free and ad-funded&#8221; to a pursuing a broader range of business models.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the financial relationship is an expression of the overall relationship,&#8221; MacDonald added. (Listener relationship-building was also a theme in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/acast-acquires-radiopublic/">Acast&#8217;s acquisition of RadioPublic last month</a>.) But certainly the financial side is important: &#8220;There are a number of times that I’ve heard podcasters say, &#8216;If I could make just a little bit more money, I could squeak out another episode.&#8217; We&#8217;re giving them the financial pathways to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acast+ is currently in beta testing and <a href="https://www.acast.com/en/beta">accepting signups</a> from interested podcasters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IBM has installed a couple of its own Quantum System One machines across the world in recent years, but today it announced its first private-sector U.S. deployment thanks to a new ten-year partnership with the Cleveland Clinic. This not only marks IBM&#8217;s first U.S. install of one of its quantum computers outside of its own facilities, but also the first time a healthcare institute purchases and houses a quantum computer. And thanks to this deal, Cleveland will also get access to IBM&#8217;s upcoming next-gen 1,000+ qubit quantum system.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still in the very early days of commercializing quantum computing and for most current users, having access to a system over the cloud is sufficient for the experiments they are running. But increasingly, we are seeing research institutes and even some commercial users who are looking to install on-premises quantum computers to have full access to a dedicated machine.</p>
<p>This new deal is part of a larger partnership between IBM and the Cleveland Clinic, which also involves IBM&#8217;s hybrid cloud portfolio for high-performance computing and its AI tools. The partnership also forms the foundation of Cleveland Clinic&#8217;s new Center for Pathogen Research &amp; Human Health, which is supported by <a href="https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2021/01/25/through-a-500-million-partnership-with-the-state-of-ohio-jobsohio-and-ohio-development-services-agency-cleveland-clinic-forms-global-center-for-pathogen-research-human-health/">$500 million</a> in investments from the State of Ohio, Jobs Ohio and <span class="il">Cleveland</span> Clinic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re announcing here is the first &#8212; I&#8217;m going to call them private sector or nonprofit &#8212; but still, it&#8217;s the first sort of non-government organization that is going to have not only fully dedicated systems, but what is really, really remarkable is our commitment for the decades,&#8221; Dario Gil, IBM&#8217;s SVP and Director of IBM Research, told me. &#8220;In a way, they are partnering with us for the entire roadmap. So it&#8217;s not only taking receipt and getting access to a fleet of quantum computers and the next-generation quantum computer for next year. They&#8217;re also the first ones who are signing up and says, &#8216;I want the first 1,000+ qubit system.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that it takes a very forward-looking organization to invest heavily in quantum computing today. It&#8217;s one thing for a nation-state to start working with this nascent technology, given the potential it has in a wide variety of fields, but it&#8217;s another for a non-profit to make a similar bet. &#8220;The level of ambition is really, really high on their end because they&#8217;re thinking about the future,&#8221; Gil said of the Cleveland Clinic&#8217;s leadership.</p>
<p>Gil noted that as part of the overall deal, Cleveland Clinic&#8217;s researchers will also get access to IBM&#8217;s entire quantum portfolio in the cloud. IBM will maintain and support the on-premises quantum computer and they will remain IBM-owned machines, similar to its deals with government research labs in Japan and Germany, he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maintaining it and supporting it is really critical,&#8221; Gil said about why that&#8217;s the case. &#8220;And they need us and our expertise to be able to do that. And also, you know, we do it because it&#8217;s like one of the most sensitive technologies that we have in IBM. So we are exquisitely focused on maintaining the security and safety for the machines.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the overall deal, IBM and Cleveland Clinic will also work on building skills among Cleveland Clinic&#8217;s researchers in quantum computing, but also AI and high-performance computing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through this innovative collaboration, we have a unique opportunity to bring the future to life,&#8221; said Tom Mihaljevic, M.D., President and CEO of <span class="il">Cleveland</span> Clinic. &#8220;These new computing technologies will revolutionize discovery in the life sciences and ultimately improve people’s lives. The Discovery Accelerator will enable our renowned teams to build a forward-looking digital infrastructure and transform medicine, while training the workforce of the future and growing our economy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is announcing a handful of major updates to Google Maps today that range from bringing its Live View AR directions indoors to adding weather data to its maps, but the most tantalizing news &#8212; which in typical Google fashion doesn&#8217;t have an ETA just yet &#8212; is that Google plans to bring a vastly improved 3D layer to Google maps.</p>
<p>Using photogrammetry, the same technology that also allows Microsoft&#8217;s Flight Simulator to render large swaths of the world in detail, Google is also building a model of the world for its Maps service.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to continue to improve that technology that helps us fuse together the billions of aerials, StreetView and satellite images that we have to really help us move from that flat 2D map to a more accurate 3D model than we&#8217;ve ever had. And be able to do that more quickly. And to bring more detail to it than we&#8217;ve ever been able to do before,&#8221; Dane Glasgow, Google&#8217;s VP for Geo Product Experience, said in a press event ahead of today&#8217;s announcement. He noted that this 3D layer will allow the company to visualize all its data in new and interesting ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2131509" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Google-Maps-3D.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131509" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2131509" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Google-Maps-3D.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131509" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>How exactly this will play out in reality remains to be seen, but Glasgow showed off a new 3D route preview, for example, with all of the typically mapping data overlayed on top of the 3D map.</p>
<p>Glasgow also noted that this technology will allow Google to parse out small features like stoplights and building addresses, which in turn will result in better directions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also think that the 3D imagery will allow us to visualize a lot of new information and data overlaid on top, you know, everything from helpful information like traffic or accidents, transit delays, crowdedness &#8212; there&#8217;s lots of potential here to bring new information,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131510" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Indoor-Live-View-2.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131510" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2131510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Indoor-Live-View-2.gif" alt="" width="350" height="620" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131510" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>As for the more immediate future, Google announced a handful of new features today that are all going to roll out in the coming months. Indoor Live View is the flashiest of these. Google&#8217;s existing <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/new-sense-direction-live-view/">AR Live View walking directions</a> currently only work outdoors, but thanks to some advances in its technology to recognize where exactly you are (even without a good GPS signal), the company is now able to bring this indoors. This feature is already live in some malls in the U.S. in <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago, Long Island, Los Angeles, Newark, San Francisco, San Jose, and Seattle, but in the coming months, it&#8217;ll come to select airports, malls and transit stations in Tokyo and Zurich as well (just in time for vaccines to arrive and travel to &#8212; maybe &#8212; rebound). Because Google is able to locate you by comparing the images around you to its database, it can also tell what floor you are on and hence guide you to your gate at the Zurich airport, for example (though in my experience, there are few places with better signage than airports&#8230;).</span></p>
<p>Also new are layers for weather data (but not weather radar) and air quality in Google Maps. The weather layer will be available globally on Android and iOS in the coming months, with the air quality layer only launching for Australia, India and the U.S. at first.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131513" style="width: 359px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131513" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2131513" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png" alt="" width="349" height="619" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png 1127w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png?resize=85,150 85w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png?resize=768,1363 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png?resize=866,1536 866w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131513" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Talking about air quality, Google Maps will also get a new eco-friendly routing option that lets you pick the driving route that produces the least CO2 (coming to Android and iOS later this year), and it will finally feature support for low emission zones, a feature of many a European City. Low emission zones on Google Maps will launch in June in Germany, France, Spain and the UK on Android and iOS. More countries will follow later.</p>
<p>And to bring this all together, Google will update its directions interface to show you all of the possible modes of transportations and routing options, prioritized based on your own preferences, as well as based on what&#8217;s popular in the city you are in (think he subway in NYC or bike-sharing in Portland).</p>
<p>Also new are more integrated options for curbside grocery pickups in partnership with Instacart and Albertsons, if that&#8217;s your thing.</p>
<p>And there you have it. As is so often the case with Google&#8217;s announcement, the most exciting new features the company showed off don&#8217;t have an ETA and may never launch, but until then you can hold yourself over by getting your weather forecasts on Google Maps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Staffbase.com">Staffbase</a>, which provides an intranet-style internal communications platform for companies, has raised a $145 million (€122 million) financing round led by General Atlantic, a growth equity firm. Existing investors Insight Partners and e.ventures also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Started in Chemnitz in Germany in 2014, Staffbase has managed to onboard over 1,000 clients including Adidas, Audi, BHP, Deutsche Post DHL, Groupon, Hitachi, Ikea, Johns Hopkins University, McKesson, Paulaner, Suncor, Viessmann, and Volvo, among others.</p>
<p>In early March this year, the company merged with Bananatag, the Canadian provider of internal communications solutions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has of course accelerated the adoption of digital tools for companies, so Staffbase is reaping the benefits of that shift. The company&#8217;s main competitors include Dynamic Signal (raised $114.8M) and Social Chorus (raised $47M). In the category of intranets, competitors include Simpplr (raised $29.1M) and Unily (raised $68M).</p>
<p>Staffbase claims its advantages are that it brings together mobile employee apps and intranets into one platform, as well as integrating with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, as well as the messaging platform Slack.</p>
<p>Dr. Martin Böhringer, co-founder and CEO of Staffbase, said in a statement: “We provide managers and communications specialists at enterprise companies with the leading digital platform for successful employee communications – a platform that we are expanding very rapidly. The partnership with General Atlantic will further help us achieve this and accelerate our growth, especially in North America.”</p>
<p>Dr. Christian Figge, managing director at General Atlantic, said: “Staffbase is a global pioneer and has developed software that specifically addresses the employee experience, supporting enterprises in transforming internal communications and engagement… Staffbase is a prime example of the quality of entrepreneurship and range of innovative companies with global ambitions emerging out of Germany.”</p>
<p>Staffbase has a workforce of 450 employees throughout 11 locations, including offices in London, New York, Vancouver, Amsterdam, and Berlin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European satellite and communications startup, <a href="https://hiber.global/">Hiber BV</a> has secured €26 million in EU and private investment to expand its IoT satellite network.  The funding comes from the European Innovation Council Fund (EIC Fund), the EU’s innovation agency, which has a €278 million Innovation Fund. The EIC co-invested with an innovation credit provided by the Dutch government and existing shareholders. Other investors include Finch Capital, Netherlands Enterprise Agency and Hartenlust Group. Hiber’s satellite constellation tracks and monitors machines and devices in harder-to-reach places.</p>
<p>At the same time co-founder of Hiber, Laurens Groenendijk, is to step aside as managing director to turn his attention to “other investment initiatives” the company said in a statement. Steven Kroonsberg joins as CFO. Roel Jansen joins as CCO. Groenendijk has been Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer at Treatwell as well as a serial investor.</p>
<p>Coen Janssen, Chief Strategy Officer and co-founder of Hiber, commented: “The €26 million funding is fantastic validation for Hiber’s success and a major boost for the European ‘New Space’ sector. It is a key step in realizing our aim of making the Internet of Things really simple and available for everyone in remote and developing regions of the world.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In particular, because it can reach out-of-the-way areas, Hiber&#8217;s network may be able to reduce losses in food production and leakages from oil wells.</p>
<p>Nicklas Bergman, European Innovation Council Fund Committee Member, commented: “I am glad to announce the EIC Fund support to this highly innovative company aiming at creating a European champion in the satellite Internet of Things sector. This equity financing will help Hiber to enable affordable and ubiquitous connectivity for the IoT solutions.”</p>
<p>Elia Montanari, Head of Management and Control at the European Space Agency, commented: “This major success has been supported at European level by collaboration of major EU bodies (EIC, EIB, ESA) fostering the Space Value Chain”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many work teams, especially stores and restaurants, rely on manual spreadsheets to ensure their operations are running smoothly. Based in Singapore, <a href="https://hellonimbly.com/">Nimbly</a> develops software that automates more of that process. Its features include digital checklists, inventory management and field audits that can be accessed through a mobile app. The startup announced today it has raised $4.6 million in pre-Series A funding, led by Insignia Ventures Partners, with participation from Sovereign’s Capital and Saison Capital.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 by Daniel Hazman and Jonathan Keith, Nimbly is currently used by more than one hundred organizations in seven countries, including Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and the United States. Most of Nimbly’s users are in the retail or food and beverage industries, and include KFC, Kopi Kenangan, 7-Eleven and Under Armour. Some clients also come from the fast-moving consumer goods and agriculture sectors, like Cargill and Wilmar.</p>
<p>The new funding brings its total raised to $5.7 million and will be used for Nimbly’s Southeast Asia expansion, including a new partnership with restaurant operator Express Food Group, and adding products like more analytics, mystery shopper and employee training.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Nimbly is designed to replace spreadsheets, emails and messaging apps by combining their functionalities into one app. This includes checklists, audits and live video to ensure that standard operating procedures are followed across all locations. For example, restaurants may use Nimbly to see if food safety and hygiene standards are being followed. FMCG companies can use it to track inventory at stores and share information about how their sales and promotions compare to competitors, while use cases for agriculture include verifying that suppliers are following sustainability measure at their farms.</p>
<p>In a statement, Insignia Venture Partners founding managing partner Yinglan Tan said, “SaaS enterprise is an emerging vertical in Southeast Asia with more businesses of all sizes and across industries seeking to transition and even upgrade their capabilities to software tools. That makes us very excited to have partnered with Daniel, Jonathan and their team at Nimbly as they lead this space in building software stack capable of serving the operational needs of companies first in Southeast Asia, and then globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vienna-based GoStudent, which connects students to tutors on a virtual learning platform, has raised a €70M Series B funding round led by new US investor Coatue. Coatue has been making &#8216;raids&#8217; into the European startup scene for the past year or so. It was joined by existing investors Left Lane Capital and DN Capital. This brings the total amount raised to €83.3M.</p>
<p>GoStudent competes with offline players like Schülerhilfe in Germany and Acadomia in France, which focus on small-classes in learning centers. By doing it online, GoStudent can introduce cost savings for users. It also competes where tutors advertise in traditional marketplaces like classified ads. The offering is similar to Chinese players like Zhangmen, VIPKid, TAL Education.</p>
<p>The investment will be used for growth and expansion into international markets such as Turkey and Greece. GoStudent is aiming for 15 countries across Europe and to grow its team to +800 employees and +10,000 tutors. It claims that over 250,000 tutoring sessions are booked every month on its platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.finchcapital.com/">Finch Capital</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/finch-capital-launches-third-fund/">the early-stage fintech VC</a> with a presence in London and Amsterdam, is acquiring Wirecard Turkey, a subsidiary of Wirecard, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/house-of-wirecard-insolvency/">disgraced fintech out of Germany</a>. The acquisition, for which terms remain undisclosed and is still subject to regulatory approval, sees Finch create a new Ireland-registered entity called Nomu Pay.</p>
<p>After facing a huge accounting scandal and failing to make payments on its own loans, Wirecard went into insolvency last year. Since then, various parts of its business have been bought, including one of its largest assets, Wirecard Solutions, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/railsbank-wirecard/">acquired by the U.K.&#8217;s Railsbank</a>.</p>

<p>Finch&#8217;s managing partner Radboud Vlaar tells me Noma Pay’s larger plan is to invest in payments infrastructure in Turkey and the Middle East region. He says that more details will be provided on the new entity&#8217;s strategy and branding once the deal has formally closed.</p>
<p>Explains Vlaar: &#8220;We see tremendous  growth opportunities to further enhance payments for Turkey&#8217;s 80 million inhabitants. We are excited to team up with Wirecard Turkey under the leadership of its CEO Serkan Yasin and we continue to actively look for further M&amp;A opportunities in the region to accelerate its growth and development&#8221;.</p>
<p>Wirecard Turkey (Wirecard Ödeme ve Elektronik Para Hizmetleri A.Ş.) was established in Turkey in July 2008 and started its operations the following year as the country&#8217;s first &#8220;direct carrier billing&#8221; service provider. In 2014, it was wholly acquired by Wirecard Issuing &amp; Acquiring Gmbh, which is a subsidiary of Wirecard AG.</p>
<p>Today, the Turkish company provides various payment services, namely: direct carrier billing, credit card acquiring, and e-money. It has contracts with all three GSM operators and the majority of banks in Turkey, and more than 1,200 merchants.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is great talent in Turkey to build a leading next generation payments company,&#8221; adds Vlaar.</p>
