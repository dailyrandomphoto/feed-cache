										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> has announced an ambitious new product today called <a href="https://stripe.com/treasury">Stripe Treasury</a>. The company is partnering with banks to offer a banking-as-a-service API. In other words, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stripe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stripe">Stripe <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> clients will be able to provide bank accounts to their customers.</p>
<p>This is part of a bigger trend called embedded finance. Essentially, instead of separating banking services from other services that you use, embedded finance products provide financial services as close as possible to the end customer in the services that they already use.</p>
<p>Other companies have been working on embedded business banking products, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/wise-raises-another-12-million-to-double-down-on-embedded-business-banking/">Wise</a>. Stripe could take advantage of its existing user base to convince them to use Stripe Treasury for new banking products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shopify">Shopify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will use Stripe Treasury for <a href="https://www.shopify.com/balance">Shopify Balance</a>. If a Shopify merchant wants to hold money, pay bills and spend money from their Shopify account, they can open a bank account in Shopify Balance directly. This way, they can skip the traditional bank account. Behind the scenes, Stripe Treasury powers that feature.</p>
<p>And yet, Stripe doesn’t want to become a bank. As usual, the company is focused on infrastructure and payments. It partners with banks, such as Evolve Bank and Goldman Sachs in the U.S. Eventually, Stripe also plans to launch Stripe Treasury in other countries thanks to partnerships with Citibank and Barclays.</p>
<p>Stripe turns everything into API calls. An API is a programming interface that lets you interact with third-party services using simple instructions. For instance, a developer can take advantage of Stripe Treasury to open bank accounts directly from their service by triggering Stripe’s API.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can move money or pay bills using API calls. Combined with <a href="https://stripe.com/issuing">Stripe Issuing</a>, you can also issue a virtual or physical card and connect it to a bank account. Slowly, Stripe is building products that cover a bigger chunk of the payment chain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Advancements in the tech and the cyber threat landscape are creating vast job opportunities. The global cyber security market is projected to reach £210 billion by 2026. But in the UK, out of 952,000 working aged (16-64) UK military veterans and 15,000 service leavers a year, only 4% of them are working in tech and cyber. This is 20% lower than the non-veteran population. The cost to the UK economy of underemployed or unemployed veterans has been estimated at £1.5 billion over 5 years. This means all this talent &#8211; talent which has literally been trained to adapt to fast-moving situations like the one the world finds itself in now &#8211; is going to waste, just when the era of massive digitization of business and society is upon us.</p>
<p>So it’s significant that the UK’s <a href="https://www.rfea.org.uk/">RFEA</a>, the Forces Employment charity, is launching a new partnership with <a href="http://TechVets.co">TechVets</a>, the non-profit set up to build a bridge for veterans into cyber security and the technology sector.</p>
<p>With the RFEA’s support, TechVets will create extensive new free upskilling and job opportunities for ‘tech-curious’ service leavers and veterans, through its offering of networking, mentoring, signposting and training services, via its new TechVets Academy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The initiative is timely. It’s estimated that over 173,000 UK military veterans are at risk due to the economic impact of COVID and the ending of the government&#8217;s furlough scheme in March 2021.</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2018, TechVets has grown to a community of over 6,000 members and several ‘chapters’ around the UK.</p>
<p>TechVets uses a blend of open-source resources, partner training, and community support, to empower those new to cyber/tech to choose the pathway that is best for them. And it’s all free to veterans and service leavers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/thumbnail_James-Murphy-BW-3-Copy-1.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="535" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2082757" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/thumbnail_James-Murphy-BW-3-Copy-1.jpg 520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/thumbnail_James-Murphy-BW-3-Copy-1.jpg?resize=146,150 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/thumbnail_James-Murphy-BW-3-Copy-1.jpg?resize=292,300 292w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/thumbnail_James-Murphy-BW-3-Copy-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/thumbnail_James-Murphy-BW-3-Copy-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></p>
<p>TechVets Programme Director, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-m-062/">James Murphy</a> (pictured), is an Army Veteran of 19 years. He joined the 1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment in 2000, before transferring to the Intelligence Corps in 2013 after sustaining life-long injuries in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In a statement, he said: “Anyone who has held a role in the Forces comes armed with an understanding of the sensitivities of working in security. Ex-Services also possess an innate ability to learn new skills and are natural problem solvers, who can work quickly and fit into a team with ease. Ex-military personnel are also the kind of people who thrive in pressurized, or time-sensitive, situations. These soft skills are incredible assets in the security and technology industries, which can be used to fill the current skills shortage in this area.”</p>
<p>RFEA’s Chief Executive Officer, Alistair Halliday, added: “The TechVets Programme is a fantastic new addition to RFEA’s services that will, no doubt, encourage talented veterans to consider tech and security-based roles that may have otherwise overlooked. It will also help veterans to upskill digitally to help them get into wider roles too.”</p>
<p>TechVets member Gareth Paterson, joined the Army in 1994. He started out as a Tank crewman and then transferred to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers as an instructor in 2001. He left in 2018, having completed operational tours of Northern Ireland, Former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan. He says his life has been changed by TechVets: “I left the Army as I was at the end of my 24-year career… I did not have a clue what career to move into, then I was introduced to offensive cybersecurity and penetration testing. I joined TechVets and it gave me my first insight into the tools and techniques of penetration testing. After that, I was hooked! The support of everyone at TechVets, and its community, has helped me to gain confidence and push harder. I was able to gain qualifications in penetration testing which improved my job prospects in the sector. By November 2018 I started working as a cybersecurity consultant.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334545842972332032">shutting down</a> its experimental app twttr, which the company had used publicly prototype new features back in 2019. The app was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/13/a-first-look-at-twitters-new-beta-app-and-its-bid-to-remain-valuable-and-relevant/">introduced</a> at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2019, then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/twitters-new-prototype-app-twttr-launches-today/">launched</a> to testers that March. Its primary focus had been on trying out new designs for threaded conversations, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/twitter-rolls-out-changes-to-threaded-conversations-following-tests-in-its-prototype-app-twttr/">things</a> like how to branch replies, apply labels and color-code responses, among other things. Some of those tests <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/twitter-rolls-out-changes-to-threaded-conversations-following-tests-in-its-prototype-app-twttr/">eventually turned into Twitter features</a> and the twttr app was no longer being used.</p>
<p>The idea to design in public was an interesting experiment by Twitter.</p>
<p>Most companies roll out internal beta tests, followed by smaller-scale A/B tests to a percentage of their public user base to get feedback about new ideas. But with twttr, the company actually invited its users to be a part of the much earlier stage development process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The concept for twttr had been spearheaded by Twitter&#8217;s then Director of Product Management, <a href="https://twitter.com/pandemona">Sara Beykpour</a> (then Sara Haider &#8212; she and Twitter Product Lead Kayvon Beykpour have since <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz">married</a>). But Sara announced last year she would be stepping into a new role at the company and Twitter&#8217;s new product director in charge of conversations would be Suzanne Xie, who had joined by way of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/twitter-picks-up-team-from-narrative-app-lightwell-in-its-latest-effort-to-improve-conversations/">Twitter&#8217;s acquisition of Lightwell</a>.</p>
<p>Work on twttr appeared to stop around the time Xie stepped in, as no other significant updates were released to twttr&#8217;s TestFlight user base. And <a href="https://twitter.com/suzannexie/status/1315707645257420805">Xie left Twitter this fall</a> for Stripe.</p>
<p>Now, it seems that maintaining the largely unused app no longer makes sense for the company.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We appreciate the feedback you gave us through this run of our prototype app twttr. For now we’re turning it off so we can work on new tests to improve the conversation experience on Twitter.</p>
<p>If you’re using twttr, switch to the main Twitter app to keep up with what’s happening. <a href="https://t.co/xq4emx9HeH">https://t.co/xq4emx9HeH</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334545842972332032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334545842972332032">announced</a> its plans to formally shut down twttr today, saying it was turning off the app in order to work on new tests related to the conversation taking place on Twitter itself. The shutdown appears to be immediate. Though the app may still function for those who have it installed, when the TestFlight build expires in 26 days, that may no longer be the case.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not likely that twttr had many dedicated users at this point, especially as the app lacked Twitter&#8217;s newer features like Topics and Fleets, for example, and was no longer offering new experiments to test.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With automation and intent data, brands can more easily connect with leads, prospects, and customers at a personal, intimate level.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coronavirus is causing large and small businesses to drastically cut marketing budgets. In Forrester’s self-described “most optimistic scenario,” the analysts project a <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/The+2020+COVID19+Crisis+Will+Stun+US+Marketing/-/E-RES160724">28% drop</a> in U.S. marketing spend by the end of 2021. Even Google is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2020/04/29/google-slashes-its-marketing-budget-what-does-this-mean/#362198806aa5">cutting its marketing budget in half</a>. As marketers move forward, <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/The+2020+COVID19+Crisis+Will+Stun+US+Marketing/-/E-RES160724">Forrester predicts marketing automation platforms</a> will grow despite an overall decline in marketing technology investment.</p>
<p>Automation platforms help marketers scale their communications. However, scaling communications is not a substitute for intimacy, which all humans crave. Because of the pandemic, it is harder than ever to get attention, let alone make a connection. More mass email blasts from your marketing automation platform are not going to get you the connections with prospects you crave. So how should marketers proceed? Direct mail captures 100% of your audience&#8217;s attention. It provides a sensory experience for your prospects and customers, and that helps establish an <a href="https://twosidesna.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2018/05/Using_Neuroscience_To_Understand_The_Role_Of_Direct_Mail.pdf">emotional connection</a>.</p>
<p>Winning marketers are strategically merging automation and digital data with the more intimate channel of direct mail. We call this <a href="http://pfl.com">tactile marketing automation</a> (TMA).</p>
<p>TMA is the integration of direct mail or personalized swag with a marketing automation platform. With TMA, a marketer doesn’t have to think about creating direct mail campaigns outside of digital campaigns. Rather, direct mail experiences are already fully integrated into the pre-built customer journey.</p>
<p>TMA uses intent data to inform content, messaging and the timing of direct mail touchpoints that maximize relevancy and scalability. Multichannel campaigns including direct mail report an ROI <a href="https://www.pfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PFL_State_of_Multichannel_v5.pdf">18 percentage points higher</a> than those without direct mail. Plus, 84% of marketers state direct mail improves multichannel campaign performance.</p>
<p>Read on to see how you can merge digital communications and direct mail to deliver remarkable experiences that spark a connection.</p>
<h2>Incorporate intent data</h2>
<p>Personalization is a key ingredient of a remarkable experience. Many marketers automate processes by introducing marketing software and then call it personalization. But, oftentimes it’s just quicker batching and blasting. Brands can’t just change the first name on a piece of content and call it “personalized.” <em>Real</em> personalization is necessary and vital for <em>real </em>results. Our consumers expect more. The best way to introduce <em>real</em> personalization within a marketing mix is to use intent data and trigger-driven campaigns.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That includes movies like &#8220;Godzilla vs. Kong,&#8221; &#8220;Mortal Kombat,&#8221; &#8220;In The Heights,&#8221; &#8220;Space Jam: A New Legacy&#8221; &#8220;The Suicide Squad,&#8221; &#8220;Dune,&#8221; the &#8220;Sopranos&#8221; prequel &#8220;The Many Saints of Newark&#8221; and &#8220;The Matrix 4.&#8221; (The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/warnermedia" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="warnermedia">WarnerMedia <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announcement notes that release dates could change, which might move some of these titles out of the scope of today&#8217;s announcement.)</p>
<p>These movies will be available on HBO Max for one month, in 4K Ultra HD and HDR, at no additional charge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, Hollywood studios responded to widespread theatrical by bringing some films straight to streaming while delaying their big releases. The disappointing box office performance of &#8220;Tenet&#8221; (also from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/warner-bros" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="warner-bros">Warner Bros.) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/media-roundup-google-to-cut-big-checks-for-news-publishers-substack-continues-to-draw-top-creators-more/">prompted additional delays</a> — but as the pandemic stretched on, there was a growing sense that studios couldn&#8217;t afford to delay things forever.</p>
<p>For example, Universal had already <a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/amc-universal-deal-entertainment-industry-future-1234718942/">reached a deal with AMC</a> and other major chains to release movies on premium video on demand just three weeks after they launch in theaters, with the revenue split with theatrical partners.</p>
<p>But WarnerMedia&#8217;s announcement seems like an even more dramatic shift — and while it only covers 2021, it could signal potentially long-lasting changes to theaters&#8217; exclusive release window.</p>
<p>This also comes after former Hulu CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/warnermedias-new-boss-is-former-hulu-ceo-jason-kilar/">Jason Kilar took over as WarnerMedia&#8217;s chief executive</a> in April, a move (followed by m<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-11-10/att-warnermedia-begins-new-round-of-layoffs-amid-reorganization">ultiple rounds of layoffs</a>) that seemed to put streaming front-and-center in the company&#8217;s priorities.</p>
<p>In a statement, Kilar said:</p>
<blockquote><p>After considering all available options and the projected state of moviegoing throughout 2021, we came to the conclusion that this was the best way for WarnerMedia’s motion picture business to navigate the next 12 months. More importantly, we are planning to bring consumers 17 remarkable movies throughout the year, giving them the choice and the power to decide how they want to enjoy these films. Our content is extremely valuable, unless it’s sitting on a shelf not being seen by anyone. We believe this approach serves our fans, supports exhibitors and filmmakers, and enhances the HBO Max experience, creating value for all.</p></blockquote>

<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/bill-gates" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="bill-gates">Bill Gates, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the co-founder of Microsoft and one of the world&#8217;s richest men and most prolific philanthropists, has just released a broad new plan on <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/How-the-US-can-lead-on-climate-change-innovation">how the U.S. could take the lead in the fight against climate change</a>.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;[We] need to revolutionize the world’s physical economy—and that will take, among other things, a dramatic infusion of ingenuity, funding, and focus from the federal government. No one else has the resources to drive the research we need,&#8221; Gates writes. </span></p>
<p>With a new Biden administration set to take over the reins of government, the timing for Gates&#8217; suggestions couldn&#8217;t be better. The outgoing Trump Administration was singularly opposed to combating climate change, rolling back regulations,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/if-elected-biden-commits-to-rejoin-climate-accord-u-s-just-abandoned/"> withdrawing from international agreements on climate change mitigation</a> and sweeping aside science in favor of specious arguments from the industries that had the most to lose from a recognition of the threats of anthropogenic climate change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rjQFUa6s1Y"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/if-elected-biden-commits-to-rejoin-climate-accord-u-s-just-abandoned/">If elected, Biden commits to rejoin climate accord US just abandoned</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;If elected, Biden commits to rejoin climate accord US just abandoned&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/if-elected-biden-commits-to-rejoin-climate-accord-u-s-just-abandoned/embed/#?secret=rjQFUa6s1Y" data-secret="rjQFUa6s1Y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Gates calls for a dramatic $25 billion boost in spending that would bring clean energy research spending to $35 billion a year (in line with medical spending from the government). Gates notes that this could lead to the <a href="https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/reports/energy-randd-impact">creation of more than 370,000 jobs</a> while boosting a clean-energy agenda.</p>
<p>Gates noted that Americans spend more on gasoline in a single month than the government spends on climate-related research.</p>
<p>Beyond simply spending more money on research, the Microsoft-made billionaire called for the creation of a network of &#8220;National Institutes of Energy Innovation.&#8221;</p>
<div class="TGN_Article_ReadTimeSection">
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;This is the most important thing the U.S. can do to lead the world in innovations that will solve climate change,&#8221; Gates wrote.</span></p>
<p>Modeled on the National Institutes of Health, the largest financier for biomedical research in the world, Gates called for the Energy Innovation Institutes to comprise separate institutions focusing on specific areas. One would be an Institute of Transportation Decarbonization while others could focus on energy storage, renewables or carbon capture and management, Gates wrote.</p>
<p>Gates also suggested that each organization should be tasked with the commercialization for innovations that come out of the lab. &#8220;It&#8217;s not enough to develop a new way to store electricity that works in the lab &#8212; to have any imapact, it has to be practical and affordable in real-world settings. The best way to ensure that is to encourage scientists to start their research with an end-use in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, Gates called for the institutes to be located around the country &#8212; just like the Department of Energy or the NASA have laboratories and research facilities spread around the country.</p>
<p>In addition to the research facilities and spending boosts, Gates called for a program of tax incentives and energy standards that could make markets for more clean-energy tools.</p>
<p><span class="normaltextrun">There are already pieces of legislation making their way through Congress like the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4447" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Clean Energy Innovation and Jobs Act</a><span class="normaltextrun"> and </span><a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/american-energy-innovation-act-aeia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the American Energy Innovation Act</a><span class="normaltextrun"> that could help the federal government move toward a more nimble and focused setup, Gates acknowledged. But both of these laws have stalled. </span></p>
</div>
<p>Gates&#8217; climate plan <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/top-companies-call-for-ambitious-us-climate-policy/">comes as more than 40 major U.S. companies penned an open letter to the incoming Biden Administration</a> to do more to address climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our communities and our economy are enduring not only a devastating pandemic but also the rising costs of climate change,&#8221; the companies wrote. &#8220;Record wildfires, flooding, hurricanes and other extreme weather are upending lives and livelihoods. And science makes clear that future generations will face far greater environmental, economic and health impacts unless we act now.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yesterday, the medical journal <em>Lancet<a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32290-X/fulltext"> </a></em><a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32290-X/fulltext">released a sweeping survey</a> documenting the health impacts associated with environmental catastrophes, pollution and climate change.</p>
<p>Heat waves, air pollution and extreme weather increasingly damage human health, the report said. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/02/940790818/we-dont-have-to-live-this-way-doctors-call-for-climate-action">As National Public Radio reported</a>, the report<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> makes an explicit connection between death, disease and burning fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Many carbon-intensive practices and policies lead to poor air quality, poor food quality, and poor housing quality, which disproportionately harm the health of disadvantaged populations,&#8221; the authors of <em>The Lancet</em> analysis wrote.</p>
<p>Even in a divided government, there&#8217;s much the Biden administration can do to make a significant dent in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/a-biden-presidency-doesnt-need-a-green-new-deal-to-make-progress-on-climate-change/">TechCrunch reported</a>, a large portion of any infrastructure-related stimulus could contain significant spending on climate change mitigation-related technologies.</p>
<p>“A lot of the really consequential climate-related stuff that’s going to come out in the [near term] … won’t actually be related to renewables,” an advisor to the President-elect said.</p>
<p>However, if the Democrats manage to wrest control of the Senate from Republican leadership in the aftermath of the January 2021 runoff elections in Georgia, then the possibility of a more muscular climate agenda &#8212; one that could incorporate Gates&#8217; suggestions &#8212; could be on the table.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nasa" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nasa">NASA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has selected the winning candidates that they&#8217;ve decided to tap to collect lunar resources for eventual Earth return, from a number of commercial companies who applied. The four companies all have rides booked on future commercial lunar lander missions, and the agency is using this as a demonstration of what kinds of efficiencies it can realize by piggybacking on private industry for serving its needs – and a precedent-setting event for NASA paying private companies to retrieve materials that they retrieved and owned privately for their own purposes prior to transferring ownership to the agency.</p>
<p>The winning bids were evaluated based on two simple criteria: Basically, were they technically feasible, and how much did they cost. There were four winners, each with a different ride out, which will seek to satisfy the conditions of NASA&#8217;s request, which is basically to collect a lunar regolith (essentially what we call &#8216;soil&#8217; on the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/moon-ba85" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="moon-ba85">Moon) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in an amount ranging from between 50 grams or 500 grams, with retrieval to be handled separately by NASA at a later date. The samples had to be collected before 2024 as part of the request, which sets them up for potential retrieval via NASA&#8217;s Artemis mission series, though the agency isn&#8217;t necessarily going to actually pick up the samples, though it reserves the option to do so.</p>
<p>The four companies selected are:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>Lunar Outpost, from Golden, Colorado, which bid to complete the contract for just $1, following the arrival of the Blue Origin lunar lander in 2023.</li>
<li>ispace Japan, which asked for $5,000 for a retrieval via the landing of its Hakuto-R lander during its first mission currently set for 2022.</li>
<li>ispace Europe, a part of ispace Japan&#8217;s global corporate footprint, which bid for $5,000 and an arrival in 2023 on the second Hakuto-R mission.</li>
<li>Masten Space Systems, which asked for $15,000, with an arrival in 2023 using its Masten XL lander</li>
</ul>
<p>The agency received 22 proposals in total, between 16 and 17 companies. This was intentionally designed to help NASA demonstrate the advantages of its public-private partnerships approach, and to set precedents about how resource material collection can happen on extra-terrestrial bodies like the Moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the commercial partnerships, this is setting a precedent internally as well as externally, relative to NASA continuing that paradigm,&#8221; said NASA’s Acting Associate Administrator for International and Interagency Relations Mike <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gold" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gold">Gold <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. &#8220;Rather than pay for the development of the systems themselves, NASA is playing the role is customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>More specifically, these contracts also set precedents in terms of what private companies can do in terms of collecting material from the Moon, and who has ownership of that material once collected.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve often said that the rocket science part, the engineering, sometimes that seems like the easy aspect when it comes to all of the policy issues, legal, or financial challenges that we have,&#8221; Gold said. &#8220;It&#8217;s very important that we resolve any legal or regulatory questions in advance because we never want policy, or regulations to slow down or hinder incredible innovations in development that we&#8217;re seeing from both the public and the private sector. So we think it&#8217;s very important to establish the precedent that the private sector entities can extract can take these resources that NASA can purchase, and utilize them to fuel, not only NASA&#8217;s activities, but a whole new dynamic era of public and private development and exploration on the Moon, and then eventually to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mars" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mars">Mars <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Basically, NASA wants this to set a precedent that private companies can go to the Moon, and eventually Mars, and mine material and retain ownership of said material for later distribution to both public and other private customers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s part of the reason these bids are so low – companies like ispace and Lunar Outpost have future business models that involve significant potential planetary body mining components. The other is that these lunar lander missions were already planned, and as NASA explicitly laid out in their request for proposals for this bid, the agency did not want to pay for any development costs for the mission of getting to the Moon itself – just the actual collection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.thomabravo.com/">Thoma Bravo</a> must really like <a href="https://www.flexera.com/">Flexera</a>, an IT asset management company out of Chicago. The private equity firm bought the company for the second time today. Sources told TechCrunch the price was $2.85 billion.</p>
<p>Technically, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/thoma-bravo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="thoma-bravo">Thoma Bravo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is getting a majority stake in the company, buying it from previous owners TA Associates and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board. The firm <a href="https://www.revenera.com/about-us/press-center/thoma-bravo-completes-acquisition-macrovision-software-business.html">originally bought Flexera in 2008</a> from Macrovision for just $200 million. It turned it around just three years later in 2011 for $1 billion profit, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2019/10/02/meet-wall-streets-best-dealmaker-new-billionaire-orlando-bravo/?sh=2ed3a34442ec">according to reports</a>.</p>
<p>While reports last year had the company&#8217;s investors <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-06/flexera-owners-are-said-to-pursue-sale-for-as-much-as-3-billion">looking for $3 billion</a>, they didn&#8217;t quite reach that mark, but it&#8217;s still a hefty profit as the company continues to change hands, giving each of its owners a substantial return on investment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">At $2.85 billion, Thoma Bravo will have a bigger challenge on its hands to make that same kind of return, but it sees a company it liked before and it still likes it, especially the management team, which to some degree at least remains intact.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Jim [Ryan] and his team have positioned <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flexera-software" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flexera-software">Flexera <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for sustained growth by focusing on the strategic challenges enterprises face with complex IT infrastructures,&#8221; Seth Boro, managing partner at Thoma Bravo said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ryan was pleased to see the company&#8217;s value continue to rise and to connect once again with Thoma Bravo. &#8220;This is a resounding vote of confidence in the growth Flexera has shown and the strategic initiatives we’ve undertaken to address the exponential challenges faced by organizations today,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2008 and has bought 12 companies along the way including five in the last couple of years, according to Crunchbase data. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next subject to regulatory approvals.</p>

<p>Injective Protocol is one of the first universal ‘DeFi’ (Decentralised Finance) protocols for cross-chain derivatives trading, so the launch of the testnet is an important milestone. Injective&#8217;s main competitors (centralized and decentralized exchanges) include CME Group, BitMEX, LedgerX and OKEx among others.</p>
<p>As well as being incubated by Binance Labs, Injective Protocol is also backed with $3M in funding from noted blockchain investors Pantera, Hashed, and others. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pantera-capital">Pantera</a> has had some successful exits including Kik, Bitstampt and Blockfolio.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paul Veradittakit, Partner at Pantera Capital, said in a statement: “Injective’s Solstice testnet trades and feels like a state of the art derivatives exchange but it’s actually entirely supported by a fully decentralized infrastructure. With a 1 second blocktime, instant finality, and full EVM support, I’m confident that Injective will be able to pioneer the next wave of decentralized derivatives trading”</p>
<p>Injective&#8217;s team emerged from Stanford University and has been building and testing its platform privately since 2018, while validating it with several large largest funds, market makers, and institutional traders. Prior to Injective, Eric Chen, CEO and сo-founder, was working at hedge funds and worked in cryptographic research at a blockchain-focused fund.</p>
<p>Injective has been working towards a mainnet and has already announced partnerships with top blockchain companies such as Elrond, Ramp DeFi, Findora, and Frontier. Its layer-2 decentralized exchange protocol lets traders trade across Ethereum, Cosmos, and others, using  Tendermint-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to facilitate cross-chain derivatives trading.</p>
<p>Centralized exchanges have been known for operational failures like front running, exit scams, and exchange hacks. At the same time, existing DEXs are still facing problems such as high transaction fees, low liquidity, inconvenient UI/UX, and slow speeds. But the trading volume of decentralized exchanges reportedly grew 70% in the middle of 2020, setting a recent record high of $1.52 billion. So there&#8217;s clearly an appetite for this approach.</p>
<p>The advantage of the approach used by Injective combines the advantages of decentralized exchanges: resistance to front running, scams, and hacks, with the speed, low transaction fees and no gas fees, only previously available with centralized platforms. Developers can also create their own derivatives and markets to trade.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin reaching an all-time-high at around $18k, the blockchain and crypto world is once again taking off.</p>
<p>Paypal <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-bought-70-of-all-newly-mined-bitcoin-last-month-as-demand-rockets/">bought</a> up to 70% of all the newly mined bitcoin since the payments giant started offering cryptocurrency services.  And Guggenheim Funds Trust <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/guggenheim-fund-files-to-be-able-to-invest-up-to-almost-500m-in-bitcoin-through-gbtc">filed</a> an amendment with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to allow its $5 billion Macro Opportunities Fund gain exposure to bitcoin by investing up to 10% of the fund’s net asset value in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube today announced it&#8217;s launching a new feature that will push commenters to reconsider their hateful and offensive remarks before posting. It will also begin testing a filter that allows creators to avoid having to read some of the hurtful comments on their channel that had been automatically held for review. The new features are meant to address long standing issues with the quality of comments on YouTube&#8217;s platform &#8212; a problem creators have complained about for years.</p>
<p>The company said it will also soon run a survey aimed at giving equal opportunity to creators, and whose data can help the company to better understand how some creators are more disproportionately impacted by online hate and harassment.</p>
<p>The new commenting feature, rolling out today, is a significant change for YouTube.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feature appears when users are about to post something offensive in a video&#8217;s comments section and warns to &#8220;Keep comments respectful.&#8221; The message also tells users to check the site&#8217;s Community Guidelines if they&#8217;re not sure if a comment is appropriate.</p>
<p>The pop-up then nudges users to click the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button and revise their comment by making &#8220;Edit&#8221; the more prominent choice on the screen that appears.</p>
<p>The feature will not actually prevent a user from posting their comment, however. If they want to proceed, they can click the &#8220;Post Anyway&#8221; option instead.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082631" style="width: 664px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082631" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2082631" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?w=654" alt="" width="654" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=144,150 144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=288,300 288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=768,799 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=654,680 654w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082631" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>The idea to put up roadblocks to give users time to pause and reconsider their words and actions is something several social media platforms are now doing.</p>
<p>For instance, Instagram last year launched a feature that would<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/instagram-anti-bullying-features/"> flag offensive comments</a> before they were posted. It later expanded that to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/instagram-to-now-flag-potentially-offensive-captions-in-addition-to-comments/"> include offensive captions</a>. Without providing data, the company claimed that these &#8220;nudges&#8221; were helping to reduce online bullying. Meanwhile, Twitter this year began to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/twitter-read-before-retweet/">push users to read the article linked in tweets</a> they were about to share before tweeting their reaction, and it stopped users from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/twitter-retweet-changes-quote-tweet-election-misinformation/">being able to retweet with just one click</a>.</p>
<p>These intentional pauses built into the social platforms are designed to stop people from reacting to content with heightened emotion and anger, and instead push users to be more thoughtful in what they say and do. User interface changes like this leverage basic human psychology to work, and may even prove effective in some percentage of cases. But platforms have been hesitant to roll out such tweaks as they can stifle user engagement.</p>
<p>In YouTube&#8217;s case, the company tells TechCrunch its systems will learn what&#8217;s considered offensive based on what content gets repeatedly flagged by users. Over time, this A.I.-powered system should be able to improve as the technology gets better at detection and the system itself is further developed.</p>
<p>Users on Android in the English language will see the new prompts first, starting today, Google says. The rollout will complete over the next couple of days. The company did not offer a timeframe for the feature&#8217;s support for other platforms and languages or even a firm commitment that such support would arrive in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, YouTube said it will also now begin testing a feature for creators who use YouTube Studio to manage their channel.</p>
<p>Creators will be able to try out a new filter that will hide the offensive and hurtful comments that have automatically been held for review.</p>
<p>Today, YouTube Studio users can choose to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/8829345?hl=en">auto-moderate potentially inappropriate comments,</a> which they can then manually review and choose to approve, hide or report. While it&#8217;s helpful to have these held, it&#8217;s still often difficult for creators to have to deal with these comments at all, as online trolls can be unbelievably cruel. With the filter, creators can avoid these potentially offensive comments entirely.</p>
<p>YouTube says it will also streamline its moderation tools to make the review process easier going forward.</p>
<p>The changes follow a year during which YouTube has been heavily criticized for not doing enough to combat <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/dennis-prager/youtube-removed-anti-trans-prageru-videos-violating-hate-speech-policies">hate speech</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562910/youtube-2020-election-trump-misinformation-fake-news-recommendations">misinformation</a> on its platform. The video platform&#8217;s &#8220;strikes&#8221; system for rule violations means that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/steve-bannons-show-pulled-off-twitter-and-youtube-over-calls-for-violence/"> videos may be individually removed</a> but a channel itself can stay online unless it collects enough strikes to be taken down. In practice, that means a YouTube creator could be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/steve-bannons-show-pulled-off-twitter-and-youtube-over-calls-for-violence/">as violent as</a> calling for government officials to be beheaded and and still continue to use YouTube. (By comparison, that same threat led to an account ban on Twitter.)</p>
<p>YouTube claims it has increased the number of daily hate speech comment removals by 46x since early 2019. And in the last quarter, of the more than 1.8 million channels it terminated for violating our policies, more than 54,000 terminations were for hate speech. That indicates a growing problem with online discourse that likely influenced these new measures. Some would argue the platforms have a responsibility to do even more, but it&#8217;s a difficult balance.</p>
<p>In a separate move, YouTube said it&#8217;s soon introducing a new survey that will ask creators to voluntarily share with YouTube information about their gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity. Using the data collected, YouTube claims it will be able to better examine how content from different communities is treated in search, discovery and monetization systems.</p>
<p>It will also look for possible patterns of hate, harassment, and discrimination that could affect some communities more than others, the company explains. And the survey will give creators to optionally participate in other initiatives that YouTube hosts, like #YouTubeBlack creator gatherings or FanFest, for instance.</p>
<p>This survey will begin in 2021 and was designed in consultation with input from creators and civil and human rights experts. YouTube says the collected data will not be used for advertising purposes, and creators will have the ability to opt-out and delete their information entirely at any time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Timnit Gebru, a leading researcher and voice in the field of ethics and artificial intelligence, says Google fired her for an email she sent to her direct reports.  According to Gebru, Google fired her because of an email she sent to subordinates that the company said reflected &#8220;behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gebru, the co-leader of Google Ethical Artificial Intelligence team, took to Twitter last night, shortly after the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-nlrb-labor-complaint/">Google alleging surveillance of employees and unlawful firing of employees</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was fired by <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffDean?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JeffDean</a> for my email to Brain women and Allies. My corp account has been cutoff. So I&#39;ve been immediately fired :-)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Timnit Gebru (@timnitGebru) <a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334352694664957952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Gebru says no one explicitly told her she was fired, but that she received an email from one of her boss&#8217;s reports, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for making your conditions clear. We cannot agree to #1 and #2 as you are requesting. We respect your decision to leave Google as a result, and we are accepting your resignation.&#8221;</p>
<p>That email, according to Gebru, went on to say that &#8220;certain aspects of the email you sent last night to non-management employees in the brain group reflect behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I said here are the conditions. If you can meet them great I’ll take my name off this paper, if not then I can work on a last date. Then she sent an email to my direct reports saying she has accepted my resignation. So that is google for you folks. You saw it happen right here.</p>
<p>&mdash; Timnit Gebru (@timnitGebru) <a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334343577044979712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The email in question, <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical">obtained by Casey Newton</a>, discussed how Gebru was disappointed in how her organization had, &#8220;After all this talk,&#8221; only hired 14% or so women this year, she wrote. She pointed to how Samy Bengio, who leads a group of researchers inside the Google Brain team, hired 39% women but that there is no incentive for him to do so. She added:</p>
<blockquote><p>What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the “we need more mentorship” rather than “we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing” the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gebru&#8217;s email also discussed issues with silencing marginalized voices, how her expertise has been dismissed and how she&#8217;s felt gaslighted by Google.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to both Gebru and Google for comment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/google-s-co-head-of-ethical-ai-says-she-was-fired-over-email">As Bloomberg reported</a>, Gebru has been outspoken about the lack of diversity in tech as well as the injustices Black people in tech face. According to Bloomberg, Gebru believes Google let her go to signal to other workers that it&#8217;s not ok to speak up.</p>
<p>Gebru is a leading voice in the field of ethics and artificial intelligence. In 2018, Gebru collaborated with Joy Buolamwini, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, to study biases in facial recognition systems. <a href="http://gendershades.org/overview.html">They found</a> high disparities in error rates between lighter males and darker females, which led to the conclusion that those systems didn&#8217;t work well for people with darker skin.</p>
<p>Since Gebru&#8217;s announcement, she&#8217;s received an outpouring of support from those in the tech community.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">To be bold, to be honest, to know your worth, to speak up for others, to do the thankless work, to pioneer the way, to suffer no fools, to be all they could only wish to be, wrapped in black womanhood is an affront to those who would rather see us cower than own our power 1/n</p>

<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I thought this was a joke because it seemed ridiculous that anyone would fire <a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@timnitGebru</a> given her expertise, her skills, her influence.

This year, the company wants to expand that offering, and today it announced some updates to the program at the Partner keynote today at AWS re:Invent.</p>
<p>While startups technically have to pay a $2500 fee if they are accepted to the program, AWS typically refunds that fee, says Doug Yeum, head of the Global Partner Organization at AWS &#8212; and they get a lot of benefits for being part of the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the APN has a $2,500 annual program fee, startups that are accepted into the invite-only APN Global Startup Program get that fee back, as well as free access to substantial additional resources both in terms of funding as well as exclusive program partner managers and co-sell specialists resources,&#8221; Yeum told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And those benefits are pretty substantial including access to a new &#8220;white glove program&#8221; that lets them work with a program manager with direct knowledge of AWS and who has experience working with startups. In addition, participants get access to an ISV program to work more directly with these vendors to increase sales and access to data exchange services to move third party data into the AWS cloud.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s more, they can apply to the new AI/ML Acceleration program. As AWS describes it, &#8220;This includes up to $5,000 AWS credits to fund experiments on AWS services, enabling startups to explore AWS AI/ML tools that offer the best fit for them at low risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, they get partially free access to the AWS Marketplace, offsetting the normal marketplace listing fees for the first five offerings. Some participants will also get access to AWS sales to help use the power of the large company to drive a startup&#8217;s sales.</p>
<p>While you can apply to the program, the company also recruits individual startups that catch its attention. &#8220;We also proactively invite mid-to-late stage startups built on AWS that, based on market signals, are showing traction and offer interesting use cases for our mutual enterprise customers,&#8221; Yeum explained.</p>
<p>Among the companies currently involved in the program are HashiCorp, Logz.io and Snapdocs. Interested startups can apply on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/global-startup/">APN Global Startup website</a>.</p>

<p>Founder, CEO and CTO Pawan Kumar Chandana will join us to talk about building his new business, his prior experience developing rockets for the Indian <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">Space <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Research Organization (ISRO) and how Skyroot&#8217;s Vikram-series launch vehicles plan to achieve the company&#8217;s ambitious goals.</p>
<p>Bluefield Technologies is focused on an entirely different, but potentially just as impactful opportunity: Observation, monitoring and analysis of methane emissions data on Earth. Their satellite-based methane observation technology offer a new high bar of precision and detail.</p>
<p>Bluefield founder and CEO Yotam Ariel will join us to talk about what becomes possible across a range of industries once you offer them the ability to track up to 90% of the Earth&#8217;s methane emissions with pinpoint accuracy, at costs that are up to 100 percent cheaper than existing solutions on up to a daily basis.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have conversations with Chandana, Ariel and others as part of our &#8216;Founders in Focus&#8217; series, just one small part of the all-star agenda at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=spaceindustries&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=spaceindustriespost&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=spaceindustries&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=spaceindustriespost&amp;display=true">Tickets are still available at the Late Registration pric</a>e with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=spaceindustries&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=spaceindustriespost&amp;display=true">discounts for students, government/military employees and groups</a>, so grab yours below to attend this fully virtual event.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">VCs expect the companies they invest in to use data to improve their decision-making. So why aren’t they doing that when evaluating startup teams?</p>
<p>Sure, venture capital is a people business, and the power of gut feeling is real. But using an objective, data-backed process to evaluate teams — the same way we do when evaluating financial KPIs, product, timing and market opportunities — will help us make better investment decisions, avoid costly mistakes and discover opportunities we might have otherwise overlooked.</p>
<p>An objective assessment process will also help investors break free from patterns and back someone other than a white male for a change. Is looking at how we have always done things the best way to build for the future?</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0149206313493325">Sixty percent of startups fail because of problems with the team</a>. Instinct matters, but a team is too big a risk to leave to intuition. I will use myself as an example. I have founded two companies. I know what it takes to build a company and to achieve a successful exit. I like to think I can sense when someone has that special something and when a team has chemistry. But I am human. I am limited by bias and thought patterns; data is not.</p>
<p>You can (and should) take a scientific approach to evaluating a startup team. A “strong” team isn’t a vague concept — extensive research confirms what it takes to execute a vision. Despite what people expect, soft skills can be measured. VCVolt is a computerized selection model that analyzes the performance of companies and founding teams developed by Eva de Mol, Ph.D., my partner at CapitalT.</p>
<p>We use it to inform every investment decision we make and to demystify a common hurdle to entrepreneurial success. (The technology also evaluates the company, market opportunity, timing and other factors, but since most investors aren’t taking a structured, data-backed approach to analyzing teams, let’s focus on that.)</p>
<p>VCVolt allows us to reduce team risk early on in the selection and due diligence process, thereby reducing confirmation bias and fail rates, discovering more winning teams and driving higher returns.</p>
<p>I will keep this story brief for privacy reasons, but you will get the point. While testing the model, we advised another VC firm not to move forward with an investment based on the model’s findings. The firm moved forward anyway because they were in love with the deal, and everything the model predicted transpired. It was a big loss for the investors, and a reminder that hunch and gut feeling can be wrong — or at least blind you to some serious risk factors.</p>
<p>The platform uses a validated model that is based on more than five years of scientific research, data from more than 1,000 companies and input from world-class experts and scientists. Its predictive validity is noted in top-tier scientific journals and other publications, including<a href="https://hbr.org/2019/03/what-makes-a-successful-startup-team"> Harvard Business Review</a>. By asking the right questions — science-based questions validated by more than 80,000 datapoints — the platform analyzes the likelihood that a team will succeed. It considers:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

With this, project managers and developers will be able to get deeper insights into the code teams are working on, for example, and where that code is in the deployment pipeline. Users of Jira Software Premium will also be able to track deployment frequency and cycle times right inside of the service now, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the quest to reach that near-mythical land of &#8216;insights,&#8217; many teams mistake consolidation for control. But the challenge is not the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">number</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of tools; it’s the way they&#8217;re integrated,&#8221; the Jira team writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;No single vendor will ever deliver all the products an agile software team needs, so the burden still lies on the team to manually connect the dots.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082569" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082569" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2082569" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png" alt="" width="1024" height="666" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png 3088w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=1536,999 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=2048,1332 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2082569" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This update, Atlassian argues, helps those teams do just that. For most teams, Jira is already the central repository where each piece of work is documented in some form or another, after all. Some of that work happens in Atlassian tools, but most of it happens in the context of third-party services. The idea here is to pull all of this DevOps work together and provide more visibility and insights into the state of a company&#8217;s development pipeline.</p>
<p>Specifically, there are four different updates here. The first is &#8216;code in Jira,&#8217; which may sound like you can now code inside of Jira, but in reality, it&#8217;s about seeing which repos in B<span style="font-weight: 400;">itbucket, GitHub, GitLab or Git Integration for Jira are currently actively worked on. With the new &#8216;deployments&#8217; feature, users can now get a real-time view of all of their deployment information across CI/CD services like Bitbucket Pipelines, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, Circle CI, Octopus Deploy and JFrog.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Whether you’re a product manager looking to see which features have deployed to which environment or a team lead looking to understand the average time it takes for your team to go from idea to production within a certain project, you’ll find your answer in the Deployments in Jira tab,&#8221; the company explains.</p>
<p>The last two features, only available in the pricier and more enterprisey <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/pricing">Jira Software Premium</a>, will soon provide more in-depth metrics about deployment frequency and cycle times. The idea here is simply to provide more metrics to help teams better understand trends and identify outliers in their processes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you want to make a machine learning system, you need data for it, but that data isn&#8217;t always easy to come by. <a href="https://mlcommons.org/">MLCommons</a> aims to unite disparate companies and organizations in the creation of large public databases for AI training, so that researchers around the world can work together at higher levels, and in doing so advance the nascent field as a whole. Its first effort, the People&#8217;s Speech dataset, is many times the size of others like it, and aims to be more diverse as well.</p>
<p>MLCommons is a new non-profit related to <a href="https://www.mlperf.org">MLPerf</a>, which has collected input from dozens of companies and academic institutions to create industry-standard benchmarks for machine learning performance. The endeavor has met with success, but in the process the team encountered a paucity of open datasets that everyone could use.</p>
<p>If you want to do an apples-to-apples comparison of a Google model to an Amazon model, or for that matter a UC Berkeley model, they really all ought to be using the same testing data. With computer vision one of the most widespread datasets is ImageNet, which is used and cited by all the most influential papers and experts. But there&#8217;s no such dataset for, say, speech to text accuracy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Benchmarks get people talking about progress in a sensible, measurable way. And it turns out that if the goal is the move the industry forward, we need datasets we can use — but lots of them are difficult to use for licensing reasons, or aren&#8217;t state of the art,&#8221; said MLCommons co-founder and executive director David Kanter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hHHo4RuDeB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/microsoft-amazon-back-a-socal-company-making-microchips-specifically-for-voice-based-apps/">Microsoft, Amazon back a SoCal company making microchips specifically for voice-based apps</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft, Amazon back a SoCal company making microchips specifically for voice-based apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/microsoft-amazon-back-a-socal-company-making-microchips-specifically-for-voice-based-apps/embed/#?secret=hHHo4RuDeB" data-secret="hHHo4RuDeB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Certainly the big companies have enormous voice datasets of their own, but they&#8217;re proprietary and perhaps legally restricted from being used by others. And there are public datasets, but with only a few thousand hours their utility is limited — to be competitive today one needs much more than that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building large datasets is great because we can create benchmarks, but it also moves the needle forward for everyone. We can&#8217;t rival what&#8217;s available internally but we can go a long way towards bridging that gap,&#8221; Kanter said. MLCommons is the organization they formed to create and wrangle the required data and connections.</p>
<p>The People&#8217;s Speech Dataset was assembled from a variety of sources, with about 65,000 of its hours coming from audiobooks in English, with the text aligned with the audio. Then there are 15,000 hours or so sourced from around the web, with different acoustics, speakers, and styles of speech (for example conversational instead of narrative). 1,500 hours of English audio were sourced from Wikipedia, and then 5,000 hours of synthetic speech of text generated by GPT-2 were mixed in (&#8220;A little bit of the snake eating its own tail,&#8221; joked Kanter). 59 languages in total are represented in some way, though as you can tell it is mostly English.</p>
<p>Although diversity is the goal — you can&#8217;t build a virtual assistant in Portuguese from English data — it&#8217;s also important to establish a baseline for what&#8217;s needed for present purposes. Is 10,000 hours sufficient to build a decent speech-to-text model? Or does having 20,000 available make development that much easier, faster, or effective? What if you want to be excellent at American English but also decent with Indian and English accents? How much of <em>those</em> do you need?</p>

<p>The general consensus with datasets is simply &#8220;the larger the better,&#8221; and the likes of Google and Apple are working with far more than a few thousand hours. Thus the 86,000 hours in this first iteration of the dataset. And it is definitely the first of many, with later versions due to branch out into more languages and accents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we verify we can deliver value, we&#8217;ll just release and be honest about the state it&#8217;s in,&#8221; explained Peter Mattson, another co-founder of MLCommons and currently head of Google&#8217;s Machine Learning Metrics Group. &#8220;We also need to learn how to quantify the idea of diversity. The industry wants this; we need more dataset construction expertise — there&#8217;s tremendous ROI for everybody in supporting such an organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization is also hoping to spur sharing and innovation in the field with MLCube, a new standard for passing models back and forth that takes some of the guesswork and labor out of that process. Although machine learning is one of the tech sector&#8217;s most active areas of research and development, taking your AI model and giving to someone else to test, run, or modify isn&#8217;t as simple as it ought to be.</p>
<p>Their idea with MLCube is a wrapper for models that describes and standardizes a few things, like dependencies, input and output format, hosting and so on. AI may be fundamentally complex, but it and the tools to create and test it are still in their infancy.</p>
<p>The dataset should be available now, or soon, from <a href="https://mlcommons.org/">MLCommons&#8217; website</a>, under the CC-BY license, allowing for commercial use; a few reference models trained on the set will also be released.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Launching things to space doesn&#8217;t have to mean firing a large rocket vertically using massive amounts of rocket-fuel-powered thrust &#8212; startup <a href="https://www.aevumspace.com">Aevum</a> breaks the mould in multiple ways, with an innovative launch vehicle design that combines uncrewed aircraft with horizontal take-off and landing capabilities, with a secondary stage that deploys at high altitude and can take small payloads the rest of the way to space.</p>
<p>Aevum&#8217;s model actually isn&#8217;t breaking much new ground in terms of its foundational technology, according to founder and CEO Jay Skylus, with whom I spoke prior to today&#8217;s official unveiling of the startup&#8217;s Ravn X launch vehicle. Skylus, who previously worked for a range of space industry household names and startups, including NASA, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boeing-7321" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boeing-7321">Boeing, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Moon Express and Firefly, told me the startup has focused primarily on making the most of existing available technologies to create a mostly reusable, fully automated small payload orbital delivery system.</p>
<p>To his point, Ravn X doesn&#8217;t look too dissimilar from existing jet aircraft, and bears obvious resemblance to the Predator line of UAVs already in use for terrestrial uncrewed flight. The vehicle is 80 feet long, and has a 60-foot wingspan, with a total max weight of 55,000 lbs including payload. Seventy percent of the system is fully reusable today, and Skylus says the goal is to iterate on that to the point where 95% of the launch system will be reusable in the relatively near future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2082461" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082461" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2082461" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082461" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aevum</p></div></p>
<p>Ravn X&#8217;s delivery system is designed for rapid response delivery, and is able to get small satellites to orbit in as little as 180 minutes &#8212; with the capability of having it ready to fly and deliver another again fairly shortly after that. It uses traditional jet fuel, the same kind used on commercial airliners, and it can take off and land in &#8220;virtually any weather,&#8221; according to Skylus. It also takes off and lands on any one-mile stretch of traditional aircraft runway, meaning it can theoretically use just about any active airport in the world as a launch and landing site.</p>
<p>One of they key defining differences of Aevum relative to other space launch startups is that what they&#8217;re presenting isn&#8217;t theoretical, or in development &#8212; the Ravn X already has paying customers, including over $1 billion in U.S. government contracts. Its first mission is with the U.S. Space Force, the ASLON-45 small satellite launch mission (set for late 2021), and it also has a contract for 20 missions spanning nine years with the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center. Deliveries of Aevum&#8217;s production launch vehicles to its customers have already begun, in fact, Skylus says.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Defense has for quite some time now been actively pursuing space launch options that provide it with responsive, short turnaround launch capabilities. That&#8217;s the same goal of companies like Astra, which was originally looking to win the DARPA challenge for such systems (since expired) with its Rocket small launcher. Aevum&#8217;s system has the added advantage of being essentially fully compatible with existing airfield infrastructure &#8212; and also of not requiring that human pilots be involved or at risk at all, as they are with the superficially similar launch model espoused by Virgin Orbit.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HtCFZyc9wR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/astra-targets-december-for-next-orbital-launch-attempt/">Astra targets December for next orbital launch attempt</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Astra targets December for next orbital launch attempt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/astra-targets-december-for-next-orbital-launch-attempt/embed/#?secret=HtCFZyc9wR" data-secret="HtCFZyc9wR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Aevum isn&#8217;t just providing the Ravn X launcher, either; its goal is to handle end-to-end logistics for launch services, including payload transportation and integration, which are parts of the process that Skylus says are often overlooked or underserved by existing launch providers, and that many companies creating payloads also don&#8217;t realize are costly, complicated and time-consuming parts of actually delivering a working small satellite to orbit. The startup also isn&#8217;t &#8220;re-inventing the wheel&#8221; when it comes to its integration services &#8212; Skylus says they&#8217;re working with a range of existing partners that all already have proven experience doing this work but haven&#8217;t previously had the motivation or the need to provide these kinds of services to the customers that Skylum sees coming online, both in the public and private sector.</p>
<p>The need isn&#8217;t for another <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Skylus says; rather, thanks to SpaceX, there&#8217;s a wealth of aerospace companies that previously worked almost exclusively with large government contracts and the one or two massive legacy rocket companies to put missions together. They&#8217;re now open to working with the greatly expanded market for orbital payloads, including small satellites that aim to provide cost-effective solutions in communications, environmental monitor, shipping and defense.</p>
<p>Aevum&#8217;s solution definitely sounds like it addresses a clear and present need, in a way that offers benefits in terms of risk profile, reusability, cost and flexibility. The company&#8217;s first active missions will obviously be watched closely, by potential customers and competitors alike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google announced this morning Android phones will receive an update this winter that will bring some half-dozen new features to devices, including improvements to apps like Gboard, Google Play Books, Voice Access, Google Maps, Android Auto and Nearby Share. The release is the latest in a series of update bundles that now allow Android devices to receive new features outside of the usual annual update cycle.</p>
<p>The bundles may not deliver Android&#8217;s latest flagship features, but they offer steady improvements on a more frequent basis.</p>
<p>One of the more fun bits in the winter update will include a change to &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/googles-gboard-introduces-emoji-kitchen-a-tool-to-mash-up-emojis-to-use-as-stickers/">Emoji Kitchen</a>,&#8221; the feature in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Gboard</a> keyboard app that lets users combine their favorite emoji to create new ones that can be shared as customized stickers. To date, users have remixed emoji more than 3 billion times since the feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/googles-gboard-introduces-emoji-kitchen-a-tool-to-mash-up-emojis-to-use-as-stickers/">launched</a> earlier this year, Google says. Now, the option is being expanded. Instead of offering hundreds of design combinations, it will offer more than 14,000. You&#8217;ll also be able to tap two emoji to see suggested combinations or double tap on one emoji to see other suggestions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This updated feature had been live in the Gboard <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.inputmethod.latin">beta</a> app, but will now roll out to Android 6.0 and above devices in the weeks ahead.</p>

<p>Another update will expand audiobook availability on Google Play Books. Now, Google will auto-generate narrations for books that don&#8217;t offer an audio version. The company says it worked with publishers in the U.S. and U.K. to add these auto-narrated books to Google Play Books. The feature is in beta but will roll out to all publishers in early 2021.</p>
<p>An accessibility feature that lets people use and navigate their phone with voice commands, Voice Access, will also be improved. The feature will soon leverage machine learning to understand interface labels on devices. This will allow users to refer to things like the &#8220;back&#8221; and &#8220;more&#8221; buttons, and many others by name when they are speaking.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.voiceaccess&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">new version of Voice Access</a>, now in beta, will be available to all devices worldwide running Android 6.0 or higher.</p>
<p>An update for Google Maps will add a new feature to one of people&#8217;s most-used apps.</p>
<p>In a new (perhaps Waze-inspired) &#8220;Go Tab,&#8221; users will be able to more quickly navigate to frequently visited places &#8212; like a school or grocery store, for example &#8212; with a tap. The app will allow users to see directions, live traffic trends and disruptions on the route, and gives an accurate ETA, without having to type in the actual address. Favorite places &#8212; or in the case of public transit users, specific routes &#8212; can be pinned in the Go Tab for easy access. Transit users will be able to see things like accurate departure and arrival times, alerts from the local transit agency, and an up-to-date ETA.</p>

<p>One potentially helpful use case for this new feature would be to pin both a transit route and driving route to the same destination, then compare their respective ETAs to pick the faster option.</p>
<p>This feature is coming to both Google Maps on Android as well as iOS in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p><a href="http://android.com/auto">Android Auto</a> will expand to more countries over the next few months. Google initially said it would reach 36 countries, but then updated the announcement language as the timing of the rollout was pushed back. The company now isn&#8217;t saying how many countries will gain access in the months to follow or which ones, so you&#8217;ll need stay tuned for news on that front.</p>

<p>The final change is to <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/nearby-share/">Nearby Share</a>, the proximity-based sharing feature that lets users share things like links, files, photos and and more even when they don&#8217;t have a cellular or Wi-Fi connection available. The feature, which is largely designed with emerging markets in mind, will now allow users to share apps from Google Play with people around them.</p>
<p>To do so, you&#8217;ll access a new &#8220;Share Apps&#8221; menu in &#8220;Manage Apps &amp; Games&#8221; in the Google Play app. This feature will roll out in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Some of these features will begin rolling out today, so you may receive them earlier than a time frame of several &#8220;weeks,&#8221; but the progress of each update will vary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has always gone out of its way to build features for users with disabilities, and VoiceOver on iOS is an invaluable tool for anyone with a vision impairment — assuming every element of the interface has been manually labeled. But the company just unveiled a brand new feature that uses machine learning to identify and label every button, slider and tab automatically.</p>
<p>Screen Recognition, available now in iOS 14, is a computer vision system that has been trained on thousands of images of apps in use, learning what a button looks like, what icons mean and so on. Such systems are very flexible — depending on the data you give them, they can become expert at spotting cats, facial expressions or, as in this case, the different parts of a user interface.</p>
<p>The result is that in any app now, users can invoke the feature and a fraction of a second later every item on screen will be labeled. And by &#8220;every,&#8221; they mean <em>every</em> — after all, screen readers need to be aware of every thing that a sighted user would see and be able to interact with, from images (which iOS has been able to create one-sentence summaries of for some time) to common icons (home, back) and context-specific ones like &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; menus that appear just about everywhere.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea is not to make manual labeling obsolete — developers know best how to label their own apps, but updates, changing standards and challenging situations (in-game interfaces, for instance) can lead to things not being as accessible as they could be.</p>

<p>I chatted with Chris Fleizach from Apple&#8217;s iOS accessibility engineering team, and Jeff Bigham from the AI/ML accessibility team, about the origin of this extremely helpful new feature. (It&#8217;s described in a paper due to be presented next year.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082611" style="width: 338px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082611" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2082611" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg" alt="A phone showing a photo of two women smiling and voiceover describing the photo" width="328" height="326" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg 656w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=300,298 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2082611" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Apple</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We looked for areas where we can make inroads on accessibility, like image descriptions,&#8221; said Fleizach. &#8220;In iOS 13 we labeled icons automatically &#8212; Screen Recognition takes it another step forward. We can look at the pixels on screen and identify the hierarchy of objects you can interact with, and all of this happens on device within tenths of a second.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea is not a new one, exactly; Bigham mentioned a screen reader, Outspoken, which years ago attempted to use pixel-level data to identify UI elements. But while that system needed precise matches, the fuzzy logic of machine learning systems and the speed of iPhones&#8217; built-in AI accelerators means that Screen Recognition is much more flexible and powerful.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t have been possible just a couple of years ago — the state of machine learning and the lack of a dedicated unit for executing it meant that something like this would have been extremely taxing on the system, taking much longer and probably draining the battery all the while.</p>
<p>But once this kind of system seemed possible, the team got to work prototyping it with the help of their dedicated accessibility staff and testing community.</p>
<p>&#8220;VoiceOver has been the standard-bearer for vision accessibility for so long. If you look at the steps in development for Screen Recognition, it was grounded in collaboration across teams — Accessibility throughout, our partners in data collection and annotation, AI/ML, and, of course, design. We did this to make sure that our machine learning development continued to push toward an excellent user experience,&#8221; said Bigham.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qDm7GiKra28?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>It was done by taking thousands of screenshots of popular apps and games, then manually labeling them as one of several standard UI elements. This labeled data was fed to the machine learning system, which soon became proficient at picking out those same elements on its own.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as simple as it sounds — as humans, we&#8217;ve gotten quite good at understanding the intention of a particular graphic or bit of text, and so often we can navigate even abstract or creatively designed interfaces. It&#8217;s not nearly as clear to a machine learning model, and the team had to work with it to create a complex set of rules and hierarchies that ensure the resulting screen reader interpretation makes sense.</p>
<p>The new capability should help make millions of apps more accessible, or just accessible at all, to users with vision impairments. You can turn it on by going to Accessibility settings, then VoiceOver, then VoiceOver Recognition, where you can turn on and off image, screen and text recognition.</p>
<p>It would not be trivial to bring Screen Recognition over to other platforms, like the Mac, so don&#8217;t get your hopes up for that just yet. But the principle is sound, though the model itself is not generalizable to desktop apps, which are very different from mobile ones. Perhaps others will take on that task; the prospect of AI-driven accessibility features is only just beginning to be realized.</p>
