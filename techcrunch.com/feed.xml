										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What a rollercoaster day for China&#8217;s tech industry. TikTok&#8217;s parent company ByteDance has dissolved its strategic investment team, sending worrying messages to other internet giants that have expanded aggressively by investing in other companies.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, ByteDance reviewed its &#8220;businesses&#8217; needs&#8221; and decided to &#8220;reduce investments in areas that are not key business focuses,&#8221; a company spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>ByteDance isn&#8217;t halting external investments outright, though; instead, the investment team will be &#8220;restructured&#8221; and &#8220;integrated across the various business lines to support the growth&#8221; of its business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259409" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In other words, some members from its strategic investment team, which has backed <a href="https://www.itjuzi.com/company_map/bytedance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">169 companies</a> by far, according to Chinese startup database IT Juzi (some deals may not be public), will be reassigned roles in other business departments and continue to invest there.</p>
<p>The &#8220;restructuring&#8221; still stirred up a wave of panic in the industry. China&#8217;s cyberspace regulator has drafted new guidelines that will require its &#8220;internet behemoths&#8221; to get its approval before undertaking any investments or fundraisings, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-cyberspace-regulator-drafts-new-rules-internet-behemoths-sources-2022-01-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters reported citing sources</a>. Some Chinese media outlets also reported similar drafted rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;Behemoths&#8221; refer to any internet platform with more than 100 million users or more than 10 billion yuan ($1.58 billion) in revenue, said Reuters&#8217; sources. That rule, if true, will put a slew of Chinese internet giants, from Tencent, Alibaba, Pinduoduo, JD.com to Baidu, under regulatory review for their investment activities. Tencent in particular is famous for its expansive investment portfolio, which earns it the moniker &#8220;the SoftBank of China.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a surprising turn, China&#8217;s cyberspace regulator <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2022-01/19/c_1644194891665201.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the &#8220;rumored guidelines for internet companies&#8217; IPO, investment and fundraising are untrue.&#8221; Furthermore, the authority will &#8220;investigate and hold relevant rumormongers responsible in accordance with the law.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ByteDance&#8217;s motive for restructuring may indeed be to generate more synergies between its external investments and internal businesses. We don&#8217;t know for sure yet. But there are signs that China&#8217;s antitrust action on its internet darlings are nowhere near the end.</p>
<p>Tencent recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/tencent-divestment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold a great chunk of its shares</a> in two of its most important allies, Chinese online retailer JD.com and Singaporean video games and e-commerce conglomerate Sea. While antitrust pressure wasn&#8217;t cited as the causes for its divestments, speculation is rife that China is continuing to blunt the monopolistic power of its largest interent platforms. A handful of them have<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/china-gets-serious-about-antitrust-fines-alibaba-2-75b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> received various degrees of fines</a> for violating anti-competition rules, but a pause on their investment game will carry much greater consequences. The question now is who&#8217;s next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last year, Netflix’s new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/netflix-launches-games-to-iphone-and-ipad-users-worldwide/">gaming service</a> became globally available across both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/netflix-launches-games-to-iphone-and-ipad-users-worldwide/">iOS</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/netflix-games-are-coming-to-all-members-on-android-starting-this-week/">Android</a> with a debut lineup that included two “Stranger Things”-themed games and a few casual games. Netflix has now expanded its lineup with two more casual games that are rolling out globally for both iOS and Android users.</p>
<p>The first game is called Arcanium: Rise of Akhan and is an open-world single-player card strategy game. The game was developed by Rogue Games. Netflix says the game merges the roguelike and deckbuilding genres in new ways. The goal is to create a team of heroes and embark on a journey to defeat Akhan the Calamity and save the world of Arzu from destruction. If one person on your team succumbs to corruption, the game ends.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Netflix&#8217;s second new title is called Krispee Street and was developed by Frosty Pop. The goal of the puzzle game is to bring the characters and world of Krispee to life by finding hundreds of characters and objects scattered throughout the levels. The game is based on a popular webcomic called Krispee.</p>
<p>The streaming giant&#8217;s gaming lineup now includes 12 titles, including Bowling Ballers, Shooting Hoops, Teeter Up, Asphalt Xtreme, Stranger Things 1984, Stranger Things 3, Card Blast, Dominos Cafe, Wonderputt Forever and Knittens.</p>
<p>To access the titles on Android, you need to tap on the new Games tab in the Netflix app for Android where the games are listed. After selecting a title, users are directed to the Google Play Store to install the games, as you would any other app. Once the games are downloaded, they are available to play at any time by tapping them within the Netflix app or on the home screen of an Android device. For iOS, Netflix is using a similar system where users are directed to Apple’s App Store for downloads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Longer-term, Netflix has plans to expand its gaming catalog with other additions and gaming genres. For instance, the streaming giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-acquires-its-first-games-studio-oxenfree-developer-night-school/">acquired</a> independent game developer Night School Studio in September, best known for narrative-driven titles like Oxenfree, to further build out its library of Netflix games.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few years back there was debate in the tech market concerning the growth of low- and no-code apps and services. A global shortage in developer talent was part of the impetus behind building software that made creating software simpler, but there were some who viewed no- and low-code tools as merely very good ways to create more, newly exciting technical debt.</p>
<p>In the last year or so, I&#8217;ve noticed that such conversations have died down, while companies building products replete with lower-code capabilities that empower non-technical folks have been trucking right along.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.softr.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Softr</a> is a good example of the trend, with the startup raising $13.5 million in a Series A that it announced this week. TechCrunch<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/softr/"> covered the startup&#8217;s seed round</a> in early 2021, when Softr put together $2.2 million in external funds.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259392" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s Series A was led by FirstMarket Capital and participated in by a host of individuals from around the technology world. I caught wind of the deal a little while ago thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ashleymayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashley Mayer</a>, who did stints at Box and Glossier. AtlanticLabs, which put capital into the company previously, also participated in the Softr Series A.</p>
<p>What does it do? The Berlin-based startup lets customers build apps atop Airtable databases. But it has pretty big aspirations beyond that current remit.</p>
<p>In an interview with Softr CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/mariam_hakobyan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mariam Hakobyan</a>, TechCrunch learned that the company intends to expand the sorts of databases that can be leveraged to create apps using its software. It also intends to create a marketplace for both components (to extend what Softr can do beyond official capabilities), and templates (whole-cloth apps out of the box, by our understanding).</p>
<p>Hakobyan said Softr intends to become an ecosystem in time. Adding support for Google Sheets and other data sources will help in that work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company thinks that it is swimming downstream, with no-code services &#8220;just taking over,&#8221; Hakobyan said.</p>
<p>She cited a few trends regarding why no-code services &#8212; and, I would add, lower-code services more generally &#8212; are performing so well in today&#8217;s software market. The first is that there are not enough developers in the market today to meet demand. That&#8217;s well-understood. Her other argument was generational in nature. Per Hakobyan, GenZ is more tech-savvy than prior generations, less interested in snagging a traditional day job, and looking for ways to build their own tools and the like.</p>
<p>GenZ as a no-code accelerant makes sense in my head, even if I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on why &#8212; something for us to keep an eye on in coming quarters.</p>
<p>How is Softr performing in-market? The company is very young in terms of time in market with its product, so we can&#8217;t really hammer it too hard on year-over-year growth metrics, but it did share some early data. The company has 30,000 registered users today and has more than 1,000 paying customers. Its main customers, it disclosed, are small and mid-sized businesses, which makes sense, as those are the firms perhaps most likely to be priced out of today&#8217;s competitive developer market.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be curious to see how quickly Softr can bring more data sources to its service, and how rapidly it can roll out its planned marketplace. From that point, the market will decide if Softr is destined to become an ecosystem or not.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In nine years as a VC, I have seen many founders misinterpret the standard advice to ask potential investors questions during pitch meetings.</p>
<p>Frequently, these questions can derail, distract, and make investors feel defensive. To avoid this, I train founders in a strategy inspired by my experience as a high school math teacher which focuses on building rapport, maintaining constant engagement and creating a shared reality. The key is the effective use of low cognitive load questioning.</p>
<p>In other words: only ask investors easy questions.</p>
<p>Let’s say your company is a paper mache startup. As a generalist investor, one of the worst ways you could start a meeting is by asking me to share my thesis on the paper mache industry. I don’t have one, so as soon as you ask that question, my cortisol levels will rise like a nervous student who didn’t do his homework and just got called on by the teacher.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Save the challenging questions for when you&#8217;re selecting from multiple investors who are ready to write checks after you&#8217;ve convinced them your company is fundable.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I will then proceed to save face by making up the smartest-sounding stuff I can on the fly. But I will know deep down that whatever I just said was a load of nonsense, and on a subconscious level, my brain work towards getting this meeting over with as soon as possible to avoid further callouts.</p>
<p>If you were hoping I would invest in your company, this is a bad place for us to be. Save the challenging questions for a time when you&#8217;re selecting from multiple investors who are ready to write checks after you&#8217;ve convinced them your company is fundable. In your initial discussions, ask easy questions. These can begin with simple yes/nos.</p>
<p>Asking students easy questions is one of the engagement tricks I learned as a math teacher: If I made them think too much at first, I would often get blank stares and no responses. But if I asked a relatively easy question, like “What is opposite of addition?” I’d get an answer immediately. Approach an investor pitch similarly.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st also received investments from Avenir and Google;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s the latter’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/googles-africa-investment-fund-makes-first-investment-in-ugandas-safeboda/">second check</a> from its Africa Investment Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of prominent individual investors, including</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the founders of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chipper Cash</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sky Mavis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yield Guild Games, took part</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259396" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round &#8212; which is an extension of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/riot-games-and-konvoy-ventures-back-games-publisher-carry1st-in-6m-series-a/">Series A Carry1st raised last May</a> from Riot Games, Konvoy Ventures, Raine Ventures and TTV Capital &#8212; also saw the same investors double down on their investments in the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz general partners</span><a href="https://a16z.com/author/david-haber/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">David Haber</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://a16z.com/author/jonathan-lai/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Lai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will join Carry1st’s board as observers. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cordelrc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cordel Robbin-Coker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucyhoffman08/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucy Hoffman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinotenda-mundangepfupfu-3333b915/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tinotenda Mundangepfupfu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founded Carry1st in 2018. The South Africa-based company, which currently has a team of 37 people across 18 countries, wants to use this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capital to scale interactive content across Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company started as a game studio where it conceptualized, developed (from system designs to artwork and engineering), and launched mobile games. Over time, it switched to a hybrid model, adopting a publishing role and handling distribution, marketing and operations.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st co-founder and chief executive Robbin-Coker told TechCrunch that Carry1st has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on its publishing arm since it went hybrid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three-year-old company has signed publishing deals for seven games from six studios globally, including</span><a href="https://www.tiltingpoint.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tilting Point</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, publisher of Nickelodeon’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpongeBob: Krusty Cook-Off</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which Carry1st recently launched in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others include</span><a href="https://www.crazylabs.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">CrazyLabs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Sweden’s</span><a href="https://www.newswire.com/news/carry1st-and-raketspel-sign-global-publishing-deal-21342559"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Raketspel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a studio with over 120 million downloads across its portfolio</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st said it provides a full-stack publishing solution, handling user acquisition, live operations, community management and monetization for its partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a full-suite service that starts with distribution and partnerships. We help them create bespoke marketing materials from short-form advertising videos to statics, and we customize their content to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">resonate with individuals in different countries,” said Robbin-Coker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And then we operate the game and we also monetize. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we’ve built out our monetization engine </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow users to be able to pay for content that they want more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also enhances monetization in the region through its embedded payments solutions, where customers can pay via a range of local payment options, including bank transfers, crypto and mobile money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after closing its Series A round, Carry1st launched its online marketplace for virtual goods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On this marketplace, called <a href="https://shop.carry1st.com/">Carry1st Shop</a>, users of a Carry1st game can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> virtual goods such as airtime, mobile data, entertainment vouchers, grocery store vouchers and gaming currency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Games revenue has increased 90% month-on-month since the second half of last year, the company said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s not unexpected considering the astonishing growth of games </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quantity and revenue (gaming apps accounted for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">nearly 70%</a> of all App Store revenue last year) on both Apple and Google stores since the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s online marketplace is noticing even faster growth, said Robbin-Coker, especially among users in South Africa and Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st will use this funding to expand its content portfolio, grow its product and engineering teams, and obtain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “tens of millions” of new users on the back of this revenue growth in its games and marketplace products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, the company said it intends to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more users by expanding into game co-development with studios</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is also eyeing the possibility of developing infrastructure to support play-to-earn gaming in Africa, thus venturing into web3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrency tokens such as SLP, AXS and MANA </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in play-to-earn games. They can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be withdrawn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a crypto wallet and traded for another cryptocurrency like bitcoin or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sold for fiat cash to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the real world. Carry1st wants to create on- and off-ramps (platforms that convert fiat into crypto and back) and accept crypto at point-of-sale in its marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Carry1st, we want to be the leading consumer internet company in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the best kind of wedge would be able to do that is a combination of gaming and micropayments and online commerce,” the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hese industries are being pretty </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disrupted or augmented with web3 and crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And as more gaming content starts to integrate with NFTs and cryptocurrencies, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there’s a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> big opportunity to partner with those studios the same way we partner with free-to-play studios.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is the next major growth market for gaming globally. The rapid tech adoption from its 1.1 billion millennials and GenZs is a significant driver for this. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st released a report last year with Newzoo showing that the number of games in sub-Saharan Africa will increase by 275% in the next decade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Gaming revenues </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are projected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see a 728% increase in the same period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These stats present a much bigger addressable market than what Carry1st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> envisioned when it launched four years ago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with the company’s converging at the intersection of gaming, fintech and web3, there is a broader set of opportunities (which we can see in other emerging markets) to go after in Africa. It’s one factor that piqued a16z’s interest in the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are delighted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be making our first investment in an Africa-headquartered company in Carry1st, a next-generation mobile games and fintech platform,” Haber said in a statement. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see immense opportunity for the company to mirror outstanding successes we’ve seen in markets like India, China, and Southeast Asia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We couldn’t be more thrilled to partner with founders Cordel, Lucy, Tino, and the Carry1st team on their mission to build the Garena of Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seemingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intentional about the investors it brought into this round, especially as it looks to move deep in gaming, web3 and fintech across Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of the largest crypto-centric funds, at over $3 billion, a16z brings unmatched expertise in gaming and web3. Google, via its products and phones, will help Carry1st deepen penetration and engagement in Africa. At the same time, Avenir continues to make a big push in African fintech following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">big-sized check</a> in Flutterwave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the individual investors, Nas has been fairly prolific with his crypto investments, and Axie Infinity founders own the world’s biggest web3 gaming company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a heavyweight group. We’re excited, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that their combination will be beneficial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for us. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s a sign that we’re on the right track and this helps drive strategic partnerships for us in the future,” said Robbin-Coker</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the streaming market grows, so has the demand for content. But even though it&#8217;s now easier than ever for filmmakers to create, distribution is still often controlled by traditional systems &#8212; meaning many filmmakers are still being shut out of Hollywood if they don&#8217;t have the right connections. A company called <a href="https://filmhub.com/">Filmhub</a> is working to solve this problem by making distribution easier and more efficient, via technology. With its platform, filmmakers can directly distribute to over 100 streaming channels, including big names like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, IMDb TV, TCL, Tubi, Plex, and others.</p>
<p>Today, Filmhub is announcing a $6.8 million seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).</p>
<p>Other participants in the round include 8VC, FundersClub, Eleven Prime, Tara Viswanathan (CEO of Rupa Health), Nick Greenfield (CEO of Candid), David Fraga (former COO of InVision), and Jerrod Engelberg (CEO of Codecov).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259040" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Filmhub got its start in 2016 as a side project by co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/klausbadelt/">Klaus Badelt</a>, an L.A.-based film composer who has worked on over 100 titles over the years, including &#8220;The Thin Red Line,&#8221; &#8220;Gladiator,&#8221; &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,&#8221; and <a href="http://klausbadelt.com/">others</a>. He had seen the opportunity in the space as the cost of production decreased and more films were getting made, but weren&#8217;t able to get strong distribution. Badelt later teamed up with tech industry veteran, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alandescragnolle/">Alan d&#8217;Escragnolle</a>, who had previously worked at places like Square, Mint.com, and Google, to take the project full-time in 2020. </span></p>
<p>Since then, Filmhub has been focused on growing the business, adding streaming channels as partners, and bringing on more filmmakers who want an easier way to have their work discovered by an audience, without having to give up their rights.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259081" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259081" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2259081" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="281" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png 3306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=300,124 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=768,318 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=680,281 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=1536,636 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=2048,847 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259081" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Filmhub</p></div></p>
<p>Filmhub begins by first interviewing the filmmakers to ensure their content meets the technical specifications of the streamers it works with. The company will then get that content up on as many streaming services as possible using automated technology and its own sales team. Though its name is &#8220;Filmhub,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">d&#8217;Escragnolle clarifies this content doesn&#8217;t have to just be full-length movies. It can also be serialized content like TV shows, shorts, or any sort of professionally-produced content. But its focus is on working directly with the filmmakers, he says. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the traditional studio system doesn&#8217;t end up being the most friendly to filmmakers. For instance, if you make a studio film as a filmmaker, you&#8217;re typically paid upfront so that deal,&#8221; explains <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">d&#8217;Escragnolle. </span>But if the film takes off, the filmmaker may not be able to share in the revenues their work earns, he points out. &#8220;We believe that there&#8217;s an opportunity to restore power to the to the creator and the original filmmaker, and allow them to build a library of their own,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">d&#8217;Escragnolle adds. </span></p>
<p>In a way, what Filmhub is doing is similar to what other distribution platforms &#8212; like DistroKid &#8212; have done for the music industry, as they&#8217;ve allowed artists to upload their work directly to top streaming services instead of having to first sign a deal with a label.</p>
<p>One of Filmhub&#8217;s more recent partnerships is with Struum, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/struum-launches-its-classpass-for-streaming-service-to-the-public/">the ClassPass-like streaming service that aggregates content</a> from smaller video services under its own subscription. Filmhub has been working with Struum to help filmmakers participating in the Slamdance Film Festival gain distribution for their work. Struum will carry each Slamdance Films title exclusively for three months, and filmmakers will receive 100% of their earnings on Filmhub and Struum for the first year, as a part of the deal.</p>
<p>Typically, Filmhub takes a 20% revenue share of the royalties made by the films it distributes. However, the rates each streaming service pays Filmhub will vary.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259082" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259082" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2259082" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg 2342w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=2048,1158 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259082" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Filmhub</p></div></p>
<p>Though the company isn&#8217;t sharing its revenue figures, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">d&#8217;Escragnolle says revenue has increased by 3x year-over-year, and it has grown from distributing thousands of titles to now 10,000 titles. Its content reaches over 100 streaming channels. With the data it has on hand, the company is also able to help its streaming partners better determine what sort of content will best perform on its services. This, in turn, can help close deals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Not all the content Filmhub distributes is new. Some films may be modern, like Torsten Hoffmann&#8217;s  2020 documentary, &#8220;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9203586/">Cryptopia &#8212; Bitcoin, Blockchains, and The Future of the Internet</a>,&#8221; for example. But older content, like the 2014 title &#8220;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2246565/">An Honest Liar</a>,&#8221; about magician James Randi, can also see a strong second life when they hit the streaming platforms. According to </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">d&#8217;Escragnolle, Filmhub is distributing classics from the 50&#8217;s, 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s, as well, which it considers &#8220;evergreen.&#8221; These sorts of movies and TV shows may not have ever gained traction on television today, but can take off on streaming services where they&#8217;re able to connect with different audiences. </span></p>
<p>In time, Filmhub aims to launch its own direct-to-consumer streaming service which will feature the filmmakers&#8217; content. It hopes to make this service available across devices and even as an add-on within other companies&#8217; existing streaming platforms. The company is hiring for this project now, along with others in engineering, technical operations, and sales, as a result of the funding, to grow its team of now just 35 people.</p>
<p>&#8220;In today&#8217;s market, unless you’re an established filmmaker, it can be very difficult to have your work discovered. This is a missed opportunity for both streaming services and consumers alike, especially given the potential we&#8217;re seeing for more diverse and international content,&#8221; said Andrew Chen, General Partner at a16z, about his investment &#8220;By working to move the industry&#8217;s distribution model forward, Filmhub is creating a win-win-win for creatives, platforms and viewers globally,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday show, where we niche down to a single topic, think about a question and unpack the rest. This week, <a href="http://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> dared to refresh perhaps the most common conversation in startups these days: the ubiquity, and resulting irrelevance, of unicorns. Our big question wasn&#8217;t a simple one:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259070" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Do we care that the meaning of unicorns has been hollowed out?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The conversation ran the gamut, starting with information on unicorn creation rates, startup hit success and of course, funding booms leading to aforementioned ripple effects. The majority of our time was spent asking more meta questions about the moniker, like how the quality bar has changed for $1 billion dollar companies and why late-stage thinks it needs to act like early stage?</p>
<p>On TC+, we&#8217;ve recently written about the changing characteristics of unicorns, and how public markets may bring a not-so-private reckoning to tech&#8217;s stars.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there was ever a rubber-meets road moment for six-year-old app Gale Healthcare Solutions, it’s probably right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gale Healthcare Solutions, founded in 2016, matches nurses with available work shifts. A hospital or clinic posts available shifts, then nurses can peruse opportunities, claim open spots, and be paid the same day through the platform. This network of nurses now stretches to 40,000, CEO and founder Tony Braswell tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until this point, Gale Healthcare Solutions has been entirely self funded. But on Wednesday, the company announced a $60 million dollar growth equity investment from FTV capital. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have arguably the largest network of nurses in the United States for this for this type of platform,” Richard Liu, a partner at FTV Capital, tells TechCrunch. But the firm was also drawn to Gale because of Braswell’s own experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tony has been doing healthcare staffing for three decades and so he&#8217;s built up a ton of this industry domain knowledge,” Liu continues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braswell comes to Gale Healthcare Solutions after 30 years in healthcare staffing. He made phone calls, sent emails, and crafted texts constantly looking to fill temporary nursing shifts. But about six years ago, Braswell realized he was going about things the wrong way. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon comes to my house every day and the typical staffing company calls people every day. That&#8217;s not efficient. So we built technology,&#8221; Braswell says.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adequate nurse staffing is increasingly recognized as a major driver of patient well-being. For instance, </span><a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/26/7/559"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across acute care hospitals in England, Belgium, Ireland, Spain, Finland and Switzerland found that for every 10 percent reduction in the proportion of professional nurses at a hospital, resulted in an 11 percent increase in odds of death. </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMsa012247?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies from the US</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29455061/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Korea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have also linked higher nursing staff to better patient outcomes. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Findings like this have led to legislation in California, for instance, that actually mandates that hospitals maintain a </span><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2004/rpt/2004-r-0212.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of nurses per patient, depending on the type of care being provided. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you zoom out, there is also a clear shortage of nurses filling shifts in general. </span><a href="https://bhw.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bureau-health-workforce/data-research/nchwa-hrsa-nursing-report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2017 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the US Department of Health and Human Services projects that seven states will significant nursing shortages by 2030. California, for instance, is estimated to have a nursing shortage of over 44,000. Texas will have a shortage of 15,900, and New Jersey, a shortage of around 11,400 full-time nurses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 has only accelerated things as healthcare workers face immensely heavy patient loads on </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/the-mass-exodus-of-americas-health-care-workers/620713/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fewer physical and emotional resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are already staffing agencies geared towards filling the empty nurse shifts (estimates for the temporary healthcare worker market size </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/us-healthcare-staffing-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hover around</span></a> <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/01/14/2367100/0/en/Global-Healthcare-Staffing-Market-to-Reach-US-47-8-Billion-by-the-Year-2026.html#:~:text=The%20Healthcare%20Staffing%20market%20in,share%20in%20the%20global%20market."><span style="font-weight: 400;">19-20 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) But with a problem as pressing (and large) as nursing shortages, you’re likely to have more than tech-centric startup looking to solve it. And when it comes to matching nurses with shifts, there are other players in the space. Specifically IntelyCare, another app which matches nurses and shifts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braswell, through his experience, notes that being able to find positions quickly and easily is a big part of making it work as a temporary nurse. But the company is also looking to create a more stable form of gig work that offers certain perks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gale nurses are W-2 employees with the option of a healthcare benefits package. But Gale’s distinguishing characteristic is same-day pay. Braswell has been fronting the money to enable this feature (“there’s a lot of float there,” he notes). But he sees it as an essential piece of making Gale work for temporary healthcare staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t tell you how many nurses contact me personally, out of 40,000, who need $25 for gas money,” he says. Unfortunately, a lot of nurses are in that situation. This empowers that nurse to work when she wants to work, and get paid when she wants to get paid.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite fronting the money for same-day paychecks, both Liu and Braswell note that Gale Healthcare Solutions is currently profitable. The company earns revenue from taking a percentage of nurse earnings – though neither Braswell nor Liu would disclose the percentage. Though, says Liu, the fee is in line with “industry standard.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(That is something to note, as traditional healthcare staffing agencies have been </span><a href="https://www.aha.org/2021-11-15-white-house-urged-investigate-price-gouging-staffing-agencies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of price-gouging in response to the pandemic by some lawmakers. But Liu puts Gale’s position bluntly: “Gale never did that.”) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of Gale’s history and future growth, Branswell, as a founder, wasn’t initially interested in pursuing venture capital. But now, he feels the time is right, largely, for technical expertise and further connections. Liu also notes that FTV has focused on building out the technical capacity of Gale with this current round – specifically he’s looking to evolve the platform, and provide more tools for hospitals and nurses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, with that growing technology, it’s possible Gale might eye more than just nurse staffing. Braswell has his eyes set on expanding the idea of easily accessible, same-day-pay gig work across other jobs in healthcare facilities: like housekeeping, laundry or cooks. Liu, for his part, will also focus on expanding Gale’s network of 40,000 nurses into more states. They’re in about 38 right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With network models, you know, increased density increases the fill rates, right, which are important in this industry,” Liu says. </span></p>

<p>Instead of talking about what the public markets are doing and how their moves may impact startup valuations, we&#8217;re going to ask when VCs will hit the brakes.</p>

This resulted in the assembly of larger, more rapid venture capital funds, and larger, more rapid startup funding events.</p>
<p>The result of both was that startups got expensive as hell to buy into during their growth curve.</p>
<p>Not everyone is thrilled. Venture capitalists are hardly celebrating paying 75x, 150x, or even greater multiples for shares in nascent startups. But the game was set by rules external to the players, meaning that the venture crew has merely responded to in-market incentives in recent years.</p>
<p>The question before us &#8212; and it&#8217;s perhaps the most important question in startup land for the next few years &#8212; is what happens next. The incentives that venture capitalists followed for the last decade or so are finally changing, with the price of money expected to rise sharply this year (due to tightening monetary policy generally). This has led to the anticipated result &#8212; falling valuations for riskier stocks like richly valued technology shares.</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that there is an inverse relationship between the price of money (where interest rates are set by key central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve) and the value of startup <em>exit</em> prices.</p>
<p>This is simple to understand: Startups are priced first on hope (seed-stage), then momentum (Series A through C), and later by exit comps (late-stage). The startup exits that truly matter to venture funds tend to be post-late-stage, so we care most about how upstart tech companies are valued by their public market analogs. This means that more expensive money makes bonds and other, comparatively safer investments more valuable as startups lose in-market pricing power. So, up goes the price of money, down goes the exit value of startups.</p>
<p>This should impact earlier-stage startup prices in time, but we&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/software-stocks-give-up-even-more-ground/">tread that ground before</a>.</p>
<p>All that in hand, when will venture capitalists tap the brakes? From where I sit today, the answer is clearly <em>not yet</em>. This is for two reasons:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security — as in &#8220;hey you, you can&#8217;t go in there&#8221; — quickly becomes a complex, arguably impossible job once you get past a few buildings and cameras. Who can watch everywhere at once, and send someone in time to prevent a problem? <a href="https://ambient.ai/">Ambient.ai</a> isn&#8217;t the first to claim that AI can, but they may be the first to actually pull it off at scale — and they&#8217;ve raised $52 million to keep growing.</p>
<p>The problem with today&#8217;s processes is the sort of thing anybody can point out. If you&#8217;ve got a modern company or school campus with dozens or hundreds of cameras, they produce so much footage and data that even a dedicated security team will have trouble keeping up with it. As a consequence, not only are they likely to miss an important event as it happens, but they&#8217;re also up to their ears in false alarms and noise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Victims are always looking at the cameras, expecting that someone is coming to help them&#8230; but it just isn&#8217;t the case,&#8221; CEO and co-founder of Ambient.ai, Shikhar Shrestha, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Best case is you wait for the incident to happen, you go and pull the video, and you work from there. We have the cameras, we have the sensors, we have the officers — what&#8217;s missing is the brain in the middle.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259148" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Obviously Shrestha&#8217;s company is looking to provide the brain: a central visual processing unit for live security footage that can tell when something&#8217;s going wrong and immediately tell the right people. But without the bias that threatens such endeavors, and no facial recognition.</p>
<p>Others have made inroads on this particular idea before now, but so far none has seen serious adoption. The first generation of automatic image recognition, Shrestha said, was simple motion detection, little more than checking whether pixels were moving around on the screen — with no insight into whether it was a tree or a home invader. Next came the use of deep learning to do object recognition: identifying a gun in hand or a breaking window. This proved useful but limited and somewhat high maintenance, needing lots of scene- and object-specific training.</p>
<p>&#8220;The insight was, if you look at what humans do to understand a video, we take lots of other information: is the person sitting or standing? Are they opening a door, are they walking or running? Are they indoors or outdoors, daytime or nighttime? We bring all that together to create a kind of comprehensive understanding of the scene,&#8221; Shrestha explained. &#8220;We use computer vision intelligence to mine the footage for a whole range of events. We break down every task and call it a primitive: interactions, objects, etc, then we combine those building blocks to create a &#8216;signature.&#8217; &#8221;</p>

<p>A signature may be something like &#8220;a person sitting in their car for a long time at night,&#8221; or &#8220;a person standing by a security checkpoint not interacting with anyone,&#8221; or any number of things. Some have been tweaked and added by the team, some have been arrived at independently by the model, which Shrestha descrbed as &#8220;kind of a managed semi-supervised approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>The benefit of using an AI to monitor a hundred video streams at once is plain even if you were to assume that said AI is only, say, 80 percent as good as a human at spotting something bad happening. With no such shortcomings as distraction, fatigue, or only having two eyes, an AI can apply that level of success without limits on time or feed number, meaning the chance of success is actually quite high.</p>
<p>But the same might have been said of a proto-AI system from a few years ago that was only looking for guns. What Ambient.ai is aiming for is something more comprehensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;We built the platform around the idea of privacy by design,&#8221; Shrestha said. With AI-powered security, &#8220;people just assume facial recognition is part of it, but with our approach you have this large number of signature events, and you can have a risk indicator without having to do facial recognition. You don&#8217;t just have one image and one model that says what&#8217;s happening &#8211; we have all these different blocks that allow you to get more descriptive in the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Essentially this is done by keeping each individual recognized activity bias-free to begin with. For instance, whether someone is sitting or standing, or how long they&#8217;ve been waiting outside a door — if each of these behaviors can be audited and found to be detected across demographics and groups, then the sum of such inferences must likewise be free of bias. In this way the system structurally reduces bias.</p>
<p>It must however be said that bias is insidious and complex, and our ability to recognize it and mitigate it lags behind the state of the art. Nevertheless it seems intuitively true that, as Shrestha put it, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t have an inference category for something that can be biased, there&#8217;s no way for bias to come in that way.&#8221; Let&#8217;s hope so!</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen a few startups come and go along these lines, so it&#8217;s important for these ideas to be demonstrated on the record. And despite keeping relatively quiet about itself, Ambient.ai has a number of active customers that have helped prove out its product hypothesis. Of course the last couple years haven&#8217;t exactly been business as usual&#8230; but it&#8217;s hard to imagine &#8220;five of the largest US tech companies by market cap&#8221; would both be customers (and they are) if it didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>One test at an unnamed &#8220;Fortune 500 Technology Company&#8221; was looking to reduce &#8220;tailgating,&#8221; where someone enters a secured area right behind another person authorized to do so. If you think no one does this, well, they identified 2,000 incidents the first week. But by sending GIFs of the events in near real time to security, who presumably went and wagged their fingers at the offenders, that number was reduced to 200 a week. Now it&#8217;s 10 a week, probably by people like me.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259191" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259191" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2259191" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg" alt="Illustration of ambient.ai's interface, showing detected events like falls and active shooters." width="1024" height="728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2259191" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ambient.ai</p></div></p>
<p>In another test case Ambient.ai documented, a school&#8217;s security cameras caught someone scaling the fence after hours. The security head was sent the footage immediately and called the cops. Turns out the guy had priors. The point I take here is not that we need to lock down our school campuses and this will help do that, but something else mentioned in the document, which is that the system can combine the knowledge of &#8220;someone is climbing a fence&#8221; with other stuff, like &#8220;this happens a lot a bit before 8:45,&#8221; so kids taking a shortcut don&#8217;t get the cops called on them. And the AI could also discern between climbing, falling, and loitering, which in different circumstances might matter, or not.</p>
<p>Ambient.ai claims that part of the system&#8217;s flexibility is in all these &#8220;primitives&#8221; being easy to rearrange depending on the needs of the site — maybe you truly don&#8217;t care if someone climbs a fence, unless they fall — as well as being able to learn new situations: &#8220;Ah, so this is what it looks like when someone is cutting a fence.&#8221; The team currently has about 100 suspicious behavior &#8220;signatures&#8221; and hopes to double that over the next year.</p>
<p>Making the existing security personnel more effective by giving them more control over what blows up their phone or radio saves time and improves outcomes (Ambient.ai says it reduces the number of common alarms in general by 85-90 percent). And AI-powered categorization of footage helps with records and archives as well. Saying &#8220;download all footage of people climbing a fence at night&#8221; is a lot easier than scrubbing through 5,000 hours manually.</p>
<p>The $52M round was led by a16z, but there&#8217;s also a bit of a who&#8217;s-who in the individual investor pile: Ron Conway, Ali Rowghani from Y Combinator, Okta co-founder Frederick Kerrest, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz, Microsoft CVP Charles Dietrick, and several others who know of what they invest in.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a unique time; security practitioners are expected to do a lot more. The basic proposal of not having to have someone watching all these feeds is universal,&#8221; said Shrestha. &#8220;We spend so much money on security, $120 billion&#8230; it&#8217;s crazy that the outcomes aren&#8217;t there — we don&#8217;t prevent incidents. It feels like all roads are leading to convergence. We want to be a platform that an organization can adopt and future-proof their security.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Nowsta’s web and mobile app rolls workforce management tools into an all-in-one resource that includes an on-demand labor marketplace connecting employers with a skilled pool of workers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nowsta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nowsta</a> attracted venture capital for its approach to help employers better engage with their hourly workforces in this increasingly hybrid work environment.</p>
<p>The company announced today $41 million in Series B funding in a round led by GreatPoint Ventures that brings the company’s total funding raised to date to $59 million. Joining GreatPoint in the financing were VMG Catalyst, Rally Ventures, Tribe Capital and existing investors Green Visor Capital, Compound Ventures and Clocktower Technology Ventures.</p>
<p>CEO Nick Lillios founded Nowsta in 2015 and spent the next year-and-a-half building the technology that arose out of his experience working with food service vendors in New York. The operational complexity of hourly workforces was the inspiration for the company’s technology, an answer to current workforce management solutions that were not able to keep up with the changing nature of hourly work, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259017" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Nowsta’s web and mobile app rolls workforce management tools, like automated scheduling, time-tracking, payroll and communication, into an all-in-one resource that includes an on-demand labor marketplace that connects employers with a skilled pool of workers sourced by trusted third-party staffing providers. There is also a wallet feature so users can get paid after every shift and see their future earnings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Every employer is leveraging a contingent workforce and trying to use 1099 workers to fill in the gaps,” Lillios told TechCrunch. “Our marketplace matches employers in need with employees, and you can see how they have been trained and vetted so employers can make quick decisions.”</p>
<p>The company raised an $8.1 million Series A in April 2019, which gave it the boost to create the marketplace. When the global pandemic hit, Nowsta began working with customers that had to furlough its workers, and the resource enabled the company to help customers transition employees to other jobs.</p>
<p>Lillios doesn’t believe that hourly work will go back to normal. Instead, the shift seen over the past two years will be permanent as more employees crave flexibility and more employers have access to tools and resources that help them adapt.</p>
<p>A market that used to have little technology is now flush with startups giving attention to this underserved population. Most recently we reported on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/asknicely-frontline-workers/">AskNicely</a>, which raised $32 million in Series B funding for its employee empowering app.</p>

<p>Today, Nowsta’s technology manages over 300,000 workers each month across 600 employers, including sports stadiums, hotels, food services vendors and warehouses. As more stadiums and hotels were coming back online throughout the pandemic and needed to hire around 1,000 employees, Nowsta was able to source hundreds of workers initially, which Lillios said for some “has revolutionized their businesses and ushered in a new model of flex work.”</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to scale its operations across 25 new U.S. markets, double its 68-person headcount by the end of the year — it was 25 people in 2021 — and invest in product development and sales and marketing. After ramping up revenue significantly in 2021, Lillios doesn’t expect to repeat that, but does forecast the company to grow at least three to five times in revenue this year.</p>
<p>Ashok Krishnamurthi, managing partner at GreatPoint Ventures, said in a written statement: “The last two years have caused a paradigm shift in the labor marketplace, and hourly and flex work is becoming ever more prevalent. Businesses of all types now must connect easily with, and manage their on-demand workforces efficiently. The most effective way to do that is with Nowsta, and we couldn&#8217;t be more excited to be partnering with Nick and the team to help achieve this vision.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Password management platform <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=1Password+techcrunch&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">1Password</a> has closed a massive $620 million Series C funding round that raises the company’s valuation to $6.8 billion.</p>
<p>The investment was led by Iconiq Growth, with participation from Tiger Global, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Backbone Angels, and Accel, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/fourteen-years-after-launching-1password-takes-first-funding-a-200m-series-a/">which led the company’s $200 million Series A</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/1password-raises-100m-at-a-2b-valuation/">$100 million Series B rounds</a>. Other investors taking part include CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz, General Motors CEO Mary Barry, and LinkedIn chairman Jeff Weiner. The round also attracted investment from investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/how-ryan-reynolds-has-mastered-authentic-marketing/">Ryan Reynolds</a>, Robert Downey Jr, and Justin Timberlake.</p>
<p>The bumper funding round follows an impressive year of growth for 1Password. The company told TechCrunch that since its Series B raise in July last year, it has increased its paying customer base from 90,000 to more than 100,000 — adding big-name corporate subscribers including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/datadog/">Datadog</a>, Intercom and Snowflake — and has grown its internal headcount from 475 to 570 employees. This, the company says, has been driven by three things: the continuation of remote and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/epos/is-hybrid-working-the-future-of-the-workplace/">hybrid working</a>, the rapid adoption of cloud apps, and the acceleration of work-related burnout.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258728" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latter point is becoming a particularly worrying cybersecurity threat, according to the company, which found that 80% of office workers and 84% of security specialists are feeling burned out as a result of the pandemic, with 12% using the same password or just a few different passwords for everything at work as a result.</p>
<p>“We’ve found that when you have stress and burnout, two things happen,” 1Password CEO Jeff Shiner tells TechCrunch. “Firstly, people look for the easy way — when you’re overworked, you&#8217;re going to put security on the back-burner. The other side effect of stress and burnout has been a desire to change, and you see that in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/using-data-driven-techniques-to-beat-the-great-resignation/">Great Resignation</a>. That leads to security issues because all those apps and services that IT are not aware of you’re now taking with you.”</p>
<p>1Password will use its newly-raised funds to drive continued growth; the company said it plans to triple its engineering and customer support teams, to build out its business-focused Events API functionality that provides visibility into successful and failed sign-in attempts, and to finance more acquisitions.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at strategic acquisitions,” Shiner says. “We made an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/1password-acquires-secrethub-and-launches-new-enterprise-secrets-management-tool/">acquisition last year with Secret Hub</a>, and we will continue to look at acquisitions and how those can help us achieve our mission and goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, though the Series C funding round provides 1Password with a substantial amount of capital, Shiner says the company has no plans for an exit &#8220;just yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding will &#8220;give us the sleep-at-night ability to go after some of the big bets that we need to take,&#8221; said Shiner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mantrahealth.com/">Mantra Health</a>, a digital mental health startup focused on young adults, has raised $22 million in Series A funding led by VMG Partners. The round includes new investors New Market Venture Partners, Elements Health Ventures, 14W and Alumni Ventures. Returning investors included Canaan Partners, Global Founders Capital, Baleon Capital, Western Tech Investments and City Light Capital. This latest investment brings the company&#8217;s total amount of funding to nearly $28 million.</p>
<p>The company provides virtual mental healthcare services to college and university students in the United States. By combining clinical services with software and design, Mantra Health aims to improve the mental health of over 20 million university and college students through partnerships with higher education institutions and health insurance plans. Mantra’s care program has been deployed on 52 campuses across the country, including Penn State, Miami Dade College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</p>
<p>Mantra Health equips campus counseling offices with a dedicated psychiatry or therapy provider to work exclusively with the school. The company says it&#8217;s not interested in replacing universities&#8217; counseling operations and instead works as a digital extension of on-campus counseling staff and provider groups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258883" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup was founded in 2018 by Ed Gaussen, Matt Kennedy and Dr. Ravi Shah. Gaussen, who is now the CEO of Mantra Health, told TechCrunch that the trio started the company out of deep curiosity around how to improve the status quo of mental healthcare for young adults. Gaussen says he has a sibling who dropped out of college in 2016 due to mental health issues and saw firsthand how difficult it was to find an appropriate provider.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw firsthand through that experience the chaos of finding an appropriate provider, the costs related to treatment, and so many gaps in the process of getting the right support,&#8221; Gaussen said. &#8220;I ultimately spent the majority of my time as a VC learning about this space and trying to understand what was being done to solve the multiple problems in the system. It was always a personal goal to become a founder and that curiosity turned into an obsession, which ultimately led to starting the company with Matt and Ravi.&#8221;</p>
<p>To get started with Mantra Health, students take an online assessment to learn about their care options. From there, they can schedule an initial video consultation to discuss their symptoms and treatment options. The Mantra Health provider then works with the student to develop a personalized plan that includes therapy, lifestyle changes and medication, if appropriate. Students have ongoing access to their mental health provider and also have tools to track their progress.</p>
<p>Gaussen says the company will use this latest funding to quadruple the size of its team over the next 12 months across all operations, including product development and clinical operations. Mantra Health is also going to focus on clinical investments in its virtual provider group and continue its expansion across the country. The company is also dedicating partial proceeds of this round to scale its diversity scholarship, which offers financial support to marginalized individuals who are pursuing a degree related to mental health.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding future plans, Mantra Health COO and co-founder Matt Kennedy says the company plans to introduce new digital-first treatments and other services for its patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the next year or so, we’ll introduce new digital-first treatments for patients, new specialties within our provider group, and continue to expand our payment mix,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;Ultimately, Mantra will have a mental wellness pathway tailored to each student from the day they walk on campus to well after graduation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the funding announcement, Mantra Health is debuting a new insurance referral program to support both short-term, episodic care and long-term mental healthcare needs for young adults. The program is designed to work with students&#8217; insurance as the payer instead of the school. Mantra is already in-network with Optum, Cigna, as well as other local payers, and has launched the new insurance referral program as a pilot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://routefusion.com/">Routefusion</a> cofounders </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/colton-seal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colton Seal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/richard-scappaticci"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Scappaticci </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/routefusion-channels-3-6m-seed/">attempted to launch a neobank in 2016</a>, but they ran into significant hurdles when trying to integrate with banks to help their customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">move money to other countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They found that in order to provide cross-border payments on their platform, they had to first navigate a “super fragmented market” filled with payment providers relying on complex, inefficient platforms, Seal told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Banks and other financial services companies are really just risk companies. They&#8217;re not payments companies, and that&#8217;s not necessarily their fault – that could be because of regulation or whatever else. But as two outsiders kind of coming into the industry, there were so many hurdles around how to partner with a bank and how to get compliance [approval],” Seal said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add in the complexities of different regulatory regimes in different countries, and one can start to see how legacy cross-border payment tools could be tough for developers to navigate. Seal and Scappaticci decided to ditch the neobank and launch Routefusion to help simplify the process instead. The company allows its customers to access over twelve different banking and foreign exchange providers through a single API (application programming interface).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259229" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I tell our [banking and foreign exchange] partners all the time, you guys are really good at building payment rails, and you&#8217;re really good at doing the compliance. But we&#8217;re really good at doing product and customer service and building awesome APIs,” Seal said, describing what differentiates Routefusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Austin-based company officially launched in 2019 and has doubled its number of customers to nearly 40 since its first institutional funding round last February, Seal said. Its customers largely use Routefusion for B2B payments today, but some also use it for remittances, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the same period, Routefusion’s revenue grew by 5,000% to a seven-figure sum, according to the company, though Seal declined to share further detail on the numbers. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Routefusion just raised another $10.5 million in a “seed prime” round, bringing the company’s total institutional funding raised to date to $14.1 million. New investor Canvas Ventures led the most recent round, with participation from existing investors including Silverton Partners and Initialized Capital and new investor Haymaker Ventures. Angel investors Sherwin Gandi (co-founder of Jeeves) and Aldrin Clement (co-founder of Novel Bank) also backed Routefusion in the “seed prime” raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to double its headcount from 20 to 40-plus employees by the end of this year, Seal said. Seal is currently focused on expanding Routefusion’s product offerings in Latin America, Europe, the United Kingdom, and Canada, and is pre-emptively exploring different markets in Africa, where he expects to see surging demand in the next two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Routefusion is the only payments API company other than Stripe founded by two software engineers, which constitutes a competitive advantage, Seal said. He wants customers to see Routefusion “as an extension of their own team” rather than as an external payments provider removed from their day-to-day challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebecca Lynn, who led Canvas Ventures’ investment in Routefusion, said the company’s developer-friendly approach allows it to onboard customers far more efficiently than legacy providers. As a former engineer who self-identifies as “product-oriented,” Lynn was drawn to Routefusion in part because of its positive customer feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I pay a lot of attention to what customers tell me. I can think whatever I want to think about a founder or company or product or service, but what I think doesn&#8217;t really matter – it&#8217;s what their customers think, and the customers love this company,” Lynn told TechCrunch in an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s really what sold me, because it seems like a noisy space at the top level. But when you start diving in, there&#8217;s no one really solving this middleware problem the way they are,” Lynn said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Michelle Davey was first building Wheel, a healthcare platform that helps staff clinical workforces, she had to convince investors on two visions: one, that consumers will soon demand high-quality virtual care, and two, that the behavior will change so dramatically that her startup would build vital, underlying infrastructure to scale hybrid medical workforces.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing the entire industry race towards the same direction, and that’s to serve more patients virtually &#8212; everything from traditional healthcare players like insurers to very large retailers such as Walmart and Amazon,” she said. “But, what we’ve seen in the early days of this innovation is a lot of point of care solutions…and a refragmentation of the patient experience.”</p>
<p>Davey’s vision to reinvent the back-end of virtual healthcare clicked amid the pandemic, when telehealth startups soared in usage and impact as visits went online. Soon enough, she had another evolution of her three-year-old startup: Wheel needed to evolve from an urgent care model to a more comprehensive platform that could help any program power the patient journey &#8212; from primary care to pediatrics to chronic condition management.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259210" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With hopes of providing a more holistic infrastructure to telehealth services, Wheel announced today the close of a $150 million Series C round co-led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Tiger Global. New investors Coatue and Salesforce participated in the round, along with existing investors CRV, Tusk Venture Partners and Silverton Partners. The company last raised a $50 million Series B in May 2021, bringing its total known funding to date to $216 million.</p>
<p>The money will help Wheel offer its platform to more companies seeking to sell holistic, virtual care service to patients. The startup wants to now be able to help patients start at a telehealth visit, but then get directed to labs, diagnostics or even an in-person visit. “While it may seem obvious, [this] transition in health care is not trivial, it requires new clinical protocols, new regulation, regulation considerations, new software and infrastructure and an entirely new workforce to deliver that care across the continuum,” Davey said.</p>
<p>Wheel isn’t the only startup with a pitch to help point-care solutions broaden their services to reach wider consumer patient population. Providers and healthcare startups have access to white-label solutions such as publicly listed Teladoc and Truepill, which have been around for a long time and have powered the operations of unicorns like Hims and Hers, Nurx and GoodRx as they look to scale in a compliant but efficient manner; simultaneously companies like SteadyMD have built an &#8220;AWS for healthcare&#8221; that combines digital recruiting with EMR integrations, doctor-patient communication channels and prescription referrals.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2PPUWwjYDx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/">Should startups build or buy telehealth infrastructure?</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Turnkey solutions bring up a series of questions, such as the importance of building infrastructure in-house versus outsourcing it, or if it makes sense to rely on a third-party for staffing a practice. Many startups view their clinician base as their core competitive advantage, so leaning elsewhere for sourcing takes away some of its value proposition.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a churn and burn third-party service,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are really focused on the clinician and how do we enable them to practice at the highest value of their care. Wheel’s clinician network has grown over 60% this year, with 90% retention, she said.</p>
<p>She attests part of the retention to the fact that Wheel built its telehealth visit workflows inside one platform so clinicians wouldn’t have to patchwork different services when dealing with patients. Additionally, the scale of the platform helps clinicians access &#8220;a whole different dimension&#8221; of work, toggling between in-person care, virtual care or a flexible mix of them both.</p>
<p>To date, Wheel has helped conduct 1.3 million patient visits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Working remotely has become the norm for a lot of desk-based employees, and there have been a number of tech companies that have seen their business explode in catering to that shift. But today comes news of a different kind of startup called <a href="https://www.turingsaas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing Labs</a>, which is addressing the same challenges, but as they apply to people who work in laboratories. It has now raised $16.5 million in funding on the back of its growth.</p>
<p>The Series A round of funding is being led by Insight Partners, with previous backers <span class="s1">Moment Ventures</span> and <span class="s1">Y Combinator (where it was part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/turing-cpg-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 cohort</a>)</span> and new individual investor <span class="s1">Borge Hald</span> (CEO and co-founder of <span class="s1">Medallia</span>), also participating. The investment will be used to accelerate R&amp;D, grow the engineering team, widen operations, and a further build a go-to-market organization.</p>
<p>Turing Labs&#8217; platform helps labs speed up the process of making new products. So far<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, Turing has been working with companies in the consumer packaged goods space, where its technology is being used to come up with new formulations for home care products, food and drink, and cosmetics. It</span> uses AI to simulate working through different ingredient combinations for new product formulations to determine a smaller subset that actual technicians then put together &#8212; and it <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">will be using the investment to continue working on its own R&amp;D (adding more functionality to the platform to extend for example deeper into packaging and alternative ingredients for processed food) as well as on hiring and business development.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259360" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We initially focused on formulation but now we are moving into other areas like ingredients or packaging &#8212; anything that can be digitally simulated or optimized,&#8221; said <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Manmit Shrimali, Turing Labs&#8217; CEO who co-founded the company with </span><span class="s1" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ajith Govind</span>it, in an interview. The opportunity is in how the whole R&amp;D game has shifted, he added. &#8220;The process used to be 90% manual but now its 90% digital.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Shrimali also</span> said the startup is also seeing a growing opportunity in moving into altogether new categories, too: for example, the rise of plant-based alternatives to, say, meat or dairy is opening the door to applying AI to come up with new foodstuffs altogether.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While Turing Labs already works with some of the world&#8217;s biggest consumer packaged goods companies, it doesn&#8217;t disclose who they are publicly, but they are household names you would know well. The plan is to expand that list, as well as engagement with the companies that are already using Turing. </span></p>
<p>As we have noted when previously profiling Turing, R&amp;D labs play a specific and critical role in the world of CPG.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before eventually being shipped into production, the labs are where products are discovered; tested; tweaked in response to input from customers, marketing, budgetary and manufacturing departments and others; then tested again; then tweaked again; and so on. One of the big clients that Turing works with spends close to $400 million in testing alone.</p>
<p>Even before Covid-19, R&amp;D departments were under a lot of pressure. They are seeing their budgets getting cut, while facing an increasing number of demands and variables to which to be accountable. They are still expected to meet timelines in producing new products (or often more likely, extensions of products) to keep consumers interested. There are a new host of environmental and health concerns around goods with huge lists of unintelligible ingredients, meaning they have to figure out how to simplify and improve the composition of mass-market products. And smaller direct-to-consumer brands are undercutting their larger competitors by getting to market faster with competitive offerings that have met new consumer tastes and preferences. Running through combinations of formulations, with all of the other variables involved, is a time-consuming and expensive process.</p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The pandemic has complicated this even further, with companies aiming to reduce time spent in physical environments, including labs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Turing Labs&#8217; approach is to solve these various challenges with AI. Not unlike other complex computational applications where machines take on the role of caus lculations and do them faster than any team of humans could do, here that concept is applied to the products that are being built or reformulated, cutting down steps to minimize what the technicians need to do. In theory this gives them the opportunity to focus on coming up with newer innovations that they can then try in different combinations, although &#8212; as is the case with any AI innovations &#8212; it will be worth watching to see how and if Turing Labs&#8217; platform eventually grows smart enough to cut the technicians out of the process altogether.</span></p>
<p class="p2">&#8220;With rapidly changing consumer preferences, including ingredient inputs, as well as the emergence of competitive independent brands, CPG companies today are under pressure to develop new products faster and evolve their existing portfolio. Turing Labs allows users to automate the formulation process and predict outcomes, helping CPG companies bring innovative products to market faster,” said Josh Fredberg, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “Turing Labs’ ability to systemize and speed up market discovery and product formulation across CPG organizations makes it a stand-out in the industry. We look forward to partnering with the team at Turing Labs as they continue to grow.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company’s no-code software can automate any kind of process: employee onboarding, contract approvals, help tickets or any other recurring work.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wrangle.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wrangle</a> raised $2 million in an oversubscribed pre-seed funding to advance its technology that automates workflows, approvals and tickets so that a company can track work and provide call-to-action tasks within chat platforms like Slack.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Beta and Eniac Ventures co-led the investment, with participation from Liquid 2 Ventures, Hustle Fund, TDF Ventures and more than 20 founder angel investors.</p>
<p>Adam Smith and Adam Long founded Wrangle in 2020 and bootstrapped the remote company until now. This is the third company where they have worked together. Most recently they were COO and CTO, respectively, at Automated Insights, which was <a href="https://www.statsperform.com/press/vista-equity-partners-and-stats-acquire-automated-insights-2-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Vista Equity Partners</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While growing a startup, they saw firsthand how software could play into the new remote way of working.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to get operations done when you are in the same office and with five people around the table, but when you are growing really fast, and real departments begin to emerge, you need a process to handle the team-to-team handoffs,” Adam Smith said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, as more people live in different time zones and are working with different goals and processes, that can throw a wrench in the gears. Add into that the global pandemic where everyone was home, and it separated teams further, Smith added.</p>
<p>In their research, they saw Slack direct messages and channels get busy as people dealt with up to 100 requests per week with little way to audit/track where people were in the process.</p>
<p>Wrangle is solving this problem by giving companies a new way to run operations directly in the tools where employees are already talking to each other, like Slack and Microsoft Teams. The company’s no-code software can automate any kind of process: employee onboarding, contract approvals, help tickets or any other recurring work. It also gathers requests with forms, assigns and notifies people to follow-up and tracks the progress for everyone to follow.</p>
<p>Now when colleagues are assigned a task, like onboarding an employee, an automated checklist pops up, and employees check off their steps and don’t have to worry about what to do because all the work is automated for them, Long said.</p>

<p>Wrangle launched in February 2021, initially with Slack, and now more than 800 organizations have used the workflow builder to complete over 10,000 workflows. One of their customers, Reuben Doetsch, co-founder and CTO of AvantStay, started using Wrangle for bug reports and future requests.</p>
<p>“The AvantStay team has been growing rapidly and Wrangle is the tool behind the scenes that keeps our workflows on track in Slack,” Doetsch said in a written statement. “We use it for everything from processing refunds to managing changes to property listings. Wrangle saves us hundreds of hours a month while also ensuring nothing gets lost in the chaos of Slack.”</p>
<p>The new round of funding will enable Wrangle to grow its team from just the two founders, invest in product development and accelerate its marketing efforts. The tool is expanding into Microsoft Teams and will be launching a web app for building workflows and analyzing them to move the work along. The company has dozens of paying customers and is growing revenue at 20% to 30% every month.</p>
<p>Investor Karin Klein, founding partner of Bloomberg Beta, said via email that her firm looks at the future of work and how to make work better.</p>
<p>She says that as Slack and Teams become the places where more people work together, the Wrangle team has created a way to have ticketing workflows happen where the work happens without being siloed in with other products.</p>
<p>“Adam and Adam are exceptional founders who have created an easy to use approach to ticketing so we don’t have to switch between multiple applications, saving everyone time and ensuring important approvals don’t get missed,” Klein added. “The need for Wrangle is only going to grow as work remains hybrid and distributed.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Parallel Systems, a company founded by three former SpaceX engineers to build autonomous battery-electric rail vehicles, came out of stealth mode on Wednesday with a $49.55 million Series A raise. The company, which has raised $53.15 million to date, including a $3.6 million seed round, is working to create a more efficient, decarbonized freight network that flows on top of existing railway infrastructure.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to build Parallel System&#8217;s second-generation vehicle and launch an advanced testing program that will help the startup figure out how to integrate its vehicles into real-world operations, according to co-founder and CEO Matt Soule.</p>
<p>Parallel Systems also intends to use the new investment &#8212; which was led by Anthos Capital and includes investments from Congruent Ventures, Riot Ventures, Embark Ventures and others &#8212; to hire about 60 engineers, most of whom will deal with software, says Soule.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259100" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s rail vehicle architecture aims to solve a few problems: carbon emissions in freight, supply chain constraints of trucking and limits of railway freight. In the U.S., <a href="https://railroads.dot.gov/rail-network-development/freight-rail-overview#:~:text=Heavy%20freight%20such%20as%20coal,length%20and%20weight%20freight%20travels)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">rail network accounts for 28% of all freight movement</a>, but most of that is bulk movement activity &#8212; large trains that move primary resources like coal and lumber. A smaller portion of rail freight movement is referred to as intermodal activity, which essentially involves moving steel containers between a range of different modes of transportation, like boats and trucks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rail has a lot of opportunity to grow when it comes to intermodal, and we focus on this because this is where we think there&#8217;s competition and appetite for innovation,&#8221; Soule told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Parallel&#8217;s patent-pending vehicle architecture involves individually powered railcars that can load and transport standard shipping containers as a single or double-stacked load. They can join up to form &#8220;platoons&#8221; or split off to multiple destinations while en route, which means they don&#8217;t need to hold large volumes of freight to make the service economical, although Soule says they can actually carry much more weight than trucks, which handle most freight transportation in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the unit economics of freight trains to get competitive with trucks, you need really long trains, and you&#8217;re amortizing the cost of that locomotive and crew over that one really long train,&#8221; said Soule. &#8220;When that becomes a problem is when you&#8217;re figuring out where to park that big train, and the answer is, not many places.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Relying on long trains to transport goods means it&#8217;s harder to do high-volume turnovers that handle all our e-commerce wonders because those trains can&#8217;t always access urban communities or ports. They require specially built, large terminals to accommodate their physical size, said Soule.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our unit economics don&#8217;t depend on a very big train,&#8221; said Soule. &#8220;We can move in smaller platoons and rather than dwelling all day for the unloading and loading operation, we&#8217;re in and out within an hour or two, leaving room for other platoons to come in. It&#8217;s the more efficient footprint and it enables things like serving ports and creating inland port shuttle systems so you can move the containers from a seaport to an inland port, which is often a better place for trucks to go and are closer to warehousing activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it comes to autonomy, Parallel sees the railroad&#8217;s closed network as the ideal operational design domain for safe and early commercialization of autonomous technology due to limited track access and centralized traffic control. It&#8217;s important to note, however, that while Parallel&#8217;s long-term vision seems promising, the company has yet to test on national networks &#8212; it has been testing its prototype vehicle on a small rail in Los Angeles that&#8217;s insulated from national networks.</p>
<p>Rail in the U.S. is privately owned by owner-operators, which makes it difficult for Parallel to test its vehicles and the autonomous systems running the vehicles on a large scale. Parallel is targeting private rail companies as its customers, hoping to sell or lease its tools for them to operate the service on a day-to-day basis while offering a supporting role in terms of providing and integrating the technology. Until the startup gets a legacy railroad partner on board, it won&#8217;t be able to see if its tech can handle real-world operations.</p>
<p>The early-stage company is a few years off from developing tech that could go to market, says Soule, but it has an opportunity to own this sector of the market, particularly as shippers around the world not only want faster freight, but also cleaner freight.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platoon technology features self-propelled rail cars that push against each other to distribute the load, which, the company predicts, will lead to Parallel vehicles using just 25% of the energy compared to a semi-truck.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fundamental reason we&#8217;re doing this is to accelerate the decarbonization of freight, but the problem that we see is rail&#8217;s scale of operations is limited to a market it can serve,&#8221; said Soule. &#8220;So we&#8217;re trying to embrace this energy efficiency, but then break down its operational and economic barriers at the same time. And by the way, we&#8217;re making our powertrain electric, which further accelerates the decarbonization benefits because our grid itself is not clean. So when you look at a diesel truck, compared to what we&#8217;re building, and looking at the average, real-world CO<sub>2</sub>content of the U.S. grid, we&#8217;re going to be 90% less CO<sub>2</sub> per mile to move a unit of freight with our technology versus a diesel truck today.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://harness.io">Harness</a>, a startup from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/">AppDynamics founder</a> Jyoti Bansal, has been building a platform of developer tools over the last five years. In 2020, the company made its first foray into open source when it bought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/harness-makes-first-acquisition-snagging-open-source-ci-company-drone-io/">continuous integration tool Drone</a>. Today, they embraced openness further with the release of a free and open version of the company&#8217;s continuous delivery product.</p>
<p>Bansal is reluctant to use the term &#8216;open source&#8217; because it carries some big connotations with it and he doesn&#8217;t want to misrepresent what the company is doing. But starting today, he is making the source code for the community edition of the continuous delivery tool available for any developer to use under the &#8220;source-accessible <a href="https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0/">Polyform Shield</a> license.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing everything [in the same way] as what the power of open source would be, but we are using the source available licensing strategy, where we are putting 100 percent of our source in open repos…Everything is similar to a fully open source project except that our competitors are not allowed to monetize it,&#8221; Bansal explained.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259115" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the last several years, companies like Elastic and MongoDB saw some cloud providers like Amazon taking advantage of the open source license to create their own versions of the same product. They took exception and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/">created a slightly more restrictive license</a> to prevent wholesale poaching by competitors.</p>
<p>Stefano Maffulli executive director at the Open Source Initiative (OSI) says Harness is being careful and respectful when it comes to how they frame this product. &#8220;Harness is doing the right thing by making clear where they are using an OSI-approved license and where they are not. Doing so respects the community and builds trust,&#8221; Maffulli said.</p>

<p>Bansal said they are trying to balance the idea of having an open and available product, while protecting the significant investment they have made into building the product. He believes that by making it open, he can remove any friction from the process, allowing developers to download the open version without having to check with a manager or get permission, which is often the case when a purchase is involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have provided a free version of our product since the beginning, but we wanted to take it to the next level of where we just remove the barriers so there is no reason for a developer to ask for permission from their managers. They can go and download and try it and use it. And only when the product starts working in their environment and they&#8217;re successful will we have the commercial discussion if they need to,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Harness also offers a paid enterprise version and a hosted version of the product in addition to the open product. Bansal says the plan is to eventually move every product on the platform where it makes sense into this model, but they are starting with the continuous delivery product since the Drone continuous integration product is already open source.</p>
<p>Bansal adds that the Drone founders really showed him the value of a community and how having outside developers involved in a project can improve the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;What [the Drone founders] brought to us was showing us that you could build a great community. We have been building great products, and we know how to build great products, but if we can involve our community of users much more closely and the developer community outside of the company, we can even build even better products.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s ad-fuelled boom in crypto trading looks to be headed for major speed restrictions: The country&#8217;s financial watchdog said it will beef up rules around marketing of crypto assets and could even put limits on who can invest, following government confirmation yesterday that it will extend the regulator&#8217;s remit to cover crypto.</p>
<p>In recent years, ads for crypto have been plastered over billboards across the UK capital &#8212; fuelling a boom in trading that has led to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59638313">a few slaps </a>from the advertising standards watchdog.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59638313">December</a>, the Advertising Standards Authority banned seven crypto ads for &#8220;irresponsibly taking advantage of consumers&#8217; inexperience and for failing to illustrate the risk of the investment&#8221; &#8212; saying it hoped to produce new guidance on crypto advertising.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But the financial watchdog&#8217;s intervention looks set to put a more significant dampener on the UK crypto bubble.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/strengthen-financial-promotions-rules-protect-consumers">announcement</a> trailing the proposed changes, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it&#8217;s acting in response to concerns about the &#8220;ease and speed&#8221; that people can make high risk investments &#8212; in line with a <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/consumer-investments-strategy">Consumer Investment Strategy</a> it published last year.</p>

<p>The plan for new crypto rules &#8212; which the FCA said will be confirmed by summer 2022 &#8212; include proposed restrictions on the marketing and uptake of cryptoassets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;[T]he FCA plans to categorise qualifying cryptoassets as ‘Restricted Mass Market Investments’, meaning consumers would only be able to respond to cryptoasset financial promotions if they are classed as restricted, high net worth or sophisticated investors,&#8221; the regulator writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firms issuing such promotions would have to adhere to FCA rules, such as the requirement to be clear, fair and not misleading,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>The regulator is consulting on the proposals &#8212; with a deadline of March 23 for responses.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sarah Pritchard, the FCA&#8217;s executive director of markets, added: &#8220;Too many people are being led to invest in products they don’t understand and which are too risky for them. People need clear, fair information and proper risk warnings if they are to invest with confidence, which is the central aim of our consumer investments strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yesterday the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-strengthen-rules-on-misleading-cryptocurrency-adverts">government c</a><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-strengthen-rules-on-misleading-cryptocurrency-adverts">onfirmed</a> it will legislate to bring the promotion of cryptoassets within the scope of financial promotions legislation to tackle misleading advertising &#8212; writing (or, well, warning) that: &#8220;This means the promotion of qualifying cryptoassets will be subject to FCA rules in line with the same high standards that other financial promotions such as stocks, shares, and insurance products are held to.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, chancellor, Rishi Sunak, added: &#8220;Cryptoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest &#8212; but it’s important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are ensuring consumers are protected, while also supporting innovation of the cryptoasset market.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research/research-note-cryptoasset-consumer-research-2021">Cryptoasset consumer research</a>, published by the FCA last summer, suggested that some 2.3 million Brits owned crypto (out of a UK population of ~52M) &#8212; which amounts to just under 4.5% of Brits holding crypto. In 2020 the FCA said that around 1.9M Brits held cryptoassets &#8212; suggesting there&#8217;s been a percentage increase of ~21% year over year, per the research.</p>
<p>Other estimates of the number of Brits holding crypto that have been bandied around by crypto press in recent months have <a href="https://uk.style.yahoo.com/most-popular-cryptocurrency-2021-uk-093057693.html">touted even bigger figures</a> (but, well, the crypto trading press is itself often located inside the hype bubble).</p>
<p>The marketing frenzy around crypto trading in the UK certainly appears to have fuelled rising awareness among the population, with the FCA finding that 78% of adults had heard of cryptocurrencies &#8212; up from 42% in 2019; and 73% in 2020.</p>
<p>However in another finding that likely sharpened its concern, the regulator found that despite rising awareness the level of understanding of cryptocurrencies was declining &#8212; suggesting &#8220;some crypto users may not fully understand what they&#8217;re buying&#8221;, as it (politely) puts it. Ya think?!</p>
<p>The FCA research also found fewer crypto users regard buying the assets as a gamble (38%, down from 47%); and more see them as an alternative or complement to mainstream investments, with half of crypto users saying they intend to invest more&#8230;</p>
<p>Ergo, it&#8217;s not difficult to see why the UK government and financial regulator have decided it&#8217;s past time to step in with regulatory limits to stop clueless Brits from throwing money at Ponzi-like schemes wrapped in shiny crypto marketing.</p>
<p>Other countries are taking similar steps.</p>
<p>Just this week, Singapore&#8217;s financial regulator announced its own clamp down on crypto marketing (via <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Singapore-clamps-down-on-ads-for-highly-risky-crypto-trading">Nikkei Asia</a>).</p>
<p>Some other countries are going even further &#8212; with planned cryptocurrency bans in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/china-says-all-cryptocurrency-related-transactions-are-illegal/">China</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/india-plans-law-that-will-prohibit-all-private-cryptocurrencies-with-certain-exceptions/">India</a>.</p>
<p>The free-for-all trading party isn&#8217;t over yet but regulators around the globe are slowly closing in on cryptoland&#8217;s gangsta paradise.</p>
