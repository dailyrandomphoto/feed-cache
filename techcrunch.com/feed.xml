										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While working as the chief operating officer of a pizza chain in Vietnam, Taku Tanaka saw how difficult it is for restaurants to connect with farmers. Many small F&amp;B businesses can’t buy in large volumes, so they rely on nearby markets or multiple suppliers who only sell one category. In turn, this means farmers are disconnected from the end customers of their products, making it hard to predict selling prices or plan their crops. Tanaka founded <a href="https://www.web.kamereo.vn/?lang=en">Kamereo</a>, B2B platform with its own warehouse and last-mile delivery network, to focus on those problems.</p>
<p>Based in Ho Chi Minh City, the company announced today that it has raised $4.6 million co-led by food conglomerate CPF Group, Quest Ventures and Genesia Ventures. The capital will be used for hiring, building a new warehouse management system, user interface upgrades and expanding into Hanoi next year.</p>

<p>Before founding Kamereo in 2018, Tanaka was COO of Pizza 4Ps, which grew from one location in Ho Chi Minh City when he joined to 10 stores three years later (it now has more than 30 locations in Vietnam).</p>
<p>Kamereo works with about 15 farmers, including cooperatives, and serves more than 400 active customers, ranging in size from family-owned restaurants to chains with more than 20 locations. Despite COVID-19 related movement restrictions and temporary business closures, Kamereo says it has grown by 15% every month over the last 12 months. It currently has about 100 employees.</p>
<p>F&amp;B businesses use the platform to order from multiple farmers. Kamereo handles supplier negotiations, order processing and management, and fulfillment. Tanaka told TechCrunch that the company operates its own warehouses and last-mile delivery network because it is cheaper than working with third-party providers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178450" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178450" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178450" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png" alt="One of Kamereo's warehouses for fresh farm products" width="1024" height="614" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png 1550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png?resize=1536,921 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2178450" class="wp-caption-text">One of Kamereo&#8217;s warehouses for fresh farm products</p></div></p>
<p>Most of Kamereo’s last-mile deliveries are done by motorbikes since Vietnam has many small roads that are inaccessible to trucks. Tanaka said one drawback is how many goods can be delivered in one trip. Since drivers need to make multiple trips each day, Kamereo plans to expand its micro-warehouse network in Ho Chi Minh City so they don’t need to travel long distances. Its tech team is also building an internal system to manage inventory, fulfillment and last-mile deliveries with the goal of minimizing variable costs.</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, Quest Ventures partner Goh Yiping said, “Kamereo sites in one of the largest food production hubs of Southeast Asia, and there is much room to grow in solving many of the inefficiencies of the supply chain today, improving farmers&#8217; livelihood outcomes and procuring the best products for businesses and homes.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2yP4yLk9xM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>As the pandemic dwindled enough to get in our car with dogs, SiriusXM, and our children in the rear view mirror, we drove to South Carolina. Tina had endured the last year and almost another half while her mother languished with aging pets, her husband in a facility, and eventually his death. As the miles melted away, we alternated between MSNBC, the Beatles channel, and a mixtape of soul, Steely Dan, and Bill Withers.</p>
<p>For years, we&#8217;d dreamed of a way to live from anywhere, and now the pandemic had made our reality a shared one. We&#8217;ll see how much this sticks as companies try to find a way to mix this digital acceleration with some semblance of business life as we knew it. But as we reached the driveway in Charleston, we were tired enough to not care much how the captains of industry would work things out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;d calculated the journey to leave on a Monday and arrive on a Thursday, three 16 hour days and then a day to rest before recording the next Gang session. Instead we left on Tuesday and arrived the night before the session. Surprisingly, the combination. of a three hour time zone shift and the ease of recording on Zoom, two M1 Macs, and enough WiFi to get away with it added up to a relaxed session. I&#8217;ve been using blur mode on Zoom for some months now, so everything felt just about normal. I even got to joke with a few of the guys who could not quite tell which coast we were on.</p>
<p>The dogs locked in to their summer digs with alacrity, roaming the fenced in back yard for a quick check and then settling into strategic spots surrounding us on our bed. Our daughters heated up the Facetime video link with tales of boyfriends and babies (our oldest is in her six month) and extended life seemed possible. When reality intruded, it somehow arrived with a gentleness we hope to get used to. Dinner with our youngest&#8217;s godparents was careful — no masks but no hugs either— as we ease our way into the new next.</p>
<p>Our first show here was followed by a train wreck of dueling agendas and uncomfortable management parries. The show started in a jocular fashion as Brent Leary tried to apologize (sort of) for his comments on one of his shows about the Gillmor Gang. It seems, he joked, that our show was rudderless and frequently a good opportunity to nap on air.</p>
<p>But then Brent said he hoped neither Tina nor I was watching this unspooling in realtime, which of course I was. Now I was both pissed off and actually more amused. Brent&#8217;s instincts fall somewhere between Harpo Marx&#8217;s brilliant silence and an unerring ability to bat back a question designed to prove he wasn&#8217;t engaged with a comment that proved not only that he was but that he chose not to say anything. Brilliant, devastating, and kind all at once. So I seized the moment to call him and say of course I was watching.</p>
<p>The next Gang recording session featured Brent&#8217;s repeated attempts at an apology or at least an explanation, but I kept interrupting him. The result was a funny but diffuse beginning to the show that devolved into a debate about social media and the First Amendment that we often can&#8217;t seem to avoid. As usual, no light was shed, and the show remains unreleased.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Several weeks ago, the Linux community was rocked by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22410164/linux-kernel-university-of-minnesota-banned-open-source">disturbing news</a> that University of Minnesota researchers had developed (but, as it turned out, not fully executed) a method for introducing what they called &#8220;hypocrite commits&#8221; to the Linux kernel &#8212; the idea being to distribute hard-to-detect behaviors, meaningless in themselves, that could later be aligned by attackers to manifest vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This was quickly followed by the &#8212; in some senses, equally disturbing &#8212; announcement that the university had been banned, at least temporarily, from contributing to kernel development. A <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/clarifications-hc.pdf">public apology</a> from the researchers followed.</p>
<p>Though exploit development and disclosure is often messy, running technically complex &#8220;red team&#8221; programs against the world&#8217;s biggest and most important open-source project feels a little extra. It&#8217;s hard to imagine researchers and institutions so naive or derelict as not to understand the potentially huge blast radius of such behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Equally certain, maintainers and project governance are duty bound to enforce policy and avoid having their time wasted. Common sense suggests (and users demand) they strive to produce kernel releases that don&#8217;t contain exploits. But killing the messenger seems to miss at least some of the point &#8212; that this was research rather than pure malice, and that it casts light on a kind of software (and organizational) vulnerability that begs for technical and systemic mitigation.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Projects of the scale and utter criticality of the Linux kernel aren&#8217;t prepared to contend with game-changing, hyperscale threat models.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I think the &#8220;hypocrite commits&#8221; contretemps is symptomatic, on every side, of related trends that threaten the entire extended open-source ecosystem and its users. That ecosystem has long wrestled with problems of scale, complexity and free and open-source software’s (FOSS) increasingly critical importance to every kind of human undertaking. Let&#8217;s look at that complex of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest open-source projects now present big targets.</li>
<li>Their complexity and pace have grown beyond the scale where traditional “commons” approaches or even more evolved governance models can cope.</li>
<li>They are evolving to commodify each other. For example, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly hard to state, categorically, whether “Linux” or “Kubernetes” should be treated as the “operating system” for distributed applications. For-profit organizations have taken note of this and have begun reorganizing around “full-stack” portfolios and narratives.</li>
<li>In so doing, some for-profit organizations have begun distorting traditional patterns of FOSS participation. Many experiments are underway. Meanwhile, funding, headcount commitments to FOSS and other metrics seem in decline.</li>
<li>OSS projects and ecosystems are adapting in diverse ways, sometimes making it difficult for for-profit organizations to feel at home or see benefit from participation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the threat landscape keeps evolving:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attackers are bigger, smarter, faster and more patient, leading to long games, supply-chain subversion and so on.</li>
<li>Attacks are more financially, economically and politically profitable than ever.</li>
<li>Users are more vulnerable, exposed to more vectors than ever before.</li>
<li>The increasing use of public clouds creates new layers of technical and organizational monocultures that may enable and justify attacks.</li>
<li>Complex commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions assembled partly or wholly from open-source software create elaborate attack surfaces whose components (and interactions) are accessible and well understood by bad actors.</li>
<li>Software componentization enables new kinds of supply-chain attacks.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, all this is happening as organizations seek to shed nonstrategic expertise, shift capital expenditures to operating expenses and evolve to depend on cloud vendors and other entities to do the hard work of security.</li>
</ul>
<p>The net result is that projects of the scale and utter criticality of the Linux kernel aren&#8217;t prepared to contend with game-changing, hyperscale threat models. In the specific case we&#8217;re examining here, the researchers were able to target candidate incursion sites with relatively low effort (using static analysis tools to assess units of code already identified as requiring contributor attention), propose “fixes” informally via email, and leverage many factors, including their own established reputation as reliable and frequent contributors, to bring exploit code to the verge of being committed.</p>
<p>This was a serious betrayal, effectively by “insiders” of a trust system that&#8217;s historically worked very well to produce robust and secure kernel releases. The abuse of trust itself changes the game, and the implied follow-on requirement &#8212; to bolster mutual human trust with systematic mitigations &#8212; looms large.</p>
<p>But how do you contend with threats like this? Formal verification is effectively impossible in most cases. Static analysis may not reveal cleverly engineered incursions. Project paces must be maintained (there are known bugs to fix, after all). And the threat is asymmetrical: As the classic line goes &#8212; blue team needs to protect against everything, red team only needs to succeed once.</p>
<p>I see a few opportunities for remediation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit the spread of monocultures. Stuff like Alva Linux and AWS&#8217; Open Distribution of ElasticSearch are good, partly because they keep widely used FOSS solutions free and open source, but also because they inject technical diversity.</li>
<li>Reevaluate project governance, organization and funding with an eye toward mitigating complete reliance on the human factor, as well as incentivizing for-profit companies to contribute their expertise and other resources. Most for-profit companies would be happy to contribute to open source because of its openness, and not despite it, but within many communities, this may require a culture change for existing contributors.</li>
<li>Accelerate commodification by simplifying the stack and verifying the components. Push appropriate responsibility for security up into the application layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, what I&#8217;m advocating here is that orchestrators like Kubernetes should matter less, and Linux should have less impact. Finally, we should proceed as fast as we can toward formalizing the use of things like unikernels.</p>
<p>Regardless, we need to ensure that both companies and individuals provide the resources open source needs to continue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Relevance is often tied to rarity. As a result, the <em>first </em>anything — whether a birthday, scientific feat or female vice president — comes with its own weight. Whether that pressure is warranted is a discussion in and of itself, but today, we’ll focus on the ripple effects of India’s <em>first </em>unicorn IPO: Zomato.</p>
<p>Food delivery startup Zomato, set to start trading public shares next week, has been labeled by journalists and industry experts as India’s biggest tech public offering to date. The company could be valued at up to $8.6 billion in its public debut, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">early indications of investor interest were strong. </a></p>
<p>As my colleagues <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim put it in their column</a>, the eventual performance of Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/">will be watched by Paytm</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/indian-financial-services-firm-mobikwik-looks-to-raise-255-million-in-ipo/">MobiKwik</a>, two Indian fintech unicorns also looking to go public soon, the some 100 Indian unicorns, and, of course, returns-focused venture capitalists. The success of the startup could lead to more venture funding, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/zomato-juice-indian-unicorns-proposed-ipo-could-drive-regional-startup-liquidity/">exits down the road</a>, and overall, highlight a milestone for growth investments amid legislative and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/india-bans-mastercard-from-adding-new-customers/">regulatory tension. </a></p>
<p>While the pressure is on for Zomato not to get squashed by the public markets, it’s not simply baseless, anticipatory energy. Our on-the-ground reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc">Manish Singh</a> has religiously reported on all the signs that India has been building toward this event, from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">early-stage startup fundraising frenzy</a> to how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">engineers suddenly feel empowered</a> to ask for more money thanks to an increase in demand.</p>
<p>A Zomato success may turn more investors to pay attention to the startup scene, but they will be playing catch-up: Indian startups have raised a record $10.46 billion in the first half of 2021, up from $4 billion during the same period last year, and $5.4 billion in the first half of 2019, data insight platform Tracxn told TechCrunch. For comparison, Indian startups had raised $11.6 billion in all of 2020.</p>
<p>The takeaway here, both in life and in startups, is that the <em>first </em>anything is rarely a result of a single decision. Often, if you look closely, a massive milestone is due to an amalgamation of different wins, successes, failures, and tinier milestones along the way. This doesn’t take away its title as the biggest tech startup to go public in India (relevant, and rare!) but it does suggest that ripple effects aren’t just a side effect of a financing event, but maybe the impetus of the IPO in the first place.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll get into emerging fund manager trends, as well as funding round advice that has nothing to do with closing a round.

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Friends! Hello and thanks for dropping by. Today we have lots of our usual fare: Funding rounds to digest, some data on the startup market (thank you, DocSend), and the like. But we’re starting with a passion of mine: Racing.</p>
<p>The Exchange has made various jokes about technology money finding its way into the Formula One world this year. Companies like Splunk and Webex and Microsoft and Zoom and Oracle and others are sponsoring teams, races and the league itself.</p>
<p>One particular F1 partner of note is Amazon. Its public cloud project, AWS, has powered on-screen graphics for the sport, for example. Sure, sometimes fans wonder precisely how the group’s compute clusters are coming up with certain metrics, but AWS’ notes on tire wear are useful and timely.</p>
<p>It turns out, however, that behind the scenes Amazon has been more active in the F1 world than I had previously understood. In short, the tech-and-F1 money story that we’ve discussed was just a piece of a larger puzzle. How so? It turns out that AWS was key to the design process of F1’s new 2022 car.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178795" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178795" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178795" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png" alt="" width="1024" height="518" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=768,389 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=680,344 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=1536,778 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178795" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Formula One</p></div></p>
<p>Pretty neat, yeah?</p>
<p>I’ll bet you are wondering why it is so swoopy. The answer to that is that the car is designed with some very specific aerodynamic goals in mind. Like reducing something called “dirty air,” a phenomenon when the wind flying off the back of an F1 car makes the car following it struggle to stay on the track.</p>
<p>Today’s F1 cars &#8212; we’re in the midst of the last season with the current generation of Formula One hardware; <a href="https://twitter.com/LandoNorris">let’s go Lando!</a> &#8212; generate lots of dirty air. Which makes for somewhat awkward racing as the cars on the track can’t get too close to one another for fear of losing their all-important downforce. You know, the stuff that keeps the cars on the tarmac and not in the wall.</p>
<p>To design a base car that will do what F1 wanted for its next era of competition, namely cut dirty air and allow for more close racing, a lot of computing effort had to go into computational fluid dynamics, or CFD. And it turns out that AWS handled the computing needs of the racing group.</p>
<p>The Exchange got on Amazon Chime &#8212; our first time on the platform, we might add &#8212; to chat with F1’s Rob Smedley, its director of Data Systems, to chat about how it all came together. Per the former Ferrari and Williams engineer, the racing org and Amazon have been working on the new car project since 2018. F1 has lots of in-house brains to handle its own side of the affair, while Amazon provided thousands of cores to do all the tricky math.</p>
<p>According to Smedley, if his team had used the same computing power that individual F1 teams are allowed &#8212; the sport of Formula One racing is replete with regulations designed to help keep teams on a somewhat equal footing, or to hold Mercedes back, depending on your perspective &#8212; it would have taken four days per compute cycle to model two of the new cars driving one behind the other.</p>
<p>But with Amazon providing 2,500 compute cores, Smedley and the data boffins at F1 could get the same work done in six or eight hours. That means that the group could run more simulations and design a better car. At times they absorbed even more compute, with the data director telling The Exchange that at one point last year his team was running simulations on more than a dozen iterations concurrently. That was made possible by around 7,500 cores powering the data work. The simulation runs took 30 hours.</p>
<p>This is all to say that yes, there is lots of tech money in Formula One helping the teams do their job and stay financially solvent. But there’s also a boatload of tech going into the real guts and bolts of F1 as well. And as an F1 dweeb, it brings me great joy to see a passion of mine intersect with work.</p>
<p>Now, back to our more regular fare.</p>
<h2>The Midwest’s latest unicorn</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.m1finance.com/">M1 Finance</a> is a company that keeps cropping up in my reporting life. Mostly because it keeps raising money and announcing new performance metrics. This week the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/m1-finance-raises-150m-in-softbank-led-series-e-boosts-valuation-to-1-45b/">landed a $150 million round at a valuation of $1.45 billion</a>. The consumer fintech superapp’s latest funding was led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>So, why do we care? Well what’s super fun about M1 is that the company told us how to track its revenue growth over time. Early in my coverage of the startup its CEO said that it hopes to generate around 1% of its assets under management (AUM) as revenue. So, we can kinda back-of-the-envelope the company’s revenue growth by tracking how quickly it accretes AUM.</p>
<p>And the company keeps releasing AUM numbers. (PR folks, providing longitudinal data is a great way to keep us interested in a startup!)</p>
<p>Here’s a rundown of M1’s AUM over time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/m1-finance-raises-33m-series-b-as-it-reaches-1-45b-aum/#:~:text=M1%20Finance%20caught%20TechCrunch%E2%80%99s%20attention%20earlier%20in%20the,was%20faring%20in%20the%20current%20savings-and-investing%20fintech%20boom.">June, 2020</a>: $1.45 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/m1-finance-closes-45m-series-c-mere-months-after-it-raised-its-33m-series-b/">October, 2020</a>: $2 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/m1-finance-raises-another-rapid-fire-round-after-scaling-its-aum-to-more-than-3-5b/">March, 2021</a>: $3.5 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/m1-finance-raises-150m-in-softbank-led-series-e-boosts-valuation-to-1-45b/">July, 2021</a>: $4.5 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>At its 1% target, those work out to target run rates of $14.5 million, $20 million, $35 million and $45 million. Or the company effectively tripled its revenues since last June. That’s pretty good and is the sort of growth that investors want to back. Hence today’s round. And M1’s new unicorn price tag.</p>
<h2>Truveta</h2>
<p>Remember <a href="https://truveta.com/">Truveta</a>? We’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/can-data-fix-healthcare/">talked about it before</a>, back when it was taking the wraps off its plans. Former Microsoft exec Terry Myerson is part of the team, and since I used to cover Microsoft for a living I paid attention to the startup’s early days. Truveta, as a reminder, wants to “collect oodles of data from healthcare providers, anonymize it, aggregate it and make it available to third parties for research,” as we put it last time.</p>
<p>Well, this week the startup announced new partnerships <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2021/07/provider-led-data-company-truveta-raises-95m-adds-3-new-health-system-members/?rf=1">and $95 million in funding</a>. That’s a pretty big check! The startup now has 17 partner health groups to boot.</p>
<p>By bringing together lots more data in one place, the startup hopes to help make the medical world better and more equitable. And now it has a zillion bucks to go after that goal. Let’s see what it can get done.</p>
<h2>Other important things</h2>
<p>To save modestly on word count and avoid braking the c0py editng stiff here at TechCrunch [<em>ed. note: done broke</em>], here’s the rest of what’s important that we couldn’t get to in other pieces:</p>
<p><strong>Cambridge Savings Bank (CSB) gets into fintech: </strong>Remember how Goldman launched Marcus, a digital bank for regular folks? It’s not alone in the effort. Now CSB has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210715005660/en/Cambridge-Savings-Bank-Launches-New-Digital-Only-Division-Ivy-Bank">built and launched its own digital-first bank called Ivy</a>. Frankly I kinda like this idea: Take a bank that has a long operating history and a classic tech stack and services suite. Then build something right next to it that is more modern. It’s probably a better solution than trying to force an old bank to learn new tricks. Also if more banks do this, it undercuts neobanks to some degree, right?</p>
<p><strong>Code-X raises $5 million, proves that you can share your valuation and not burst into flame: </strong>A small note that <a href="https://codex-ai.com/">Code-X</a>, a Florida-based startup that has built a “lattice-based data protection platform,” is now worth $40 million thanks to its latest capital raise. No, I don’t know what a “lattice-based data protection platform” is. But I do know that Code-X announced its <em>valuation</em> as part of an <em>early-stage </em>round. That’s worth applauding. Good on Code-X.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, data from DocSend: </strong>The document-sending company with a somewhat literal name dropped some <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/docsend-startup-index-shows-sustained-substantial-startup-fundraising-activity-during-pandemic-and-recovery-301331992.html?utm_campaign=Email%20%7C%202019-11-22%20DocSend%20Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=140759858&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_GQi9y_I1HFi0ZmWjDF8xlWu0G6BLQQjYUKa1BfB7AAFT-ZKtzNuw7NJwLt6IYlM7TpgQxdoJLud5s4nKk6i2xr1dKABrAIpInSc7-ci50VacbWFQ&amp;utm_content=140759858&amp;utm_source=hs_email">new data this week</a> that I’ve been chewing on. Here’s the core bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>[N]ew Q2 2021 data from DocSend&#8217;s Startup Index shows a 41% year-over-year (YOY) increase in investor interest and engagement (a proxy for demand) with startup pitch decks. Links created by founders actively fundraising with their pitch decks (an indicator of supply) were up 36% YOY in Q2 2021.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is this fun? Demand went up more than supply! Ha! That really kinda says it all.</p>
<p>We’ve been digging into the venture world’s Q2 results for weeks now, and somehow failed to summarize succinctly. <em>Why</em> are startup valuations going up? <em>Why </em>are startups raising more, and faster? Because amongst venture-backable companies, investor demand is far greater than startup supply.</p>
<p>2021 in a nutshell.</p>
<p><strong>You are amazing and delightful and look great today!</strong></p>
<p>Next week we’ll have notes on two battery-focused SPACs, namely Evonix and SES. Lots to chat about there when it comes to battery tech, energy density and the future of well, everything. And money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like some of the best consumer tech from the last decade, I didn&#8217;t know I needed an e-bike until I was on one, breezing down the bike lane contemplating my newfound freedom.</p>
<p>Before buying a Nintendo Switch, I would have never guessed how much a candy-colored gaming console that I could pop out of a dock and into my backpack for long flight would fill me with joy. An e-bike, particularly <em>this</em> e-bike, <a href="http://vanmoof.com/en-US/x3?color=dark&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw3MSHBhB3EiwAxcaEu2vDbElIhrXbpA5MERweQ-xnfvwk3JfhTxtJaK_-D3z0H8Xfxo0KXRoCSnoQAvD_BwE">the VanMoof X3</a>, feels like that.</p>
<p>I live in Portland, Oregon, land of ample bike lanes and naked bike rides. When I first moved here, I biked everywhere, but that habit slowly dissolved over the years. First, I bought a car for weekend camping trips, which slowly became weekday errand running.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A few years later, I got diagnosed with a chronic illness and suddenly found myself much less confident in what my body could do and where it could comfortably take me. Over time, my bike would only see a handful of rides a season on beautiful days, when I&#8217;d always sigh and think <em>I wish I biked more — it makes me feel good!</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178888" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Before testing the X3, I&#8217;d find excuses to drive short distances instead of riding my bike. <em>What if I got tired and didn&#8217;t feel like biking home? What if it starts pouring rain? What&#8217;s if it&#8217;s too hot? What if I&#8217;m too sweaty when I get to the office?</em> Riding an e-bike erases most of those concerns outright.</p>
<p>The X3 is an effortless enough ride that I can still zoom to work if it&#8217;s 95+ degrees out. It&#8217;s fast enough that I can get out of a surprise rainstorm quickly if need be. If I don&#8217;t want to be sweaty at the start of the day, I can lean on sweet, sweet electricity to whisk me away, rolling up to my office without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>And it can&#8217;t go unstated that going fast on a bike — the whole time, with as much or little effort as you feel like putting in — is really, really fun. If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to try an e-bike, know that the sensation of effortlessly zipping around, electricity near-imperceptibly humming beneath you, is difficult to describe and best experienced first-hand.</p>
<p>VanMoof&#8217;s handsome pair of high tech bikes, the X3 and its larger cousin the S3, are far from the only options on the market, so some of their pluses would hold true for any electric bike. But that doesn&#8217;t make the VanMoof interchangeable either. The VanMoof X3 has a very specific look, feel and feature set that will perfectly suit a certain kind of rider (myself included) but other e-bike shoppers will still want to play the field. We&#8217;ll get into that — here goes!</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178880" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178880" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178880 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?w=680" alt="VanMoof X3 e-bike" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178880" class="wp-caption-text">Matrix display shows battery life, speed and other key info.</p></div></p>
<h2>APPEARANCE</h2>
<p>I tested the VanMoof X3 over the S3 not by choice — its geometry is a little wacky looking in pictures — but because I&#8217;m 5&#8217;4&#8243;. The X3, which fits anybody from 5&#8242;-6&#8217;5&#8243;, is a little smaller and less traditional looking than the S3, which suits anyone taller than 5&#8217;8&#8243;. The X3 has 24&#8243; wheels rather than the S3&#8217;s 28&#8243; wheels and it has a little bungee-corded platform in the front where presumably you could carry something, but I still have no idea what (You can also buy an add-on front basket that slots in there and looks very cute.)</p>
<p>Like most e-bikes, the X3 is much, much heavier than a normal road or commuter bike. The listed weight is 45.8 lbs and you&#8217;ll feel every pound of it if you ever need to carry it very far. I live in a standalone house in Portland, Oregon and had to carry the X3 down a very short front step to ride it — totally fine!</p>
<p>I used to live in a fifth floor walkup in Brooklyn and carrying it up or down that would have been impossible. If you can&#8217;t store the X3 (or most any e-bike) around ground level with access to a charger, it might not be a good fit for you. (Note that in our pictures, the small platform above the chain area is where an optional external battery pack, discussed later, sits. The platform is removable.)</p>
<p>Though on paper I&#8217;d prefer the look of the S3, the X3 doesn&#8217;t look strange at all IRL, whether parked or with somebody riding it. It&#8217;s cute, futuristic but not conspicuous and gets plenty of compliments. My wife described its aesthetic as &#8220;Death Star chic&#8221; and while I don&#8217;t totally know what that means, she&#8217;s not wrong. On the way to my office a sanitation truck driver rolled down his window to bellow &#8220;HEY—THAT&#8217;S A REALLY COOL BIKE.&#8221; Thanks, my dude!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178884" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?w=680" alt="VanMoof X3 e-bike" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The current generation of VanMoof e-bikes are coated in matte paint and you can choose between a classic, sexy matte black or a pleasantly cheery matte light blue. A previous version of the bikes used glossy coating, but apparently the matte is supposed to be more scratch resistant. The paint does seem pretty tough though it&#8217;s not totally bombproof. Somehow the handlebars picked up a little nick in the paint, though I still have no idea where it came from or what did it (owls?).</p>
<p>Something important to note is that neither the VanMoof X3 or S3 look like e-bikes. They don&#8217;t have an ugly bulge jutting out from the frame and the top tube and down tube are both thick but uniform — and not so thick you&#8217;d think twice about it.</p>
<p>The electronic components are nestled away in the frame and even the drivetrain is tucked away and enclosed. And while there&#8217;s a deeply cool LED matrix display embedded in the top tube, only the rider really sees it. For anyone looking for an e-bike that doesn&#8217;t scream <em>e-bike!!!!</em> the VanMoof is one of the best choices if not the best choice you could make. It&#8217;s an awesome looking bike — not just an awesome looking e-bike.</p>

<h2>RIDING</h2>
<p>The VanMoof X3 is a nice-looking bike — you get it. But what about, you know, the biking? I can confidently report that from the first time you hop on it to your twentieth commute to work, the X3 is an absolute joy to ride.</p>
<p>As an e-bike newcomer I had reservations. Would the electric assistance cheapen the magic of riding a bike? Do I really want a bike<em> doing the shifting for me?</em> As it turns out, quite the opposite and yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>The VanMoof X3 (and its sibling the S3) give you an electric boost while pedaling — you&#8217;ll still be pedaling but it feels enticingly easy and you&#8217;ll go faster with less effort. The bike also features a Turbo Boost button on the right-side handlebar that gives you a big boost on top of the smoother normal electronic assistance, up to 20 miles per hour in the U.S.</p>
<p>You can choose the amount of help that you want. Using the VanMoof app, which we&#8217;ll get to, or a physical button, you can select what level of power assist you&#8217;d like from zero to four. Zero is you pedaling a heavy-ass bike alone with no help (it sucks) and four makes everything feel so easy there&#8217;s almost no way to break a sweat.</p>
<p>In my time testing the bike, I&#8217;d use &#8220;two&#8221; when I felt like getting a bit of a workout with extra pep in my pedal, four when I was in a hurry to get to my co-working space in the mornings and three the rest of the time, like riding to brunch on a weekend. Being able to choose the level of pedal assistance is a huge perk and it makes the bike feel flexible for different uses.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178885" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178885" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178885 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?w=680" alt="VanMoof X3 e-bike" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178885" class="wp-caption-text">The kick lock button, back wheel and enclosed chain.</p></div></p>
<p>Whatever mode you&#8217;re on, the turbo boost button is a killer feature. It flattens steep hills and makes it feel way safer to zip across busy intersections where you&#8217;re not sure drivers are paying attention. It&#8217;s fun and awesome for safe, defensive city riding.</p>
<p>It takes a little bit to get used to the automatic electronic shifting but that&#8217;s silky smooth too. I initially assumed that, like many things that worked perfectly well before having some extraneous &#8220;smart&#8221; high-tech nonsense draped over them (fridges! lamps! vibrators!) the technology would fail just often enough to be a nuisance.</p>
<p>After a long period of testing, I can report that the X3 rides as smooth and seamless as ever. Every once in a while I&#8217;d crunch down on the pedal or a gear won&#8217;t catch right away but it&#8217;s super rare. You can even use the app to customize when the bike shifts up and down and it&#8217;s worth playing around with that to find something that feels just right.</p>
<p>What else? The X3&#8217;s maximum assisted speed is in the U.S. is 20 mph (32km/hr), but anyone in Europe will be limited to 15.5 mph (25km/hr). The U.S. speed feels great and it&#8217;s painless to get up to 20mph and maintain that speed with the X3 in a way I&#8217;d have to destroy my quads to manage otherwise, even on my zippy non-electric road bike.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the seat is very comfy and the ride is pleasantly upright and natural. After riding the X3 for a while I had a hard time going back to hunching over on my (adorable) little Bianchi and pined for the comfy ride I&#8217;d gotten so used to.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178881" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178881" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178881 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02419.jpg?w=680" alt="VanMoof X3 e-bike" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02419.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02419.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02419.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02419.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02419.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02419.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02419.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02419.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178881" class="wp-caption-text">Tail light from the future.</p></div></p>
<h2>VALUE</h2>
<p>The VanMoof X3 is an excellent value, all things considered. The company has a weird habit of tinkering with its pricing, but after a redesign and a colossal price drop in 2020 ($3,398 to $1,998 at the time) the bikes feel very well priced. Now they&#8217;re retailing for $2,298 — $300 more than the previous price but still a fine deal for anyone looking for a very full-featured e-bike without spending more than around $2,000.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not <em>that</em> much more than you&#8217;d spend on a regular new bike, sans electricity and VanMoof&#8217;s many, many cool bells and whistles. If you&#8217;re into higher end bikes, it could even be a lot less. And realistically, it&#8217;s just as likely that you&#8217;re shopping for an e-bike to rely less on a car, public transportation or whatever else you&#8217;re paying for to get around — not to replace a traditional bike. (For something in the U.S. in the sub-$2,000 range, check out <a href="https://www.radpowerbikes.com/">Rad Power Bikes</a> and <a href="https://www.chargebikes.com/products/city-electric-bike?sscid=71k5_gk7h8">Charge</a> for some good options.)</p>
<p>VanMoof&#8217;s pricing is also substantially less than you&#8217;d pay for the <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a22132137/best-electric-bikes/">high end tier</a> of feature-rich e-bikes with high quality components, but the company still manages to compete with those on looks and features. Still, it&#8217;s kind of stressful that VanMoof is quietly messing around with the pricing with the bikes already out in the wild. It would suck to plan to buy one only to see the price shoot up before you&#8217;d pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>The company should be more transparent about this, giving set future dates for planned price changes. There also seem to be updates within generations of the bikes, so an X3 you buy now might differ from an X3 you could buy in 2020. That&#8217;s confusing and all of it should be made clearer somewhere obvious on the website.</p>

<h2>RANGE</h2>
<p>One of the biggest considerations with an e-bike (or an e-anything!) is range. VanMoof says the X3&#8217;s range is 37 miles using &#8220;full power&#8221; and up to 93 miles in economy mode. If you&#8217;re getting 93 miles out of the battery, you probably aren&#8217;t even using the pedal assistance at all, so you can just toss that number out. The low end estimate of 37 miles might be a little generous for someone who&#8217;s using the bike on the fourth power assistance level and smashing the turbo boost regularly, but 35-45 miles feels about right from my testing (usually mode 3 or 4, occasionally 2, light use of turbo button).</p>
<p>The range feels good. Even using the X3 most days out of the week, charging is infrequent enough to never feel annoying. In my case, that meant daily short rides (2.5-5 miles, usually) and the occasional longer ride (10-20 miles). If you&#8217;re using the X3 or S3 to commute to work somewhere that&#8217;s farther away, you&#8217;re going to find yourself plugging in more. Even so, I never got into a situation where I was concerned that I&#8217;d run out of battery far from home. And even if you do, you can still pedal the bike — it&#8217;s just really heavy. Most people will probably charge up overnight, but you can fill up the battery in four hours if you need to.</p>
<p>Something to note is that you&#8217;ll plug in a wall charger directly to the bike to charge it. For anyone who can&#8217;t charge and store the X3 on ground level, know you&#8217;ll have to carry the whole dang bike to an outlet. The lack of a removable battery might be a strike against the VanMoof bikes for folks who live in walk-ups or small apartments, but for people with somewhere easy to store it, this wasn&#8217;t something I thought twice about.</p>
<p>While the built-in range is totally adequate for a lot of use cases, VanMoof just introduced an external add-on battery pack for both the X3 and S3. The battery slots into a little platform, pictured below and mounted on our test bike, and it extends the X3&#8217;s range considerably. VanMoof sells the PowerBank accessory for $348. The thing isn&#8217;t small — it weighs six pounds — but VanMoof says it&#8217;ll give you anywhere from 28 to 62 miles of extra range. Again, almost nobody is going to hit the high end of this, but even at the low end it almost doubles the bike&#8217;s existing range.</p>

<p>The PowerBank is big and pretty clunky. It doesn&#8217;t look <em>awful</em>, but it definitely makes the X3 look like an e-bike. It&#8217;s not elegant like the removable battery on the Cowboy, another extremely handsome e-bike, but it&#8217;s ok. If everything else about a VanMoof suits you perfectly but you need more range, it&#8217;s great to have the option, even if you&#8217;ll be shelling out for it.</p>

<h2>TECH FEATURES</h2>
<p>The tech bells and whistles are something that really makes the VanMoof X3 and S3 stand out from the crowd. The X3&#8217;s price feels reasonable for a reliable, great-looking e-bike, but on top of that you&#8217;ll be getting an electric steed with some pretty sweet tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Matrix display:</strong> On the bike&#8217;s top tube an array of LED lights built into the metal displays your speed, battery life and other useful info. This is a killer feature, it&#8217;s extremely cool!</li>
<li><strong>Alarm</strong>. You can activate an alarm that will *literally growl* at anyone who jostles your bike. It&#8217;s intense and really loud.</li>
<li><strong>Kick lock.</strong> You can kick a small physical button to alarm the bike and lock the back wheel. If you live in a city with bike theft, someone could still toss the bike in a truck easily so this isn&#8217;t a single security solution (I used a normal mini Kryptonite lock and that worked great.)</li>
<li><strong>Find My on iOS.</strong> If you&#8217;re an iOS user you can<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FdbKqrw6Q8&amp;feature=emb_title"> track your bike&#8217;s whereabouts easily</a>. It&#8217;s a nice feature, though ideally if your bike is well-locked you aren&#8217;t going to be messing with this much.</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2178878" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178878" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2178878" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?w=680" alt="Vanmoof Find My iOS" width="680" height="361" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg 2209w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=1536,816 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=2048,1088 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178878" class="wp-caption-text">VanMoof support for &#8220;Find My&#8221; app in iOS</p></div></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lights.</strong> The VanMoof X3 has great built-in lights, front and back.</li>
<li><strong>App:</strong> Surprisingly, the app is actually pretty good. You can customize lots of small things (bell noise, alarm on or off, shifting preferences), use it to track your rides and more. You also don&#8217;t have to be connected to the bike with the app to do the most essential stuff, liking riding it, unlocking it and changing your level of electric assistance. I had an occasional connectivity problem with the app (usually on Android) but this was easily resolved and never kept me from biking anywhere, though it did mean some rides weren&#8217;t automatically tracked. Importantly, you can also track your bike&#8217;s whereabouts through the app and VanMoof touts this feature combined with its alarm system and recovery team for helping people get their bikes back.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, something great about the X3 is that the tech features aren&#8217;t just fancy tricks — they really enhance the experience. And even so, they&#8217;re optional. You can ride the bike and benefit from the power assistance without using the app. You can use a regular lock and skip the alarm system if you choose to, or use a physical button code to disable it manually. You can change the power assistance mode with the same button. This is all huge and lets you use the e-bike how you want to. Personally, I&#8217;d never buy an e-bike that required connectivity, a phone or an app to operate it; that&#8217;s just asking for trouble.</p>
<h2>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
<p><strong>Shipping and Assembly:</strong> The VanMoof X3 and S3 come in the mail in a big box. The assembly process was almost painless — except for this one really fiddly bit you have to slide into another fiddly bit which took me the better part of an hour and some searching on the VanMoof subreddit (not the only one with this problem!)</p>
<p><strong>Extra Support: </strong>VanMoof offers three paid plans to keep your bike in working order and in your possession. You can buy a three-year maintenance plan for $348, a three-year theft recovery plan for $398 or a combined plan for $690 (broken down via VanMoof below).</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Where you live should be a major consideration when thinking about buying a VanMoof. In my time testing it for reliability over an extended period, I was surprised by how few problems came up. I had to mess around with re-centering the front wheel at some point because a brake pad was rubbing, but aside from occasional app connectivity issues, that was pretty much it. Of course, significant wear and tear means any bike could benefit from a pro tune up from someone who knows the model.</p>
<p>VanMoof has full-fledged stores in Amsterdam, London, Paris, Berlin, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Tokyo. Beyond its flagship stores, the company <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/dutch-e-bike-maker-vanmoof-is-on-a-massive-expansion-drive">relies on an expanding network of service centers</a> and &#8220;certified workshops&#8221; to maintain its bikes, so be sure to check what&#8217;s near you. Personally, I&#8217;d want to be near enough to a VanMoof store or at least a service center to guarantee my $2,000+ investment and its many, many technological bits could be maintained in perfect health. Nobody wants to ship a bike back for repairs, especially a heavy, technologically complex one.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178892" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Prior to testing out the X3, e-bikes aren&#8217;t something I&#8217;d thought a lot about and I wasn&#8217;t really sure who they were for. I first heard of VanMoof a couple of years ago when a close friend and much more serious biker than me bought one for towing her dog (the goodest girl) on a long work commute. We rode to the farmer&#8217;s market together and I admired her VanMoof, but I was skeptical that something with so much technology under the hood could prove reliable over time.</p>
<p>Bikes are mechanical and simple — that&#8217;s something wonderful about them! Could an e-bike really translate the joyful simplicity of biking into something much more high tech? As it turns out, yes. After test riding the VanMoof X3 to get a sense of its reliability and how its features hold up in normal day-to-day use, I regret my early skepticism.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I can overstate how much riding an e-bike, specifically this e-bike, enhanced my life in small ways for the better while I tried it out. Biking more — and e-bikes <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/08/11/electric-bike-riders-more-exercise-than-cyclists/">do get people biking more</a> — makes me happier and healthier. Biking more has helped me ease out of an intensely sedentary pandemic period into new habits that make me feel more connected to the world around me. I&#8217;m seeing my city with fresh eyes, biking to new neighborhoods I&#8217;ve never explored and appreciating all of the little things I took for granted. My only e-bike regret is not hopping on one sooner.</p>

That’s a lot of money. The deal could help make Intel a full-stack chipmaker able to make silicon for, well, just about anything. More capacity for manufacturing during a global chip shortage wouldn’t be so bad, right?</li>
<li><strong>What’s next for Virgin Galactic:</strong> Our own Devin Coldewey got <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/virgin-galactic-president-mike-moses-on-whats-next-for-the-companys-growing-fleet/">some time with the president of Virgin Galactic</a></strong> to chat about the future of the company after its recent jaunt to space (or nearly space, depending on how you measure). It turns out the company expects to reuse its space plane hundreds of times. That should make for pretty attractive economics, we reckon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/digital-lending-platform-blend-valued-at-over-4b-in-its-public-debut/"><strong>Blend is no longer a startup:</strong></a> Banking tech unicorn Blend went public this week. It’s now worth $4 billion or so, more than its final private round. So consider the company not only no longer a startup, but also no longer a private unicorn. Blend’s software powers the mortgage option in other apps, making it a company that you may not have heard of but may have used.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/taste-intelligence-startup-halla-closes-4-5m-series-a1-to-predict-what-grocery-items-shoppers-will-buy/">Halla raises $4.5M to help guess what you are going to eat:</a></strong> Buying groceries online is big business. Amazon is into it. It’s Instacart’s core remit. And European grocery delivery services have been raising oodles of money. Halla wants to help those companies sell more stuff by “using human behavior to steer shoppers to food items they want while also discovering new ones as they shop online.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/rivian-delays-deliveries-of-r1t-r1s-electric-vehicles-again/">Rivian once again delays EV deliveries:</a> </strong>The global chip shortage &#8212; see our earlier note regarding Intel &#8212; is showing up in a host of places, including Rivian’s ramp toward commercial production of its electric vehicles. Other issues are holding the company up, but this chip shortage is a real kettle of fish for companies of all shapes and sizes.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/yummy-raises-4m-aims-to-be-super-app-of-venezuela/">Yummy wants to build Venezuela’s superapp:</a> </strong>Then there’s Yummy, which just raised a $4 million round. It has big aspirations: ride-hailing, delivery and more. The superapp model may have been spearheaded in Asia, but it’s going global. Yummy will need more than $4 million to build it, however. So if things go well, expect the company to raise again in short order.</li>

<h2>Outdoorsy co-founders detail how they expanded the sharing economy to RVs</h2>
<p>Seven years ago, ad executive Jen Young and tech entrepreneur Jeff Cavins stepped away from the careers they&#8217;d built to launch Outdoorsy, an RV rental marketplace.</p>
<p>Last month, they announced a partnership with high-end camping company Collective Retreats and raised a $90 million Series D and $40 million in debt to speed up an already impressive rate of growth.</p>
<p>To learn more about their approach to building a transportation company that caters to people who crave a taste of nomadic existence, Rebecca Bellan interviewed Young and Cavins for Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>Their conversation explored the impacts of COVID-19, their business strategy and why they decided to take on $30 million in debt financing:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Jeff Cavins:</strong> We like to look at macro trends as a business and I think U.S. monetary policy is going to get us all in a little bit of trouble. So we wanted to lock in a credit facility for the company at advantageous terms.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At our recent Early Stage event, we had the opportunity to talk at length with Arvind Purushotham, the managing director and global head of Citi Ventures, about how startups should think about corporate venture arms, including what a check from an enterprise like Citi can mean, and how to leverage that kind of Goliath once it&#8217;s already a financial partner.</p>
<p>For founders trying to understand the benefits and potential pitfalls of working with a corporate venture arm versus a more traditional venture team, it&#8217;s very much worth zipping through this discussion.</p>
<p>Among the many topics addressed, Purushotham gave us insight into how corporates have altered the way they work in recent years, driven by necessity. Unsurprisingly, he said that they&#8217;ve had to move faster in order to remain competitive. Still, owing to Citi&#8217;s already-in-place internal systems &#8212; involving risk and compliance teams and senior management &#8212; he insisted that moving faster mostly hasn&#8217;t been a problem.</p>
<p>Said Purushotham: &#8220;We have not had to wait for a second close or we&#8217;ve not had to request the company to do a second close. We&#8217;ve been able to close along with the rest of the the syndicate.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google favors large sites more than ever, basically because it is trying to avoid providing misinformation in our polarized age.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you hire a marketing consultant, you don&#8217;t necessarily expect to wind up discussing your life&#8217;s purpose. Yet, that is what Spanish marketing expert and entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abarrera/">Alex Barrera</a> often ends up doing with startup founders who hire him to help improve their pitch. They think they are going to get help convincing investors, and they do, but the byproduct of the process is that they reframe their startup&#8217;s vision.</p>
<p>In this context, ethical and philosophical considerations aren&#8217;t that far away, because more often than not, this includes a deep look at how their company impacts society. &#8220;The days where you could do whatever you wanted and dive into grey legal or moral areas are dwindling,&#8221; Barrera says. &#8220;Growth companies need to be careful about the potential fallouts of pursuing such strategies. While there are still plenty of investors that push for &#8220;growth at any cost,&#8221; the social pressure is changing and it&#8217;s suddenly becoming costlier to take such stances.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may have spotted Barrera&#8217;s cowboy hat at one of the many startup conferences he is involved with as a mentor, judge, host or speaker &#8212; and he does wear many hats.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Having previously co-founded two startup accelerators and Europe-focused tech publication <a href="https://tech.eu/">Tech.eu</a>, he now authors <a href="https://thealeph.com/">The Aleph Report</a>, a periodical publication on cutting-edge technology and its implications. But it is through his Press42 venture that he collaborates with startups and corporations on organizational storytelling and strategic communications, and it is also what we discussed in the interview below (which has been edited for length and clarity).</p>
<blockquote><p><em>TechCrunch is asking founders who have worked with growth marketers to share a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this survey</a>. We’ll use your answers to find more experts to interview.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><b>What do people often misunderstand about pitch training?</b></p>
<p>Well, it depends on their experience level. When first-time entrepreneurs hear about pitching, they immediately think of the infamous &#8220;elevator pitch,&#8221; roll their eyes and moan. For those with a bit more experience, pitching is about a set of slides to achieve a certain goal, mostly funding. However, seasoned managers end up discovering that telling the story of their product or service is not a one-way street. Having to sell a future vision of where the company is heading invariably affects your conception of the product in the now and what you need to build to achieve it. The vision impacts the product, because you need consistency between the product and storytelling.</p>
<p><b>What type of companies do you help?</b></p>
<p>I have been helping startups with pitching for years. This used to be mostly early-stage startups, and in groups, with accelerators and startup competitions calling me to help their entire batch or portfolio. I still provide that sort of training, but these days I will more often work one-on-one with a single client that is at a later stage. And I also sometimes work with tech companies getting ready for M&amp;As, as well as large corporations.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;I don&#8217;t work with companies that sell smoke and mirrors or hurt society because they shamelessly disregard any responsibility for their impact on others.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><b>What is your sweet spot for startups you work with?</b></p>
<p>For one-on-one work, I have a preference for David versus Goliath, and less sexy spaces. I love these companies that were built without the noise: There&#8217;s a lack of hubris, they are really humble, but the numbers are there &#8212; the founders could be obnoxious, but it&#8217;s the opposite. I don&#8217;t work with companies that sell smoke and mirrors or hurt society because they shamelessly disregard any responsibility for their impact on others.</p>
<p>Luckily, that&#8217;s rarely the case of people who call me. Usually, they are a bit out of the circuit, and they often have impostor syndrome. So my work is also about helping them understand what they can be proud of what they do, and then how to show that in their pitch. They value talking to someone who understands them and their challenges. I spend a lot of time doing research on all verticals and thinking about the future, so the conversation will typically go like this: &#8220;Dude, you get it!&#8221;</p>
<p><b>What is one of your favorite things about one-on-one pitch-related consulting work?</b></p>
<p>I find it very fulfilling to see how much value it brings to those involved. I am also a developer, and I do project management, but most of the consulting I do is not the kind of growth marketing stuff that takes more time to show results. When you do growth hacking at the product level, it takes time to see the impact, and even then, it&#8217;s not always easy to connect the dots.</p>
<p>When we work together on their pitch, CEOs can instantly see if the new pitch resonates or not; and they also know if the exercise itself worked for them. Working on a pitch requires a lot of reflection and it entails a lot of tension between you and the CEO.</p>
<p>This is especially true at the beginning, when you keep questioning why they did this or that, what the product provides and to whom, or why it grew here and not there. All these questions force many founders and managers to stop and think hard about the product, the market or the roadmap. Sometimes it pushes them to provide data to back up certain claims. The process pushes them to revisit old biases, beliefs or even myths around their company. Many people are surprised by how much clarity they gain into their company when they work on a pitch.</p>
<p><b>Do you only work with founders and executives?</b></p>
<p>Sometimes, the clarity and the strategic insight that working on a pitch provides to founders or CXOs becomes a trigger for them wanting to provide that level of understanding to other areas of the company, like sales, customer support or even the product team. In my case, being a developer myself enables me to switch and adapt my process to any layer of the organization, including the development team.</p>
<p>This is rare, but it eventually turns me into a kind of translator of the challenges of different parts of an organization, acting ultimately as the connector bridging different perceptions. In the end, that&#8217;s exactly what storytelling provides. It&#8217;s not just a tool for pitching, it&#8217;s a brutally effective way to communicate between humans, especially around challenging topics.</p>
<p><b>How would you describe the value that executives get from your collaboration?</b></p>
<p>One of the usual and even surprising values for most executives is the insight the process provides. When someone is running either a big company or a scaleup, their day to day is all about growing. They rarely have time to sit down and think about where they&#8217;re heading in terms of future product. They do have a roadmap, and their KPIs, but I rarely see a strong future vision broken down into steps.</p>
<p>The pitching process provides them with two valuable things: time and perception. Time because as they&#8217;re paying me, they&#8217;re stuck with me and need to allocate time for our sessions. That bubble, and the need to build a coherent story that tells why the company is at that particular point, create tremendous insight for most. And then, there&#8217;s perception. It&#8217;s funny because they&#8217;re the ones that provide all the pieces of the picture, I just help them put them together and then point at the obvious.</p>
<p>This process is very rewarding at a personal level for them. It helps them build a confidence that, while it was always there, it rarely shone through the pitch before. It also makes them reflect on where they want to go next, not just from a product perspective, but from a mission&#8217;s perspective. It reconnects them with that side that most of us care about, and the personal questions we ask ourselves about life and meaning.</p>

<p><b>How do you bridge the gap between what your clients already know and what&#8217;s next?</b></p>
<p>My clients already know how to grow a company. I always keep this in mind, not just with startups, but also with big corporations — too often, I see consultants talking to them and starting by telling: &#8220;You are doing it wrong!&#8221; Well, they got to where they are, didn&#8217;t they? It doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t need help, but you can make them see that, you don&#8217;t have to dismiss what they have achieved. I see myself as the person that helps them get to the next level and build on top of what they have already done. Sometimes it takes some bruising to get there, but there is always massive respect for their achievements.</p>
<p>These people are very good professionals. It&#8217;s not that they don&#8217;t see or can&#8217;t see the vision. It&#8217;s that the need to connect the dots in detail allows for the emergence of a strategic vision of the organization. Now, here is where the real &#8220;coaching&#8221; kicks in. When such a picture emerges, many founders or executives tend to shy away from it. They have a hard time believing that they might be onto something groundbreaking or actually winning in their respective markets.</p>
<p>This is especially true for many scaleup companies. They&#8217;ve been fighting, first for market fit, and later on for market share, that they freeze at the possibility that they might be doing a fantastic job. Part of my role is precisely to break through their impostor syndrome and encourage them to be bolder, to believe in themselves, to trust the data.</p>
<p><b>How do you promote your services?</b></p>
<p>Well, it would be very hard for me to do cold calling. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to say: &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about pitching, you are going to see the future of your company!&#8221; — so I stopped even trying to market that. My best marketing tool is word of mouth from my clients, or even from people that see me perform on stage. But even then, people call for help with a specific milestone, like raising a round. It&#8217;s only through the process that they see that there&#8217;s way more to it. They begin to understand other parts about themselves that either enhance their capacity to raise more funds, or even take them to the next level like an acquisition or the development of a major breakthrough.</p>

<p><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you grow your startup?</em></p>

<hr />
<p><b>What do you end up actually working on with founders?</b></p>
<p>Going higher up the chain, the pitch becomes a very powerful tool not just for fundraising, but also for thinking about your company strategically. It&#8217;s a place where founders can reach clarity about their strategy and what really matters — questions they don&#8217;t have time for on a day-to-day basis. They allocate time to it because they think it will help with fundraising, and then they find out that it helps them understand their company.</p>
<p>So typically, they will call me because they are raising a Series B round, or a very large A round. They realize that to unlock the next milestone, they need to fine-tune what they say. The game is different; it&#8217;s not about market fit anymore, or just about gaining market share, and what worked for them just no longer works — especially if they were semi-bootstrapped up to that point. They need to talk to someone who understands them and can help them prepare for the future, for instance by researching certain pitfalls or trends. I&#8217;m not just the guy that &#8220;pitches&#8221; but the guy that&#8217;s going to provide you with ammo to help you build a compelling case for your audience, whatever it is. The pitch is just an excuse!</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;The thing is, scaleups and growth-stage startups have a choice in how they market themselves; so they need to be aware of ethical concerns that may arise sooner than later.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><b>What&#8217;s your take on comparing your startup to another one when pitching; for instance, calling yourself the &#8220;Uber for X&#8221;?</b></p>
<p>Analogies are very powerful. The major challenge when you are pitching any company, even a late-stage one, is that people have a tendency to put you in a box. So you have two options: either you let them do it, or you provide the tools to put you in a box. That&#8217;s where analogies work really well.</p>
<p>But then, who do you compare yourself to? It&#8217;s a challenge, because two elements are becoming increasingly important: capturing the right trends of the moment, and the ethics of how you do what you do. You want to control which box they place you, ideally one that&#8217;s trendy but at the same time one that doesn&#8217;t position you in apparently direct competition with someone you don&#8217;t want to be associated with.</p>
<p><b>Why do startups need to be careful when communicating?</b></p>
<p>Over the last few years, we have seen how startups are no longer seen as innocent by society; they no longer have &#8220;carte blanche,&#8221; and society is becoming a lot more sensitive. There&#8217;s a polarization issue around many topics, and we are increasingly going to see a clash between society and startups. It is even going to increase post-COVID, with tensions around automation versus jobs. And the thing is, scaleups and growth-stage startups have a choice in how they market themselves; so they need to be aware of ethical concerns that may arise sooner than later.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As pandemic drags on, interest in automation surges&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/as-pandemic-drags-on-interest-in-automation-surges/embed/#?secret=dw2b7buzEe" data-secret="dw2b7buzEe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Society is going to ask you for responsibility. What&#8217;s happening with big brands is trickling down, and scaleups are hitting that threshold sooner. Typically, it catches them unprepared, because they reach that stage only knowing local feelings about what they do, and suddenly getting national or regional blowback. Or they expand internationally with local operations led by really young people with no experience in dealing with politics, who suddenly face strong local blowback.</p>
<p>All of this has a lot to do with pitching, because it&#8217;s not about product anymore. So for instance, it&#8217;s about convincing public authorities at different levels to let you operate, when their incentives are very different from investors. It&#8217;s B2G2C — business to government to consumer. And we are seeing more and more startups, with regulation as a factor in their operations.</p>
<p><b>How can you talk to public authorities, customers and investors in a unified pitch?</b></p>
<p>The major pitch needs to bring all elements together. It needs to be clear on what you do, and hit the right notes on ethical concerns. It&#8217;s important both for regulators and for fundraising; because from the investors&#8217; perspective, it also reduces uncertainty around your business. As a scaleup, your ability to scale is a concern, so it helps to show that you are thinking and planning around societal impact.</p>
<p>I have to say that an increasing amount of investors do genuinely care about this. It may be because they have been burned, for instance from seeing regulatory blowback firsthand, or just because they are growing conscious. There are still some investors that have the &#8220;Uber mindset&#8221; and only care about muscle — grow first, and only then, deal with regulators — but more and more, VCs are aware that this might not fly, because society is changing. The pandemic is just highlighting this even more.</p>
<p><b>What about startups? Do they also care more about their societal impact?</b></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a pendulum, and the current generation is a child of the previous regulatory blowback. Crypto <a href="https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1415353984617914370">might still be on the other side</a>, but increasingly, startups are aware that there are societal implications they will have to deal with. I also try to bring that message across when I prepare my clients to pitch — and warn that it sometimes happens very quickly: We&#8217;ve seen how one prohibition in one place can spread like wildfire. So you need to regulate your initial message and also be prepared to adapt quickly.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The fintech sector has been hugely successful (and hugely profitable) for much of the last decade, and even more so during the pandemic. But it might come as a surprise to learn that many in the industry believe that the story is just beginning and the sector is poised to achieve much more, with fintech’s next decade <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/fintech-companies-must-balance-the-pursuit-of-profit-against-ethical-data-usage/">expected to be radically different</a> from the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Long before the pandemic, the way in which banks were regulated was changing. Initiatives like Open Banking and the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) were being proposed as a way to promote competition in the banking industry — allowing smaller challenger firms to break into a market that has long been dominated by corporate titans.</p>
<p>Now that these initiatives are in place, however, we’re seeing that their effect goes way beyond opening up a gap for challenger banks. Since open banking requires that banks make valuable data available via APIs, it is leading to a revolution in the way that small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) are funded — one in which data, and not hard capital, is the most important factor driving fintech success.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Open banking and data freedom</h2>
<p>In order to understand the changes that are sweeping fintech and reconfiguring the way that the industry works with small businesses, it’s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-banking.asp">important to understand open banking</a>. This is a concept that has really taken hold among governmental and supranational banking regulators over the past decade, and we are now beginning to see its impact across the banking sector.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Allowing third parties access to the data held at banks will allow the true financial position of SMEs to be assessed, many for the first time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>At its most fundamental level, open banking refers to the process of using APIs to open up consumers’ financial data to third parties. This allows these third parties to design, build and distribute their own financial products. The utility (and, ultimately, the profitability) of these products doesn’t rely on them holding huge amounts of capital — rather, it is the data they harvest and contain that endows them with value.</p>
<p>Open-banking models raise a number of challenges. One is that the banking industry will need to develop much more rigorous systems to continually seek consumer consent for data to be shared in this way. Though the early years of fintech have taught us that consumers are pretty relaxed when it comes to giving up their data — with some studies indicating that almost <a href="https://tokenist.com/study-over-60-of-americans-choose-fintech-over-data-privacy/">60% of Americans choose fintech over privacy</a> — the type and volume shared through open-banking frameworks is much more extensive than the products we have seen up until now.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the push toward open banking is progressing around the world. In Europe, the PSD2 (the Payment Services Directive) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/25/psd2-europes-banks-brace-for-new-eu-data-sharing-rules.html">requires large banks to share financial information</a> with third parties, and in Asia services like Alipay and WeChat in China, and Tez and PayTM in India are already altering the financial services market. The extra capabilities available through these services are already leading to calls for the U.S. banking system to embrace open banking to the same degree.</p>
<h2>Serving SMEs</h2>
<p>If the U.S. banking industry can be convinced of the utility of open banking, or if it is forced to do so via legislation, several groups are likely to benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers will be offered novel banking and investment products based on far more detailed data analysis than exists at present.</li>
<li>The fintech companies who design and build these products will also see the use of their products increase, and their profit margins alongside this.</li>
<li>Arguably, even banks will benefit, because even in the most open models it is banks who still act as the gatekeepers, deciding which third parties have access to consumer data, and what they need to do to access.</li>
</ul>
<p>By far the biggest beneficiary of open banking, however, will be SMEs. This is not necessarily because open-banking frameworks offer specific new functionality that will be useful to small and medium-sized businesses. Instead, it is a reflection of the fact that SMEs have historically been so poorly served by traditional banks.</p>
<p>SMEs are underserved <a href="https://www.smehorizon.com/underserved-smes-look-to-digital-banks-to-provide-enhanced-services-visa-study/">in a number of ways</a>. Traditional banks have an extremely limited ability to view the aggregate financial position of an SME that holds capital across multiple institutions and in multiple instruments, which makes securing finance very difficult.</p>
<p>In addition, SMEs often have to deal with dated and time-consuming manual interfaces to upload data to their bank. And (perhaps worst of all) the B2B payment systems in use at most banks provide very limited feedback to the businesses that use them — a lack of information that can cost businesses dearly.</p>
<h2>New capabilities</h2>
<p>Given these deficiencies, it’s not surprising that fintech startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/heres-why-so-many-fintech-startups-are-loaning-to-small-businesses/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFSiz8fMHelROZyWqzhM29Vg9vDtySACUiMehcM8V6eEQZefan9Evs23mWCs_MTMZvBk7a-skdv6ZgooGKYjSHd2bgIf_uozhoIlMjR7tml3AAcZ53IAHKH-XDBVb9SxM87Va6rhJtaQzC9a8_kEnvBp2hkmNUDDwD6Q2S2MZIpC">are keen to lend to small businesses</a>, and that SMEs are actively looking for novel banking products and services. There have, of course, already been some success stories in this space, and the kinds of banking systems available to SMEs today (especially in Europe) are leagues ahead of the services available even 10 years ago.</p>
<p>However, open banking promises to accelerate this transformation and dramatically improve the financial services available to the average SME. It will do this in several ways. Allowing third parties access to the data held at banks will allow the true financial position of SMEs to be assessed, many for the first time.</p>

<p>Via APIs, fintech companies will be <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/banking-matters/reimagining-transaction-banking-with-b2b-apis">able to access information</a> on different types of accounts, insurance, card accounts and leases, and consolidate data from multiple countries into one overall picture.</p>
<p>This, in turn, will have major effects on the way that credit-worthiness is assessed for SMEs. At the moment, there is a funding gap facing many SMEs, largely because banks have been hesitant to move away from the &#8220;balance sheet&#8221; model of assessing credit risk. By using real-time analytics on an SME’s current business activities, banks will be able to more accurately assess this risk and lend to more businesses.</p>
<p>In fact, this is already happening in countries where open banking is well advanced – in the U.K., Lloyds’ Business ToolBox offers unlimited credit checks on companies and directors in addition to account transaction data.</p>
<p>Open banking will <a href="https://www.kearney.com/financial-services/the-open-banking-series/the-impact-of-open-banking-on-smes">also allow peer comparison analytics</a> far ahead of what we have seen until now. APIs can be used to provide SMEs real-time feedback on how they are performing within their market sector. Again, this ability is already available in the U.K., with Barclays’ SmartBusiness Dashboard offering marketing effectiveness tools as part of a customizable business dashboard.</p>
<p>These capabilities will be so useful to SMEs that they are likely to drive the popularity of any fintech product that offers them. For SMEs, this value will lie mainly in intelligent data-analytics-based insights, recommendations and automatic prompts that can be built on top of account aggregation.</p>
<p>Then, additional insights generated from these same monitoring tools could enable banks and alternative lenders to be more proactive with their lending — offering preapproved lines of credit, in a timely manner, to SMEs that would have previously found it difficult to access funding.</p>
<h2>The bottom line</h2>
<p>Crucially for the fintech sector, it’s almost a certainty that SMEs will be willing to pay fees for data-analytics-based value-added services that help them grow. This is why some startups in this space are already attracting huge levels of funding, and why open banking is at the heart of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/the-intersection-of-small-business-tech-and-our-financial-system-is-more-important-than-ever/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJIIHIPRCxh8iK-yR6vfYApu4hjYuzJGXq6ijRiUBtNMpxI726P589qVTtU2FlbxQCUb35WHmb2hpNrsXZvAgFua158We7TFTenw5ozEjk_sIKkb-ofdNClRC31lZu9iAspWF399V5U5aT8o3bmwJCo16rkpGDjL5XtSsz9-Z0GJ">the relationship between tech and the economy</a>.</p>
<p>So if fintech has had a good year, this is likely to be just the start of the story. Backed by open-banking initiatives, the sector is now at the forefront of a banking revolution that will finally give SMEs the level of service they deserve and unleash their true potential across the economy at large.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://servicemax.com">ServiceMax</a>, a company that builds software for the field-service industry, <a href="https://resources.servicemax.com/servicemax-to-go-public">announced yesterday</a> that it will go public via a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, in a deal valued at $1.4 billion. The transaction comes after ServiceMax <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/14/ge-digital-snags-servicemax-for-915-million/">was sold to GE for $915 million</a> in 2016, before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/ge-s-digital-future-looking-murkier-with-move-to-spin-off-industrial-iot-biz/">being spun out</a> in late 2018. The company most recently raised $80 million from Salesforce Ventures, a key partner.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Broadly, ServiceMax’s business has a history of modest growth and cash consumption.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>ServiceMax competes in the growing field-service industry primarily with ServiceNow, and interestingly enough given Salesforce Ventures&#8217; recent investment, Salesforce Service Cloud. Other large enterprise vendors like Microsoft, SAP and Oracle also have similar products. The market looks at helping digitize traditional field service, but also touches on in-house service like IT and HR giving it a broader market in which to play.</p>
<p>GE originally bought the company as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/29/how-ge-avoided-kodaks-fate/">a growing industrial Internet of Things (IoT) strategy</a> at the time, hoping to have a software service that could work hand in glove with the automated machine maintenance it was looking to implement. When that strategy failed to materialize, the company spun out ServiceMax and until now it remained part of Silver Lake Partners thanks to a deal that was finalized in 2019.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was curious why that was the case, so we dug into the company’s investor presentation for more hints about its financial performance. Broadly, ServiceMax’s business has a history of modest growth and cash consumption. It promises a big change to that storyline, though. Here&#8217;s how.</p>
<h2>A look at the data</h2>
<p>The company’s pitch to investors is that with new capital it can accelerate its growth rate and begin to generate free cash flow. To get there, the company will pursue organic (in-house) and inorganic (acquisition-based) growth. The company’s blank-check combination will provide what the company described as “$335 million of gross proceeds,” a hefty sum for the company compared to its most recent funding round.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">After a record year for biotech investment in 2020 — during which the <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q1-2021-pitchbook-analyst-note-biotech-went-to-work-as-the-world-stayed-home">industry saw</a> $28.5 billion invested across 1,073 deals — the market for new innovations remains strong. What&#8217;s more, these innovations are increasingly coming to market by way of early-stage startups and/or their scientific founders from academia.</p>
<p>In 2018, for instance, U.S. campuses conducted $79 billion worth of sponsored research, much of it thanks to the federal government. That number <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/pandemic-pounds-us-universities-federal-support-helps-their-labs-stay-afloat">spiked</a> amid the pandemic and could increase even more if President Biden’s infrastructure plan, which <a href="https://www.bioprocessonline.com/doc/outlook-biotech-in-beyond-0001">includes</a> $180 billion to enhance R&amp;D efforts, passes.</p>
<p><a href="https://autm.net/AUTM/media/Surveys-Tools/Documents/AUTM-2019-Infographic-FNL.pdf">Since 1996</a>, 14,000 startups have licensed technology out of those universities, and 67% of licenses were taken by startups or small companies. Meanwhile, the median step-up from seed to Series A is now 2x — higher than all other stages, suggesting that biotech startups are continuing to attract investment at earlier stages.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When it comes to protecting IP, early and consistent communication with investors, tech transfer offices and advisers can make all the difference.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For biotech startups and their founders, these headwinds signal immense promise. But initial funding is only one part of a long journey that (ideally) ends with bringing a product to market. Along the way, founders will need to procure additional investments, develop strategic partnerships and stave off competition. All of which starts by protecting the fundamental asset of any biotech company: its intellectual property.</p>
<p>Here are three key considerations for startups and founders as they get started.</p>
<h2>Start with an option agreement</h2>
<p>Most early-stage biotechnology starts in a university lab. Then, a disclosure is made with the university’s tech transfer office and a patent is filed with the hopes that the product can be taken out into the market (by, for instance, a new startup). More often than not, the vehicle to do this is a licensing agreement.</p>
<p>A licensing agreement is important because it shows investors the company has exclusive access to the technology in question. This in turn allows them to attract the investments required to truly grow the company: hire a team, build strategic partnerships and conduct additional studies.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean jumping right to a full-blown licensing agreement is the best way to start. An option agreement is often the better move.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ants and camels are famously resilient, but when it was time to select a name for a startup that offers open-source, cloud-based distributed database architecture, you can imagine why &#8220;Cockroach Labs&#8221; was the final candidate.</p>
<p>Database technology is fundamental infrastructure, which partially explains why it&#8217;s so resistant to innovation: Oracle Database was released in 1979, and MySQL didn&#8217;t reach the market until 1995.</p>
<p>Since hitting the market six years ago, CockroachDB has become &#8220;a next-generation, $2-billion-valued database contender,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Bob Reselman, who interviewed the company&#8217;s founders to write a four-part series:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">Part 1: Origin story</a>: From the creation of the popular open-source image editor GIMP to some of Google’s most well-known infrastructure products.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">Part 2: Technical design</a>: Analyzes the key differentiation that CockroachDB offers, particularly its focus on geography and data storage.</p>

<p>Our ongoing search for the best startup growth marketers is yielding results: reporter Anna Heim <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/this-early-stage-marketing-expert-says-b2b-saas-is-actually-very-very-cool-n">interviewed SaaS and early-stage startup marketing consultant Lucy Heskins</a> to learn more about the mistakes her clients are most likely to make before they seek her help.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first is hiring a marketer too soon,&#8221; said Heskins. &#8220;I’ve come into startups thinking I was coming in to set up their in-house function. However, very quickly you realize that they’ve jumped the gun and think they’ve got product-market fit when they are nowhere near it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heskins shared a few pages from her early-stage marketing playbook, in which she recommends aligning content marketing with the customer experience — as opposed to just putting pages up that score well in search results.</p>
<p>Because their conversation contains a lot of strategic advice for startups that haven&#8217;t yet made a marketing hire, we made it available on TechCrunch.</p>
<p>If you know of a skilled growth marketer, please share your recommendation <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">in this quick survey</a>.</p>

<p>Congratulations: You&#8217;ve joined a startup and received an Incentive stock option grant! You now own a percentage of the company, and there&#8217;s no telling how much it could be worth one day.</p>
<p>A few questions: Do you know your 409A valuation? What&#8217;s your strike price? Surely, you know the preferred share price and which type of options you were granted?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s complicated stuff, and for most ISO recipients, this may be the first time they start thinking seriously about how federal tax laws impact them personally.</p>

<p>First of all, what is suptech?</p>
<p>“The emergence of purpose-built technologies to facilitate regulator oversight has, over the past few years, garnered its own moniker of supervisory technology, or suptech,” Marc Gilman, the general counsel and VP of compliance at Theta Lake, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>Gilman notes that “nearly every financial services regulator is engaged in some type of suptech activity.”</p>
<p>But as a primer, he focused on three areas: regulatory reporting, machine-readable regulation, and market and conduct oversight.</p>

<p>Superhuman co-founder and CEO Rahul Vohra joined us last week at TechCrunch Early Stage to provide an in-depth look at how he and his company worked to optimize and refine their product early to create a version of “growth hacking” that would not only help Superhuman attract users, but serve them best and retain them, too.</p>
<p>Vohra articulated a system that other entrepreneurs should be able to apply to their own businesses, regardless of area or focus.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim dialed in on India for today&#8217;s Exchange, noting that the country is a good example of the global trend of booming venture capital dollars invested.</p>
<p>&#8220;The country’s venture capital haul thus far in 2021 has nearly matched its 2020 total and is on pace for a record year,&#8221; they write. &#8220;But as the third quarter gets underway, something perhaps even more important is going on: public-market liquidity.&#8221;</p>
<p>They looked at recent venture capital results and considered what Zomato&#8217;s flotation means for the country&#8217;s IPO pipeline. Don&#8217;t miss this analysis of an explosive startup market.</p>

<p>Now that COVID-19 vaccines are encouraging the world to reopen, two trends are underway:</p>
<p>In the first half of 2021, mergers and acquisitions increased by more than 150% YOY to $2.4 trillion; in several surveys, an overwhelming majority of workers said they intend to seek employment elsewhere.</p>
<p>If your startup is angling toward an exit, the promise of a big payday may not be enough to retain employees who feel burned out or dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Many founders don&#8217;t have prior management experience, and, frankly, the uncertainty associated with an exit makes it a poor time for on-the-job learning. With that in mind, here are several communication strategies that can help you keep your winning team intact.</p>

<p>How do you go beyond the names and numbers with your startup pitch deck? For Doug Landis, the answer is one simple compound gerund: storytelling. It’s a word that gets thrown around a lot of late in Silicon Valley, but it’s one that could legitimately help your startup stand out from the pack amid the pile of pitches.</p>
<p>Landis joined the TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising event to offer a presentation about the value of storytelling for startups, whittling down the standard two-hour conversation to a 30-minute version.</p>
<p>Though he still managed to rewind things pretty far, opening with, “400,000 years ago, men and women used to sit around the fire pit and tell stories about their day, about their hunt, about the one that got away.”</p>

On hand was Adina Tecklu, a principal at Khosla Ventures, and who formerly built out Canaan Beta, the consumer seed practice at Canaan Partners.</p>
<p>We talked about the importance of knowing your customer (aka your potential investor), focusing on story, typical slides in a deck, the appendix slides, formatting, and then alternative formats and which to avoid in a pitch deck.</p>

<p>News that Apple plans to get into the buy now, pay later game had Alex Wilhelm wondering about the impact on startups in the space.</p>
<p>Shares of public competitors Affirm and Afterpay dropped on the news, but it doesn’t mean a death knell for those looking to jump into the BNPL game, Alex notes.</p>
<p>“Provided that Apple’s BNPL solution is rolled out over time to the same markets where Apple Pay is present, the … company could consume market shares — and therefore oxygen — from generalized rival BNPL services,” he writes.</p>
<p>“Those startups building more niche or targeted solutions will likely enjoy some shelter from the competitive storms.”</p>

<p>So how does the math work out for all these startups with minimal revenue, tons of cash and sky-high valuations?</p>
<p>Alex Wilhelm ran through the numbers, explaining why the current state of the venture capital market makes sense for startups and investors alike.</p>
<p>“Today we can make super-expensive startup math work out, provided that growth rates stay generally strong and public-market multiples stay rich,” he writes in The Exchange. “If the latter dips, the former has to improve, and vice versa.”</p>

<p>At the TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising event last week, Norwest Venture Partners‘ Lisa Wu took the stage to discuss how founders can think like venture capitalists in all facets of their business.</p>
<p>The overlapping in job roles is uncanny: The best investors and founders have to find focus through the noise, understand the weight of due diligence and pitch others with conviction.</p>
<p>Wu used anecdotes and exercises — such as the eyebrow test — in the tactical, engaging chat.</p>

<p>Jasper Kuria, the managing partner of The Conversion Wizards, breaks down how the CRO consultancy ran an A/B test to boost the conversion rates of a multibillion-dollar company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Radical redesigns that incorporate a large number of variables (instead of single-element tests) are more likely to provide substantial gains,&#8221; Kuria writes. &#8220;Another advantage to doing this is it requires much less time and traffic for your tests to reach statistical significance.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This last weekend featured the much-ballyhooed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/virgin-galactic-and-richard-branson-celebrate-launch-of-first-passengers-into-space/">launch of Virgin Galactic&#8217;s first (nonpaying) passengers</a>, with founder and CEO Richard Branson along for the ride. After the festivities, I had the chance to talk with the company&#8217;s president, Mike Moses, who seems to be familiar with every detail of the operation and the company&#8217;s plans for going from test to commercial flights.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my recorder went on the fritz, but Moses was kind enough to hop on the phone later in the week to talk (again) about the next generation of spaceplanes, where the company needs to invest, and more. You can read through our conversation below.<em> (Interview has been lightly edited for clarity.)</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TC:</strong> To begin with, can you tell me what&#8217;s left to test, and when do you expect to finish the test flight phase?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> The test flight series that we&#8217;re kind of in right now, and the flight with Richard was the first of those, represents a shift from what was more classic and traditional, envelope testing, where we&#8217;re looking at aerodynamics and trajectories and handling qualities, to more of an operational check-out, where we are validating cabin experience experiences, training procedures, hardware for the folks in the back and what they&#8217;re going to go through.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ve laid out a series of a few flights there, three to be specific, that both demonstrate key product milestones and features, as well as allow us time to iterate and develop and optimize some of that back-of-cabin experience. But as always, that&#8217;s a notional schedule, right? The schedule and the numbers are going to depend on the results. So if things go well, we think that&#8217;s a three-flight series if we find things that we need to adjust, we&#8217;ll add more as needed based on what we&#8217;re learning.</p>
<p>Based on the results that we got after Richard and crew came back from the last flight, you know, we know we have some stuff to work on but but everything was pretty much thumbs up.</p>

<p>Now, we know we&#8217;re going to do those flights over the course of this summer and late summer, and then we&#8217;ll be ready to move into, as we announced during our previous earnings call, a &#8216;modification phase&#8217; where we&#8217;re going to do some upgrades on our mothership and our spaceship to prepare them for commercial service. The main focus there is to look at things that allow us to increase the flight-rate frequency. Right now in test, we fly at a fairly slow pace [i.e. infrequently, not at low speed], because we&#8217;re inspecting everything prudently. We&#8217;re going to want to start to move away from that, and as we learn, and so we already know, there&#8217;s some modifications we want to make to enable that to start to happen. We haven&#8217;t set a specific timescale for when that officially ends.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> You mentioned when we talked at the Spaceport, the crew hadn&#8217;t yet really been debriefed about the experience. I&#8217;m hoping maybe you have a little more information now about recommendations from Sir Richard, from Siriha, from everybody that was actually up there. Have you gotten any substantive feedback that you can share?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> So we are definitely in the middle of all that feedback and debriefing. As you might imagine, there&#8217;s a lot of data to go through. And in some cases, that data is as simple as the 16 video cameras that we had onboard, and getting them all synced up to see that what&#8217;s happening where, and couple that with live notes, and debriefs, and the audio tracks that went with it. We are definitely gathering up the inputs, but there&#8217;s nothing on that list that I think I&#8217;m ready to disclose at this time. We&#8217;ll keep folks posted as we go.</p>
<p>The general feedback, post-landing both that day and the next day, was &#8216;things were awesome,&#8217; right? Now that&#8217;s not a scientific answer, and I want the scientific answer, so we&#8217;re gonna make them go through the work to debrief.</p>

<p><strong>TC:</strong> You touched on this with the &#8216;modification phase&#8217;&#8230; Unity is, I don&#8217;t know how exactly you&#8217;d describe it, a production prototype. Could you tell me whether there&#8217;s any special upkeep for it as the sort of first off the line?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> There&#8217;s nothing special as part of its design or build that requires special upkeep. But as a test vehicle and as our first article, we give it a lot of extra attention. We dive in pretty deep on inspections, both regularly and as we see issues, we would probably, test those and explore just to make sure we truly understand that there&#8217;s no unknowns out there, things like how the system performs how it does in cold temperatures, under load and under stress. We keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a series of measurements that we make to say, you know, where did the vehicle perform based on its design envelope. And if we&#8217;re close to the edges of any of that envelope, we go do extra inspections to validate that our modeling and our predictions are right. So in that regard, it&#8217;s pretty similar to how you would have a first set of articles coming out for a new aircraft development, you would build a maintenance and inspection program. That is, an extremely conservative one. And then as you use it, you start to pull out that conservatism based on your positive feedback.</p>
<p>But in general, yes, Unity does get a lot of extra attention. And the next vehicles will have some of that designed in part of that. We&#8217;ve already learned a bunch of, like, &#8216;hey, on the next vehicle, make this different so I don&#8217;t have to look at it every time, I can look at it every five times.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> I think that when we when we talked before, you mentioned that you expect multiple-hundred flights, at least theoretically, out of Unity.</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> Yeah, multiple-hundred flights of the vehicle. We set a design envelope where we designed for a certain lifetime, and we we tested to that, and then we can always go do life extension. Some of that is just a limitation of&#8230; you know, we&#8217;re going to cycle the stuff 10,000 times rather than 40,000 times, and we&#8217;ll come back later and get the other cycles when we get closer to the 10,000 life. We&#8217;ll go back and add more to it. There&#8217;s not a lot of components that have, you know, like a &#8216;fall off the cliff&#8217; type of lifetime.</p>

<p><strong>TC:</strong> You mentioned some of the modifications you are going to build into the successor or production craft. Can you tell me any of those, how it will differ in minor or major ways, when you expect weight on wheels and that kind of thing?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> So we&#8217;ve already done weight on wheels. And we had our rollout, which is effectively that weight on wheels, where we transition from, basically major factory assembly into ground tests. So all of the systems are installed, and now they&#8217;re gonna start to run integrated ground testing, where you can basically go run a computer system through its checkouts, you can run the flight control system through checkouts&#8230; you&#8217;re still on the ground, right, you&#8217;re not yet ready to fly. But we are in that integrated testing.</p>
<p>As far as changes&#8230; when we designed the structure, if you think about it as the skeleton, under the skin, with Imagine and Inspire, we optimized and moved those skeletons, the ribs in the spars, to the locations where the load was highest. Unity was built off of the original design intent of Scaled Composites, and flight tests, they&#8217;ve shown us that sometimes that load is not exactly where it is expected. There&#8217;s a lot of extra weight in Unity to account for that load; Imagine and Inspire, we&#8217;re able to optimize and put the structure right where it needed to be.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a joint, for example, on Unity that I have to go look at every time, because I had to add extra to it. Whereas on Imagine, it was designed to where it should be in the first place. I&#8217;ll still look at it, but it&#8217;s much easier access and a much shorter inspection.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178422" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178422" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2178422" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg" alt="VSS Imagine on a runway." width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2178422" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Virgin Galactic</p></div></p>
<p>So things like that, that let me optimize my inspection schedule. And other just simplistic things — there are now access panels where we know we need them, whereas we had to kind of add them after the fact in Unity. Your quick release fasteners and things like that, that make inspections shorter, we were able to add into the design, we made a pretty significant number of changes like that, all fairly minor, but they have a large effect on the maintainability of the vehicle.</p>
<p>And the next phase, right, we talked about this, the Delta class of spaceships, we&#8217;re going to make changes for manufacturability. Unity and Inspire and Imagine are still fairly one-off hand-built aircraft — spacecraft, sorry. And if we want to go build a dozen or more to get to these 400-flight-a-year rates, we need to make sure they&#8217;re manufacturable at a smaller price tag in a smaller time scale. So that next design will incorporate a bunch of that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> That&#8217;s actually one of the things I wanted to talk about is how you get to the reliability and cadence that you want to have for commercial operation? Obviously, more aircraft is one part of that, but you know, maybe expanding ground ops or crew, better maintenance and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> Yeah, you bet. And I think that&#8217;s it, right: It&#8217;s a fleet, so we have multiple vehicles for dispatch. That gives you capacity to be able to handle anything that comes up unexpected, like weather. And then it&#8217;s the workforce — with more workforce, a 24/7 clock, then you can have multiple expertises, or a crew focused on just one vehicle. And the second crew, they&#8217;re focused on the second one.</p>
<p>I think our mantra here is going to be to take it in baby steps — we&#8217;re not going to try to go to those high flight rates initially, we want to get a little faster, then a little faster, then a little faster. That&#8217;s kind of Unity&#8217;s purpose in life in 2022, to allow us to go explore those operational cadences and see where we can apply multiplying factors for when we get additional spaceships.</p>
<p>You know, the business model is a great one, right? But in these next couple of years, it&#8217;s fairly insensitive to whether I&#8217;m doing eight flights or 10 flights or 12 flights with Unity. I mean, in terms of revenue, it doesn&#8217;t move the needle very much. But in terms of operational learning, that&#8217;s a significant step for us, so we want to be prudent with how we proceed down that path.</p>

<p><strong>TC:</strong> Can you can you tell me again why, or whether, you plan on keeping the flight plans more or less the same? Maybe there&#8217;s possibility, later down the line with the revised version with six people in it, that you might have to have a slightly different profile?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> That&#8217;s kind of coupled with what we talked about at the beginning of this Q&amp;A, the move from a test phase into this operational readiness phase. Coupled with that is a profile that is now set — the trajectory that the pilots fly, the techniques they use, we&#8217;ll still optimize, but we&#8217;re not making major revisions. Those are all pretty much physics-based results. The airspeed we&#8217;re at, the angles that we&#8217;re at, and the subsequent altitude we get to, the weight we carry, are all kind of locked-in variables, and there&#8217;s not much you can do to change that equation.</p>
<p>There&#8217;ll be some definite trajectory changes that come along with Imagine because it will have more capacity on board, which means it&#8217;ll have a slightly different performance, and we just need to go verify that envelope. But for the most part, you know, the physics of the equation kind of set what you can do, roughly speaking, so that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re limited to only carrying four passengers here initially. We can change that, and we do plan on looking at weight reductions in the ship, but again, with an eye towards the fleet that we&#8217;re building, and make sure we get a fleet that is serviceable for the long haul.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got here. Thanks again for taking the time to chat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgages may not be considered sexy, but they are a big business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve refinanced or purchased a home digitally lately, you may not have noticed the company powering the software behind it — but t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here’s a good chance that company is <a href="https://blend.com/">Blend</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2012, the startup has steadily grown to be a leader in the mortgage tech industry. Blend’s white label technology powers mortgage applications on the site of banks including Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank, for example, with the goal of making the process faster, simpler and more transparent. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based startup’s SaaS (software-as-a-service) platform currently processes over $5 billion in mortgages and consumer loans per day, up from nearly $3 billion last July.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Blend made its debut as a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol “</span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BLND?p=BLND&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BLND</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” As of early afternoon, Eastern Time, the stock was trading up over 13% at $20.36.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday night, the company had said it would offer 20 million shares at a price of $18 per share, indicating the company was targeting a valuation of $3.6 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That compares to a $3.3 billion valuation at the time of its last raise in January &#8212; a $300 million Series G funding round that included participation from Coatue and Tiger Global Management. Also, let’s not forget that Blend only became a unicorn last August when it raised a $75 million Series F. Over its lifetime, Blend had raised $665 million before Friday&#8217;s public market debut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In filing its </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001855747/000119312521194971/d162671ds1.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S-1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on June 21, Blend revealed that its revenue had climbed to $96 million in 2020 from $50.7 million in 2019. Meanwhile, its net loss narrowed from $81.5 million in 2019 to $74.6 million in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the San Francisco-based startup significantly expanded its digital consumer lending platform. With that expansion, Blend began offering its lender customers </span><a href="https://finledger.com/2020/12/14/modular-architecture-powers-blends-expansion-from-mortgage-to-consumer-banking-products/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new configuration capabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that they could launch any consumer banking product “in days rather than months</span><b>.”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company had said it expects its revenue growth rate “to decline in future periods.” It also doesn’t envision achieving profitability anytime soon as it continues to focus on growth. Blend also revealed that in 2020, its top five customers accounted for 34% of its revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, TechCrunch spoke with co-founder and CEO Nima Ghamsari about the company’s decision to go with a traditional IPO versus the ubiquitous SPAC or even a direct listing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, Blend said he wanted to show its customers that it is an &#8220;around for a long time company” by making sure there’s enough on its balance sheet to continue to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had to talk and convince some of the biggest investors in the world to invest in us, and that speaks to how long we’ll be around to serve these customers,” he said. “So it was a combination of our capital need and wanting to cement ourselves as a really credible software provider to one of the most regulated industries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghamsari emphasized that Blend is a software company that powers the mortgage process and is not the one offering the mortgages. As such, it works with the flock of fintechs that are working to provide mortgages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of them are using Blend under the hood, as the infrastructure layer,” he said.</span></p>
<p>Overall, Ghamsari believes this is just the beginning for Blend.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things about financial services is that it&#8217;s still mostly powered by paper. So a lot of Blend&#8217;s growth is just going deeper into this process that we got started in years ago,&#8221; he said. As mentioned above, the company started out with its mortgage product but just keeps adding to it. Today, it also powers other loans such as auto, personal and home equity.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of our growth is actually powered by our other lines of business,&#8221; Ghamsari told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot to build because the larger digitization trends are just getting started in financial services. It&#8217;s a relatively large industry that has lots of change.&#8221;</p>
<p>In May, digital mortgage lender Better.com announced it would combine with a SPAC, taking itself public in the second half of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://visualping.io/">Visualping</a>, a service that can help you monitor websites for changes like price drops or other updates, announced that it has raised a $6 million extension to the $2 million seed round it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/visualping-which-scans-the-web-for-changes-including-new-vaccination-slots-raises-2-million/">announced</a> earlier this year. The round was led by Seattle-based <a href="https://fuse.vc/">FUSE</a>, a relatively new firm with investors who <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/investors-ignition-spin-new-seattle-firm-fuse-seahawks-football-star-bobby-wagner/#:~:text=A%20group%20of%20investors%20at,up%20Fuse%20as%20general%20partners.">spun out of Ignition Partners</a> last year. Prior investors <a href="https://mistralvp.com/portfolio/">Mistral Venture Partners</a> and <a href="https://www.n49p.com/">N49P</a> also participated.</p>
<p>The Vancouver-based company is part of the current Google for Startups Accelerator class <a href="https://canada.googleblog.com/2021/03/meet-google-for-startups-accelerator.html">in Canada</a>. This program focuses on services that leverage AI and machine learning, and, while website monitoring may not seem like an obvious area where machine learning can add a lot of value, if you&#8217;ve ever used one of these services, you know that they can often unleash a plethora of false alerts. For the most part, after all, these tools simply look for something in a website&#8217;s underlying code to change and then trigger an alert based on that (and maybe some other parameters you&#8217;ve set).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178691" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/visualping_gif.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178691" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178691" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/visualping_gif.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2178691" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Visualping</p></div></p>
<p>Earlier this week, Visualping launched its <a href="https://visualping.io/machine-learning">first machine learning-based tools</a> to avoid just that. The company <a href="https://visualping.io/blog/more-signal-less-noise/">argues</a> that it can eliminate up to 80% of false alerts by combining feedback from its more than 1.5 million users with its new ML algorithms. Thanks to this, Visualping can now learn the best configuration for how to monitor a site when users set up a new alert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Visualping has the hearts of over a million people across the world, as well as the vast majority of the Fortune 500. To be a part of their journey and to lead this round of financing is a dream,” FUSE&#8217;s Brendan Wales said.</p>
<p>Visualping founder and CEO Serge Salager tells me that the company plans to use the new funding to focus on building out its product but also to build a commercial team. So far, he said, the company&#8217;s growth has been primarily product led.</p>
<p>As a part of these efforts, the company also plans to launch Visualping Business, with support for these new ML tools and additional collaboration features, and Visualping Personal for individual users who want to monitor things like ticket availability for concerts or to track news, price drops or job postings, for example. For now, the personal plan will not include support for ML. &#8220;False alerts are not a huge problem for personal use as people are checking two-three websites but a huge problem for enterprise where teams need to process hundreds of alerts per day,&#8221; Salager told me.</p>
<p>The current idea is to launch these new plans in November, together with mobile apps for iOS and Android. The company will also relaunch its extensions around this time, too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that while Visualping monetizes its web-based service, you can still use the extension in the browser for free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian is pushing back deliveries of its long-awaited R1T electric pickup truck and R1S SUV several more months due to delays in production caused by &#8220;cascading impacts of the pandemic,&#8221; particularly the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips, according to a letter sent to customers from CEO RJ Scaringe. The R1T deliveries will begin in September with the R1S to follow &#8220;shortly,&#8221; Scaringe wrote in the message.</p>
<p>Deliveries of the R1T Launch Edition vehicles, the limited edition release of its first series of “electric adventure vehicles,” were<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/rivian-delays-deliveries-of-the-r1t-launch-edition-by-one-month/"> supposed to begin in July</a> after being delayed by a month.</p>
<p>Rivian is hardly the only automaker grappling with the global chip shortage. GM, Ford, Toyota and virtually every other automaker has either slowed production or built its vehicles without certain features supported by chips. For instance, GM is now building certain mid- and full-sized SUVs without a wireless phone charging feature due to<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the global shortage of semiconductor chips. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike the established players with plenty of inbound revenue, Rivian is a newcomer that is trying to be the first automaker to bring an electric pickup truck to market. Ford plans to bring the electric <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">F-150 Lightning pickup truck</a> to market in spring 2022. Production of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/gmc-reveals-the-hummer-ev-1000-hp-350-mile-range-and-0-60-in-around-3-seconds/">GMC Hummer EV pickup</a> is expected to begin later this year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ford unveils the F-150 Lightning, its all-electric pickup truck that will start under $40,000&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/embed/#?secret=oJbQ3uvYOr" data-secret="oJbQ3uvYOr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s a segment of the letter, which was viewed by TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We know you can&#8217;t wait to get behind the wheel of your vehicle. Earlier this summer, we announced that deliveries would begin in July; however, the timing for the first deliveries of the R1T has shifted to September, with the R1S shortly thereafter in the fall. I wanted to be sure you heard this from me directly.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why our production ramp is taking longer than expected. The cascading impacts of the pandemic have had a compounding effect greater than anyone anticipated. Everything from facility construction, to equipment installation, to vehicle component supply (especially semiconductors) has been impacted by the pandemic. Beyond these unforeseen challenges, launching three new vehicles while setting up a multi-vehicle manufacturing plant is a complex orchestra of coordinated and interlinked activities where small issues can translate into ramp delays.</p></blockquote>
<p>Scaringe provided a few more details about the company&#8217;s progress, including it now employs more than 7,000 people. The Rivian factory in Normal, Illinois, has two separate production lines producing vehicles, according to Scaringe. One is dedicated for the R1 vehicles and other line is for its commercial vans.</p>
<p>In 2019, Rivian announced it was developing an electric delivery van for Amazon using its skateboard platform. Amazon ordered 100,000 of these vans, with deliveries starting in 2021. Earlier this year, Amazon began testing the electric delivery van in Los Angeles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/amazon-begins-testing-its-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-in-san-francisco/">and San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p>Scaringe said Rivian has &#8220;built hundreds of vehicles as part of our validation process, with many of those spotted out in the wild covered in unique vinyl wraps.&#8221; He also addressed why those vehicles haven&#8217;t been delivered to customers, noting that the company <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">believes &#8220;it is critical to both our </span>long-term success and your ultimate satisfaction that the quality and robustness of our launch products truly sets the tone for what to expect from us as a brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The founder and CEO also acknowledged that the company needed to improve how it communicates specifics around deliveries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are many blockchain platforms competing for investors&#8217; and developers&#8217; attention right now, from the big daddy of them all, Ethereum, to so-called &#8220;Ethereum Killers&#8221; like <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>, which we wrote about in May.</p>
<p>Often, these technologies are seen as so promising that investors are willing to fund not only the blockchains but an ecosystem of products and projects that are built on their blockchain networks. On Wednesday, for example, Phantom, a digital wallet that resides on the Solana blockchain network, announced <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/a16z-leads-9m-raise-for-solanas-phantom-wallet-to-go-multi-chain">$9 million</a> in Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz (which in June also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-startup-solana-raises-314-million-to-develop-faster-blockchain-11623240001">splashed out</a> a lot of money for Solana&#8217;s digital tokens).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0wz327YNyL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/">Solana, a blockchain platform followed by top crypto investors, says it&#8217;s far faster than Ethereum</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Solana, a blockchain platform followed by top crypto investors, says it&#8217;s far faster than Ethereum&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/embed/#?secret=0wz327YNyL" data-secret="0wz327YNyL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Similarly, a syndicate of investors today is casting their votes for <a href="https://www.terra.money/">Terraform Labs</a>, a three-year-old platform that originally set out to mint different so-called stablecoins for e-commerce that mimic the value of various fiat currencies and has since expanded its offerings.</p>
<p>There is so much more to be built off the platform, in fact, that backers including Pantera Capital and Arrington XRP have just committed to investing $150 million on products tied to the Terra ecosystem, commitments that will be deployed over several years, says the company, and commitments that, should they prove fruitful, will boost Terraform&#8217;s underlying growth in a kind of virtuous circle.</p>
<p>Why are they so excited about Terraform? The Singapore-based company has apparently been gaining ground fast with merchants in users in South Korea by shortening settlement time from days to seconds, often without e-commerce customers knowing that their online (and sometimes offline) transaction involved a blockchain.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been doing so well, says investor Mike Arrington, that it launched an e-commerce wallet called Chai that&#8217;s grown popular in Asia. It also launched <a href="https://mirror.finance/">Mirror Protocol</a>, which creates fungible assets, or “synthetics,&#8221; that track the price of real world assets. (Arrington XRP led Mirror&#8217;s first round.)</p>
<p>Indeed, the market cap of Terraform&#8217;s tokens &#8212; they&#8217;re called LUNA &#8212; has skyrocketed from $300 million in January to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/">$2.6 billion</a> as excited buyers snap them up.</p>
<p>Whether these backers are getting ahead of themselves is an open question, but the company&#8217;s equity investors &#8212; which also include Coinbase Ventures and Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital &#8212; are plainly betting there is more to come.</p>
<p>Back in January, when Galaxy co-led a $25 million round in Terraform, Novogratz <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/novogratz-invests-in-crypto-startup-serving-millions-in-korea.">talked with Bloomberg</a> about the investment. Among other praise heaped on the company, he said that: “What’s great about Terra is they are one of the first sandbox experiments that’s getting outside the sandbox. We are always looking at those projects because they are the canaries in the coal mines of what else is going to happen.”</p>
