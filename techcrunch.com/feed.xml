					<description><![CDATA[The offer management platform provides “deal desk” software for recruiters to easily manage compensation strategies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you haven’t noticed yet, the hiring market is a hot one &#8212; and getting more complicated as enterprise talent acquisition leaders face technology gaps while assessing candidates. This leads to difficulty in determining compensation.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://kcpr.mxfig.com/5c538c40d7ccca0f92010099/l/KjwTCTHPBd5v2jTeu?messageId=1wZPjR23diElFlfUU&amp;rn=gIsxWYIBSZulGdzlmcoNkI&amp;re=gIt92YuwWah12ZAh2YuVncjh2YlRnLsxWYoNmI&amp;sc=false">Compa</a>. The offer management platform provides “deal desk” software for recruiters to more easily manage their compensation strategies to create and communicate offers that are easy to understand and are unbiased.</p>
<p>Charlie Franklin, co-founder and CEO of Compa, told TechCrunch it was frustrating to lose a candidate at the compensation stage, so the company created its software to reduce the challenge of relying on crowdsourcing data or surveys to compare pay.</p>
<p>“Recruiters often lack the data and tools to figure out how much to pay people and communicate that effectively,” Franklin told TechCrunch. “We see talent acquisitions teams like a sales team. If you think of it from that perspective, they need to close a candidate, but to ask the recruiter to operate off of a spreadsheet slows that process down.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194156" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194156" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2194156" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg 3088w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194156" class="wp-caption-text">Compa co-founders, from left, Charlie Franklin, Joe Malandruccolo and Taylor Cone. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Compa</p></div></p>
<p>With Compa, recruiters can input pay expectations and compare recent offers and collaborate with other team members and hiring managers to reach pay consensus quicker. The software automates all of the market intelligence in real time and provides insights about compensation across similar industries and organizations.</p>
<p>The company, based in both California and Massachusetts, emerged from stealth Thursday with $3.9 million in seed funding led by Base10 Partners. Participation in the round also came from Crosscut Ventures and Acadian Ventures, as well as a group of strategic angel investors including 2.12 Angels, Oyster HR CEO Tony Jamous and Scout RFP co-founders Stan Garber and Alex Yakubovich.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jamison Hill, partner at Base10 Partners, said via email his firm was doing research in the ESG “megatrend,” particularly looking for startups focused on compensation management, when it came across Compa.</p>
<p>He was attracted to the founders’ “clarity and conviction” on the company’s vision, their understanding of the pay gap in the market, how Compa’s solution would “create a new wave of smarter, more-data driven recruiting teams” and how it was enabling employers to use compensation and a positive offer management approach to differentiate itself from competitors.</p>
<p>“They deeply understand the nuances that come with enterprise-level HR teams and bring that expertise to every aspect of Compa&#8217;s product offering, which is why we believe Compa can emerge as a leader in this trend and chose to partner with this very special team,” Hill added.</p>
<p>Franklin, who previously led human resources M&amp;A at Workday, founded Compa last year with  Joe Malandruccolo, who was on the engineering side at Facebook and Oculus, and Taylor Cone, who has done innovation consulting for organizations like Stanford University.</p>
<p>The company was bootstrapped prior to going after the seed round and will use the capital to expand the team and create additional products that fit into its mission of “making compensation fair and competitive for everyone,” Franklin said.</p>
<p>Going forward, he adds that job offers and compensation need to catch up to how quickly the world is changing. As more people work remotely and companies want to attract a diverse workforce, compensation will be an important factor.</p>
<p>“This is a long-term trend we are seeing in HR — compensation becoming more transparent — not just a spreadsheet shared internally, but a transition from secretive to open and accountable, Franklin said. “Technology is catching up to that, and we have the ability to produce outcomes that drive differences in pay.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founders Fund and Paradigm are leading an investment in a platform that&#8217;s aiming to wed music rights with NFTs, allowing user to buy shares of songs through the company&#8217;s marketplace, earning royalties as the music they&#8217;ve invested in gains popularity.</p>
<p>The venture, called <a href="https://royal.io/">Royal</a>, is led by Justin Blau, an EDM artist who performs under the name 3LAU, and JD Ross, a co-founder of home-buying startup Opendoor. Blau has been one of the more active and visible figures in the NFT community, launching a number of upstart efforts aimed at exploring how musicians can monetize their work through crypto markets. Blau says that as Covid cut off his ability to tour, he dug into NFTs full-time, aiming to find a way to flip the power dynamics on &#8220;platforms that were extracting all the value from creators.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#8220;</span></p>
<p>Back in March, weeks before many would first hear about NFTs following the $69 million Beeple sale at Christies, Blau set his own record, selling a batch of custom songs and custom artwork for a collective $11.7 million worth of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Royal&#8217;s investment announcement comes just as a broader bull run for the NFT market seems to reach a fever pitch with investors dumping hundreds of million of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies into community NFT projects like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes. While visual artists interested in putting their digital works on the blockchain have seen a number of platforms spring up and mature in recent months to simplify the process of monetizing their art, there have been fewer efforts focused on musicians.</p>
<p>Paradigm and Founders Fund are leading a $16 million seed round in Royal, with participation from Atomic &#8212; where Ross was recently a General Partner. Ross&#8217;s fellow Opendoor co-founder Keith Rabois led the deal for Founders Fund.</p>

<p>The company isn&#8217;t sharing an awful lot about their launch or product plans, including when the platform will actually begin selling fractionalized assets, but it seems pretty clear the company will be heavily leveraging Blau&#8217;s music and position inside the music industry to bring early fans/investors to the platform. Users can sign-up for early access on the site currently.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As NFT startups chase more complex ownership splits that aim to help creators share their success with fans, there&#8217;s plenty of speculation taking off around how regulators will eventually treat them. While the ICO boom of 2017 led to plenty of founders receiving SEC letters alleging securities fraud, entrepreneurs in this wave seem to be working a little harder to avoid that outcome. Blau says that the startup&#8217;s team is working closely with legal counsel to ensure the startup is staying fully compliant.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s bigger challenge may be ensuring that democratizing access to buying up music rights actually benefits the fans of those artists or creates new fans for them, given the wide landscape of crypto speculators looking to diversify. That said, Blau notes there&#8217;s plenty of room for improvement among the current ownership spread of music royalties, largely spread among labels, private equity groups and hedge funds.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;A true fan might want to own something way earlier than a speculator would even get wind of it,&#8221;Blau says. &#8220;Democratizing access to asset classes is a huge part of crypto’s future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jessica Ko was head of design at Google and then Opendoor, she realized that her teams spent about 90% of their time digging around Dropbox looking for assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, they’d find older versions. Or they couldn’t find what they were looking for. Or even worse, they’d accidentally pick the wrong asset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was such a chaotic process,” Ko recalls. “Anyone could go in and alter things and change folder structures around. It was a total mess, and just continued like that because there was no alternative.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Opendoor grew in size, the problem became an even bigger one, she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Designers were quitting because it was giving them so much anxiety,” Ko recalls. “Dropbox hadn’t solved it yet. Google Drive was not a good alternative either. Designers deal with files the most, and we’re exchanging files constantly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the frustration and stress the problem of file storage and sharing caused, not being able to locate the correct assets also led to errors, which in turn led to lots of money lost, according to Ko.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We spent a lot of money on photo shoots because we couldn&#8217;t find new things, or people would have to recreate designs,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, she said, designers weren’t the only ones who needed to access the assets. Finance teams were constantly needing them for things like creating pitch decks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2018, Ko left Opendoor to set about solving the problem she was tired of dealing with by creating file storage for modern design workflows and processes. Or put more simply, she wanted to build a new kind of cloud storage that would serve as an alternative to Dropbox and Google Drive “built by, and for, creatives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2020, Ko (CEO) teamed up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Zirbel (CTO) to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launch San Francisco-based </span><a href="https://www.playbook.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which she describes as the “Dropbox for designers,” to tackle the challenge. And today, the startup has emerged from stealth and announced it has raised $4 million in a seed funding round led by Founders Fund at a $20 million post-money valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors in the round include Abstract, Inovia, Maple, Basis Set, Backend, Wilson Sonsini and a number of angels, including Opendoor co-founder and CEO Eric Wu, Gusto co-founder Eddie Kim and SV Angel&#8217;s Beth Turner.</span></p>
<p>In a nutshell, Playbook claims it can automatically imports, tags, categorizes an organization&#8217;s entire media library, in minutes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When starting out, the first thing Playbook set out to do was attempt to reinvent the way folders exist for assets, with subfolders underneath. And then, the company set about trying to change the way people share files. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since so much is done over email and Slack these days, version control becomes even more difficult,” Ko told TechCrunch. So Playbook, she said, has built a storage system that can be accessed by all parties as opposed to just sending files via different channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For years, these assets have been dropped into what feels like a file cabinet,” Ko said. “But these days, sharing assets is much more collaborative and there’s different kinds of parties involved such as freelancers and contractors. So who is managing these files, and controlling the versions has become very complex.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playbook offers 4TB of free storage, which Ko says is 266 times the free version of Google Storage and 2,000 times that of Dropbox</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The hope is that this encourages users to use its platform as an all-around creative hub without worrying about running out of storage space. It also a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">utomatically scans, organizes and tags files and has worked to make it easier to browse files and folders visually.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194268" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194268" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2194268 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0-Playbook-Team-e1629938420572.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194268" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Playbook</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, Playbook opened a beta version of its product to the design community and got about 1,000 users in two months. People continued to sign up and the company at one point had to close the beta so that it could manage all the new users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it has about 10,000 users signed up in beta. Early users include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individual freelancers to design teams at companies like Fast, Folx and Literati.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seven-person company wants to focus on getting the product “right” before attempting to monetize and launch to enterprises (which will likely happen next year), Ko said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Playbook is focused on the needs of freelancers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company believes that the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/07/freelance-work-grows-amid-covid-19-math-stats-game-hiring-in-demand.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exponential growth of freelancers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> post-pandemic means “cloud storage needs to be smarter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to first solve that use case, and unlock the problem from the bottom up,” Ko told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, another strategy behind that initial focus is that freelancers can also introduce Playbook to the companies and enterprises they work for, so the marketing then becomes built into the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They can transfer assets and files through Playbook to their clients, who tend to adopt,” she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Playbook is helping manage over 2 million assets and says it has “hundreds of waitlist sign-ups” every month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Zirbel said the startup wants to branch out into i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mage scanning, similarity, content detection, previewing and long-term cloud storage and tons of integrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are lots of interesting technology challenges when you focus on the creative side of cloud storage,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders Fund’s John Luttig said when the firm first met Ko and Zirbel last year, it was “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clear that they had a depth of understanding and thoughtfulness around file management” that his firm hadn’t seen before. Plus, in his view, there has been very little innovation in cloud storage since Dropbox launched in 2007. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The product leverages modern design, collaboration principles, and artificial intelligence to make file management much faster and easier,” he wrote via email. “Given their design-centric backgrounds, they’re extremely well-positioned to rethink the user experience for file systems from the ground up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playbook, he said, is able to leverage recent advancements in computer vision and design “to build a far better product to manage and share files.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Good news, TechCrunch family, <a href="https://twitter.com/sabakarimm">Techstars&#8217; Saba Karim</a> is coming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt (September 21-23)</a> this year.</p>
<p>With a great vantage point from his perspective as Global Startup Pipeline Manager at Techstars, Karim will be hosting a session on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">the Extra Crunch stage</a> discussing <em>how to craft a pitch deck that cannot be ignored</em>. It&#8217;s a popular topic not only because of how important decks remain in today&#8217;s venture capital world, but also because what they should contain slowly changes over time &#8212; what not to include, as well.</p>
<p>Karim has a background in making people pay attention. Before he had his current role at Techstars, he was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabakarim/">CMO at Evolve</a>, for example. Earlier in his career, Karim helped found and run Rawberry in Australia, before working for Telstra. He was also the marketing director at T.H. Capital Ventures in Sydney, before jetting to Boston to work as the VP of growth at StartupCMO.</p>

<p>In case you need a refresher, Karim is joining what could be our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#eb919231-f3e4-4def-8dd0-afb0bc7c9c6e">strongest-ever Disrupt speaking cohort</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">St. Louis-based grocery chain Schnucks (one of those “With a name like Smucker&#8217;s, it has to be good” situations, one imagines) <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/26/2287087/0/en/Schnuck-Markets-Becomes-World-s-First-Grocer-to-Deploy-Intelligence-Robots-Chainwide.html">announced this week</a> that it will be deploying technology from Simbe Robotics across its 111 U.S. locations.</p>
<p>The deal comes a year and a half into a global pandemic that has substantially increased interest in automation, particularly around essential businesses &#8212; a qualifier that certainly applies to grocery stores.</p>
<p>Simbe’s mobile robots provide inventory scanning, offering a constantly updating picture of what’s on the store shelves and what needs to be restocked. Anyone who’s ever worked retail can almost certainly tell you that doing inventory is one of the biggest headaches in the industry, often requiring hours-long shutdowns or overnight marathons to complete.</p>
<p>The &#8220;multi-year&#8221; chain-wide rollout comes four years after Schnucks first began piloting the tech. Over the years, the partnership has gradually expanded. Simbe says its shelf-scanning Tally robot is capable of reducing out of stock items by 20-30% and can detect 14 times more missing inventory than traditional human scanning.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194489" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194489" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2194489" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194489" class="wp-caption-text">Schnuck Markets deploys Tally robot by Simbe Robotics to its stores &#8211; bringing shelf insights for better shopping experience. Photographed on Friday, Aug. 13, 2021, in Des Peres, Mo. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Simbe</p></div></p>
<p>“By deploying Tally to all stores, we are fully operationalizing these insights into our supply chain and expanding our ability to leverage real-time data to make revenue impacting decisions,” Schnucks VP Dave Steck said in a release. “Tally has become an integral component of our stores, streamlining operations and ultimately creating a better store experience for our customers and teammates.”</p>
<p>A number of companies are working to automate the world of inventory scanning, including Brain Corp and Bossa Nova, though the latter was dealt a massive setback when Walmart ended a large contract at the end of 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Which terms come to mind when you think about SaaS?</p>
<p>&#8220;Solutions,&#8221; &#8220;cutting-edge,&#8221; &#8220;scalable&#8221; and &#8220;innovative&#8221; are just a sample of the overused jargon lurking around every corner of the techverse, with SaaS marketers the world over seemingly singing from the same hymn book.</p>
<p>Sadly for them, new research has proven that such jargon-heavy copy — along with unclear features and benefits — is deterring customers and cutting down conversions. Around 57% of users want to see improvements in the clarity and navigation of websites, suggesting that techspeak and unnecessarily complex UX are turning customers away at the door, according to <a href="https://www.creative-copywriter.net/saas-marketers-its-time-to-tune-up-your-2021-strategy">The SaaS Engine</a>.</p>
<p>That’s not to say SaaS marketers aren’t trying: Seventy percent of those surveyed have been making big adjustments to their websites, and 33% have updated their content. So how and why are they missing the mark?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			They say there’s no bigger slave to fashion than someone determined to avoid it, and SaaS marketing is no different. To truly stand out, you need to do thorough competitor analysis.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>There are three common blunders that most SaaS marketers make time and again when it comes to clarity and high-converting content:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not differentiating from competitors.</li>
<li>Not humanizing &#8220;tech talk.&#8221;</li>
<li>Not tuning their messaging to prospects’ stage of awareness at the appropriate stage of the funnel.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’re going to unpack what the research suggests and the steps you can take to avoid these common pitfalls.</p>
<h2>Blending into the competition</h2>
<p>It’s a jungle out there. But while camouflage might be key to surviving in the wild, in the crowded SaaS marketplace, it’s all about standing out. Let’s be honest: How many SaaS homepages have you visited that look the same? How many times have you read about &#8220;innovative tech-driven solutions that will revolutionize your workflow&#8221;?</p>
<p>The research has found that of those using SaaS at work, 76% are now on more platforms or using existing ones more intensively than last year. And as always, with increased demand comes a boom in competition, so it’s never been more important to stand out. Rather than imitating the same old phrases and copy your competitors are using, it&#8217;s time to reach your audience with originality, empathy and striking clarity.</p>
<p>But how do you do that?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Picsart COO Tammy Nam said it was now past a $100 million run rate, and that it was worth more than $1 billion after the SoftBank round. That was the extent of our ability to mine her for details.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://picsart.com/">Picsart</a> announced this morning that it has raised a $130 million round led by SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2. The new capital infusion pushes the company&#8217;s valuation north of the $1 billion mark, though it declined to get more specific.</p>
<p>Per <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>, the company&#8217;s preceding round of capital, in 2019, valued the company at around $600 million. We can infer from the two figures that Picsart&#8217;s valuation went up materially in its latest round.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not incredibly hard to figure out why. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">chatted with the company earlier this year</a>, noting that it was over the $50 million ARR mark, and that the company expected to crest the $100 million ARR threshold this year. The company said today it has surpassed that goal. Precisely how far? The company would not disclose.</p>
<p>Picsart COO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammynam/">Tammy Nam</a> told TechCrunch in an interview this week that her company was now past a $100 million run rate, and that it was worth more than a flat $1.0 billion after the SoftBank round. That was the extent of our ability to mine her for details.</p>
<p>What we can say, then, is that the company is doing nine figures of revenue that start with one, and that it is worth ten figures that also start with a one. That gives Picsart a maximum revenue multiple of just under 20x, though we expect the correct figure is in the low tens.</p>
<p>What makes the Picsart news fun, apart from its constituent large numbers, is that its product is quite cool. That&#8217;s something that we can&#8217;t say about most unicorns that we write about here at TechCrunch. The company builds mobile and desktop image and video editing tools for consumers and professionals alike, which means that you have likely seen work created by its tools in the wild. And frankly, because they are something that anyone can use &#8212; unlike, say, HR-focused APIs or what have you &#8212; it&#8217;s a startup that feels more tangible than most.</p>
<p>Picsart provides both free and paid services. Its paid products include more images for users to work with &#8212; watermark removal and the like. The company also offers a teams-focused plan with multi-seat purchase options, though Nam said that because her team had not yet publicized the option to their user base, it&#8217;s too early to tell how the product is faring. It&#8217;s effectively in beta, she explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More broadly, the company&#8217;s monetization efforts are succeeding. We can tell that from Picsart&#8217;s revenue growth. Happily, Nam provided a bit more context, saying that the company had millions of subscribers today. She sees more room for growing, explaining that if her company tripled its gross subscriber number, the resulting cohort would still be a &#8220;drop in the bucket&#8221; when compared to its active user tally. There again, Picscart was somewhat coy with the data. It previously said that it had reached 100 million monthly actives <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/creative-focused-app-picsart-hits-100m-maus-attracting-brands-tired-of-trolls/">in October of 2017</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/creative-focused-app-picsart-hits-100m-maus-attracting-brands-tired-of-trolls/">130 million in 2019</a> and around 150 million earlier this year. Picsart would only say that it has <em>more</em> than 150 million today.</p>
<p>Turning to the company&#8217;s revenue mix between consumers and business users, Nam stressed that the dividing line between the two is especially blurry among Generation Z, which by our understanding is a key Picsart user demographic. That makes it difficult to parse the precise revenue mix at the company today. However, Nam told TechCrunch that its business revenue represented around 30% of total revenue in an interview earlier this year, which provides directional guidance for us today.</p>
<p>She also noted in our recent chat that business usage of Picsart was rising, as SMBs became increasingly digital in the COVID-19 era. How that shift in market demand will impact Picsart&#8217;s revenue mix over time should prove interesting.</p>
<p>So, what about an IPO? Sadly, that was likely just delayed. It&#8217;s great news for Picasart that it raised so much new capital, but for those of us hungry to get more S-1s, and more quickly, such large capital events can delay liquidity as the company in question wants to put the new funds to work.</p>
<p>Still, provided an even medium growth rate, we&#8217;d hazard that Picsart won&#8217;t struggle to match its final private valuation when it does file. We just want that to happen quickly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Airbnb announced on Thursday it will allow anyone with available space to sign up to provide housing for Afghan refugees. The new initiative aims to build upon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/airbnb-to-provide-free-temporary-housing-for-20000-afghan-refugees/">Airbnb’s initial commitment</a> to provide free temporary housing for 20,000 Afghan refugees.</p>
<p>The company says existing Airbnb hosts and anyone else can sign up to provide free or discounted stays to Afghan refugees through its dedicated <a href="https://www.airbnb.org/">website for emergency housing</a>. Airbnb notes it waives its fees on all refugee stays. For those who are unable to open up their homes but are still eager to help, Airbnb says they can aid the crisis by donating money to support housing for Afghan refugees.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Airbnb announced its initial commitment to house 20,000 Afghan refugees and said the company will cover the costs for the housing, using funds from contributions to its nonprofit Airbnb.org and a specific Refugee Fund established by that division, as well as personal contributions from Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky himself.</p>

<p>“Since the announcement, we have received enormous interest from people within the Airbnb community and beyond looking for ways to support Airbnb and Airbnb.org’s work with partner organizations to house Afghan refugees. In many cases, we have heard from people who want to offer their space free of charge,” the company said <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/how-to-support-afghan-refugees/">in a statement.</a> “​​The response has been overwhelming and today we’re sharing more details on how people can help us expand on efforts to meet this unprecedented need for temporary, emergency stays for refugees arriving from Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>Airbnb.org and Airbnb are also extending support to the federal government, along with states and cities that have expressed interest in receiving refugees to help provide stays as needed.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s housing initiatives come at a time when tens of thousands of people are attempting to flee Afghanistan. Amid the crisis, companies and governments are facing increasing pressure to aid refugees fleeing the country. There are currently nearly 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan, according to the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/uk/afghanistan.html">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is infamous for spinning up products and killing them off, often in very short order. It&#8217;s an annoying enough habit when it&#8217;s stuff like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/">messaging apps</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/google-shuts-down-its-internal-stadia-game-studios/">games</a>. But the tech giant&#8217;s ambitions stretch into many domains that touch human lives these days. Including, most directly, healthcare. And &#8212; it turns out &#8212; so does Google&#8217;s tendency to kill off products that its PR has previously touted as &#8220;life saving&#8221;.</p>
<p>To wit: Following a recent reconfiguration of Google&#8217;s health efforts &#8212; reported earlier by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-health-shutting-down-david-feinberg-leaves-2021-8?r=US&amp;IR=T">Business Insider </a>&#8212; the tech giant confirmed to TechCrunch that it is decommissioning its clinician support app, Streams.</p>
<p>The app, which Google Health <a href="https://health.google/for-clinicians/streams/">PR</a> bills as a &#8220;mobile medical device&#8221;, was developed back in 2015 by DeepMind, an AI division of Google &#8212; and has been used by the U.K.&#8217;s National Health Service in the years since, with a number of NHS Trusts inking deals with DeepMind Health to roll out Streams to their clinicians.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, one NHS Trust &#8212; London&#8217;s Royal Free &#8212; is still using the app in its hospitals.</p>
<p>But, presumably, not for too much longer, since Google is in the process of taking Streams out back to be shot and tossed into its deadpool &#8212; alongside the likes of its ill-fated social network, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/looking-back-at-google/">Google+,</a> and Internet balloon company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-alphabet-is-shutting-down-loon-internet/">Loon</a>, to name just two of a frankly endless list of now defunct Alphabet/Google products.</p>
<p>Other NHS Trusts we contacted which had previously rolled out Streams told us they have already stopped using the app.</p>
<p>University College London NHS Trust confirmed to TechCrunch that it severed ties with Google Health earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our agreement with Google Health (initially DeepMind) came to an end in March 2021 as originally planned. Google Health deleted all the data it held at the end of the [Streams] project,&#8221; a UCL NHS Trust spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust also told us it stopped using Streams this summer (in July) &#8212; and said patient data is in the process of being deleted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Following the decommissioning of <span class="il">Streams</span> at the Trust earlier this summer, data that has been processed by Google Health to provide the service to the Trust will be deleted and the agreement has been terminated,&#8221; a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As per the data sharing agreement, any patient data that has been processed by Google Health to provide the service will be deleted. The deletion process is started once the agreement has been terminated,&#8221; they added, saying the contractual timeframe for Google deleting patient data is six months.</p>
<p>Another Trust, Taunton &amp; <span class="il">Somerset, also confirmed its involvement with Streams had already ended. </span></p>
<p>The Streams contracts DeepMind inked with the NHS Trusts were for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/deepmind-health-inks-another-5-year-nhs-app-deal-in-face-of-ongoing-controversy/">five years</a> &#8212; so these contracts were likely approaching the end of their terms, anyway.</p>
<p>Contract extensions would have had to be agreed by both parties. And Google&#8217;s decision to decommission Streams may be factoring in a lack of enthusiasm from involved Trusts to continue using the software &#8212; although if that&#8217;s the case it may, in turn, be a reflection of Trusts&#8217; perceptions of Google&#8217;s weak commitment to the project.</p>
<p>Neither side is saying much publicly.</p>
<p>But as far as we&#8217;re aware the Royal Free is the only NHS Trust still using the clinician support app as Google prepares to cut off Stream&#8217;s life support.</p>
<h2>No more Streams?</h2>
<p>The Streams story has plenty of wrinkles, to put it politely.</p>
<p>For one thing, despite being developed by Google&#8217;s AI division &#8212; and despite DeepMind founder Mustafa Suleyman saying the goal for the project was to <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/predicting-patient-deterioration">find ways to integrate AI</a> into Streams so the app could generate predictive healthcare alerts &#8212; the Streams app doesn&#8217;t involve any artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>An algorithm in Streams alerts doctors to the risk of a patient developing acute kidney injury but relies on an existing AKI (acute kidney injury) algorithm developed by the NHS. So Streams essentially digitized and mobilized existing practice.</p>
<p>As a result, it always looked odd that an AI division of an adtech giant would be so interested in building, provisioning and supporting clinician support software over the long term. But then &#8212; as it panned out &#8212; neither DeepMind nor Google were in it for the long haul at the patient&#8217;s bedside.</p>
<p>DeepMind and the NHS Trust it worked with to develop Streams (the aforementioned Royal Free) started out with wider ambitions for their partnership &#8212; as detailed in an early 2016 memo we reported on, which set out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/nhs-memo-details-googledeepminds-five-year-plan-to-bring-ai-to-healthcare/">five-year plan to bring AI to healthcare</a>. Plus, as we noted above, Suleyman keep up the push for years &#8212; <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/predicting-patient-deterioration">writing</a> later in 2019 that: &#8220;Streams doesn’t use artificial intelligence at the moment, but the team now intends to find ways to safely integrate predictive AI models into Streams in order to provide clinicians with intelligent insights into patient deterioration.&#8221;</p>
<p>A key misstep for the project emerged in 2017 &#8212; through press reporting of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/deepmind-nhs-health-data-deal-had-no-lawful-basis/">data scandal</a>, as details of the full scope of the Royal Free-DeepMind data-sharing partnership were published by <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2086454-revealed-google-ai-has-access-to-huge-haul-of-nhs-patient-data/">New Scientist</a> (which used a freedom of information request to obtain contracts the pair had not made public).</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s data protection watchdog went on to find that the Royal Free had not had a valid legal basis when it passed information on millions of patients&#8217; to DeepMind during the development phase of Streams.</p>
<p>Which perhaps explains DeepMind&#8217;s eventually cooling ardour for a project it had initially thought &#8212; with the help of a willing NHS partner &#8212; would provide it with free and easy access to a rich supply of patient data for it to train up healthcare AIs which it would then be, seemingly, perfectly positioned to sell back into the self same service in future years. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/20/deepmind-wants-its-healthcare-ai-to-charge-by-results-but-first-it-needs-your-data/">Price tbc</a>.</p>
<p>No one involved in that thought had properly studied the detail of UK healthcare data regulation, clearly.</p>
<p>Or &#8212; most importantly &#8212; bothered to considered fundamental patient expectations about their private information.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bw1VA2lb4c"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/deepmind-nhs-health-data-deal-had-no-lawful-basis/">DeepMind NHS health data deal had &#8216;no lawful basis&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DeepMind NHS health data deal had &#8216;no lawful basis&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/deepmind-nhs-health-data-deal-had-no-lawful-basis/embed/#?secret=bw1VA2lb4c" data-secret="bw1VA2lb4c" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So it was not <em>actually</em> surprising when, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/13/deepmind-hands-off-role-as-health-app-provider-to-parent-google/">2018</a>, DeepMind announced that it was stepping away from Streams &#8212; handing the app (and all its data) to Google Health &#8212; Google&#8217;s internal health-focused division &#8212; which went on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/google-completes-controversial-takeover-of-deepmind-health/">complete its takeover of DeepMind Health in 2019</a>. (Although it was still shocking, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/google-gobbling-deepminds-health-app-might-be-the-trust-shock-we-need/">as we opined at the time</a>.)</p>
<p>It was Google Health that Suleyman suggested would be carrying forward the work to bake AI into Streams, writing at the time of the takeover that: &#8220;The combined experience, infrastructure and expertise of DeepMind Health teams alongside Google’s will help us continue to develop mobile tools that can support more clinicians, address critical patient safety issues and could, we hope, save thousands of lives globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>A particular irony attached to the Google Health takeover bit of the Streams saga is the fact that DeepMind had, when under fire over its intentions toward patient data, claimed people&#8217;s medical information would never be touched by its adtech parent.</p>
<p>Until of course it went on it hand the whole project off to Google &#8212; and then lauded the transfer as great news for clinicians and patients!</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s takeover of Streams meant NHS Trusts that wanted to continue using the app had to ink new contracts directly with Google Health. And all those who had rolled out the app did so. It&#8217;s not like they had much choice if they did want to continue.</p>
<p>Again, jump forward a couple of years and it&#8217;s Google Health now suddenly facing a major reorg &#8212; with Streams in the frame for the chop as part of Google&#8217;s perpetually reconfiguring project priorities.</p>
<p>It is quite the ignominious ending to an already infamous project.</p>
<p>DeepMind&#8217;s involvement with the NHS had previously been seized upon by the UK government &#8212; with former health secretary, Matt Hancock, trumpeting an AI research partnership between the company and Moorfield’s Eye Hospital as an exemplar of the kind of data-driven innovation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/17/uk-health-minister-sets-out-tech-first-vision-for-future-care-provision/">he suggested would transform healthcare service provision in the UK</a>.</p>
<p>Luckily for Hancock he didn&#8217;t pick Streams as his example of great &#8220;healthtech&#8221; innovation. (Moorfields confirmed to us that its research-focused partnership with Google Health is continuing.)</p>
<p>The hard lesson here appears to be don&#8217;t bet the nation&#8217;s health on an adtech giant that plays fast and loose with people&#8217;s data and doesn&#8217;t think twice about pulling the plug on digital medical devices as internal politics dictate another chair-shuffling reorg.</p>
<p>Patient data privacy advocacy group, <a href="https://medconfidential.org">MedConfidential</a> &#8212; a key force in warning over the scope of the Royal Free&#8217;s DeepMind data-sharing deal &#8212; urged Google to ditch the spin and come clean about the Streams cock-up, once and for all.</p>
<p>“Streams is the Windows Vista of Google &#8212; a legacy it hopes to forget,&#8221; MedConfidential&#8217;s Sam Smith told us. &#8220;The NHS relies on trustworthy suppliers, but companies that move on after breaking things create legacy problems for the NHS, as we saw with wannacry. Google should admit the decision, delete the data, and learn that experimenting on patients is regulated for a reason.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Questions over Royal Free&#8217;s ongoing app use</h2>
<p>Despite the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office&#8217;s 2017 finding that the Royal Free&#8217;s original data-sharing deal with DeepMind was improper, it&#8217;s notable that the London Trust stuck with Streams &#8212; continuing to pass data to DeepMind.</p>
<p>The original patient data-set that was shared with DeepMind without a valid legal basis was never ordered to be deleted. Nor &#8212; presumably has it since been deleted. Hence the weight of the call for Google to delete the data now.</p>
<p>Ironically the improperly acquired data should (in theory) finally get deleted &#8212; once contractual timeframes for any final back-up purges elapse &#8212; but only because it&#8217;s Google itself planning to switch off Streams.</p>
<p>And yet the Royal Free confirmed to us that it is still using Streams, even as Google spins the dial on its commercial priorities for the umpteenth time and decides it&#8217;s not interested in this particular bit of clinician support, after all.</p>
<p>We put a number of questions to the Trust &#8212; including about the deletion of patient data &#8212; none of which it responded to.</p>
<p>Instead, two days later, it sent us this one-line statement which raises plenty more questions &#8212; saying only that: &#8220;The Streams app has not been decommissioned for the Royal Free London and our clinicians continue to use it for the benefit of patients in our hospitals.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not clear how long the Trust will be able to use an app Google is decommissioning. Nor how wise that might be for patient safety &#8212; such as if the app won&#8217;t get necessary security updates, for example.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also asked Google how long it will continue to support the Royal Free&#8217;s usage &#8212; and when it plans to finally switch off the service. As well as which internal group will be responsible for any SLA requests coming from the Royal Free as the Trust continues to use software Google Health is decommissioning &#8212; and will update this report with any response. (Earlier a Google spokeswoman told us the Royal Free would continue to use Streams for the &#8216;near future&#8217; &#8212; but she did not offer a specific end date.)</p>
<p>In <a href="https://telecareaware.com/breaking-google-health-shutting-down-most-employees-scattered-to-other-divisions/">press reports</a> this month on the Google Health reorg &#8212; covering an internal memo first obtained by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-health-shutting-down-david-feinberg-leaves-2021-8?r=US&amp;IR=T">Business Insider</a> &#8212;  teams working on various Google health projects were reported to be being split up to other areas, including some set to report into Google&#8217;s search and AI teams.</p>
<p>So which Google group will take over responsibility for the handling of the SLA with the Royal Free, as a result of the Google Health reshuffle, is an interesting question.</p>
<p>In earlier comments, Google&#8217;s spokeswoman told us the new structure for its reconfigured health efforts &#8212; which are still being badged &#8216;Google Health&#8217; &#8212; will encompass all its work in health and wellness, including Fitbit, as well as AI health research, Google Cloud and more.</p>
<p>On Streams specifically, she said the app hasn&#8217;t made the cut because when Google assimilated D<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">eepMind Health it decided to focus its efforts on another digital offering for clinicians &#8212; called <a href="https://health.google/for-clinicians/care-studio/">Care Studio</a> &#8212; which it&#8217;s currently piloting with two US health systems (namely: Ascension &amp; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). </span></p>
<p>And anyone who&#8217;s ever tried to use a Google messaging app will surely have strong feelings of déjà vu on reading that&#8230;</p>
<p>DeepMind&#8217;s co-founder, meanwhile, appears to have remained blissfully ignorant of Google&#8217;s intentions to ditch Streams in favor of Care Studio &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/mustafasuleymn/status/1174342121450401792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1174342121450401792%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2019%2F09%2F19%2Fgoogle-completes-controversial-takeover-of-deepmind-health%2F">tweeting</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/google-completes-controversial-takeover-of-deepmind-health/">back in 2019</a> as Google completed the takeover of DeepMind Health that he had been &#8220;proud to be part of this journey&#8221;, and also touting &#8220;huge progress delivered already, and so much more to come for this incredible team&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the end, Streams isn&#8217;t being &#8216;supercharged&#8217; (or levelled up to use current faddish political parlance) with AI &#8212; as his 2019 blog post had envisaged &#8212; Google is simply taking it out of service. Like it did with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/17/crunchweek-google-reader-samsung-s4-dropbox-mailbox/">Reader</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/farewell-allo/">Allo</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/15/google-kills-its-tango-augmented-reality-platform-shifting-focus-to-arcore/">Tango</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/google-play-music-to-shut-down-starting-in-september-will-disappear-by-december/">Google Play Music</a>, or&#8230;. well, the list goes on.</p>
<p>Suleyman&#8217;s own story contains some wrinkles, too.</p>
<p>He is no longer at DeepMind but has himself been &#8216;folded into&#8217; Google &#8212; joining as a VP of artificial intelligence policy, after initially being placed on an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-21/google-deepmind-co-founder-placed-on-leave-from-ai-lab">extended leave of absence from DeepMind</a>.</p>
<p>In January, allegations that he had bullied staff were reported by the <a href="https://archive.is/TcMvW">WSJ</a>. And then, earlier this month, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/deepmind-mustafa-suleyman-google-allegations-bullying-settlements-2021-8?r=US&amp;IR=T">Business Insider</a> expanded on that &#8212; reporting follow up allegations that there had been confidential settlements between DeepMind and former employees who had worked under Suleyman and complained about his conduct (although DeepMind denied any knowledge of such settlements).</p>
<p>In a statement to Business Insider, Suleyman apologized for his past behavior &#8212; and said that in 2019 he had &#8220;accepted feedback that, as a co-founder at DeepMind, I drove people too hard and at times my management style was not constructive&#8221;, adding that he had taken time out to start working with a coach and that that process had helped him &#8220;reflect, grow and learn personally and professionally&#8221;.</p>
<p>We asked Google if Suleyman would like to comment on the demise of Streams &#8212; and on his employer&#8217;s decision to kill the app &#8212; given his high hopes for the project and all the years of work he put into that particular health push. But the company did not engage with the request.</p>
<p>We also offered Suleyman the chance to comment directly. We&#8217;ll update this story if he responds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the most fascinating aspects of Boston Dynamics’ transition into a commercial organization is watching the company &#8212; and its partners &#8212; figure out real-world jobs for Spot. There’s no question that the tech is impressive, but there’s always been the broader subject of usefulness beyond the company’s initial purpose of serving as off-road pack mules.</p>
<p>We’ve seen some interesting examples since Spot first went on sale, including inspection for constructions sites and potentially dangerous settings &#8212; from nuclear power plants to off-shore oil rigs. There have also been some, shall we say, more controversial gigs, including Spot’s time as an electronic K9 for the NYPD.</p>
<p>But maybe finding the perfect job for Spot entails thinking both outside the box and Earth’s gravitational pull. NASA’s JPL in California has been working with the quadrupedal robot for a couple of years now, first as part of a DARPA challenge and now as a potential way to explore extraterrestrial caves. For this week’s installment of Actuator, we spoke to JPL NeBula Autonomy Project lead Ali Agha about the partnership.</p>
<p><strong>How long has NASA been working with Spot?</strong></p>
<p>We have been working with the SPOT robots for about two years now. We initially integrated our NeBula autonomy and AI solutions on the Spot robot as one of our robots participating in the DARPA Subterranean challenge competition. However, since then we have extended the application of these robots and JPL’s NeBula autonomy solution to planetary cave exploration and surface exploration as well as terrestrial disaster response and mining efforts.</p>
<p><strong>What is the advantage of using legs (as opposed to wheels) on the Martian surface?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a no-road terrain on Earth. The ability to walk will allow traversing different elements of such a terrain much better than a typical wheeled vehicle. Similarly, legged locomotion can potentially enable totally new missions when exploring extreme and challenging terrains on planetary bodies in the solar system beyond our home planet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_HpWIhFFD54?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How closely does NASA/JPL work with a company like Boston Dynamics on a project like this?</strong></p>
<p>We have had an amazing collaboration with Boston Dynamics and work closely with them. On our project, JPL and Boston Dynamics’ efforts are highly synergistic. At JPL, we develop autonomy and AI solutions (called NeBula) acting as the robot brain to enable fully autonomous exploration of extreme and challenging environments with very minimal (to none) prior information about the terrain or environmental conditions.</p>
<p>NeBula is agnostic to the choice of robotic platform and can be used on wheeled rovers, legged platforms, as well as drones. On the other hand, Boston Dynamics is developing cutting-edge incredible robotic locomotion systems that can maintain the stability of the system over extreme environments. As a result, the combination of an autonomy solution like NeBula with a capable locomotion system like Boston Dynamics’ Spot opens up avenues for totally new classes of planetary and terrestrial missions.</p>
<p><strong>I know autonomy is a big piece of this. Do the robots need to be able to function with no human intervention?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, autonomy is the main focus of our project. In planetary exploration, specifically, when exploring underground caves, there is no, or very minimal, prior information about the environment. Further, when robots enter the cave, they typically lose communication with the surface and are on their own to accomplish the mission objectives.</p>
<p>As a result, autonomy is a crucial capability to enable such missions to accomplish mission goals with no human intervention when the robot is out of communication exploring previously unseen terrains and environments. To this end, JPL has been developing autonomy and AI solutions (called NeBula) acting as the robot brain, which is now being paired with Boston Dynamics Spot robots as the robot body.</p>

<p>A bit closer to Earth (as in, roughly 100 to 150 feet above our heads), Alphabet’s Wing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/wing-approaches-100000-drone-deliveries-two-years-after-logan-australia-launch/">announced this week</a> that it’s approaching 100,000 drone deliveries two years after launching in the Brisbane-adjacent city of Logan, Australia. The announcement follows recent insight into Amazon’s struggles in the drone delivery space.</p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch,” I think we’ll launch new services in Australia, Finland and the United States in the next six months. The capabilities of the technology are probably ahead of the regulatory permissions right now.”</p>

<p>A closer look at some of those 100,000 deliveries:</p>
<ul>
<li>10,000 cups of coffee</li>
<li>1,700 children’s snack packs</li>
<li>1,200 hot chooks (roasted chicken, in Australian)</li>
<li>2,700 sushi rolls</li>

<p>Speaking of food, LA-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/last-mile-robotic-delivery-firm-coco-raises-36m/">Coco just raised $36 million</a> for its delivery robots. The round brings its total funding up to $43 million. The UCLA spinout is currently piloting its 50-pound, remote-piloted robots in a variety of Los Angeles neighborhoods. The company tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are currently operating in Santa Monica and in five different L.A neighborhoods. Later this year we are expanding into a number of other major U.S. cities. We have partnered with national restaurant brands like SBE (Umami Burger) and are actively scaling across many locations, and we are serving a wide range of family operated restaurants like Bangkok West Thai in Santa Monica and San Pedro Brewing Company in Los Angeles. We are out of the pilot phase and are launching with dozens of new merchants every day.</p></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, California-based fast casual salad chain Sweetgreens <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/salad-chain-sweetgreen-buys-kitchen-robotics-startup-spyce/">just acquired Spyce</a>. Built by MIT alums, the company develops kitchen robotics, which it has rolled out in a pair of Boston-based restaurants. Sweetgreens eventually plans to implement these in some of its 120+ locations, though no timeline has been given as of yet.</p>

<p>In this week’s small-ray-of-sunshine-in-an-otherwise-horrifying-situation news, a team of young women roboticists <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/americas/afghanistan-women-robotics-team-intl-scli/index.html">managed to evacuate Kabul</a> amid the Taliban takeover.

<p>“From now on forward we will have opportunities for many more achievements in our lives, and thus be part of the fight for a better life,&#8221; team member Fatemah Qaderyan said at a press conference on their arrival in the country. &#8220;Although we are far from our homes, we will always be united and thanks to your help we will achieve it, thank you very much, we really appreciate having all our things here in Mexico with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team also <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/12/trump-afghan-girls-robots-240474">made international headlines in 2017</a>, as they entered the U.S. on a 10-day “parole,” in spite of the Trump administration’s executive order banning entry from predominately Muslim countries.</p>

<p>Before we go, a thought on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/musk-the-tesla-bot-is-coming/">Tesla robot</a>. Or, rather, a story. A few years ago, I was asked to be on a panel discussing robots for a group of people who weren’t really familiar with the field. That’s fine. There’s a lot to be said for getting outside your comfort zone. At the end, we opened things up to Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>As is nearly always the case with these things, the first question &#8212; well, it wasn’t a question really. It was more of a laundry list of things the asker would like to see a robot do. She went on to describe a small drone that flies from surface to surface, cleaning different parts of the house. I told her it sounded great, and I’d love to see her invent it.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PY33aGVHq2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/musk-the-tesla-bot-is-coming/">Musk: The Tesla Bot is coming</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Point is, I think the vast majority of people outside of robotics have an entirely unrealistic idea of what’s possible with technology today. There’s a reason iRobot spent the better part of a decade banging its head against the wall, working out a robot that can vacuum floors. There’s also a reason that the Roomba is really the only semi-ubiquitous home robot. Always be wary of robots announced onstage as a press event.</p>
<p>I’m not saying a Tesla robot is impossible. I’m just saying we have to temper our expectations of what is. Sometimes you go in expecting a robot and get someone in a spandex onesie doing the Dougie:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-introduces-the-news-partner-program/">launching</a> a new program that will allow subscription news organizations that participate in the Apple News app and meet certain requirements to lower their commission rate to 15% on qualifying in-app purchases taking place inside their apps on the App Store. Typically, Apple&#8217;s model for subscription-based apps involves a standard 30% commission during their first year on the App Store which then drops to 15% in year two. But the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/news-partner/">Apple News Partner Program</a>, announced today, will now make 15% the commission rate for participants starting on day one.</p>
<p>There are a few caveats to this condition, and they benefit Apple. To qualify, the news publisher must maintain a presence on Apple News and they have to provide their content in the Apple News Format (ANF). The latter is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_news/apple_news_format">the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format</a> that&#8217;s used to create articles for Apple News which are optimized for Mac, iPhone and other Apple mobile devices. Typically, this involves a bit of setup to translate news articles from a publisher&#8217;s website or from their CMS (content management system) to the supported JSON format. For WordPress and other popular CMS&#8217;s, there are also plugins available to make this process easier.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for publishers headquartered outside one of the four existing Apple News markets &#8212; the U.S., U.K., Australia, or Canada &#8212; they can instead satisfy the program&#8217;s obligations by providing Apple with an RSS feed.</p>
<p>On the App Store, the partner app qualifying for the 15% commission must be used to deliver &#8220;original, professionally authored&#8221; news content, and they must offer their auto-renewable subscriptions using Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase system.</p>

<p>While there is some initial work involved in establishing the publisher&#8217;s connection to Apple News, it&#8217;s worth noting that most major publishers already participate on Apple&#8217;s platform. That means they won&#8217;t have to do any additional work beyond what they&#8217;re already doing in order to transition over to the reduced commission for their apps. However, the program also serves as a way to push news organizations to continue to participate in the Apple News ecosystem, as it will make more financial sense to do so across their broader business.</p>
<p>That will likely be an area of contention for publishers, who would probably prefer that the reduced App Store commission didn&#8217;t come with strings attached.</p>
<p>Some publishers already worry that they&#8217;re giving up too much control over their business by tying themselves to the Apple News ecosystem. Last year, for example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/technology/new-york-times-apple-news-app.html">The New York Times announced</a> it would exit its partnership with Apple News, saying that Apple didn&#8217;t allow it to have as direct a relationship with readers as it wanted, and it would rather drive readers to its own app and website.</p>
<p>Apple, however, would argue that it doesn&#8217;t stand in the way of publishers&#8217; businesses &#8212; it lets them paywall their content and keep 100% of the ad revenue from the ads they sell. (If they can&#8217;t sell it all or would prefer Apple to do so on their behalf, they then split the commission with Apple, keeping 70% of revenues instead.) In addition, for the company&#8217;s Apple News+ subscription service &#8212; where the subscription revenue split is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/publishers-chafe-at-apples-terms-for-subscription-news-service-11549998416">much higher</a> &#8212; it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18281465/apple-news-wall-street-journal-deal">could be argued</a> that it&#8217;s &#8220;found money.&#8221; That is, Apple markets the service to customers the publisher hadn&#8217;t been able to attract on its own anyway.</p>
<p>The launch of the new Apple News Partner program comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">amid</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/08/technology/antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html">regulatory</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/apple-app-store-european-union-antitrust.html">scrutiny</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">over</a> how Apple manages its App Store business and more recently, proposed legislation aiming to address alleged anticompetitive issues<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/open-app-markets-act-app-stores-apple-google/"> both in the U.S.</a> and in major App Store markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/final-vote-delayed-for-koreas-plan-to-ban-google-and-apple-in-app-payment-rules/">like South Korea</a>.</p>

<p>Sensing this shift in the market, Apple had already been working to provide itself cover from antitrust complaints and lawsuits &#8212; like the one underway now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Apple">with Epic Games</a> &#8212; by adjusting its App Store commissions. Last year, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">launched the App Store Small Business Program</a>, which also lowered commissions on in-app purchases from 30% to 15% &#8212; but only for developers earning up to $1 million in revenues.</p>
<p>This program may have <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/11/apple-is-reducing-the-cut-it-takes-from-most-news-publishers-subscriptions/">helped smaller publishers</a>, but it was clear some major publishers still weren&#8217;t satisfied. After the reduced commissions for small businesses were announced in November, the publisher trade organization <a href="https://digitalcontentnext.org/">Digital Content Next</a> (DCN) &#8212; a representative for the AP, The New York Times, NPR, ESPN, Vox, The Washington Post, Meredith, Bloomberg, NBCU, The Financial Times, and others &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/major-u-s-news-publishers-join-the-coalition-for-app-fairness-advocacy-group-to-fight-the-apple-tax/?tpcc=ECTW2020">joined the advocacy group</a> and lobbying organization the <a href="https://appfairness.org/">Coalition for App Fairness</a> (CAF) the very next month.</p>
<p>These publishers, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/news-publishers-join-fight-against-apple-over-app-store-terms-11597949300">who had previously written to Apple CEO Tim Cook</a> to demand lower commissions &#8212; had other complaints about the revenue share beyond just the size of the split. They also didn&#8217;t want to be required to use Apple&#8217;s services for in-app purchases for their subscriptions, saying this &#8220;Apple tax&#8221; forces them to raise their prices for consumers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Fh3tWEoDgb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/major-u-s-news-publishers-join-the-coalition-for-app-fairness-advocacy-group-to-fight-the-apple-tax/">Major US news publishers join the Coalition for App Fairness advocacy group to fight the &#8216;Apple tax&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Major US news publishers join the Coalition for App Fairness advocacy group to fight the &#8216;Apple tax&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/major-u-s-news-publishers-join-the-coalition-for-app-fairness-advocacy-group-to-fight-the-apple-tax/embed/#?secret=Fh3tWEoDgb" data-secret="Fh3tWEoDgb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It remains to be seen how these publishers will now react to the launch of the Apple News Partner program.</p>
<p>While it gives them a way to lower their App Store fees, it doesn&#8217;t address their broader complaints against Apple&#8217;s platform and its rules. If anything, it ties the lower fees to a program that locks them in further to the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p>Apple, in a gesture of goodwill, also said today it would recommit <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/apple-teams-with-media-literacy-programs-in-the-us-and-europe/">support</a> to three leading media non-profits, Common Sense Media, the News Literacy Project, and Osservatorio Permanente Giovani-Editori. These non-profits offer nonpartisan, independent media literacy programs, which Apple views as key to its larger mission to empower people to become smart and active news readers. Apple also said it would later announce further media literacy projects from other organizations. The company would not disclose the size of its commitment from a financial standpoint however, or discuss how much it has sent such organizations in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;Providing Apple News customers with access to trusted information from our publishing partners has been our priority from day one,&#8221; said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services, in a statement. &#8220;For more than a decade, Apple has offered our customers many ways to access and enjoy news content across our products and services. We have hundreds of news apps from dozens of countries around the world available in the App Store, and created Apple News Format to offer publishers a tool to showcase their content and provide a great experience for millions of Apple News users,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>More details about the program and the application form will be available at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/news-partner/">News Partner Program website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.brightlive.com/">Bright</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/live-video-platform-bright-lets-you-zoom-with-your-favorite-creators/">a live video platform</a> that lets fans engage in live conversations with their favorite creators and celebs, has raised $15 million in new funding, the company announced today. The round was co-led by co-founder and <a href="https://variety.com/2020/music/news/guy-oseary-madonna-u2-manager-maverick-1234618275/">talent manager</a> Guy Oseary&#8217;s Sound Ventures, the fund he founded with Ashton Kutcher. RIT Capital and Regah Ventures also co-led.</p>
<p>Other investors in the new round include Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures, Globo Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Shawn Mendes &amp; Manager Andrew Gertler&#8217;s AG Ventures, as well as Jeff Lawson, CEO and co-founder of Twilio.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of artists, performers, actors and other celebrities also invested, Bright says, including Rachel Zoe, Drew and Jonathan Scott, Judd Apatow, Ashton Kutcher, Amy Schumer, Bethenny Frankel and Ryan Tedder. Meanwhile, Jessica Alba, Kane Brown and Maria Sharapova are joining the company as advisors.</p>
<p>Bright, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/live-video-platform-bright-lets-you-zoom-with-your-favorite-creators/">which first debuted in May</a>, was co-founded by Madonna and U2 talent manager Guy Oseary along with early YouTube product manager Michael Powers, who had previously launched the YouTube Channels feature while at Google. The startup&#8217;s premise is to tap into the growing creator economy in a way that allows creators to better monetize their success outside of ad-supported networks, like YouTube, so they can grow their own business.</p>

<p>The platform itself is built on top of Zoom &#8212; a choice that not only saves Bright from starting from scratch for its real-time video technology, but also one that leverages the broad adoption Zoom has since seen due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>At launch, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/live-video-platform-bright-lets-you-zoom-with-your-favorite-creators/">Bright announced a lineup</a> that included over 200 prominent creators who were set to host ticketed online events where they share their stories or expertise, engage in interviews, offer advice and more. Today, Bright says now over 320 notable names have joined the service to engage with fans and continue to build their brand. The list includes Madonna, Naomi Campbell, D-Nice, the D’Amelio Sisters, Laura Dern, Deepak Chopra, Lindsey Vonn, Diego Boneta, Jason Bolden, Yris Palmer, Cat &amp; Nat, Ronnie2K and Chef Ludo Lefebvre. Even more are on board to host future sessions, with Bright now on track to double the number of creators on board by year-end.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike social media creator tools, Bright is focused on knowledge-sharing rather than just gaining likes or follows. For example, one the first sessions featured actor Laura Dern speaking about personal growth, while another featured streamer and online creator Ronnie2K hosting a series about building a career in gaming. In other words, Bright doesn&#8217;t only showcase Hollywood entertainment or top artists &#8212; it&#8217;s open to anyone whose fan base would be willing to pay to hear them talk.</p>
<p>Today, there are sessions across a variety of interests and topics, organized into areas like craft, home, money, culture, body and mind.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146982" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146982" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2146982" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?w=381" alt="" width="381" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg 909w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=168,300 168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=768,1371 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=381,680 381w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=860,1536 860w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146982" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bright session example</p></div></p>
<p>Bright itself generates revenue by taking a 20% commission on creator revenue, which is somewhat lower than the traditional marketplace split of 30/70 (platform/creator) but higher than some of the newer platforms available today, like Clubhouse and its commission-free direct <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/clubhouse-rolls-out-payments-to-over-60k-creators-following-initial-test">payments</a>.</p>
<p>The startup says the funding is being used to help roll out Creator Studio, a new suite of creator tools for managing learning sessions, audience communication and revenue performance. These sorts of analytics and tools are aimed at serving creators who are working to build a business through live sessions, in addition to growing their fan base.</p>
<p>Initially, creators in September will gain access to a sessions list tool for managing announcements of upcoming sessions, and placing sessions for sale with tickets and pricing. Later in the year, it will be expanded to include analytics, connections for messaging participants directly, and a wallet feature for tracking revenue, Bright says.</p>
<p>The funds will also help Bright to add new interactive features, like instant polls and the ability to share learning materials with attendees, as well as to onboard the influx of new talent.</p>

<p>These features could potentially help Bright stand out from a growing number of competitors looking to serve online creators, which today includes major tech companies like YouTube, Facebook, TikTok and Twitter. However, Oseary&#8217;s ability to leverage his personal network to pull in big names is, for now, the more notable differentiator.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a believer in lifelong learning, I&#8217;m proud to be investing in a platform like Bright, offering audiences the unique opportunity to learn directly from the artists and experts they admire the most,&#8221; said new investor, director and producer, Judd Apatow, in a statement. &#8220;Through Bright, I can directly connect and share my knowledge with fellow writers, aspiring directors and lovers of comedy,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Bright declined to share details as to its revenue, but did tell TechCrunch that its seeing ticket prices range from $25 to $150 per 1 to 2 hour sessions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s inspiring to have the support of incredible investors as well as these notable artists and entrepreneurs. All our partners share Bright’s vision that people want to level up their lives by learning directly from those they admire,&#8221; Bright CEO Michael Powers said, in an announcement. &#8220;Through Bright, talent can better engage authentically with audiences by sharing their own knowledge and bringing their many interests and passions to the foreground. We are excited to roll out our new features to continue elevating our platform and mission&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Voice skins” have become a very popular feature for AI-based voice assistants, to help personalize some of the more anodyne aspects of helpful, yet also kind of bland and robotic, speaking voices you get on services like Alexa. Now a startup that is building voice skins for different companies to use across their services, and for third parties to create and apply as well, is raising some funding to fuel its growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lovo.ai/">LOVO</a>, the Berkeley, California-based artificial intelligence (AI) voice &amp; synthetic speech tool developer, this week closed a $4.5 million pre-Series A round led by South Korean Kakao Entertainment along with Kakao Investment and LG CNS, an IT solution affiliate of LG Group.</p>
<p>Its previous investor SkyDeck Fund and a private investor, vice president of finance at DoorDash Michael Kim, also joined the funding.</p>
<p>The proceeds will be used to propel its research and development in artificial intelligence and synthetic speech and grow the team.</p>
<p>“We plan on hiring heavily across all functions, from machine learning, artificial intelligence and product development to marketing and business development. The fund will also be allocated to securing resources such as GPUs and CPUs,&#8221; co-founder and chief operating officer Tom Lee told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>LOVO, founded in November 2019, has 17 people including both co-founders, chief executive office Charlie Choi and COO Lee.</p>
<p>The company plans to double down on improving LOVO’s AI model, enhance its AI voices and develop a better product that surpasses any that exists in the current market, Lee said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our goal is to be a global leader in providing AI voices that touches people’s hearts and emotions. We want to democratize limitations of content production. We want to be the platform for all things voice-related,” Lee said.</p>
<p>With the mission, LOVO allows enterprises and individual content creators to generate voiceover content for using in marketing, e-learning, customer support, movies, games, chatbots and augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).</p>

<p>“Since our launch a little over a year ago, users have created over 5 million voice content on our platform,” co-founder and CEO Choi said.</p>
<p>LOVO launched its first product LOVO Studio last year, which provides an easy-to-use application for individuals and businesses to find the voice they want, produce, and publish their voiceover content. Developers can utilize LOVO’s Voiceover API to turn text into speeches in real-time, integrated into their applications. Users also can create their own AI voices by simply reading 15 minutes of script via LOVO’s DIY Voice Cloning service.</p>
<p>LOVO owns more than 200 voice skins that provide users with voices categorized by language, style, and situation suited for their various needs.</p>
<p>The global text to speech (TTS) market is estimated at $3 billions, with the global voiceover market at around $10 billion, according to Lee. The Global TTS market is projected to increase $5.61 billion by 2028 from $1.94 billion in 2020, based on <a href="https://researchinterviewer.com/2021/08/22/text-to-speech-market-size-and-forecast/">Research Interviewer’s report published in August 2021</a>.</p>
<p>LOVO already secured 50,000 users and more than 50 enterprise customers including the US-based J.B. Hunt, Bouncer, CPA Canada, LG CNS, and South Korea’s Shinhan Bank, Lee mentioned.</p>
<p>LOVO’s four core markets are marketing, education, movies and games in entertainment and AR/VR, Lee said. The movie Spiral, the latest film of the Saw Series, features LOVO’s voice in the film, he noted.</p>
<p>It is expected that LOVO will create additional synergies in the entertainment industry in the wake of the latest funding from a South Korean entertainment.</p>
<p>VP of CEO Vision Office at Kakao Entertainment J.H. Ryu said, “I’m excited for LOVO’s synergies with Kakao Entertainment’s future endeavors in the entertainment vertical, especially with web novels and music,” Ryu also added, “AI technology is opening the doors to a new market for audio content, and we expect a future a where an individual’s voice will be utilized effectively as an intellectual property and as an asset.”</p>
<p>Founding Partner at SkyDeck Fund Chon Tang said, “Audio is uniquely engaging as a form of information but also difficult to produce, especially at scale. LOVO’s artificial intelligence-based synthesis platform has consistently out-performed other cloud-based solutions in quality and cost.”</p>
<p>LOVO is also preparing to penetrate further to international market, “We have a strong presence in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and are getting signals from the rest of Europe, South America and Asia,” Lee said. LOVO has an office in South Korea and is looking to expand into Europe soon, Lee added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech giants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> have pledged billions to bolster U.S. cybersecurity following a meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The meeting, which also included attendees from the financial and education sectors, was held following months of high-profile cyberattacks against critical infrastructure and several U.S. government agencies, along with a glaring cybersecurity skills gap; according to data from <a href="https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html">CyberSeek</a>, there are currently almost 500,000 cybersecurity jobs across the U.S that remain unfilled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of our critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, and the federal government can&#8217;t meet this challenge alone,&#8221; Biden said at the start of the meeting. &#8220;I&#8217;ve invited you all here today because you have the power, the capacity and the responsibility, I believe, to raise the bar on cybersecurity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to help the U.S. in its fight against a growing number of cyberattacks, Big Tech pledged to invest billions of dollars to strengthen cybersecurity defenses and to train skilled cybersecurity workers.</p>
<p>Apple has vowed to work with its 9,000-plus suppliers in the U.S. to drive “mass adoption” of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> and security training, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/25/fact-sheet-biden-administration-and-private-sector-leaders-announce-ambitious-initiatives-to-bolster-the-nations-cybersecurity/">according to the White House</a>, as well as to establish a new program to drive continuous security improvements throughout the technology supply chain.</p>
<p>Google said it will invest more than $10 billion over the next five years to expand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/zero-trust/">zero-trust</a> programs, help secure the software supply chain, and to enhance open source security. The search and ads giant has also pledged to train 100,000 Americans in fields like IT support and data analytics, learning in-demand skills including data privacy and security.</p>
<p>“Robust cybersecurity ultimately depends on having the people to implement it,” said Kent Walker, Google&#8217;s global affairs chief. “That includes people with digital skills capable of designing and executing cybersecurity solutions, as well as promoting awareness of cybersecurity risks and protocols among the broader population.”</p>
<p>And, Microsoft said it&#8217;s committing $20 billion to integrate cybersecurity by design and deliver &#8220;advanced security solutions.&#8221; It also announced that it will immediately make available $150 million in technical services to help federal, state, and local governments with upgrading security protection, and will expand partnerships with community colleges and non-profits for cybersecurity training.</p>
<p>Other attendees included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws/">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS), Amazon’s cloud computing arm, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ibm/">IBM</a>. The former has said it will make its security awareness training available to the public and equip all AWS customers with hardware multi-factor authentication devices, while IBM said it will help to train more than 150,000 people in cybersecurity skills over the next five years.</p>
<p>While many have welcomed Big Tech’s commitments, David Carroll, managing director at Nominet Cyber, told TechCrunch that these latest initiatives set a “powerful precedent” and show “the gloves are well and truly off” — some within the cybersecurity industry remain skeptical.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">Following the announcement, some <a href="https://twitter.com/hacks4pancakes/status/1430737810055651331?s=21">infosec veterans</a> noted that</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> many of the vacant cybersecurity jobs the U.S. is looking to fill <a href="https://twitter.com/ki_twyce_/status/1430717877569654785">fall behind</a> on competitive salaries and few, if any, benefits.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So 500,000 open cybersecurity jobs and almost that same amount or more looking for jobs,&#8221; said Khalilah Scott, founder of <a href="https://www.techsecchix.com/about-techsecchix">TechSecChix</a>, a foundation for supporting women in technology, <a href="https://twitter.com/ki_twyce_/status/1430717877569654785">in a tweet</a>. &#8220;Make it make sense.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lordstown Motors has hired Daniel A. Ninivaggi, a longtime automotive executive and former head of Carl C. Icahn&#8217;s holding company, as CEO and a board member. The appointment follows months of tumult at Lordstown, which became publicly traded via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company.</p>
<p>In June, founder and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/lordstown-motors-ceo-and-cfo-resign-amidst-production-woes/">CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez resigned</a> following a disappointing first-quarter earnings that revealed the company was consuming more capital than expected and unable to reach previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">forecasted production numbers</a> for its electric Endurance pickup truck. The resignations were also tied to a board committee investigation that found inaccuracies in some of the company&#8217;s disclosures on its truck preorders.</p>
<p>The resignations were just one of several problems, including allegations of fraud and separate investigations by the Department of Justice and the SEC, that has put the two-year-old company at risk of failing. Lordstown did receive a lifeline in August when hedge fund YA II PN purchased 35.1 million shares, or about 19.9% of outstanding shares. The sale provided much-needed capital required to produce its first electric vehicle at the former GM Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio.</p>
<p>Ninivaggi has the background to bring order to Lordstown&#8217;s business. He is also bullish on the company&#8217;s product, noting in a statement that the demand for full-size electric pickup trucks will be strong and that Lordstown&#8217;s Endurance truck has the opportunity to capture a meaningful share of the market.</p>
<p>The former CEO of Icahn Enterprises, has served in a variety of senior leadership positions in the automotive and transportation industries, beginning at Lear Corporation, where he eventually became executive vice president. He was later coo-chairman and co-CEO of automotive components supplier Federal Mogul Holdings Corporation ahead of its sale to Tenneco.</p>
<p>While with Icahn Enterprises, Ninivaggi also oversaw the company&#8217;s automotive aftermarket service network and parts distribution businesses. He also has a long history directing public companies, including Motorola Mobility (prior to its sale to Google), Navistar International, Hertz Global Holdings and CVR Energy.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Peter Thiel&#8217;s AI company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/palantir" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="11" data-v9y="1">Palantir</a>, whose clients have included the CIA and US immigration agency <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-03-feds-are-using-palantirs-tech-to-root-out-immigrants.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="12" data-v9y="1">ICE</a>, is back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. A new report claims a glitch in its secretive software program used by the FBI allowed unauthorized personnel to access private data for more than a year. According to <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/25/fbi-palantir-glitch-allowed-unauthorized-access-to-private-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="13" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Post</em></a>, the mishap was revealed in a letter by prosecutors in the Manhattan federal court case against accused hacker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-01-crypto-expert-arrested-over-north-korea-sanctions.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="1">Virgil Griffith</a>. Palantir denied the claims in a statement and said the fault was caused by the FBI&#8217;s incorrect use of the software.</p>
<p>Griffith was arrested in 2019 for allegedly providing North Korea with information on how cryptocurrency and blockchain tech could help it to evade US sanctions. The incident in question revolves around the alleged hacker&#8217;s social media data, obtained through a federal search warrant in March 2020. According to the letter, the Twitter and Facebook information was uploaded to Palantir&#8217;s program through the default settings, effectively allowing unauthorized FBI employees to access it</p>
<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>Between May 2020 to August 2021, the material was accessed four times by three analysts and an agent. The FBI case agent assigned to Griffith&#8217;s case was alerted to the issue by a colleague earlier this month, according to the letter. Those who accessed the info reportedly told prosecutors that they did not recall using it in their investigations.</p>
<p>“An FBI analyst, in the course of conducting a separate investigation, had identified communications between the defendant and the subject of that other investigation by means of searches on the Platform that accessed the Search Warrant Returns,” the letter noted.</p>
<p>Palantir is trying to distance itself from the issue. &#8220;There was no glitch in the software,&#8221; it told <em>The New York Post</em> in a statement, adding that the &#8220;customer&#8221; did not follow the &#8220;rigorous protocols established to protect search warrant returns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amid increasing growth, the last thing Palantir needs is a major PR crisis involving flaws in its software. Since going public last fall, the company has seen its revenues <a href="https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-Reports-49-Revenue-Growth-US-Commercial-Revenue-Up-90-YY" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">surge</a>, though it&#8217;s operational losses are also increasing. Palantir&#8217;s customers now span government agencies, tech stalwarts like<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-02-08-IBM-and-Palantir-Partner-to-Help-Businesses-Easily-Deploy-Powerful-and-Open-AI-Applications-Unlock-Valuable-Data-Across-Hybrid-Cloud-Environments" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1"> IBM</a>and even mining group <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005373/en/Palantir-Technologies-and-Rio-Tinto-Sign-Multi-Year-Enterprise-Partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Rio Tinto</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Porsche Cars North America has added its entire U.S. inventory of new cars to its online marketplace as the company seeks to keep up with customer demands and the industry&#8217;s shift to digital commerce.</p>
<p>When the online marketplace Porsche Finder launched in May 2020, customers were only able to search for pre-owned and certified pre-owned vehicles using the tool. That platform, which lets customers search by vehicle model and generation as well as price, equipment, packages and colors, now includes all new vehicle inventory from its 193 U.S. dealerships.</p>
<p>The platform, which was developed by automaker&#8217;s Porsche Digital subsidiary and PCNA, also includes features that let customers estimate a trade-in value and a payment calculator to compare leasing and financing options from Porsche Financial Services.</p>
<p>Online platforms that allow customers to search for products are not new. As customers shift their shopping to online — a trend that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic — digital platforms have become a critical tool for companies.</p>
<p>Established automakers like Porsche, however, have had to balance the demand of its customers and dealership network. Porsche doesn&#8217;t have a direct sales model like Tesla and new entrants Lucid Group and Rivian.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dealership is still at the center of everything we do,&#8221; PCNA President and CEO Kjell Gruner said in a recent interview. &#8220;At the dealership, we believe very much in personal interaction — in looking somebody in the eye, reading their body language. And, of course, our products are very physical.&#8221;</p>
<p>While all 193 dealers are participating in the Porsche Finder tool, Gruner acknowledged that this large group includes those who have been more cautious about the move toward digital commerce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;You always have some more innovative people, some more cautious,&#8221; he said. &#8220;COVID &#8230; really prompted a willingness to go digital and to use those tools for their own advantage.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.breezometer.com/">BreezoMeter</a> has been on a mission to make environmental health hazards accessible to as many people as possible. Through its <a href="https://blog.breezometer.com/breezometers-air-quality-index">air quality index (AQI) calculations</a>, the Israel-based company can now identify the quality of air down to a few meters in dozens of countries. A partnership with Apple to include its data into the iOS Weather app along with its own popular apps delivers those metrics to hundreds of millions of users, and an API product allows companies to tap into its dataset for their own purposes.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/breezometer-the-iphone-tool-that-measures-air-quality-raises-a-30m-series-c/">Right on the heels of a $30 million Series C round a few weeks ago</a>, the company is radially expanding its product from air quality into the real-time detection of wildfire perimeters with its new product, Wildfire Tracker.</p>
<p>The new product will take advantage of the company’s fusion of sensor data, satellite imagery, and local eyewitness reports to be able to identify the edges of wildfires in real-time. “People expect accurate wildfire information just as they expect accurate weather or humidity data,” Ran Korber, CEO and co-founder, said. “It has an immediate effect on their life.” He added further that BreezoMeter wants to “try to connect the dots between climate tech and human health.”</p>
<p>Fire danger zones will be indicated with polygonal boundaries marked in red, and as always, air quality data will be viewable in these zones and in surrounding areas.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192952" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192952" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2192952" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/smoke-travel-US_BreezoMeter.gif?w=600" alt="" width="600" height="337" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192952" class="wp-caption-text">BreezoMeter&#8217;s air quality maps can show the spread of wildfire pollution easily. Image Credits: BreezoMeter.</p></div></p>
<p>Korber emphasized that getting these perimeters accurate across dozens of countries was no easy feat. Sensors can be sparse, particularly in the forests where wildfires ignite. Meanwhile, satellite data that focuses on thermal imaging can be fooled. “We’re looking for abnormalities … many of the times you have these false positives,” Korber said. He gave an example of a large solar panel array which can look very hot with thermal sensors but obviously isn’t a fire.</p>
<p>The identified fire perimeters will be available for free to consumers on <a href="https://www.breezometer.com/air-quality-map/air-quality/">BreezoMeter’s air quality map website</a>, and will shortly come to the company’s apps as well. Later this year, these perimeters will be available from the company’s APIs for commercial customers. Korber hopes the API endpoints will give companies like car manufacturers the ability to forewarn drivers that they are approaching a conflagration.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new feature is just a continuation of BreezoMeter’s long-time expansion of its product. “When we started, it was just air quality … and only forecasting air pollution in Israel,” Korber said. “Almost every year since then, we expanded the product portfolio to new environmental hazards.” He pointed to the addition of pollen in 2018 and the increasingly global nature of the app.</p>
<p>Wildfire detection is an, ahem, hot area these days for VC investors. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/cornea-eyes-in-on-fighting-wildfires-using-better-data/">Cornea is a startup focused on helping firefighters identify and mitigate blazes</a>, while Perimeter wants to help identify boundaries of wildfires and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go/">give explicit evacuation instructions complete with maps</a>. As Silicon Valley’s home state of California and much of the world increasingly become a tinderbox for fires, expect more investment and products to enter this area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Finding the right learning platform can be difficult, especially as companies look to upskill and reskill their talent to meet demand for certain technological capabilities, like data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence roles.</p>
<p><a href="http://workera.ai/">Workera.ai</a>’s approach is to personalize learning plans with targeted resources — both technical and nontechnical roles — based on the current level of a person’s proficiency, thereby closing the skills gap.</p>
<p>The Palo Alto-based company secured $16 million in Series A funding, led by New Enterprise Associates, and including existing investors Owl Ventures and AI Fund, as well as individual investors in the AI field like Richard Socher, Pieter Abbeel, Lake Dai and Mehran Sahami.</p>
<p>Kian Katanforoosh, Workera’s co-founder and CEO, says not every team is structured or feels supported in their learning journey, so the company comes at the solution from several angles with an assessment on technical skills, where the employee wants to go in their career and what skills they need for that, and then Workera will connect those dots from where the employee is in their skillset to where they want to go. Its library has more than 3,000 micro-skills and personalized learning plans.</p>
<p>“It is what we call precision upskilling,” he told TechCrunch. “The skills data then can go to the organization to determine who are the people that can work together best and have a complementary skill set.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="U9Rwn2ErLI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/mapping-out-one-edtech-companys-200m-bet-on-lifelong-learning/">Mapping out one edtech company’s $200M bet on lifelong learning</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mapping out one edtech company’s $200M bet on lifelong learning&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/mapping-out-one-edtech-companys-200m-bet-on-lifelong-learning/embed/#?secret=U9Rwn2ErLI" data-secret="U9Rwn2ErLI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Workera was founded in 2020 by Katanforoosh and James Lee, COO, after working with Andrew Ng, Coursera co-founder and Workera’s chairman. When Lee first connected with Katanforoosh, he knew the company would be able to solve the problem around content and basic fundamentals of upskilling.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It raised a $5 million seed round last October to give the company a total of $21 million raised to date. This latest round was driven by the company’s go-to-market strategy and customer traction after having acquired over 30 customers in 12 countries.</p>
<p>Over the past few quarters, the company began working with Fortune 500 companies, including Siemens Energy, across industries like professional services, medical devices and energy, Lee said. As <a href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/are-we-losing-jobs-effect-of-artificial-intelligence-in-workforce/">spending on AI skills</a> is expected to exceed $79 billion by 2022, he says Workera will assist in closing the gap.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a need to measure skills,” he added. “The size of the engagements are a sign as is the interest for tech and non-tech teams to develop AI literacy, which is a more pressing need.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ATuBM4qOvi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/there-is-no-cybersecurity-skills-gap-but-cisos-must-think-creatively/">There is no cybersecurity skills gap, but CISOs must think creatively</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As a result, it was time to increase the engineering and science teams, Katanforoosh said. He plans to use the new funding to invest in more talent in those areas and to build out new products. In addition, there are a lot of natural language processes going on behind the scenes, and he wants the company to better understand it at a granular level so that the company can assess people more precisely.</p>
<p>Carmen Chang, general partner and head of Asia at NEA, said she is a limited partner in Ng’s AI fund and in Coursera, and has looked at a lot of his companies.</p>
<p>She said she is “very excited” to lead the round and about Workera’s concept. The company has a good understanding of the employee skill set, and with the tailored learning program, will be able to grow with company needs, Chang added.</p>
<p>“You can go out and hire anyone, but investing in the people that you have, educating and training them, will give you a look at the totality of your employees,” Chang said. “Workera is able to go in and test with AI and machine learning and map out the skill sets within a company so they will be able to know what they have, and that is valuable, especially in this environment.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tuna is on a mission to "fine tune" the payments space in Latin America.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tuna is on a mission to &#8220;fine tune&#8221; the payments space in Latin America and has raised two seed rounds totaling $3 million, led by Canary and by Atlantico.</p>
<p>Alex Tabor, Paul Ascher and Juan Pascual met each other on the engineering team of Peixe Urbano, a company Tabor co-founded and he referred to as a “Groupon for Brazil.” While there, they came up with a way to use A/B testing to create a way of dealing with payments in different markets.</p>
<p>They eventually left Peixe Urbano and started Tuna in 2019 to make their own payment product which enables merchants to use A/B testing of credit card processors and anti-fraud providers to optimize their payments processing with one integration and a no-code interface.</p>
<p>Tabor explained that the e-commerce landscape in Latin America was consolidated, meaning few banks controlled more of the market. The address verification system merchants use to verify a purchaser is who they say they are, involves sending information to a bank that is returned to the merchant with a score of whether that match is legitimate.</p>
<p>“In the U.S., that score is used to determine if the purchaser is legit, but they didn’t implement that in Latin America,” he added. “Instead, merchants in Latam have to tap into other organizations that have that data.”</p>
<p>That process involves manual analysis and constant adjusting due to fraud. Instead, Tuna’s A/B tests between processors and anti-fraud providers in real time and provides a guarantee that a decision to swap providers is based on objective data that considers all components of performance, like approval rates, and not just fees.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the company added 12 customers and saw its revenue increase 15%. It boasts a customer list that includes the large Brazilian fashion chain Riachuelo, and its platform integrates with others including VTEX, Magento and WooCommerce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/445865/e-commerce-share-of-retail-sales-in-latam/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20e%2Dcommerce%20sales,surpassing%20seven%20percent%20by%202023.">share of e-commerce in overall retail</a> is less than 10 percent in Latin America. Marcos Toledo, Canary’s managing partner, said via email that e-commerce in Latam is currently at an inflexion point: not only has the global pandemic driven more online purchases, but also fintech innovation that has occurred in recent years.</p>
<p>In Brazil alone, e-commerce sales grew 73.88% in 2020, but Toledo said there was much room for improvement. What Tuna is building will help companies navigate the situation and make it easier for more customers to buy online.</p>
<p>Toledo met the Tuna team from his partner, Julio Vasconcellos, who was one of the co-founders of Peixe Urbano. When the firm heard that the other Tuna co-founders were starting a business that was applying some of the optimization methods they had created at Peixe Urbano, but for every company, they saw it as an opportunity to get involved.</p>
<p>“The vast tech expertise that Alex, Paul and Juan bring to a very technical business is something that we really admire, as well as their vision to create a solution that can impact companies throughout Latin America,” Toledo said. “The no-code solution that Tuna is building is exciting because it is scalable and can help companies not only get better margins, but also drive their developers to other efforts — and developers have been a very scarce workforce in the region.”</p>
<p>To meet demand for an <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/quarterly-online-sales/">e-commerce industry that surpassed $200 billion in 2020</a>, Tuna plans to use the new funding to build out its team and grow outbound customer success and R&amp;D, Tabor said.</p>
<p>Up next, he wants to be able to show traction in payments optimization and facilitators in Brazil before moving on to other countries. He has identified Mexico, Colombia and Argentina as potential new markets.</p>
