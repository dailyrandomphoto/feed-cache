										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>A few items before jumping in. Policy corner is going on hiatus for a bit. A message from reporter Aria Alamalhodaei:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249664" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;For the time being, your favorite mini-roundup of transportation policy news will be taking an extended hiatus. I hope to be back with you in the second quarter of 2022! If you have tips or policy news you want to share, send it over to Kirsten or Rebecca. See you next year!”&#8221;</p>
<p>Secondly, I (that&#8217;s me Kirsten) am taking a bit of holiday time and will see you next year! Wishing all my readers a happy holiday and good health in the coming year.</p>
<p>Tthe transportation world lost one of its leaders this week. <strong>Ryan Popple</strong>, a former active duty Army officer and early member of Tesla&#8217;s finance team who rose through the ranks before leaving to become a partner at Kleiner Perkins and CEO of electric bus manufacturer Proterra, died unexpectedly at 44 years old. He is survived by a wife and three children. Popple had recently left Proterra and had joined G2 Venture Partners.</p>
<p class="">As G2 Venture Partners wrote in its remembrance of Popple: &#8220;Ryan embodied entrepreneurial spirit and devoted his life to creating a better future. His leadership at Proterra was first and foremost about increasing access to affordable, sustainable solutions and shaping a zero-emission transportation future for the benefit of our planet and the health of our communities. His work as a partner at  and Kleiner Perkins was dedicated to leading the sustainable transformation of industries. A former active duty officer in the U.S. Army, Ryan put country before self in uniform, and in civilian life.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I first interviewed Ryan back in 2016. During that interview and the few times we spoke since then, I was always struck with the particular combination of passion and practicality that he brought to every conversation. Ryan, you will be missed.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Hazel Chapman</strong>, the co-founder of Lotus Cars and former British racing driver, <a href="https://jalopnik.com/hazel-chapman-co-founder-of-lotus-cars-dies-age-94-1848214166">died earlier this week</a> at the age of 94.</p>
<p>As always, you can email me at <a href="mailto:kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com</a> to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. You also can send a direct message to me at Twitter — <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@kirstenkorosec</a></p>

<p>Welcome folks, let&#8217;s get right to it.</p>
<p><strong>Tier</strong>, a Berlin-based micromobilty operator that just keeps growing, has acquired <strong>Wind Mobility&#8217;s</strong> Italian operations. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/e-scooter-company-tier-acquires-wind-mobilitys-italian-subsidiary/">Terms of the deal were not disclosed</a>, but this is Tier&#8217;s second company purchase of late, and Wind&#8217;s second sale, as well. Wind also sold off its Israeli operations to Yandex, the Russian tech giant, a few months ago.</p>
<p>By the way, Tier also just released some stats about its London trial. Since the trial started in June, Tier scooters have seen more than 218,000 miles of trips on the road..</p>
<p><strong>Zoomo</strong>, the Australian e-bike subscription platform for enterprise and gig economy delivery workers, has come out with a new utility e-bike, the Zoomo One, that it&#8217;s hoping will take the place of the humble moped. It can handle payloads of 88 lbs in the back and 40 lbs in the front, and can handle deliveries no matter the weather or terrain, according to the company.</p>
<p><strong>Unagi</strong>, the e-scooter manufacturer, has announced the nationwide expansion of its all-access subscription plan, which allows subscribers to pay-as-you-go on a monthly plan for about $50 a month, or pay for an annual plan of $39 per month. No commitments, no cancel fees, no worries.</p>
<p><strong>Gogoro</strong> launched a new urban battery swapping initiative that uses Gogoro-powered smart parking meters, co-developed with Shengming Technology. The company says the meters will provide cities with smart city tech that fast track the deployment of wireless connectivity and off-grid power for a range of users including parking management. The meters are currently being deployed in New Taipei City, Taiwan, and will be operational in early 2022, with an additional 6,000 meters rolling out across the country by the end of the year.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Harley-Davidson</strong> announced that its taking electric motorcycle division LiveWire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/harley-davidsons-ev-motorcycle-unit-livewire-to-go-public-via-spac/">public through a merger</a> with a blank check company sponsored by executives of AEA Investors and Bridges Fund Management.</p>
<p>First the details: the agreement is with special purpose acquisition company AEA-Bridges Impact Corp (ABIC). The deal is funded by $400 million that ABIC is holding in trust, a $100 million investment from Harley-Davidson and $100 million from Kymco. Harley-Davidson will own about 74% of the newly combined company. The SPAC shareholders will have a 17% ownership, with the remaining 4% being held by SPAC founders and Kymco. The combined company is expected to have an enterprise value of about $1.77 billion and post-money equity value of about $2.31 billion at closing. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? The deal will preserve much of Harley-Davidson’s ownership while giving LiveWire access to the capital that the public markets can provide and fold in Kymco as a key partner.</p>
<p>My prediction: if 2020 and 2021 were the years of the SPAC, 2022 will be the year of the public spin out. Watch for more legacy companies to follow Harley-Davidson&#8217;s LiveWire spin out strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Apex.ai</strong>, mobility software startup founded by Bosch veterans and automated systems engineers Jan Becker and Dejan Pangercic, raised a Series B<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/mobility-software-startup-apex-ai-lands-supplier-giants-continental-zf-as-investors/"> $56.5 million round</a> led by Orillion. AGCO, Canaan, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Airbus Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover&#8217;s InMotion Ventures, Continental and ZF also participated.. Apex has raised a total of $74 million to date, a figure that includes previously announced investments from Volvo Group Venture Capital, Toyota Ventures and HELLA Ventures. ZF is taking a 5% stake in Apex.</p>
<p><strong> Gopuff</strong> is in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/gopuff-the-instant-grocery-startup-is-raising-up-to-1-5b-at-up-to-a-40b-valuation-ahead-of-going-public-as-soon-as-mid-2022/">raising $1.5 billion</a>, with a valuation of up to $40 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Solvento</strong>, a platform that provides trucking companies with immediate access to capital, raised $4.5 million in funding led by Dynamo Ventures with participation from Wollef Ventures and Zenda Capital. The funding includes a $3 million debt facility from Marco Financial.</p>
<p><strong>Vay</strong>, a company that is trying to get self-driving car services to market faster by pursuing a teledriven approach, has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/vay-raises-95m-to-bring-teledriven-self-driving-transportation-service-to-hamburg-in-2022/"> raised a $95 million Series B round</a> to help it launch its first commercial service in Hamburg, Germany sometime in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Aerospace</strong>, an aerospace and technology company, started trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker EVTL.</p>
<p><strong>Voly</strong>, a five-month-old Sydney-based startup that offers thousands of SKUs and promises deliveries in 15 minutes at a flat fee of A$2.99 ($2.14), has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/voly-raises-13m-led-by-sequoia-to-deliver-instant-groceries-in-australia/">raised A$18 million</a> (just under $13 million at today&#8217;s rates) in a seed round of funding that it will be using to expand its business to cities and towns across the country.</p>
<p><strong>WeRide</strong>, the Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company, received a strategic investment from Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC Group). The companies did not disclose the terms.</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p>It was a crazy week in the world of autonomous vehicles!</p>
<p><strong>Aurora&#8217;s</strong> self-driving trucks are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/aurora-self-driving-trucks-are-using-uber-freight-to-haul-goods-for-customers/">hauling goods for Uber Freight</a> customers in Texas as part of a multiphase commercial pilot that aims to more closely integrate the two companies. Aurora is using the Uber Freight brokerage platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered, to haul freight for customers between Dallas and Houston. Aurora said it will expand routes as it adds more terminals.</p>
<p><strong>Einride</strong>, an electric and autonomous freight company from Sweden, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2021/12/14/einride-goes-crypto-with-first-nft-auction/?sh=3fc1cd891f87">launched its debut NFT</a>, the first-ever sketch of its autonomous Pod, as its first foray into the crypto space. It will be the first in a series of NFTs to be released by the company, it says, and will be the catalyst for Einride to tap into the web 3.0 world. Because every freight company needs a space in the metaverse.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> issued a terse and unexpected statement this week that Cruise CEO Dan Ammann was leaving the company. There was no shortage of tips, rumors and speculation sent my way in the few hours after the announcement about why Ammann left. I have not confirmed any of them. I did speak with a few folks who had direct knowledge of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/longtime-gm-exec-dan-ammann-is-out-as-cruise-ceo/">how it played at over at Cruise HQ</a>. The most common words were &#8220;chaotic,&#8221; &#8220;hasty&#8221; and a &#8220;surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Separately, Lucas Watson, Cruise&#8217;s senior vice president of go-to-market, left the company last week. I&#8217;m told this is unrelated. However, it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that two key people focused on the bu BVsiness strategy at Cruise are now gone.</p>
<p><strong>Mobileye</strong> said it has added Paris to its autonomous vehicle testing program. The company said it will be working with French public transport provider RATP to provide an AV on-demand service for employees of the shopping center Galleries Lafayette Paris Hausmann.</p>
<p><strong>Motional</strong> is partnering with Uber to launch an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/motional-and-uber-partner-to-launch-autonomous-delivery-pilot-in-santa-monica-in-2022/">autonomous delivery pilot</a> in Santa Monica. Uber Eats customers will be able to order restaurant meal kits to be delivered to them via one of Motional&#8217;s retrofitted all-electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 robotaxis by early next year.</p>
<p><strong>Pony.ai,</strong> a Chinese autonomous driving startup with an office in the U.S., has paused its driverless pilot fleet in California six months after it was approved by local regulators to test autonomous vehicles without a human safety driver. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates AVs in the state, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/pony-ai-suspension-driverless-pilot-california/">suspended Pony&#8217;s driverless testing permit</a> following a reported collision in Fremont on October 28, the DMV told TechCrunch in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>TuSimple</strong> reached a deal to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/tusimple-dhl-deal/">integrate its autonomous vehicle technology</a> into DHL Supply Chain&#8217;s operations. As part of the deal, the contract logistics giant has reserved 100 autonomous trucks that are being co-developed by TuSimple and Navistar. The agreement with DHL pushes TuSimple&#8217;s total reservations order to 6,875 trucks, the first of which will be delivered in 2024.</p>
<p>TuSimple disclosed that is it already using its self-driving trucks to haul freight daily for DHL on a San Antonio-to-Dallas route.</p>
<p>A <strong>Waymo</strong> self-driving Jaguar I-Pace that struck a pedestrian in San Francisco <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/waymo-says-self-driving-car-that-struck-pedestrian-in-san-francisco-was-in-manual-mode/">was in manual mode</a>, the company told TechCrunch in response to an initial report posted on Reddit.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Abigail Bassett</strong> gives her first impressions of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/2022-porsche-taycan-gts-cross-turismo-delivers-power-and-performance-in-a-wagon/">2022 Porsche Taycan GTS Sport Turismo</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ample</strong> co-founder John de Souza is our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/amples-john-de-souza-on-the-merits-of-b2b-company-culture-and-investors-who-get-it/">last founder Q&amp;A</a> of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Canoo</strong> is ending its deal with Dutch automotive manufacturing company VDL Nedcar to serve as its contract manufacturer in Europe and instead is exploring a new deal with VDL Groep, another Dutch auto manufacturing company, to produce vehicles in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Lightyear</strong>, a company developing a long distance solar car, signed an agreement with Car-as-a-Service company LeasePlan to reserve 5,000 of Lightyear&#8217;s second model to offer on its platform by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Kia</strong> said its new EV6 has an estimated EPA range of 310 miles when equipped with a 77.4 kWh battery and rear-wheel drive. The EV6 goes on sale in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> executive <strong>Pamela Fletcher</strong>, an engineer who launched the Chevrolet Bolt and who more recently was vice president of the company’s global innovation team, left the company to become an executive with Delta Air Lines.</p>
<p><strong>Nio</strong>, the Chinese electric car company, debuted the ET5, a &#8220;smart&#8221; mid-sized sedan that it says has between 550 kilometers and 1,000 kilometers of range depending on the battery pack size. The interior has a panoramic digital cockpit it calls Panocinema that features AR and VR tech, notably there are custom augmented reality glasses developed through a partnership with Nreal that can project a 201-inch screen out 6 meters in front of drivers.</p>
<p><strong>Proterra,</strong> the U.S. commercial electric vehicle company that produces transit buses and electric charging systems, is opening up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/proterra-to-build-commercial-ev-battery-factory-in-south-carolina-its-third-in-us/">third battery factory</a> in Greer, South Carolina. The factory should begin production in the second half of 2022 with &#8220;multiple gigawatt hours of annual battery system production capacity,&#8221; according to the company.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> had its first earnings report as a publicly traded company. The big news: Rivian is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/rivian-to-invest-ipo-wealth-into-new-georgia-factory-battery-tech/">expanding production capacity</a> of its Normal, Illinois factory from 150,000 to 200,000 electric vehicles a year and building a second factory east of Atlanta that will have a targeted annual production capacity of 400,000 vehicles a year. This Georgia factory will include a co-located battery cell production facility. Construction will begin in summer 2022 with production beginning in 2024. Speaking of Rivian, reporter Mark Harris looked into one of Rivian&#8217;s earliest backers: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/space-florida-shrinking-rivian-stake/">Space Florida</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Toyota</strong> <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/36428993.html">laid out its EV plans</a> — a target of introducing 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030 and for total global battery electric vehicle sales to reach 3.5 million within same timeframe. The company also aims to turn Lexus into an all-electric brand by the end of the decade. And amid its media reveal managed to squeeze in the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/43559/toyota-literally-rickrolled-the-world-during-its-huge-ev-concept-reveal">time to rickroll us.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The relentless march of social media apps&#8217; algorithmic advertising hooks, influencer-leveraged social graphs and UX that begs for endless scrolling have led to viral success and mass-market engagement for the biggest players. But there remains a continuing gap in the market for products that let us create things like photos and share them with selected friends, without all that other social baggage. Today, one of them is announcing a sizable seed round after seeing strong early interest at its launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://beta.lapse.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lapse</a>, an app that lets users form groups, and then lets those groups collaborate, wherever they are, to take spontaneous pictures on collective &#8220;rolls&#8221; of 36 photos that are then &#8220;developed&#8221; &#8212; and only shown to the group &#8212; 24 hours after the roll has started, with a little bit of chit-chat in between, has raised $11 million in a seed round of funding.</p>
<p>Octopus Ventures and GV (previously called Google Ventures) led the round for the London-based startup of the same name, with Speedinvest and individual investors participating, including Soleio Cuervo, an early Facebook designer that has a track record when it comes to social engagement: he was part of the team that designed Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;like&#8221; button.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249611" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This brings the total raised by Lapse to $12.4 million &#8212; adding in a $1.4 million pre-seed that came ahead of the company&#8217;s launch in September, which was led by Speedinvest, with Claire Nooriala (VP EMEA, Snap Inc.), Matt Robinson (founder of Nested and GoCardless), and Ian Hogarth (founder of SongKick) also participating.</p>
<p>That September launch saw Lapse snap up 10,000 users for its beta test, briefly shoot to the top of Apple&#8217;s download charts, and rack up a waitlist of 150,000 &#8212; traction that partly explains why it was just a matter of months for the startup to quickly pull together a healthy seed round from a strong list of investors.</p>

<p>Lapse falls into the category of apps that are gaining attention among users and investors for precisely trying to turn some of the mechanics we&#8217;ve come to associate with social media on their head.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Instagram, TikTok and others continue to rack up millions of users, and those millions of users are really regular users, there is a definite seam of people (and parents of people&#8230;) who are wary of them and their agendas. They&#8217;ve been found to contain a lot of toxic content, and because it&#8217;s ultimately hard to control how they are used (and abused) some believe the solution is to abandon them.</p>
<p>On a less severe note, even those that have found a lot of fun, or even business, in mass-market social media apps tire of their relentless push for engagement and exposure and thus want to explore more private or impactful ways of being &#8220;social.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others in the category include IRL, which was started, the founder has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/messaging-social-network-irl-hits-unicorn-status-with-softbank-led-170m-series-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>, on the premise of people using it to create more meaningful social interactions rather than focusing on sharing media with each other or endlessly scrolling to see media posted by people they don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Created to focus on &#8220;in real life&#8221; physical events, the app kept itself from the usage graveyard by expanding to, ironically, virtual (that is, not IRL) events as the pandemic kicked off and wore on. Raising a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/messaging-social-network-irl-hits-unicorn-status-with-softbank-led-170m-series-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big round</a> earlier this year at a $1 billion+ valuation, IRL <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/social-app-irl-makes-its-first-acquisition-with-deal-for-digital-nutrition-company-aabeze-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made an acquisition earlier this month</a> of a &#8220;digital nutrition&#8221; app, which it said would help it develop more ethically-focused recommendations.</p>
<p>And closer in concept to Lapse is Dispo, which also makes a nod to the disposable camera roll and wanting to move away from the focus on experiencing things just to share photos of those experiences. It lets people only see what pictures they have taken the day after they&#8217;re shot.</p>
<p>The startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/amid-controversy-dispo-confirms-series-a-funding-high-profile-advisors-and-investors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also raised money earlier this year</a>, even as the same forces that propelled it to viral interest (it was co-founded by popular YouTuber David Dobrik) turned sour (one of Dobrik&#8217;s squad was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused of sexual assault</a>) and left many with a bad taste in their mouth (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early investors pulled out</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/early-investors-in-dispo-to-donate-any-profits-from-the-photo-sharing-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave up profits</a>, and Dobrik was also removed with any association with it). The app is not exactly eschewing buzzy social media trends, though: in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/dispo-launches-a-test-to-gauge-user-interest-in-selling-their-photos-as-nfts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September</a> it started a test to gauge user interest in selling their photos as NFTs.</p>
<p>Lapse was founded by brothers Dan and Ben Silvertown, who travelled to Vietnam together and used a point-and-shoot camera while there as a way of disconnecting and unwinding. They found the experience inspiring enough that they decided to see if they could build an app that recreated that idea of less anxious social posing, while still making something that let users take pictures and share them with groups of friends.</p>
<p>While Lapse leans on the same mechanic as Dispo by focusing on delayed views of photos, it takes a different approach in that it never intends for those pictures to be shared with anyone other than a close social circle.</p>
<p>(Now defunct Path &#8212; co-founded by early Facebook employee David Morin to provide a way to share amongst small groups as a counter balance to the wide-angle view taken by his former employer &#8212; turned out to be very prescient, if maybe too ahead of its time.)</p>
<p>Lapse is still very much in early stage mode and there is a lot of room for it to be developed further. The only lens that exists on the app currently, for example, is one that takes static photos, from the back of the camera. But the founders say that a lot of thought has gone into that one lens.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249780" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249780" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2249780" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249780" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ingrid</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We worked with 30 professional photographers to develop our own image processing agent,&#8221; Ben said in an interview. &#8220;But we are still only on step one on where we want to go with analogue film in what we think of as a 20-step process.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would best describe the filter as having some of the qualities of what a snap might have taken on an old-school point-and-shoot camera. Sounds quaint, and is an interesting way of willfully limiting what has become a very powerful camera experience on the average smartphone, and replacing it with spontaneity but also quite a lot of &#8220;bloopers.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little like the camera equivalent of when people proactively choose to walk instead of take a vehicle somewhere, or intentionally go through the many steps for a complicated meal instead of just buying it from somewhere: you may be making your life more inconvenient, but maybe for a different kind of end.</p>
<p>In my experience, some of the byproducts of using the Lapse filter were unexpected, and hard to manage but not in a terminal, but fun, way.</p>
<p>They included taking very blurry pictures as the camera doesn&#8217;t seem to let you focus, and you can&#8217;t take anything but a very inaccurate selfie (or maybe one in a mirror as I eventually did) since there is no front-facing lens, and there is no video, nor any &#8220;filters&#8221; to play with the image. The ability to snap is surprisingly easy: you take pictures often before you realize that you have, and there are no do-overs.</p>
<p>And my son Abel somehow found a way to take a three-image picture that I never figured out how to take myself.</p>
<p>Those images, when they are developed, are sent into the group chat, where you see them in a super-fast slideshow unless you make the effort to slow things down to see them a little more carefully. And, the app is not without its more conventional social media hooks: you can also save pictures from the roll and share them elsewhere.</p>
<p>Dan tells me that this was initially created to help spread the word about the app, mimicking how, say, TikTok grew by making it very easy to share videos from that app to other platforms and hook in people that way. As it&#8217;s still in its early days, he said they have not yet decided if they will keep that hook or eventually turn it off.</p>
<p>So too are specific questions of monetization still being put off, apart from wanting to stay away from advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had some high level thoughts about monetization, but that question will come later,&#8221; said Dan. &#8220;The strong hypothesis is that we won’t use an ad-based model because it incentivizes as many users as possible and optimizes time on screen &#8212; which is one of the reasons you get toxic behavior. We want the focus to be on quality versus quantity.&#8221; One idea, he hinted, was a freemium model, &#8220;building an app for users at level such that they love it so much that they’ll pay for additional features.&#8221; One feature will likely be removing the branding on shared pictures: currently these come with a Lapse-branded frame.</p>
<p>Most of all, though, Lapse seems to be embracing the idea of growing slowly and trying to do so without hype.</p>
<p>The app is not making active user numbers public, but I&#8217;ll say that the waitlist of 150,000 is not the full size of the app today, and having investors like GV backing you is one sign that the numbers are good. Those who are allowed in get several invites, and when you get one of these you skip the waitlist. The user engagement has been decent: 15% who download it stay using the app, Ben said. Right now the majority of users are &#8220;Gen Z&#8221; females, with a whopping 79% of users female and 71% under the age of 24. Some 80% of users currently are U.S.-based.</p>
<p>All these numbers, I suspect, will shift as and when the app matures. And in the spirit of having actual choices among different approaches to social apps, I hope that it does.</p>
<p>“Lapse is a next-generation private social network, launched at a time when consumers are fundamentally rethinking their relationship with traditional players,&#8221; said Matthew Chandler, investment manager at Octopus Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;With Lapse, the consumer is no longer the product. This dramatic shift in mentality enables users to communicate freely in private groups, and to provide in-the-moment images of their lives. The product design also means users no longer have the social pressures of portraying themselves a certain way and are instead encouraged to be authentic, which has a profound impact on the way we communicate. We are incredibly excited to partner with Dan and Ben as they build the modern platform for image-based memories.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japan-based messaging app <a href="https://linecorp.com/en/">Line Corporation</a>, which is wholly owned by <a href="https://www.z-holdings.co.jp/en/">Z Holdings</a>, will launch NFT service next year via its new organization LineNext to provide the marketplace for companies and individuals to trade NFTs globally, excluding Japan. Line is separately operating its NFT market beta version through <a href="https://www.bitmax.me/?lang=en">Line Bitmax wallet</a> that is fit for the Japanese market, a spokesperson of Line said.</p>
<p>Line announced last week it has established LineNext in South Korea and the U.S. to focus on expanding the global NFT ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Korea-based LineNext, which has around 100 employees, is working on the global NFT platform strategy and planning while the US-based LineNext is developing and operating its non-fungible token (NFT) platform business. The US office has 55 employees, the spokesperson noted.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249739" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since LineNext is the platform provider, “transaction brokerage fees will be the main source of revenue, with additional revenue sources planned for the future,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>LineNext is currently in discussions with about 20 global partners for potential partnerships, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>LineNext&#8217;s new global NFT platform will support companies and creators across the globe as they build markets and create communities and ecosystems for general users to trade NFTs.</p>
<p>“NFTs are a kind of technology infrastructure that will transform the digital space and innovate the user experience in all areas, such as content, gaming, social and commerce,” said chief product officer of Line app products (and Line fintech company) Youngsu Ko, who has been appointed CEO of LineNext. “Line has over a decade of proven experience as an innovator, becoming one of the most popular tech companies in Asia. Now we aim to do the same for the exciting new field of NFTs together with our global partners, with the Korea office focused on global NFT platform strategy and our office in the United States focused on the NFT business.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LineNext aims to transform the NFT experience for companies, creators and users by using Line&#8217;s extensive experience developing and growing messenger and blockchain services.</p>
<p>Since establishing <a href="https://blockchain.line.me/">Line Blockchain lab</a>, Line has issued its crypto-asset <a href="https://linecorp.com/en/pr/news/en/2020/3341">Link</a> and operates the crypto-asset exchange<a href="https://www.bitmax.me/?lang=en"> Line Bitmax</a> in Japan and <a href="https://www.bitfront.me/">Bitfront</a> globally. Line also runs a blockchain service development platform, <a href="https://blockchain.line.biz/#/">Line Blockchain developers</a> platform and a beta version of an NFT market on Line Bitmax Wallet in Japan.</p>
<p>More than 1.3 million NFTs have already been issued by various blockchain partners such as Zepeto and Dentsu, introducing intellectual properties, content, and gaming, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://go-supernova.com/">Supernova</a> is a new app that has now gone live on the Apple and Android app stores billing itself as a new “ethical alternative” to Instagram and Facebook, where most of the ad revenues go to charities. Does it have a chance?</p>
<p>It would be fair to say that after many years of either watching Facebook become a panopticon-like prison which jauntily suggests you join private groups to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/jan-6-capitol-riot-facebook/">topple the US government</a> or doom-scrolling through Instagram, where you and your teens’ mental health is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/18/instagram-investigation-teenagers-children-facebook">slowly eroded</a>, many people would be quite happy with an alternative social media platform with &#8211; please God &#8211; higher-minded principles. A few of these have come and gone over the years (RIP Path) but none have managed to wrestle the masses away from Zuckerberg’s vice-like grip.</p>
<p>Perhaps what people have forgotten is that the only reason Facebook (and by extension, Instagram) are as big as they are is that their advertising revenues prop up these free services. If advertisers had somewhere else to go that could capture the social media crowd with a compelling enough app, Facebook and Insta would start to feel some heat. At least, that’s how the theory goes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249529" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Now, a British entrepreneur, who knows the ad industry inside-out, plans to take on these giants with a solution of his own, designed to appeal to Millenials and Gen Z-ers who are generally led by a desire to support good causes far more than previous generations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249533" style="width: 478px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249533" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dominic-OMeara-founder-and-CEO-of-Supernova-1.jpg" alt="Dominic O&#039;Meara, founder and CEO of Supernova" width="468" height="429" class="size-full wp-image-2249533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dominic-OMeara-founder-and-CEO-of-Supernova-1.jpg 468w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dominic-OMeara-founder-and-CEO-of-Supernova-1.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dominic-OMeara-founder-and-CEO-of-Supernova-1.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dominic-OMeara-founder-and-CEO-of-Supernova-1.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249533" class="wp-caption-text">Dominic O&#8217;Meara, founder and CEO of Supernova</p></div></p>
<p>Founder and CEO of Supernova, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-o-meara-4aa5a6/">Dominic O’Meara</a>, a former Saatchi advertising guru and Bafta Award winner who is largely bootstrapping the startup, said sponsors like ASICS and charities like MQ have chosen to join at the launch because of the app’s “inclusive social network with user safety at it’s heart. It’s exactly this gap that Supernova fills and we’ll be scaling into that gap as the social network that gives back in the months and years ahead.”</p>
<p>He added said: “Our technology and accessibility make it possible for the world to genuinely help each other using social media and the power of advertising. And to see transparently exactly how and where their actions are helping at all times.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Supernova plans to do this by preventing toxicity on its platform (more on how in a moment) and aiming to create a place where users feel “safe, secure and encouraged to have positive, inspiring, life-affirming interaction with their friends&#8230; without having to witness and endure hate, racism, homophobia and extreme politics.”</p>
<p>The business model is simple. It will give away 60% of its advertising revenue to global charities, with the money distributed according to members’ preferences across the following subjects: Climate Change, Animal Welfare, Emergency Causes, Health &amp; Wellbeing, Help the Homeless, Human Rights, Mental Health and Ocean Cleanup. Which causes get the most money is determined by users.</p>
<p>If it can capture 1% or more of the global social media advertising market, says Supernova, it would be passing £600 million a year to charities. By contrast, the equivalent amount coming from Facebook and Instagram would pump out £51 billion. But of course, all that cash currently goes into Zuck’s coffers.</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram famously say they ban hate-speech, but of course, we know this rarely happens in practice. Supernova claims it will have “100% human moderation” to begin with, based on its <a href="https://go-supernova.com/support/communitystandards.html">Community Standards</a>, and even pledges a whole <a href="https://go-supernova.com/support/charter.html">Charter for users</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249534" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249534" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg" alt="Supernova app" width="1024" height="566" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2249534" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg 1310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249534" class="wp-caption-text">Supernova app</p></div><br />
 <br />
<strong>So what is the app like?</strong></p>
<p>Well, immediately you can see the similarities with Instagram. Users can share photographs and videos along with comments and messaging. Users can follow or be followed (although one or two bugs remain &#8211; my profile appeared to auto-follow users I hadn’t selected).</p>
<p>Users can also set an account to private, explore, follow and block unwanted users &#8211; basically most of the usual social media tools we’ve become used to.</p>
<p>What is different here is in the underlying mechanics.</p>
<p>Firstly, users can nominate in their profile which charitable field they want to support with the cash that Supernova gleans from its ad partners.</p>
<p>Next, instead of inducing narcissism in users, ‘Likes’ work like votes for a share of the ad revenue for charities. When a user’s post is Liked, their choice of charity will earn a bigger slice of the ‘Supernova Action Fund’ as a donation. </p>
<p>When a post gets a Superlike, or a ‘Supernova’, it gets 10x the regular ‘Like’ in votes for the poster’s cause. But there’s a catch, to give a Supernova the user must first earn sufficient ‘Karma Points’, which are somehow determined via the user charter. Presumably this is to incentivize engagement.</p>
<p>So far, global sports brand <a href="https://www.asics.com/gb/en-gb/">ASICS</a> is the first to sponsor Supernova and mental health charity <a href="https://www.mqmentalhealth.org/home/">MQ Mental Health</a> is the first charity selected to benefit.</p>
<p>Next up, unlike Instagram (but more like Facebook) Supernova has a ‘Groups’ facility where users can congregate in, well, groups.</p>
<p>O’Meara claims over £1 million has been invested in Supernova from a ‘friends, family’ funding round, with a larger raise planned for the first half of next year with institutions.</p>
<p>I asked about human moderation. I was told by O&#8217;Meara that it would be done by “a trained team based in the UK and they cover in shifts managed by us 24/7. They are young, smart people mostly computer science grads/ undergrads and our intention is to develop them within the company as we grow, so that our team has an affinity and empathy for the community right from the start.” However, they will be assisted by machine learning as the company scales, he said.</p>
<p>“Supernova will free from the toxic, radicalizing content that is actively promoted through AI on other platforms. As a result, Supernova will certainly not be for everyone, and that is deliberate,” he said.</p>
<p>Will it allow nipples on the platform, which are famously banned from Instagram?</p>
<p>“It all depends on the context and nature of the post and subjects within it, but it would certainly be checked for accordance with our Community Standards. If in breach, it would be removed,” he said.</p>
<p>If the context was a woman explaining breastfeeding, would it be allowed, I asked?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, probably, so long as the intent was clearly informative and addressing a genuine aspect of the subject. If the intent or content was in our view disrespectful/ harmful/ otherwise negative towards the subject and our community, then it would infringe our Community Standards and our Charter and would be removed,” he said.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s in it for advertisers?</p>
<p>O&#8217;Meara said: “Being part of a &#8216;new era&#8217; social media that is doing the right thing is great for their brands (PR) as opposed to being part of an old toxic order that potentially harms their brands. Deloitte tells us that 80% of millennials only want to buy from brands that put others&#8217; interests above their own. Large advertisers are fed up with the social media status quo: I met one yesterday with a global budget in excess of $10BN who told me exactly that.”</p>
<p>“Our product is entirely scaleable and if we reach only 1% of millennials we&#8217;ll serve 40M people with our sponsor&#8217;s ads every day. That&#8217;s quite enough as advertisers are now looking for &#8216;Quality over Quantity&#8217;. The Facebook boycott of 1K+ advertisers spending $4.2BN was an early sign of this and it hasn&#8217;t gone away, there just hasn&#8217;t been an alternative offer available to them and now there is: Supernova,” he added.</p>
<p>Whether Supernova will survive, or perhaps become another “MyEye” &#8211; the streaming social media app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/22/stream-it-like-beckham-global-star-backs-periscopemeerkat-rival-myeye/">launched by David Beckham</a> which suck without a trace &#8211; remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Questions remain over whether being a sort of &#8216;vanilla&#8217; social network where few tough or controversial subjects ever appear will be enough to attract users. And with content moderated by potentially biased humans, will Supernova end up being sued by those who dislike its decisions?</p>
<p>But at least from this first showing, Supernova appears to be off to a good start.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://gdevelop.io/">GDevelop</a> is a game engine that lets you develop a video game without any specific development experience. While the ‘no-code’ trend has been quite popular this year, GDevelop has been around for a few years already.</p>
<p>Florian Rival first started working on GDevelop as an open-source side project. The first public version <a href="https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop">on GitHub</a> was released back in 2014.</p>
<p>With GDevelop, he wanted to make game development as accessible as possible. You can launch GDevelop from a web browser or install it on your computer. You can start from a template, modify it and try it out whenever you want.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249333" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>GDevelop focuses specifically on 2D games as it’s more accessible for both players and developers. When it comes to level design, you can simply drag and drop objects on the scene.</p>
<p>As for game design, you can see all the game mechanisms from the Events tab. Everything is described with a condition and an action — if the player is jumping then animate the character with the ‘jumping’ animation.</p>
<p>There are a lot of actions that come with GDevelop by default. And if you want to do something a bit specific, there’s an extension system that lets you add some logic to your game. Developers can also create their own extension if they want to go further. An extension is a set of conditions and actions, or JavaScript code.</p>
<p>GDevelop leverages web technologies to render the game, such as WebGL, JavaScript and <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/wasm-game-editor-port/">WebAssembly</a>. When you’re ready to export your game, you can export it for the web or turn it into an Android game. On average, half of GDevelop users export their games to Android.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249338" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249338" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png" alt="" width="1024" height="681" class="size-full wp-image-2249338" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png 1257w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249338" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GDevelop</p></div></p>
<p>Over the years, GDevelop has attracted some nice metrics. There are hundreds of games on the <a href="https://gdevelop-app.com/games-showcase/">showcase page</a> on GDevelop’s website. Some games created in GDevelop have become quite popular. For instance, <a href="https://gdevelop-app.com/games/vai-juliette-make-your-own-hypercasual-game-million-downloads-big-brother-brasil-2021/">Vai Juliette</a> reached the number 1 and number 2 spots in the top free download charts on the Play Store and App Store in Brazil. It represents more than a million downloads.</p>
<p>Some developers spend a lot of time working on complex games with GDevelop and release them on Steam or Itch.io. Some brands also use the engine to create promotional games and support a new product launch.</p>
<p>“My dream is that the next Among Us will be developed using GDevelop,” Florian Rival</p>
<p>For all those reasons, Florian Rival is creating a company around GDevelop and is now working full time on the game engine. The startup has recently raised a $1.4 million funding round led by Seedcamp, with Secretfund, Kima Ventures, Ascension, Jabre Capital Partners, The Fund and Foreword.vc also participating. A few business angels also invested, such as Michael Pennington, Ross Sheil, Emmanuel Nataf, Will Neale and Ian Hogarth.</p>
<p>The team of six people is iterating on the open source game engine so that it gets better and better. When it comes to monetization, GDevelop doesn’t want to release a commercial engine. Thanks to the MIT license, game developers still own 100% of their games that they developed using GDevelop.</p>
<p>Instead, the company is thinking about services that could be useful for GDevelop users. For instance, GDevelop could offer a one-click export solution to release a game and monetize it.</p>
<p>Many mobile game developers rely on ads to generate revenue. But integrating ads in your game can be complicated. Developers could choose to integrate ads with GDevelop&#8217;s own ad feature — the startup would keep a cut on ad revenue.</p>
<p>Essentially, as long as GDevelop remains popular, there will be different ways to create revenue streams to support future development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OfBusiness, a New Delhi-headquartered startup that sells industrial goods and provides small businesses with credit, has secured its fourth financing round this year and is now valued at about $5 billion.</p>
<p>Alpha Wave Global, Tiger Global, and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led the startup&#8217;s $325 million Series G financing round. Alpha Wave Global, formerly known as Falcon Edge Capital, invested in OfBusiness through its new $10B+ fund called Alpha Wave Ventures II.</p>
<p>TechCrunch, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/falcon-edge-capital-eyes-raising-a-fund-of-over-10-billion/"> first reported about Falcon Edge Capital&#8217;s new fund</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/falcon-edge-closes-first-tranche-of-10b-fund-rebrands-as-alpha-wave-global/">rebranding</a>, reported in October that OfBusiness was in talks with Tiger Global and Alpha Wave Global to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/india-ofbusiness-in-talks-to-raise-new-funds-at-over-4-5-billion-valuation/">raise a new round at over $4.6 billion valuation</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249750" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/tiger-global-backs-india-ofbusiness-at-3-billion-valuation/">fourth financing round for OfBusiness this year</a>. The startup was valued at about $800 million in a round it closed in April this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ofbusiness.com/">OfBusiness</a> operates as a raw material aggregator and procurement finance provider. The startup works with banks to offer credit lines to small and medium enterprises that have an annual turnover of over $3 million. The six-year-old startup, co-founded by Asish Mohapatra, a former VC, says it operates in nine business-to-business raw material supply chains.</p>
<p>The platform collects data on customers&#8217; activity that it relies on to underwrite loans to businesses that are using the OfBusiness platform for sourcing raw material and tenders.</p>
<p>OfBusiness has come a long way in the past six years. Within months of its launch, the startup realized that the bigger problem that its customers were facing was working capital. After this realization, Mohapatra began hiring key leaders to build a finance offering. In a podcast last year with an investor, he said when the realization hit him he had little to no understanding of underwriting and how to build a finance business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“OfBusiness is well on its way to create a B2B ecosystem that marries large scale with profitability, health and engagement,&#8221; said Mohapatra in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our march in the last 3 years across all our 3 businesses (B2B Commerce marketplace, Financing and SAAS) has been rapid but there is still long way to go given the depth and unorganized fragmented market structure of B2B in India. We believe that we are in the nascency of the B2B revolution in the country and are privileged to drive it ahead.”</p>
<p>The startup, which has been profitable for the past four years, said its recent expansions has helped it grow its commerce business&#8217; revenue by four-fold this year to $1.7 billion with a net profit of $42.5 million, Mohapatra said.</p>
<p>Oxyzo, OfBusiness&#8217; financing platform that provides cash flow-matched financing to aid commerce clients, recently expanded to various fee income adjacencies that makes it more relevant to its borrowers, it said. Oxyzo&#8217;s AUM is expected to grow 100% this year and has doubled its revenue to $360 million with a profit of $21.6 million. It has been profitable since its inception and is works with about 45 financial institutions as debt partners.</p>
<p>Bidassist, the company’s SaaS offering for marketing, has now grown organically to 2.7 million unique users, making it among India’s largest and most engaged scale platforms for SMBs that are looking for revenue opportunities in the public sector domain.</p>
<p>OfBusiness says its three core offerings work in tandem and create &#8220;a healthy virtuous cycle at scale.&#8221; The startup plans to deploy the fresh funds to make deeper inroads into supply chains on the commerce side, while also broadening its technology stack for its SaaS solutions and financing engine.</p>
<p>Also on the roadmap: exploring the public market. OfBusiness plans to initiate its internal IPO process by mid-next year, the startup said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With supply chains in the automotive industry continuing to be disrupted due to Covid-19, demand has <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-new-model-shortages-drive-near-record-demand-for-used-cars-12377702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surged</a> in the used-car market. Today, one of the startups that&#8217;s seeing a lot of growth as a result of that is announcing a big round of funding to further tap the opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cars24.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cars24</a>, a startup out of India that has built an app and website for selling used cars and motorbikes, has raised $400 million: a Series G of $300 million in equity and a further $100 million in debt. The fundraise is coming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/19/indias-cars24-a-used-vehicle-marketplace-raises-450m-at-a-1-84b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just three months after Cars24 last closed a round</a> &#8212; $450 million, with $340 million as a Series F and a further $110 million in debt &#8212; and as a mark of how heated the market is right now, Cars24&#8217;s valuation has nearly doubled in that short time: it&#8217;s now $3.3 billion, versus $1.84 billion three months ago.</p>
<p>Alpha Wave Global (which co-led the last round under its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/falcon-edge-closes-first-tranche-of-10b-fund-rebrands-as-alpha-wave-global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous brand</a>, Falcon Edge Capital) is leading this Series G, with participation from other existing investors. Cars24 is not disclosing who those investors are, but other backers include DST Global, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Alibaba, Tencent, Moore Strategic Ventures, Exor Seeds, Raptor Group and around 20 others.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249610" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Cars24 claims to have a 90% share of India&#8217;s used-car market, and it&#8217;s gotten there by way of technology. Its tools include a search engine for people to find vehicles (its wide inventory being one of the main unique selling points versus physical used-car lots); options for financing for the vehicle; and logistics software to subsequently organize and carry out vehicle deliveries to new owners. It also has built analytics to measure demand and calibrate pricing and make online assessments of vehicles. Cars24 currently has some 13 million monthly visitors to its site and has sold over 400,000 vehicles (both cars and motorbikes) to date.</p>
<p>Cars24 is not only on a scaling, but also a funding, tear: it additionally raised $200 million last December, putting the total raised in the last year to about $840 million. (And rumors of this latest round were circulating a couple of weeks ago.) It&#8217;s not the only one: a month ago, <a href="https://www.spinny.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spinny</a>, another startup in the used-car space <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/india-used-cars-platform-spinny-valued-at-1-75-billion-in-over-280-million-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $280 million</a>.</p>
<p>While Cars24 plans to work on increasing new customers against rival services, it will also be investing in more hooks to extend its engagement with those already using Cars24. These will include more financing options and centers for servicing vehicles before and after purchase. It will also be continuing to add more countries to its international footprint, with its next launches expected in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The primary use of the funding will be to continue to strengthen our presence in India, and in the countries where we have expanded,&#8221; said Gajendra Jangid, Cars24&#8217;s CMO, who co-founded the company with Vikram Chopra (the CEO), Mehul Agrawal and Ruchit Agarwal in Gurugram in 2015. Cars24 is active in some 200 cities in India, and it claims to have grown 50% in the last quarter, a record for the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A number of outsized startups have emerged in India with massive coffers of funding to grow domestically, with little in the way of international strategy. And with nearly 1.4 billion people, the world&#8217;s second most populous country after China, you can see why. Cars24, however, has followed a different playbook, exporting its model to several countries in the last year, starting with the UAE (July 2021), and then Australia and Thailand (both in October). It plans to add to that list with its next markets in Southeast Asia, Jangid confirmed.</p>
<p>Launching in more developed markets like Australia and UAE has seen Cars24 adjusting its approach based on different market factors, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Australia and the Emirates, it&#8217;s been about getting a good global supply of cars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because it&#8217;s hard to get new cars right now, that’s impacting pricing and demand for used vehicles.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its home market of India, car ownership still lingers in the single-percentage digits &#8212; somewhere between 2% and 3%, according to estimates &#8212; so in that regard, the only way is up. Indeed, as one of the most populated markets, which is rapidly developing, and which has jumped in with both feet into digital services and mobile apps, India represents a giant amount of potential that Cars24 is hoping to tap.</p>
<p>While Cars24 will continue to focus on bringing on new users, it&#8217;s also investing in infrastructure to extend how it works with those who are shopping on its platform. It has built out seven so-called Mega Refurbishment Labs around the country to assess and fix up cars destined for its platform. Sitting as a complement to the company&#8217;s otherwise all-digital approach to sourcing and selling vehicles, Jangid said the idea will be to make these labs a part of how the company also provides after-care to those who have purchased vehicles with the company. Longer term, he said, these would open up to all car owners. The company is also starting to build labs in other parts of the world to extend the proposition, with the first opening in Dubai.</p>
<p>The other area where the company is expanding its services is in the area of finance. Jangid said. He said Cars24 was the only player in its category with a banking license and it&#8217;s been using that to create payment schemes for customers. LIke car ownership itself, this represents another area of currently-underserved opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Less than 20% of used cars get financed, while more than 80% of new cars sold are financed, so you can see the huge gap,&#8221; Jangid said. He said that currently, more than 50% of its customer base is financing vehicle purchases by way of Cars24.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all smooth sailing for the company. Working in used vehicles, there are a number of inconsistencies in product, and the more Cars24 scales the harder it will be to ensure a <a href="https://twitter.com/Prince_Tushar_/status/1471793819951661056" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent customer experience</a> around that, too. We&#8217;ve seen other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/16/car-startup-beepi-sold-for-parts-after-potential-exits-to-fair-and-then-dgdg-broke-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used-car startups crash</a> over similar issues, so it will be worth watching whether Cars24 manages to navigate these challenges as it scales. It&#8217;s one area where building out the physical servicing centers might help.</p>
<p>“We are excited to back Cars24 yet again as they continue to cement their leadership positions across India, UAE, Australia and other international markets,&#8221; said Navroz D. Udwadia, co-founder and partner of Alpha Wave, in a statement. &#8220;CARS24&#8217;s robust competitive moats across in-house reconditioning, access to the widest assortment/supply and deep data science drive a delightful customer experience, and reflects in its best-in-class NPS. We believe this investment will help CARS24 fortify its moats even further and scale 10x from here over the next few years. We remain impressed by the team&#8217;s vision and execution, and are delighted to deepen our partnership with CARS24.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nigerian mobility tech startup Metro Africa Xpress Inc. (<a href="https://www.max.ng/">MAX</a>) is planning to enter more markets across Africa as it races towards formalizing the continent’s transportation sector after securing $31 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>The startup told TechCrunch that it will use the funding to enter Ghana and Egypt by the end of the first quarter of 2022, and other additional markets in Francophone, East and Southern Africa by the close of the same year. The funds will also be used to extend vehicle financing credit to over 100,000 drivers in the next two years.</p>
<p>MAX started out in 2015 as a delivery startup using motorcycles to fulfil customer orders before venturing into ride-hailing, and later into vehicle subscription and financing services – solutions it came up with based on the data from its first services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249693" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup introduced vehicle financing in 2018, and in just over two years, CFO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gbnjoya_bolt-partners-with-max-to-enable-vehicle-activity-6869219827521740800-HD1v/">Guy-Bertrand Njoya</a> told TechCrunch, the churn rate by drivers affiliated to them has crashed to “close to zero.”</p>
<p>“We spent time understanding drivers&#8217; operations and it became apparent to us that most of them don&#8217;t own the vehicles they use,” said Njoya.</p>
<p>“It became clear that the fundamental issue that drivers face is consistent access to vehicles. And that is when we realized that if we are to be successful at solving the challenge of mobility across the continent, we have to first address the issue of vehicle access.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1846045" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1846045" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1846045 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="700" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg?resize=680,476 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1846045" class="wp-caption-text">MAX currently designs and assembles its own line of electric motorcycles. <strong><em>Photo Credits</em></strong>: MAX.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MAX’s commercial bank partners now extend vehicle purchase loans to drivers, using data provided by the mobility company in credit risk assessment.</p>
<p>As part of its catalogue of services, MAX plans to build electric vehicle infrastructure in its new markets, with the intention of introducing EVs to its emerging clientele.</p>
<p>“It is another milestone in our journey to make mobility safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable by deploying high-performance technologies and operators. The investment will enable us to transform the lives of hundreds of thousands of drivers across the continent, accelerate international expansion, and continue our pioneering initiatives in the mobility space,” said MAX co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adetayobamiduro/?originalSubdomain=ng">Adetayo Bamiduro</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chineduazodoh/">Chinedu Azodoh</a> is the startup&#8217;s other co-founder.</p>
<p>Providing solutions to challenges around mobility has been at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/max-ng-raises-7m-round-backed-by-yamaha-and-pilots-evs-in-nigeria/">centre of MAX’s operations</a> such that the next puzzle it wanted to solve is that of growing driver earnings by reducing their operating costs.</p>
<p>The founders quickly realized that introducing electric vehicles would be the natural next step, and in 2019 MAX kickstarted their electric mobility journey. The company currently provides two, three and four-wheeler EVs to drivers through various leasing and financing options.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s an additional option that we wanted to provide to the drivers because what they care most about is making a decent living through increased income. For us, electric mobility is going to be a significant driver of that objective because EVs are today more cost-effective than their gas equivalents,” said Njoya.</p>
<p>MAX currently designs and assembles its own line of electric motorcycles. Njoya said they work with partners across the ecosystem, including Yamaha, a leading motorcycle manufacturer, to deliver their EVs.</p>
<p>“We work with Yamaha in the area of access to vehicles for the drivers, and in the access to finance. As a testament of the success of our work and partnership, Yamaha today has set up a dedicated driver vehicle financing entity for Africa against the backdrop of the work that we&#8217;ve been doing with them over the past couple of years,” said Njoya.</p>
<p>The latest funding round that was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock, which is making its first investment in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/didi-chuxing-expands-to-south-africa-to-take-on-bolt-and-uber/">African mobility space</a>. The UAE-based international venture capital firm, Global Ventures, also took part in the round, as did existing investors Novastar Ventures, and Proparco, the French development finance institution, through their Digital Africa initiative.</p>
<p>Njoya said the startup is working towards becoming the go-to vehicle subscription and financial services platform for millions of transport operators across the continent. They recently partnered with Estonian ride-hailing company Bolt in a lease-to-own arrangement that is set to enable 10,000 drivers under the platform in Nigeria acquire energy-efficient vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Razorpay has more than doubled its valuation to $7.5 billion from $3 billion in April as one of India’s largest fintech giants demonstrates fast growth and aggressively broadens its product offerings.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-headquartered startup, which is a market leader in payments processing in India, said Sunday evening it has raised $375 million in its Series F financing round. The new round, which brings more capital to the startup than all its other previous financings put together, was co-led by Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital and TCV.</p>
<p>Existing investors Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, GIC and Y Combinator also participated in the new round, said Razorpay, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/18/razorpay-160-million-raise-valuation-hits-3-billion/">raised over $740 million over the past seven years</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249675" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://razorpay.com">Razorpay</a> accepts, processes for – and disburses money to – small businesses and enterprises. It also operates a neobanking platform, through which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/razorpay-credit-card-current-account-neo-bank/">offers credit cards and working capital to businesses</a>. It also offers an international payments gateway that supports over 90 currencies.</p>
<p>Some of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/razorpay-100-million-billion-valuation-unicorn/">other offerings</a> include helping businesses with collating tax and compliance disbursements, generating payment links that can be shared via email or through instant messaging services, subscription plans with automated recurring transactions on various payment modes, and automatic reconciliation of incoming transactions using virtual accounts and UPI IDs.</p>
<p>The startup &#8212; whose offerings are similar to those of Stripe, the global payments giant that has little to no presence in India &#8212; has also entered a few nations in Southeast Asia in recent years.</p>
<p>Razorpay, which processes $60 billion in transactions annually (up from $5 billion in 2019), says it has amassed over 8 million businesses including Facebook, Swiggy, Cred, National Pension System, Indian Oil among its customers. Of the 42 startups that have become unicorns in India this year, 34 of them use Razorpay.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our payments business continues to keep getting stronger. In the last one and a half years, we have also been able to prove our thesis on neobanking and lending,” said Harshil Mathur, co-founder and chief executive of Razorpay, in an interview with TechCrunch this week.</p>
<p>“We want to ensure that when you start a company, and sign up with Razorpay, we do everything for you on the financial side – from opening a bank account to building payments and disbursals and salary payouts. You don’t have to step out and use multiple tools,” he added. As these businesses grow, Razorpay grows with them, he said.</p>
<p>Mathur and Shashank Kumar (co-founder of Razorpay) — pictured above — met at IIT Roorkee college. At the time, small businesses in India faced a myriad of challenges in accepting money digitally and existing payment processing firms weren’t focused on catering the needs of them.</p>
<p>At a $7.5 billion valuation, up from just a little over $1 billion last year, Razorpay is now one of India’s most valuable fintech startups. But getting to this stage hasn’t been easy.</p>
<p>The co-founders struggled to convince bankers to work with them in the initial years of the startup. The conversations were slow and the co-founders felt helpless explaining the same challenges to investors numerous times, they recalled in an earlier interview.</p>
<p>“Over the last seven years, we’ve tirelessly worked towards making Razorpay a technology and product company which is people-first. If there is one thing the Razorpay team has committed to doing since 2014, it is to never stop reinventing,” said Kumar.</p>
<p>The startup plans to continue to focus on expanding its product offerings and also hire over 600 people to fuel its growth in India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>But Razorpay, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/india-razorpay-launches-faster-checkout-feature-tops-60-billion-tpv/">introduced a feature that saves shoppers’ information</a> — password, card details, addresses — during their first purchase and prefills those when they transact with the same business or any other that also uses Razorpay to process its payments, is not looking to offer a consumer-focused neobanking service, Mathur said.</p>
<p>“We might do some consumer-focused stuff, but we want to stay away from pure consumer offerings for two reasons. We don’t see any huge value add that we can bring that other players in that ecosystem aren’t already offering, and also we don’t see anything significant that we can gain by entering that business,” he said.</p>
<p>Razorpay is also gearing up to become IPO-ready, he said, but noted that the startup won’t be exploring the public markets for at least two and a half years.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the leading online payments player in the rapidly accelerating Indian digital payments market, Razorpay has continued to innovate and blaze new trails,” said Deepak Ravichandran, General Partner at Alkeon Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>“With a broad set of products across payments, banking, and software that provide a seamless end-to-end experience for merchants (who have been historically underserved by legacy payment providers) and geographic expansion on the horizon, we are thrilled to be partnering with Harshil, Shashank and his team who have continued to execute on their vision. We could not be more excited for the journey ahead.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><em>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/introducing-the-techcrunch-global-affairs-project/">TechCrunch Global Affairs Project</a> examines the increasingly intertwined relationship between the tech sector and global politics.</em></p>
<p>As the information domain becomes an increasingly active and consequential realm of state competition, two countries have gone all in. Both China and Russia have developed sophisticated information strategies to advance their geopolitical interests, and their playbooks are evolving. No longer primarily relying on proxy troll farms to generate large quantities of polarizing content, the Kremlin has turned to military intelligence assets to carry out more targeted information operations designed to circumvent platform-detection mechanisms. And motivated by concern that it might be blamed for a pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than five million people worldwide, Beijing has become considerably less risk-averse in its use of “<a href="https://www.vox.com/22167626/china-wolf-warrior-twitter-online-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wolf warrior</a>” diplomats to push conspiracy theories online. To sustain its vision of a free and open internet, Washington must develop a <a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/linking-values-and-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategy</a> to push back.</p>
<h2>Moscow’s information manipulation playbook is evolving</h2>
<p>Russia, a declining power by many measures, seeks to compensate for its relative weakness through asymmetric means, by disrupting the institutions, alliances and domestic politics of its neighbors and geopolitical competitors in the near term. With little to lose and much to gain from public awareness of its activities, the Kremlin is <a href="https://theasanforum.org/the-interference-operations-from-putins-kremlin-and-xis-communist-party-forging-a-joint-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not particularly sensitive to attribution or concerned about repercussions</a>. And so, in order to keep the transatlantic community distracted, divided and unable to carry out a confident, coordinated foreign policy that could be detrimental to its interests, the Kremlin uses disinformation to stoke chaos and promote disorder.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248877" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

First, it regularly co-opts domestic voices and institutions within target societies in order to cast information operations as authentic advocacy, often by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/world/africa/russia-madagascar-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiding</a> trolls within a target population, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/world/europe/ukraine-russia-election-tampering-propaganda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renting</a> the social media accounts of local citizens or recruiting real activists to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/08/02/moment-when-facebooks-removal-alleged-russian-disinformation-became-free-speech-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stoke protests</a>. It does so partly to evade increasingly sophisticated platform-detection mechanisms and partly to exacerbate the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/how-the-kremlin-has-weaponized-the-facebook-files/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politicization of content moderation debates</a> within the United States.</p>
<p>Second, the Kremlin‘s disinformers recognize that they do not need to perpetuate an operation at scale in order to create the impression that they or others have, and that the impression alone is enough to sow doubt about the legitimacy of election results and exacerbate partisan discord. Moscow can thus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/us/politics/2020-election-hacking.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leverage</a> widespread concern about the potential for manipulation, particularly in an election context, to achieve its goals by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/russian-troll-farm-set-elaborate-social-media-trap-midterms-no-n933781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming</a> that manipulation <em>has</em> happened — even in the absence of a successful operation.</p>
<h2>Beijing is taking a page from Moscow’s playbook — and writing some of its own plays</h2>
<p>China, meanwhile, is a <a href="https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.gwu.edu/dist/1/2181/files/2019/03/Brandt_TWQ_44-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising power</a> with little to gain and much to lose from public awareness of its interference activities. Unlike Russia, it prefers a stable international order, but one that is more conducive to its interests than the current U.S.-led framework. As a result, its activities in the information domain are primarily geared toward promoting China’s image as a responsible global superpower and stifling criticism that would tarnish its prestige, while denting the appeal of democracy by casting the United States and its partners as ineffective and hypocritical.</p>
<p>For Beijing, pursuing these interests has entailed a three-pronged <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/how-chinas-wolf-warrior-diplomats-use-and-abuse-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategy</a> of piggybacking on the propaganda networks of other strongmen, manufacturing the appearance of popular support and co-opting conversations on its rights record. Lacking an influencer network of its own, China <a href="https://www.axios.com/grayzone-max-blumenthal-china-xinjiang-d95789af-263c-4049-ba66-5baedd087df4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regularly</a> relies on the constellation of alternative <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1197106045400895489" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thinkers</a>, many of them Western, that are a fixture of Russian propaganda. Highlighting the difficulty of generating support for pro-China positions on a platform Beijing has banned at home, China’s wolf warrior diplomats <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-publications/reply-all-inauthenticity-and-coordinated-replying-in-pro-chinese-communist-party-twitter-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regularly engage</a> with false personas on Twitter. And in order to push back on criticisms of its rights record, it attempts to co-opt discussions on the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang using <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/how-chinas-wolf-warrior-diplomats-use-and-abuse-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hashtag</a> campaigns and slick <a href="https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1310953195808731138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videos</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Autocrats align — but only sometimes</h2>
<p>Despite important differences in their long-term goals, Moscow and Beijing share multiple immediate objectives: denting the global prestige of democracy, weakening multilateral institutions and undermining democratic alliances. As a result, the two countries deploy several of the same tactics.</p>
<p>Both use “whataboutism” to paint the United States as hypocritical, particularly on issues of race. Both use clickbait content to generate large followings on Twitter, recognizing that an audience is a strategic asset. Both regularly traffic in multiple, often conflicting, conspiracy theories to cast doubt on official accounts of political events, evade blame for their activities and create the impression that there is no such thing as objective reality. Both operate extensive propaganda apparatuses that spread their preferred narratives.</p>
<p>They also deploy many of the same narratives. Both countries have worked to diminish confidence in the <a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/russia-china-iran-covid-vaccine-disinformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safety record</a> of certain Western COVID-19 vaccines and portray the United States and its allies as ineffective. That said, Russia is primarily focused on pushing divisive content that deepens polarization and diminishes trust in institutions and elites, all while pushing back on what it characterizes as anti-Russian bias in established media. China, for its part, is primarily interested in <a href="https://www.power3point0.org/2020/04/02/beijings-viral-disinformation-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighting</a> the <a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ASD-ASIA-EU-China-Coronavirus-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefits</a> of its governance model, while painting critiques of its rights abuses as hypocritical. Kremlin state media almost never cover Russian domestic politics. Moscow’s goal is to drive audiences away from the political West, not pull them toward Russia. For China, the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Much has been <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-05-03/china-and-russias-dangerous-convergence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made</a> about the state of cooperation between Russia and China in various domains of their respective competitions with the United States. Evidence suggests there is very little formal coordination of their information activities beyond largely symbolic <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d774e7851544d7a457a6333566d54/share.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreements</a> to distribute one another’s content. That is not entirely a surprise. Beijing doesn&#8217;t need to formally cooperate with Moscow in order to amplify Kremlin-promoted narratives or to emulate other successful elements of the Kremlin’s information strategy.</p>
<h2>What’s to come</h2>
<p>Both Russian and Chinese information strategies are <a href="https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.gwu.edu/dist/1/2181/files/2019/03/Brandt_TWQ_44-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolving</a>. Russia’s disinformation activities are becoming more targeted and harder to detect, while China is taking a more assertive, less subtle approach than before. For Russia, these changes appear to be driven by growing awareness of its activities since 2016, which simultaneously prompted the implementation of new platform policies and detection mechanisms and ushered in an era of partisan debates over election legitimacy that reverberate today. For China, changes to its information strategy seem to be primarily motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a global crisis of unique salience to its geopolitical standing that will continue to create opportunities for Beijing to test new approaches.</p>
<p>Recognizing these consequential changes to the way Russia and China approach the information domain, the United States needs a playbook of its own. A robust <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/08/02/how-democracies-can-win-information-contest-without-undercutting-their-values-pub-85058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategy</a> would include harnessing truthful information to highlight the failures of repressive rule, <a href="https://www.progressivecentre.uk/avoiding_the_trap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deploying</a> American cyber capabilities to prevent or impose costs on those who would conduct destabilizing disinformation campaigns and implementing legislation that would make platform transparency, particularly with trusted researchers, the norm. Finally, because it is good for democratic societies and creates challenges for their authoritarian competitors, the United States should more forcefully defend freedom of information worldwide.</p>
<p>In the consequential contest between democratic and authoritarian societies, autocrats have seized the initiative. This collection of measures represents a starting point for bold and responsible action to ensure that the United States regains it. To succeed, the U.S. and its democratic partners must act quickly.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden issued an executive order in July &#8220;promoting competition&#8221; in the U.S. economy. The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">order</a> calls out Big Tech specifically, stating that “today a small number of dominant Internet platforms use their power to exclude market entrants, to extract monopoly profits, and to gather intimate personal information that they can exploit for their own advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November, the U.S. Senate <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-senate-bill-would-limit-big-tech-mergers-2021-11-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> a bill targeting anti-competitive acquisitions among tech companies. There has not been a meaningful monopolization case in the United States for 20 years, but this recent momentum suggests that the current administration would like to make one stick.</p>
<p>To date, there is still too much gray area in the rules and ambivalence among citizens to enforce antitrust law, but with a few changes to the approach, good intentions may lead to new policy, penalties and even prosecution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248994" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the last century, antitrust regulation lost its teeth and its broader goals have been abandoned for a nebulous standard around “consumer welfare.&#8221; The acid test for antitrust established during the 1980s reduced everything to whether alleged antitrust actions resulted in higher consumer prices.</p>
<p>This attempt to distill antitrust into a single test of economic consequence has proven to be overly simplistic. Defenders of this singular consumer-price-based approach to antitrust evaluation cite falling prices in technology as indisputable evidence of prevailing fair competition.</p>
<p>Breaking up tech monopolies will not be easy, but it can be done with a three-pronged approach: blocking anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions, constituting data as market power to rewrite policy and driving public interest in the topic so that citizens can elect concerned antitrust policymakers.</p>
<h2>Killer M&amp;As</h2>
<p>In an era of easy money, with protracted periods of very loose monetary policy and highly inflated stock prices, buying off future competitors at inflated values is now part of the business playbook.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Examples abound in the tech world, and Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp are incontrovertible examples. Excessive regulation does kill innovation, but free markets depend on regulation to remain fair and free.</p>
<p>Current law stipulates that any deal valued at or above $92 million must be reported to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice for review, with few exceptions.</p>
<p>Given one of the stated intents of the Biden order is increased scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions, consumers may see more legal action taken by the government to block deals that &#8220;substantially lessen competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proposed bill that would block certain acquisitions is a good sign of recognition by both sides of the aisle that there is abuse, but the bar for offenders remains high, especially when the monopolization of data isn&#8217;t widely considered anti-competitive. The FTC and the DOJ will need to exercise their ability to enforce antitrust law against Big Tech, which it can better do with this new legislation.</p>
<h2>Data = money = market power</h2>
<p>Offering free products has turned out to be a surreptitious strategy for some tech giants to accumulate other assets — notably, personal information on their unwitting “free” customers — that has not just fed them inordinate profit streams in the multiple billions but also made these companies monopolists of exactly those assets. Search engine marketing and social media advertising were built exactly this way. Such digital assets are now rented out to all other companies as a tax on their marketing budgets — an overt example of market power.</p>
<p>We have unprecedented concentration in most industries, and companies in industries with rising concentration are actually investing less because they can more readily exercise their market power.</p>
<p>However, when the weather turns inclement, the fair-weather friends of self-correcting markets will readily change teams and support extraordinary market interventions, like the multiple actions taken by the Federal Reserve amid the pandemic to unabashedly prop up markets.</p>
<p>Welcomed in the Biden executive order is the encouragement to the FTC to establish new rules on online surveillance and the accumulation of users’ data. Our monopolist tech giants have framed the rules of this game for far too long already, indulging gullible legislators in laughable oaths of self-regulation.</p>
<p>Until mass collection and control of data are properly categorized as market power, the levers of justice will continue to favor Big Tech, not the consumer. New policy and law, in this case, will materialize only when public outcry forces legislators&#8217; hands.</p>
<h2>Changing the public narrative</h2>
<p>Consumers and citizens are largely those most affected by lax antitrust enforcement and loose policy. Whether by forfeiting personal data, overpaying for services or not being able to choose among products, monopolies violate consumers&#8217; welfare in one way or another. But is there anything they can do?</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s executive order is the direct result of increased public pressure around antitrust in this country. The same is true of the new Senate bill. Increasingly, private businesses are filing their suits against monopolies in state courts, filled with elected officials.</p>
<p>It may sound ridiculous now, but antitrust could become a leading topic on which politicians must stump. Meaningful antitrust policy reform will come from reformers, elected by the body politic, which is why voting for candidates based on their views of antitrust enforcement will be critical to changing the status quo.</p>
<p>We need stronger antitrust and privacy regulation now. The privacy and well-being of our citizens are at stake. Antitrust, like charity, must begin at home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>As we entered 2021, I wrote about the big question on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/02/the-mad-rush-to-end-friction-in-2021/"> every startup’s mind for 2021:</a> How will a cataclysmic event such as a pandemic show up in post-pandemic innovation? Well, spoiler alert: We’re nearing the end of yet another pandemic year, and it seems like this state will be our world for longer than I’d like to predict. In other words, my question didn’t age well, and today, I’d like to pose a new one.</p>
<p>My question heading into 2022 is: How can the tech community sneak activation energy into startups, especially those built by historically overlooked founders, beyond capital? I’m not talking about hype machines or weekly luncheons on specific topics, I’m talking about more elusive services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249363" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In this cash-rich environment, I think entrepreneurs need more human resources than ever before when it comes to building their company. Don’t get me wrong, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/female-founders-are-making-a-buzzing-venture-backed-comeback/">the gender gap in fundraising</a> continues to be a blaring, embarrassing issue that venture needs to fix. But as we spotlight the need to get more checks to more founders, we also need to figure out how to keep those same founders in an increasingly competitive environment. After all, venture doesn’t fix all things — and in fact, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/the-inherent-tensions-within-venture-capital/">can even complicate the growth of a startup. </a></p>
<p>Activation energy can look different every day. This week, for example, I wrote about Z Fellows, an accelerator that pays people $10,000 to take a week-long break from their day job and flirt with finally building their startup idea.</p>
<p>The average age for a Z Fellow is 20 to 25 years old, meaning that the program has successfully convinced first-time founders to take a jump. Founder Cory Levy attributes interest to the program’s pre-requisite: You only have to take one week off from work.</p>
<p>“The best programs out there, whether that’s Y Combinator or the Thiel Fellowship, require this high commitment, big life decisions,” whether it’s dropping out of school or going full-time on an idea, Levy said. “Don’t do that; just kind of simulate what life would be like for a couple of days or a week: If you like it, great, if you don’t, no harm no foul.”</p>
<p>While Levy shows the importance of time, I think we’ll also see a growing importance for founders to lean on community and mental health support. For my full take on this topic, check out my TechCrunch+ column: More than another check, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/18/more-than-another-check-founders-need-activation-energy/">founders need activation energy. </a></p>

<p>It was an exhausting year, but it was one punctuated by a lot of learning (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/11/what-i-unlearned-about-startups-this-year/">and unlearning</a>) that will continue to shape how ideas turn into companies and realizations turn into thoughtful stories. That said, I’m excited to take a break so you won’t hear from Startups Weekly until the first full week of January.</p>
<p>Now, for one last time in 2021, let’s jump into the rest of this newsletter. We’ll talk about diversity in money, climate versus crypto and the trucking creator economy.

<h2>Company culture and trying to not be the &#8220;fool in the room&#8221;</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2246297" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246297" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246297" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dissidentspyware.jpg" alt="Seamless Eyes Spy Abstract Background Pattern" width="1024" height="602" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dissidentspyware.jpg 6799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dissidentspyware.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dissidentspyware.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dissidentspyware.jpg?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dissidentspyware.jpg?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dissidentspyware.jpg?resize=1536,904 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dissidentspyware.jpg?resize=2048,1205 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dissidentspyware.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246297" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> filo / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Mobility reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/rebeccabellan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebecca Bellan</a> recently published a nuanced interview with Ample co-founder John de Souza, who was born and raised in Ethiopia. The serial founder is building an electric vehicle battery swapping company, and as Bellan notes, the odds are against him thanks to a well-capitalized competitor. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/amples-john-de-souza-on-the-merits-of-b2b-company-culture-and-investors-who-get-it/">The entire interview is worth a read</a>, but I resonated most with his notes on culture, which is apparently a big focus for him even in the heart of a red hot sector.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: “</strong>The issue with growing companies, especially in the Valley, is that you have high turnover, and so trying to grow the company while you’re losing is really hard. If you can stem the people leaving you can grow the company very efficiently, and so we realize the way to keep people is not just to pay them to stay, but to create company culture,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/amples-john-de-souza-on-the-merits-of-b2b-company-culture-and-investors-who-get-it/">said de Souza.</a> This line stood out because it underscores what I think will be a massive conversation in 2022: internal communications at a company, and how the great resignation changed what employees want from their companies.</p>

<p>Notus! The early-stage startup wants to help other companies identify the best journalists and influencers to work with, based on a deep scan of the social web. They even used their own algorithm to target me for their funding round announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know</strong>: The startup confirmed that Alexis Ohanian’s 776 recently led a $1.25 million round, with participation of angels from Glossier and Tesla. Ohanian pointed out that “as the internet unbundled media, influence fragmented,” which, I’d argue, makes it harder than ever for a brand to reach and truly understand their audience. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/you-are-the-most-influential-person-we-know/">In our latest Equity podcast,</a> Alex, Mary Ann I spoke about Notus’ limitations despite the opportunity going forward.</p>

<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">latest</a> year-end <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>. App Annie said global spending across iOS and Google Play is up to $135 billion in 2021, and that figure will likely be higher when its annual report, including third-party app stores in China, is released next year. Consumers also downloaded 10 billion more apps this year than in 2020, reaching nearly 140 billion in new installs, it found.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that was up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247883" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place, with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>Apple&#8217;s App Privacy Report is here</h3>
<p>Apps have been accused of quietly snooping on their users for some time. They collect data and reshare it with advertisers and other third parties, often without users&#8217; truly informed consent. Now the tables are turned in a sense, as users will finally be able to snoop on their apps, thanks to Apple&#8217;s new App Privacy Report feature, now available in iOS 15.2 and iPadOS 15.2. This app transparency feature lets an iOS user see what their apps are actually doing &#8212; including which apps are accessing the data and the sensors on your phone, as well as where that data is being shared. The latter is revealed through the feature&#8217;s ability to report with which third-party websites an app is communicating. Some of those may be for analytics purposes, but others may be adtech sites.</p>

<p>To use the feature, you&#8217;ll head to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; App Privacy Report then switch it on. Over time, you&#8217;ll be able to see how apps accessed your data over the past seven days, complete with timestamps for its every action. While Apple should be applauded for making this information more transparent, there&#8217;s some concern that the report will leave users feeling less empowered, rather than more empowered. Sure, a favorite app may be contacting some odd-sounding domain, but what data exactly was shared? Would the user be okay with that data sharing if it were explained? If they&#8217;re not okay with it, what are they supposed to do to stop it, other than just uninstalling the app?</p>
<p>Apple seems to be betting on the fact that simply making this information public could push the app industry toward better behavior that&#8217;s more respectful of user privacy. But just like most users never read those long user agreements when installing software in the first place, it&#8217;s not clear to what extent this new feature will be adopted by mainstream users.</p>

<p>Google this week <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-android-12-go-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offered more details</a> about the new features and updates that will be available when the first devices running Android 12 (Go Edition) are launched in 2022. Designed for low-end smartphones, apps on Go Edition will launch up to 30% faster and with smoother animation, Google says &#8212; that means they&#8217;ll open instantly, instead of presenting users with a blank screen. The new SplashScreen API will help Android developers provide this consistently smooth experience when their users launch their apps.</p>
<p>The updated OS will also automatically save battery life and storage by hibernating apps that haven&#8217;t been used for extended periods of time. The Files Go app, meanwhile, allows users to recover files within 30 days so users can safely delete files when they need to free up space.</p>
<p>Other new features include guest profiles on the lock screen; offline sharing with nearby devices via Nearby Share; a privacy dashboard that shows app activity, permissions and access to sensors; a privacy indicator that alerts you when apps are using your mic or camera; the ability to select approximate location instead of precise location when sharing your information with apps; plus the ability to listen to the news, and translate on-screen content into your language from the screen where you find your recent apps.</p>
<p>Some of the new features were brought over from the main Android 12 OS to Go Edition, while others were designed for the needs of low-end smartphone users &#8212; a large market. Google says more than 200 million people actively use an Android (Go Edition) phone.</p>

<li><strong>Despite its troubles, Instagram has now surpassed 2 billion MAUs worldwide,</strong> according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/instagram-surpasses-2-billion-monthly-users.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report by CNBC</a> citing unnamed Meta employees as sources. The news (which smells a bit like a planned leak if we&#8217;re being honest) paints a picture of a company unaffected by the recent congressional scrutiny and whistleblowing. It&#8217;s like a quiet nod to Wall Street that while, &#8220;<em>sure</em>, <em>there are some bad things being said here, we&#8217;re still doing okay!</em>&#8221; Instagram passed the 1 billion user mark in June 2018 after eight years, but only took three years to hit 2 billion users, the report also noted. That&#8217;s growth that&#8217;s hard to ignore. It&#8217;s also notable given TikTok&#8217;s quick rise to the top of the charts, as it&#8217;s an indication that users aren&#8217;t necessarily abandoning one app for the other &#8212; Instagram is still retaining users and growing.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter adds an auto-captions feature to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/twitter-adds-auto-captions-feature-to-make-videos-more-accessible/">make videos more accessible</a></strong> on its platform. Captions have also become a popular way to watch videos without sound, and are common to TikTok-like feeds &#8212; such as the one Twitter is now testing.</li>
<li><strong>Rotten Tomatoes is the latest company to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/rotten-tomatoes-partners-with-tiktok-to-allow-users-to-link-to-ratings-reviews-and-more/">partner with TikTok on TikTok Jump</a></strong>, the third-party integration feature that allows creators to link out to other services &#8212; in this case, movie and TV trailers, reviews and other information. Previous TikTok Jump partners include Quizlet, Wikipedia, BuzzFeed and Jumprope.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft-owned career networking site LinkedIn <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/december/linkedin-s-new-app-to-help-professionals-in-china-find-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a new app in China</a> </strong>just months after sunsetting the local version of LinkedIn in the region. The <a href="https://mobile.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new app</a>, InCareer, is aimed at helping Chinese mainland professionals find jobs and companies locate great talent in China.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok said it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/tiktok-to-diversify-its-for-you-feed-let-users-pick-the-topics-they-want-to-avoid/">going to change its algorithm</a> to make sure people aren&#8217;t overconsuming harmful content</strong> &#8212; like things that could lead to eating disorders or depression. The changes come about after social companies, TikTok included, have been hauled in front of lawmakers to defend their apps&#8217; track record on user safety.</li>

<li><strong>Pinterest and Instagram have now both rolled out the option to reply to comments using videos.</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/pinterest-rolls-out-the-option-to-reply-to-comments-with-videos/">Pinterest&#8217;s feature</a> specifically allows users to reply with an &#8220;Idea Pin,&#8221; its video pin features aimed at creators.

<li><strong>Poland <a href="https://www.imore.com/poland-opens-investigation-apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> an investigation into Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature.</strong> Poland&#8217;s Office of Competition and Consumer Protection is working to determine if Apple is trying to eliminate competitors in the personalized ads market in order to promote Apple&#8217;s own Apple Search Ads business, &#8220;in violation of competition principles.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Grindr <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/grindr-final-gdpr-fine/">was fined</a> ~$7.1 million (65 million NOK) by Norway’s data protection authority</strong> for passing its user data to advertisers without consent — including private info related to users’ sexual orientation. The fine may serve as a warning to the adtech industry that there will be consequences to tracking users without consent.</li>

<h3><strong>Security &amp; Privacy</strong></h3>

<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/apple-releases-tracker-detect-android-app-to-help-users-discover-unknown-nearby-airtags/">released a new app for Android users</a> called &#8220;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tracker Detect</a>,&#8221; </strong>which allows Android device owners to scan for unknown AirTags nearby. The app will identify trackers that are separated from their owner and are compatible with Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Find My&#8221; network, which also includes the Chipolo ONE Spot tracker.</li>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/apple-removes-csam-detection-website/">pulled references to its CSAM detection tech</a> from its website after privacy fears.</strong> The tech was meant to automate the detection and reporting of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to law enforcement. But privacy experts were concerned the system could be abused by authoritative governments who used the system to implicate innocent people for other things besides CSAM. Apple had already said it would delay the system&#8217;s rollout in order to collect further input. Whether the removed from the web means the feature is being dropped entirely, however, is unclear.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch’s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them. Looking for our other guides? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2021/">Find them here!</a></em></p>
<p>2021 was largely defined by <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2021/10/19/1047032996/why-are-so-many-americans-quitting-their-jobs">the great resignation</a>, in which tens of millions of people left their jobs in pursuit of other opportunities. A sliver of those folks made their next career move into a personal one: betting on themselves by going solo. As a result, we have seen the rise of solopreneurs, either as a business owner, investor, or even a journalist choosing to start their own publication, traditional newsroom be damned!</p>
<p>Betting on yourself is an ambitious yet lonely process, so I surveyed a handful of solopreneurs to see what their gift wish lists look like this holiday season. We set no restrictions, so we weren&#8217;t sure what to expect — but what we got was a fun, thoughtful, and eclectic list of ideas; some focusing on productivity, others on comfort, and others on self-care. If there&#8217;s a running thread between them, it&#8217;s this: if you&#8217;re setting out to do things yourself, <em>take care of yourself.</em></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244419" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>As the appeal of remote work goes from a question mark to a definitive statement, everyone is re-thinking their monitor game. Newton, who publishes <a href="https://www.platformer.news">a daily guide</a> for understanding the social networks built by behemoths and challenged by startups, is eyeing a curved monitor. Why constantly switch from window to window when you can have one mega panoramic view of everything?</p>

<p>For balance &#8211; haha &#8211; we are ending her section with a yoga mat from Alo. The company claims that it&#8217;s 100% formaldehyde-free, non-toxic and PVC-free, as well as dry-wicking and slip free. <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This yoga mat is perfect (unless you have to take it places, and then it’s &#8216;perfect but quite heavy&#8217;),&#8221; she said. &#8220;It’s beautiful, most importantly, it’s thick enough for some at-home tabletop, and squishy enough for a lengthy savasana.&#8221; </span></p>

<p>A key to avoiding burnout, as my friends like to remind me, is to indulge in relaxation so you can show up for yourself and your team with fresh energy. That&#8217;s the vibe of this stillness bathtub, which sounds as zen as I imagine it feels. The bathtub combines water, steam, lighting, and aroma to promote &#8220;the luxury of pause.&#8221; Sign me up, especially after a year like 2021.</p>

<p>Other than the Apple Watch, Oura rings may be the most popular wearable among techies. Users receive three daily scores, one to measure how well they slept last night, one that tracks fitness activity, and finally one that tells you your readiness to take on the day. All three matter when it comes to balancing the demands of work, live and the growing overlap between the two, so if you&#8217;re into numbers and tracking the Oura ring could be for you. It also offers at-home sizing so don&#8217;t worry about losing it when you&#8217;re washing the dishes. Or do, because I still would find a way.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong><a href="https://ouraring.com/product/heritage-silver"> Starts at $299 from Oura Ring</a></p>

<p>&#8220;There is something about being near water that is extremely soothing and motivating for me,&#8221; Burney said. &#8220;I am originally from Florida and live in Atlanta where there are no beaches so I yearn to be near water as often as possible for self-care, and for rejuvenation.&#8221; As people go to work from home to work from anywhere, I totally resonate with this type of wishlist item; it&#8217;s harder to get Prime Delivery on it, but it seems like island time would fulfill us all in ways that a frother will not. The investor also added that she wants a spa subscription, which&#8230; might be a bit easier to gift.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Please check with your local travel agent, as this could range depending on how much you plan to indulge.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Regular girlfriend meetups</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Let&#8217;s trade some meetings for meetups that have nothing to do with our day jobs as we enter 2022. &#8220;As a solo GP, I still yearn for the company of girlfriends to just BE, no agenda,&#8221; Burney said. She makes a good point, considering that those are the easiest plans to not prioritize sometimes simply because you know your OGs will always be there for you. Well, here&#8217;s a healthy reminder that your friends may be loyal, but they also need attention.</span></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Priceless.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/realestate/empty-office-buildings-hotels.html">race to deploy 5G infrastructure</a> has unlocked a new use for the rooftops of restaurants, hotels, residential buildings, and even hospitals and churches. These rooftops are quickly becoming prime real estate targets for telecommunication leaders eager to establish 5G technology in highly populated areas.</p>
<p>In fact, next-generation wireless deployments are positioned to be one of the largest allocators of lease revenue in the United States over the next five years, creating a seismic opportunity for landlords and other business owners.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has made expanding the country’s 5G infrastructure a national priority. The $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package earmarks <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$65 billion</a> in funding to expand broadband coverage to rural and underserved communities. Despite its speed and power relative to other wireless technologies, 5G has a much shorter range, only reaching up to <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/how-far-does-5g-reach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 1,500 feet.</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248950" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			5G technology is uniquely suited to deployment on existing building rooftops because of the reduced antenna heights for the next-generation wireless network.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In addition to the major wireless communications providers, new entrants in the 5G deployment race include traditional cable companies and Big Tech firms. Together, these companies are forecasted to invest an additional <a href="https://www.accenture.com/t20170222T202102__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-43/Accenture-5G-Municipalities-Become-Smart-Cities.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$275 billion</a> to deploy their 5G macro and small-cell sites. The only effective and efficient way to deploy the sheer quantity of deployment sites required is to leverage existing buildings. In other words, the solution to the 5G race is to adopt a rooftop deployment strategy.</p>
<p>Historically, the wireless communications market has been challenging to navigate for real estate and other business owners. Wireless carriers and tower companies have in the past entered into long-term agreements that often were less than advantageous to the property owner.</p>
<p>In many communities, there’s strong opposition to building new towers and, moreover, the construction, zoning and permitting process can be time-consuming. However, 5G technology is uniquely suited to deployment on existing building rooftops because of the reduced antenna heights for the next-generation wireless network. Now, major institutional commercial real estate owners are better positioned than tower operators for carriers to achieve a faster, more efficient solution for their wireless real estate requirements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A rooftop deployment strategy presents a solution that is mutually beneficial to the 5G carrier and the property owner. Carriers achieve their objective of deploying their infrastructure as quickly as possible in heavily trafficked areas, while property owners reap the financial benefits of leasing their rooftops and monetizing their existing buildings in new ways.</p>
<p>The impact on the net operating income for real estate owners and the revenue generated over the terms of a potentially 30-year lease can be substantial, increasing their access to capital. In addition to collecting payments in return for leasing its rooftop to the carrier, landlords are also able to provide better services to tenants with high-speed broadband connectivity.</p>
<h2>What’s at stake in the 5G deployment race</h2>
<p>The deployment of 5G infrastructure is critically important for the United States to keep pace and remain competitive internationally. Certainly, 5G is about faster connectivity, increased capacity and zero latency, but it’s mostly about driving innovation that will enable a range of business services from autonomous vehicles and expansion of telehealth to efficiencies in manufacturing and agriculture and improved supply chain management.</p>
<p>With all of these benefits considered, 5G is expected to contribute over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1212243/economic-impact-of-5g-in-the-united-states-by-state/">$1.5 trillion to the U.S. GDP</a> by 2025.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has also identified 5G technology and universal broadband as an economic equalizer for rural America. According to policy statements, rural Americans are over 10 times more likely to lack access to reliable internet compared to urban residents.</p>
<p>In the recently signed infrastructure law, the president and Congress prioritized investments in rural broadband infrastructure to bridge that digital divide, expanding internet access to these underserved areas. Because of this emphasis, landlords with properties in rural areas could stand to benefit more from the expansion of 5G infrastructure.</p>
<p>The path to establishing a strong 5G network across the United States will be a long one. While it need not be a deterrent, property owners partnering with 5G providers and wireless carriers should also be informed and cognizant of the cybersecurity considerations of the technology as they house the infrastructure and offer the wireless network to their tenants.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://aon.mediaroom.com/2021-10-26-Aon-Client-Study-Risk-Management-Must-Address-Shifting-Nature-of-Business-Volatility-in-Wake-of-COVID-19-Pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aon survey</a> of more than 2,300 risk managers and other executives, cyber risk was listed as the No. 1 current and predicted future risk globally. Increased connectivity and 5G are the future, which means the cybersecurity industry must continue to innovate and expand its use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance defenses.</p>
<p>We’ve also seen the creation of organizations such as <a href="https://buildingcybersecurity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building Cyber Security</a> to help provide guidance and a framework to improve cybersecurity resiliency in the real estate sector.</p>
<p>For property owners to effectively monetize their rooftops and participate in the race to 5G, government and private industry must continue to work collaboratively on an expeditious deployment of 5G infrastructure, including timely review of 5G installation requests.</p>
<p>Additionally, more work is necessary at the state and local levels to improve the zoning and permitting process for the deployment of 5G antennas. Numerous state legislatures are already <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/mobile-5g-and-small-cell-2020-legislation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering legislation</a> to better address and develop a 5G strategy for their constituencies, which would also provide new opportunities for landlords.</p>
<p>There is more policy and technical work to be done to fuel the race to 5G, but the revenue opportunity for property owners is immediate and tangible. For restaurateurs or hoteliers rebounding from the economic slowdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, monetizing their rooftops could be the difference between shuttering their storefronts and turning a profit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As capital continues to flood the startup market, I keep thinking about the activation energy needed to not only start a company, but remain in charge of one.

<p>Today, I want to talk about activation energy and the various resources it takes for founders to begin moving toward a goal: time, community and mental health.</p>
<p>Bear with me; today’s topic is a more elusive concept than helping startups with content marketing or their sales pitches, but I’d argue it is necessary to help any humans, especially those in charge of others’ livelihoods, scale themselves alongside their companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://www.southparkcommons.com/fund">South Park Commons</a> (SPC), a community of tens of engineers in San Francisco&#8217;s South Park neighborhood, came together, it mostly flew under the radar, save for a New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/02/business/tech-scene-south-park-commons-san-francisco.html">profile</a> in 2017, a year after it was formed.</p>
<p>Founded by Facebook&#8217;s first female engineer, Ruchi Sanghvi, she explained at the time that her ambition with SPC was to create tech’s answer to the Bloomsbury Set or Benjamin Franklin’s Junto club, where people could discuss their respective and shared experiences and hopefully form new ideas along the way.</p>
<p>Fast forward and SPC &#8212; which went on to raise a $55 million venture fund in 2018 to back projects born by community members &#8212; says the experiment is working. It now has 450 members in the Bay Area and across the globe. It just closed a new $150 million fund from tech luminaries, as well as institutional investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249592" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It says it also has a highly valuable portfolio. In fact, says Sanghvi, SPC&#8217;s debut fund has already returned its capital &#8212; and then some &#8212; to investors owing to Compound Labs, an open-source platform for decentralized lending whose <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/compound">tokens</a> were distributed in part to early shareholders. Sanghvi says SPC has 10 to 12 other so-called unicorns across its portfolio, too.</p>
<p>We chatted earlier today with Sanghvi and her husband and business partner, Aditya Agarwal, who was also an early engineer at Facebook before cofounding with Sanghvi a startup they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/27/dropbox-buys-cove-to-bring-former-facebookers-ruchi-sanghvi-and-aditya-agarwal-to-the-team">sold</a> to Dropbox in 2012 in a reported talent acquisition. (Sanghvi stayed two years as Dropbox&#8217;s VP of Operations; Agarwal, who joined as Dropbox&#8217;s VP of engineering, was promoted to CTO in 2016 and left in 2018, joining Sanghvi at South Park Commons.)</p>
<p>We talked at some length about the evolution of the SPC community, which began in a physical space, has largely become a highly structured virtual society during the pandemic, but that remains very focused on bringing people together in real life.</p>
<p>Indeed, Sanghvi and Agarwal believe so strongly in the power of offline interactions that in addition to their San Francisco hub, a New York location is currently in the works and they suggest that other locations could follow, including in Seattle and even Southeast Asia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for that membership, roughly 70% of SPC members are &#8220;technical,&#8221; says Sanghvi, though she adds that the other 30% are &#8220;domain experts or have operational expertise or are even academics.&#8221; That composition is very much by design. &#8220;The funny thing is that when you talk with a great entrepreneur and ask if they want to hang out with another entrepreneur, the answer is always &#8216;no,'&#8221; says Sanghvi, laughing. &#8220;They want to hang out with the expert who beat the Stanford team on some AI algorithm, so having those operational experts mixed into the community is super valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The connections lead to more than friendship and fresh ideas, seemingly. According to Agarwal, upwards of 50% of the organization&#8217;s members find their cofounders or founding employees within the community, which underscores another way that South Park Commons sees itself as distinctive. Unlike a Y Combinator, which meets with nascent teams, or VCs who keep tabs on operational execs at big companies, SPC says it&#8217;s focused on capturing people who are plainly talented and probably much in demand but who, though they&#8217;ve left their last gig, aren&#8217;t immediately sure of their next move and mostly just want a little time to figure it out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s looking to capture people whose next move is simply to freely explore ideas, squishy though it might sound. &#8220;We&#8217;re really like a learning community that helps people in the &#8216;negative one to zero phase&#8217; get to the point of being able to start a company,&#8221; says Agarwal, &#8220;and if startups come out of that process, the fund invests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other things to know: members tend to work closely inside the community for nine months before &#8220;graduating,&#8221; meaning they&#8217;ve either raised more than a million dollars for a new startup concept, have more than four full-time employees, or they&#8217;ve taken a job. (Exploring ideas doesn&#8217;t always lead to starting companies.)</p>
<p>When a community member does reach the fundraising phase, one agreement made early on is to give SPC the right of first refusal to invest. (Each member is also invited to invest in SPC funds if they like, and many take the firm up on this offer. According to Sanghvi, SPC&#8217;s new $150 million fund counts 100 members as investors.)</p>
<p>As for the shape of those investments, it&#8217;s fairly standard. Agarwal says that SPC typically invests anywhere from $700,000 to $2 million dollars for 7% to 10% of the company. He also suggests that because SPC&#8217;s network is so valuable, the venture firms that tend to make subsequent investments typically make room for SPC to maintain its percentage ownership rather than dilute it for their own shorter-term benefit.</p>
<p>Certainly, the formula appears to be working right now. In addition to Compound Labs, some of the outfits to pass through South Park Commons&#8217; corridors (physical and virtual), include <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/vitalik-buterin-announces-ethereum-scaling-roadmap-using-the-graph-protocol-202111281110">The Graph</a>, an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data that has gained the very public support of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin; Pilot, a maker of bookkeeping software that&#8217;s now backed by Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures and valued at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/jeff-bezos-backed-start-up-pilot-hits-1point2-billion-valuation-.html">$1.2 billion</a>; and Unit21, a no-code software startup that helps businesses monitor fraudulent activities and in July raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/tiger-global-leads-34m-investment-into-unit21-a-no-code-fraud-prevention-platform/">$34 million</a> in Series B funding led by Tiger Global.</p>
<p>In addition to Sanghvi and Agarwal, who are the outfit&#8217;s two general partners, SPC counts as investors Mitra Lohrasbpour, who previously led revenue analytics and international expansion efforts at Dropbox, and Finn Meeks, who previously spent two years as chief of staff for Sanghvi.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, Agarwal says that though SPC&#8217;s new fund is triple the size of its last, he doesn&#8217;t expect the team to invest any more aggressively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our emphasis is on quality over quantity,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If the quality happens quickly, that&#8217;s great, but that&#8217;s not the high-order play.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hiiii and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 17, 2021! As <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> noted in yesterday&#8217;s newsletter, I&#8217;m handling the daily recap today while he takes a much-deserved vacation/personal day. Alex is one of the most hardworking and efficient humans I&#8217;ve ever met, so I like to think that one vacation day for him is somehow the equivalent to five vacation days for anyone else.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive right in,</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249393" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/buskill-kill-cord-self-destruct-laptop/">The USB &#8216;kill cord&#8217;</a>: You know the lever you&#8217;ve got to hold down to keep a lawn mower running? Imagine that, but it&#8217;s a magnetic USB cable for your laptop. Pull the cable, and your laptop automatically locks down or wipes itself. Zack Whittaker takes a look at the project, which was built to help journalists and activists keep their files safe from physical attacks.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/cytrox-predator-phone-hacking-meta/">The new spyware-for-hire</a>: Just as Apple moves to sue the group behind one spyware-for-hire tool, it&#8217;s becoming clear that this is less &#8220;slaying the dragon&#8221; and more &#8220;battling the Hydra.&#8221; Meta/Facebook announced this week that they are banning not one, not two, but <em>seven </em>groups from touching their social networks after detecting that the groups had targeted up to 50,000 people. Citizen Labs reports that one of these banned companies, Cytrox, tried to trick targets into unintentionally infecting their phones with its spyware &#8220;Predator,&#8221; which gives its operator full control over the mic, camera and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/well-tiktok-has-a-discord-now/">TikTok has a Discord now</a>: Ever wish you could talk about TikTok with other TikTokers while not actually being on TikTok? Good news! For some reason, TikTok launched a Discord. As Amanda Silberling puts it, &#8220;If the fast-food chain Wendy’s can have a Discord with over 60,000 members, why not a viral platform like TikTok?&#8221;

<div class="newsletter__block__body-text">
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/ex-uber-software-engineers-raise-3m-for-sperta/">THIS. IS. SPERTAAAAA</a>: After spending years helping to fight fraud at Uber, a pair of engineers are taking that hard-earned knowledge and building it into Sperta, an anti-fraud “rules engine as a service” system for fintech companies. Just a few months after launch, they’ve raised $3 million to keep the ball rolling.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/no-code-data-pipeline-platform-hevo-raises-30-million-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/">Hevo raises $30M for its no-code data platform</a>: Successful startups generate a ridiculous amount of data as they grow, but a lot of it tends to get locked up in each individual team’s tools of choice. Hevo taps into all of these tools and pulls that data into a “360-degree view” dashboard, allowing companies to answer complicated questions quickly — and, notably, without writing any code.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/fuzey-takes-in-4-5m-to-charge-up-its-management-tools-for-service-based-businesses/">Fuzey funding</a>: Fuzey aims to be a “one-stop shop” for small businesses — think plumbers, electricians, mechanics — by handling their messages/invoices/appointments and more in one view. Anything that makes running your own business less of a stress labyrinth is a win in my book. The company has just raised $4.5 million in seed funding, bringing its total raised to $5.2 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/longtime-gm-exec-dan-ammann-is-out-as-cruise-ceo/">Cruise’s CEO is out</a>: Longtime GM executive Dan Ammann is out as CEO of Cruise. Neither GM nor Cruise said much about the reasoning behind the departure; according to one of Kirsten Korosec’s sources, the announcement “seemed unplanned and chaotic.” Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt, who was Cruise’s first CEO before shifting to a president/CTO role, will take over as interim CEO.</p>

<p>Founded 16 years ago, Reddit has raised $1.3 billion, boosting the company to a $10 billion valuation. This week, the user-generated community revealed that it had filed confidentially to go public.</p>
<p>“You know what that means,” wrote Alex Wilhelm. “It’s time to ask questions.”</p>
<p>While he awaits Reddit’s S-1 with a sharpened scalpel, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/a-few-questions-about-the-impending-reddit-ipo/">Alex shared his initial questions</a> about the social hub’s operations, specifically:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re curious about content moderation costs, product expansion, the company’s revenue mix, how frequently governments come up in the filing, and what the unicorn has to say about crypto.”</p></blockquote>

TikTok will be launching a set of around 300 “TikTok Kitchen”-branded, delivery-only restaurants next year, working with creators to ship recreations of their popular dishes. I’m trying not to judge it in advance but … well, let’s just say I’ll be very surprised if these are good.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The debate around social media’s impact on mental health is hardly new, but the conversation has recaptured the world’s attention in light of<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/05/tech/facebook-whistleblower-testify/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reports</a> this fall that suggest Facebook has been well aware of the toxic mental health consequences of its platforms for teens.</p>
<p>While this data &#8212; and the knowledge that Facebook ignored these concerns &#8212; is troubling, understanding social media’s impact on mental health isn’t all that simple. In fact, there’s a strong argument to be made that social media can offer safe, affirming spaces and connections for young people on the journey to discover themselves and their identities.</p>
<p>These benefits are too often pushed aside while the dark consequences of social media rage on. The fact is that today’s popular social networking platforms, like Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and more, are designed with monetization as a top priority. At their core, these apps encourage excessive use because more user hours on the app equal more ad support.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248891" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The tech industry has an opportunity &#8212; and a responsibility &#8212; to make space for platforms that aren’t dependent on ad dollars.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>While some have responded to the latest backlash by declaring that spaces like Instagram should be<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/opinion/instagram-social-media-children.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> strictly reserved for adults</a>, I strongly believe that it’s possible to build a social media environment that is beneficial for teenagers &#8212; one that helps them discover themselves and affirm who they are; one that lets them explore their identities freely; and one that comforts them in times of darkness and helps them know they are not alone.</p>
<p>I’m not sure this future can be cultivated by<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/10/22719545/instagram-introduce-take-a-break-nudge-teens-harmful-content-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reactive features</a> alone, but there is potential for social media giants to team up with other organizations and nonprofits to make social media a safer place for all people.</p>
<h2>Creating space for ad-supported and nonprofit social media</h2>
<p>While it’s difficult to imagine a world where for-profit social media is not a monopoly, it doesn’t have to be this way. It may not be realistic to eliminate ad-supported social media apps completely, but the tech industry does have an opportunity &#8212; and responsibility &#8212; to make space for platforms that aren’t dependent on ad dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If the number of views, clicks and ads were secondary to people’s wants and needs, we could revolutionize the way social media platforms work. Together, we could build communities that users can come to on their own terms &#8212; whether to escape pressure from other apps, connect with peers or find an accepting place where they can be themselves.</p>
<p>While a handful of ad-free social media spaces already exist &#8212; such as <a href="https://ello.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ello</a> and <a href="https://www.trevorspace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrevorSpace</a>, The Trevor Project’s social networking site for LGBTQ+ young people &#8212; they are much smaller and have fewer features, and therefore may not attract the high volume of users who are accustomed to the bells and whistles that come with social media apps such as Instagram.</p>
<p>There also needs to be a space online for young people to explore their identities anonymously, which is nearly impossible when social media companies prioritize ad support over their users’ mental health and well-being. Advertisers want to know exactly who is spending time on social media so they can target users based on their age, gender, behavior and identities. This becomes especially problematic for young users who want to use social media as a vehicle for figuring out who they are but can’t do so discreetly.</p>
<p>In order to overcome this, the industry as a whole needs to make more investments in social media spaces whose purpose isn&#8217;t profit. Over the past few years, tech giants have made incredible strides in product innovation, which could be applied to other sites that give users a safe place to express themselves and find supportive communities.</p>
<p>There’s a time and place for Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and other ad-supported apps, but there’s also a clear need and want for online spaces that aren’t driven by revenue. It doesn’t have to be one or the other, and we can work together to make room for both.</p>
<p>With TrevorSpace, for example, we’ve invested in research to better understand our users’ wants and needs, without the added pressure of meeting specific revenue goals. Through this research, we’ve learned that our users look to the internet to explore their identities and value having a safe space where they can express themselves.</p>
<h2>What if we used AI for good?</h2>
<p>Beyond investing in more nonprofit social media platforms, there’s also an opportunity for tech companies to apply their leading-edge AI developments to improve the user experience on social media and alleviate some of the mental health stressors caused by spending too much time online.</p>
<p>Social media sites currently use machine learning to inform algorithms that encourage people to spend more time online, but its possibilities extend far beyond that. We know that technology has the power to support people’s mental health instead of exacerbating mental illness, so what if we used AI to give users newfound control over social media?</p>
<p>Imagine if AI could help people find what they really need in a given moment &#8212; like guiding users to content that makes them laugh when they want to laugh or cry when they want to cry, facilitating connections between like-minded users that build positive relationships, or suggesting resources that give them skills or knowledge that positively impact their life.</p>
<p>The majority of social media apps today use AI to determine our feeds, “for you” pages and timelines for us. However, if we instead used AI to let people guide their own journeys on social media, we could foster a fundamentally different emotional experience — one that supported their wants and needs instead of simply monopolizing their time and attention.</p>
<p>This sounds like a no-brainer, and some may even believe this is already happening. However, as recently bolstered by former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen’s testimony, this is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/10/tech/facebook-whistleblower-algorithms-fix/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simply not</a> how the content we see is curated in the current hands of social media leaders. That must change.</p>
<p>Thanks to unprecedented innovations and research in social media, we have the technology needed to create sites that are conducive to our well-being; it’s just a matter of investing time and resources in developing them and creating space for nonprofit apps to coexist with major ad-supported apps.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I see the potential for social media companies to partner with nonprofit companies to develop AI that gives users control over the content they see and how they interact with it, but it would take major time, investment and collaboration from both parties. It would also require social media giants to be OK with making room for much-needed alternative apps in the space.</p>
<p>Making social media safer and healthier for all people is a goal that many nonprofits, including The Trevor Project, are dedicated to realizing, and we would greatly benefit from social media companies’ help making it happen.</p>
