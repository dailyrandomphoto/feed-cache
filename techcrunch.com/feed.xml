										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A week after the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase staged a direct listing, much of the focus remains on the wealth that the listing generated for executives at the company, its board members, and its private investors. Citing data from Capital Market Laboratories, Cointelegraph on Monday noted, for example, that 12,965,079 <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-insiders-dump-nearly-5-billion-in-coin-stock-shortly-after-listing">shares worth close to $5 billion</a> at the time had been sold by insiders by the close of stock market on Friday.</p>
<p>One early investor who sold some of those shares is Garry Tan of the venture firm Initialized Capital. Tan worked previously as a partner with Y Combinator, where he ensured he helped ensure that Coinbase was accepted into the program and he remained the primary contact of founder and CEO Brian Armstrong, backing Armstrong three more times with seed checks after launching Initialized Capital with two other YC alums: Alexis Ohanian and Harjeet Taggar. Before the listing, Initialized still owned .08% of Coinbase, which currently boasts a market cap of $64 billion.</p>
<p>We talked with Tan late last week, who spoke candidly about the event and its impact on him personally. Tan also gave a fairly specific reason why he&#8217;s holding on to the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of his stake for the foreseeable future. You can hear our conversation<a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/8350564"> here</a>; you can also check out excerpts from that discussion below.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: What year was that when you wrote that first check to Coinbase [on behalf of Y Combinator]?</strong></p>
<p>GT: It was 2012. I believe it would have been in April or May and then the batch started in June and I had just raised $7 million from <a href="https://www.thetrustedinsight.com/investment-professional/AlexBangash/">Alex Bangash</a>, who&#8217;s a great fund of funds operator. He does direct [investing] now, too. But he&#8217;d been trying to invest with Y Combinator for many years., and Jessica [Livingston] and Paul [Graham] said, &#8216;There&#8217;s probably not a way for you to do that. But here, you should meet Garry and Harj and Alexis, who are raising a very small $7 million fund.&#8217; And he ended up giving us $5 million of the $7 million and Coinbase was one of our very first checks; we wrote a $50,000 check [with a] $9 million pre-money cap.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Did that create any complications with Y Combinator, as Coinbase started to take off? Did Initalized up with a bigger stake in the company than Y Combinator?</strong></p>
<p>GT: I think YC still ended up getting more. The other thing that was true back then was it was commonplace for YC partners to invest in YC companies. And it is true that we were quite successful. And we were asked to stop doing that, we did. And that&#8217;s when I helped raise YC Continuity. And once that got up and running in 2015, that&#8217;s when I decided to spin out.</p>
<p>I love YC. It was in super great shape. And it&#8217;s more fun to be a pirate than to join the Navy. So I jumped ship and worked on our third $125 million seed fund back in 2016. But [we&#8217;re] still close friends with all of our friends back at YC and I think super fondly of my time back there.</p>
<p><strong>TC: A lot of numbers have been published about who owns much and how much it&#8217;s worth. If you detangle Initialized&#8217;s stake from YC&#8217;s, your stake [would be valued around] $800 million. Were you restricted in any way from selling?</strong></p>
<p>GT: No.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Nobody was?</strong></p>
<p>GT: The company didn&#8217;t need to raise money. It&#8217;s a profitable company. That&#8217;s a super powerful thing to really know. This is not a speculative, cash-burning entity. This is a kind company with a durable moat and hyper profitability.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Would you share what percentage of your stake you sold?</strong></p>
<p>GT: I sold basically a fraction of my shares. As [with] many early employees, to be frank, this exit to me and my family is actually quite meaningful, just like it is for a lot of the other people who started off as engineers, I myself and an engineer [who] had credit card debt as recently as 2011 before I became an investor at Y Combinator and Initialized. We have to remember that Silicon Valley is where a lot of skilled builders are creating their own first wealth.</p>
<p>And all that being said, like a lot of other people who are also long with the company, I&#8217;m holding the majority and vast majority [of my shares] because I&#8217;m super long on both crypto and Coinbase.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you think about its valuation and whether it&#8217;s sustainable? So much of the company&#8217;s revenue derives from transaction fees and invariably, competition is going to drive those down to potentially zero. Robinhood already offers commission-free trades on crypto [and is also expected to go pubic soon]. </strong></p>
<p>GT:  In the short term, you think about it as an exchange. In the long term, you need to think about it as what is: a trusted on-ramp and user experience, and then [there&#8217;s] also the infrastructure.</p>
<p>We were actually the first seed investors and largest institutional holder of stock in <a href="https://bisontrails.co/">Bison Trails</a> [a firm that specializes in building blockchain infrastructure for banks and other companies] and was<a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/19/coinbase-acquires-bison-trails-crypto-builder-deal/."> bought by Coinbase</a> late last year [though the deal was announced in January for undisclosed terms]. This is a company that I think a lot of people should pay attention to even now, because all of crypto is switching from proof of work &#8212; [an energy intensive process] that is how Bitcoin and Ethereum currently get to consensus &#8212; to [a new way of mining called] proof of stake, which is far more efficient and pretty much all of the newer blockchains are shifting to [and that rewards miners with transaction fees].</p>
<p>So this was a huge strategic buy for Coinbase and sets them up to be like a cloud infra company the way AWS is. And if you spend time with Amazon&#8217;s annual report, you realize that [infrastructure] is a massively profitable space. So that is the way to think about Coinbase.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And Coinbase has customers of this cloud infrastructure service already.</strong></p>
<p>GT: It&#8217;s already the preferred infra company for a great number of the top 100 new crypto blockchains.</p>
<p>Long term, Microsoft is not one revenue stream, it&#8217;s not a one trick pony. They started with an OS. They used their advantage in operating systems to build applications, and then OS and applications together allowed them to also build server software.</p>
<p>[The best] companies stack durable advantages in multiple industries, and they do it on the back of hiring the best software engineers, the best designers, and the best product people, and that is enabled by a being extremely profitable, and then being a great place to work. And that&#8217;s the same for Coinbase as it is for Google, Facebook, for Amazon &#8212; any of the big tech giants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Restaurants rode a wave of usage of food delivery services like Deliveroo, Uber Eats and DoorDash in the last year, discovering new revenues and ways to connect with diners to offset the fact that in-person trade for many of them had disappeared overnight. But they also discovered something less appetizing: dealing with the mess of apps and hardware that they need to use to manage orders from their various services is a nightmare, worse than a deflated souffle or a botched Beef Wellington.</p>
<p>Today, a startup out of Belgium called <a href="https://www.deliverect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deliverect</a>, which has built a platform to manage all of that through one seamless app, is today announcing a big round of funding.</p>
<p>Underscoring the demand for its technology and the bumper year it&#8217;s just had, the company has raised $65 million &#8212; funding that it will be using to expand its business. That will include the services and integrations that it provides with a wider range of physical point of sale terminals and third-party service providers, and targeting more customers &#8212; restaurants, dark kitchens and consumer goods companies building direct-to-consumer strategies &#8212; in a wider range of markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being co-led by DST and Redpoint Ventures, with OMERS, Newion, Smartfin and the founders also participating. It brings the total raised by Deliverect to $90 million, and while the valuation is currently not being disclosed, it comes on the heels of big growth. In the last year, the company processed some $1 billion across 30 million orders for its customers, with business growing almost 750% in the last year.</p>
<p>Customers number 10,000 and include the likes of chains like KFC and Pret a Manger, smaller restaurants like Dishoom (an Indian restaurant in London, for readers outside of London), a dark kitchen startup called <a href="https://www.eatcasper.com/how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Casper</a>, and consumer goods giant Unilever.</p>
<p>For some further context on valuation, <a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toast</a>, a company that provides similar SaaS out of the US, but also sells an all-in-one product that also includes the point-of-sale hardware, is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/restaurant-software-provider-toast-prepares-for-ipo-11613938981?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly working on an IPO right now</a> that would value it at $20 billion.</p>
<p>Zhong Xu, the CEO who co-founded Deliverect with Jan Hollez (CTO), Jelte Vrijhoef (CIO), and Jerome Laredo (CRO), recalled in an interview that the idea for the company stretches back to a time when his dad, an Asian transplant to Belgium who had built a point of sale system that he sold to Chinese restaurants, had hoped that his son would take over the family business. He had the entrepreneurial itch, however, and also saw that the problem was bigger than just the range of businesses that his dad was targeting. (His dad is still in business, and they still talk, Xu confirmed.)</p>
<p>That first led Xu and Hollez, also friends outside of work, in 2010, to found POSiOS, which was the first iPad-based point of sale solution in Europe. That business four years later was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/22/lightspeed-now-caters-for-restaurants-after-buying-belgian-startup-posios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Lightspeed</a>, to spearhead its move into POS for restaurants just ahead of its IPO.</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t the end of the line for these two, though. &#8220;We saw that tens of thousands of customers were using our iPad system, but they were asking for something else. They wanted to remove all their tablets altogether,&#8221; Xu said.</p>
<p>What he is referring to is a pretty big issue for the typical ready-made food provider. Be it a restaurant, a chain, a dark kitchen or a food company itself, the market for taking and filling food orders is traditionally very fragmented. You will have one proprietary system that is used to manage orders in your restaurant itself, and another for orders that people call in to come pick up and takeaway, and a third for delivery orders taken via third-party platforms.</p>
<p>And that third can be more than one, depending on how many delivery networks your restaurant is using. All of these could feasibly require their own pieces of hardware, and these customers wanted that simplified down to one device alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just try to imagine being in a restaurant: there could be people there, others calling in, and between 5 and 10 tablets screaming for attention,&#8221; Hollez said in an interview. &#8220;It is just not possible to manage this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The solution that Deliverect, founded in 2018, has built essentially brings all of that into a single SaaS platform that manages all of these different channels in one place.</p>
<p>This gives the food provider a way of adequately monitoring and managing what stock is being used up and which dishes are subsequently off the menu, what orders are coming in and where and how to better manage that across their operations, and critically to update their customers on what they can actually order and how long it might take to fill that order out (a provider like Deliveroo will then also use that data to calculate how long it will take to not just make the order but to pick it up and get it to a customer). Deliverect also provides some analytics that can help its customers figure out how to manage all this better in the future.</p>
<p>While this state of affairs has been a problem for years, it definitely escalated in the last year, Xu said, with between 10% and 30% more orders coming from delivery platforms. The company claims that using its software helps its restaurant customers work significantly more efficiently, leading to an average increase of 25% in revenues and &#8212; importantly &#8212; an 80% decrease in order failures that resulted from all that chaotic fragmentation.</p>
<p>The work it&#8217;s doing with FMCG companies is also interesting: the idea here is that brands themselves have been in a bind that has only tightened in the last year, with usually only a very indirect relationship with customers: perhaps a strong bond in terms of marketing, but not when it comes to actually selling food items to customers: its sales typically involve intermediaries such as stores or restaurants.</p>
<p>But as the D2C trend has taken off in food, those big brands are leaving a lot on the table for competitors to pick up, and that&#8217;s even more of an issue when the restaurants and stores are being shut or just seeing less footfall due to Covid-19. So many of them have started to explore what they might do to bridge that gap. Xu said that by and large the focus at the moment is really about running marketing campaigns and getting physical items to people as a part of that, but it does present some very interesting ideas about how Deliverect might develop in the future.</p>
<p>For example, a new wave of ultra-fast grocery delivery startups are emerging, and those could represent a new wave of customers for the company and be a tool for helping the Unilevers of the world supply those platforms with steady streams of its products, or indeed the FMCG companies could leverage those to become direct sellers of their fizzy drinks, pretzels and chocolates (or whatever items they want to sell). Xu noted in fact that Spain&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a>, one of these startups, is already a partner.</p>
<p>All of this spells an interesting future, despite the many other companies also chasing the opportunity, one reason why these founders and this startup out of Ghent have been backed by these high-profile international investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The explosive rise of online food delivery is forcing restaurants to change how they operate,&#8221; said Elliot Geidt, Managing Director, Redpoint Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Zhong and the Deliverect team are building the tools and infrastructure to help restaurants thrive in a world where navigating online food delivery is a matter of success or failure. Zhong has a unique empathy for restaurant owners, an unmatched technical understanding of the food delivery tech stack, and a raw ambition and vision that leaves us very excited.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Restaurants, consumer goods companies and other businesses increasingly want to enable on-demand ordering by their customers,&#8221; added Tom Stafford, Managing Partner, DST Global Partners, in his own statement. &#8220;But many do not have the tools or technology to efficiently work with  on-demand delivery providers. Deliverect is providing key software and integrations to enable these businesses to integrate on-demand offerings seamlessly. We are excited to partner with the Deliverect team as they continue to roll out their technology globally and further develop their product offering.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/rpa-market-surges-investors-vendors-capitalize-pandemic-tech-shift/">become buzzy</a> in the last few months. New York-based UiPath is on course to launch an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/a-first-look-at-uipaths-ipo-filing/">initial public offering</a> after gaining an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">astounding valuation of $35 billion</a> in February. Over in China, homegrown RPA startup Laiye is making waves as well.</p>
<p>Laiye, which develops software to mimic mundane workplace tasks like keyboard strokes and mouse clicks, announced it has raised $50 million in a Series C+ round. The proceeds came about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/lightspeed-leads-laiyes-42m-round-to-bet-on-chinese-enterprise-it/">a year after</a> the Beijing-based company pulled in the first tranche of its Series C round.</p>
<p>Laiye, six years old and led by Baidu veterans, has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/laiye/company_financials">over $130 million</a> to date according to public information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leading investors in the Series C+ round were <a href="https://www.pingan.com/us-en.shtml">Ping An Global Voyager Fund</a>, an early-stage strategic investment vehicle of Chinese financial conglomerate Ping An, and <a href="http://www.guojianjituan.com/index_m.php/Index/news_details/id/705">Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Industry Equity Investment Fund</a>, a government-backed fund. Other participants included Lightspeed China Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia China and Wu Capital.</p>
<p>RPA tools are attracting companies looking for ways to automate workflows during COVID-19, which has disrupted office collaboration. But the enterprise tech was already gaining traction prior to the pandemic. As my colleague, Ron Miller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/rpa-market-surges-investors-vendors-capitalize-pandemic-tech-shift/">wrote</a> this month on the heels of UiPath&#8217;s S1 filing:</p>
<p>&#8220;The category was gaining in popularity by that point because it addressed automation in a legacy context. That meant companies with deep legacy technology — practically everyone not born in the cloud — could automate across older platforms without ripping and replacing, an expensive and risky undertaking that most CEOs would rather not take.&#8221;</p>
<p>In one case, Laiye&#8217;s RPA software <a href="https://laiye.com/case/social_security">helped the social security workers</a> in the city of Lanzhou speed up their account reconciliation process by 75%; in the past, they would have to type in pensioners&#8217; information and check manually whether the details were correct.</p>
<p>In another instance, Laiye&#8217;s chatbot helped automate the national population census in several southern Chinese cities, freeing census takers from visiting households door-to-door.</p>
<p>Laiye said its RPA enterprise business achieved positive cash flow and its chatbot business turned profitability in the fourth quarter of 2020. Its <a href="https://laiye.com/about#">free-to-use edition</a> has amassed over 400,000 developers, and the company also runs a <a href="https://store.uibot.com.cn/">bot marketplace</a> connecting freelance developers to small-time businesses with automation needs.</p>
<p>Laiye is expanding its services globally and boasts that its footprint now spams Asia, the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laiye aims to foster the world’s largest developer community for software robots and built the world’s largest bot marketplace in the next three years, and we plan to certify at least one million software robot developers by 2025,&#8221; said Wang Guanchun, chair and CEO of Laiye.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that digital workforce and intelligent automation will reach all walks of life as long as more human workers can be up-skilled with knowledge in RPA and AI”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The 19th annual Shanghai Auto Show delivered a bevy of electric and tech-centric vehicles this year. Chinese, European and U.S. automakers showed off their latest offerings in every price segment, from the budget-minded ​​Wuling Hong Guang Mini via a joint venture between SAIC Motor Corp., General Motors Co. and Liuzhou Wuling Motors Co. to the luxury Mercedes EQS  — and everything in between.</p>
<p>Several automakers touted the capabilities of their driver assistance systems, using terminology that suggested they <em>could</em> be autonomous if only regulators allowed it. Let&#8217;s be clear, these systems are not autonomous. Other automakers stopped short of those claims, but did publicize the software capabilities of their vehicles — a movement that has been underway since Tesla rose in popularity.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what caught our eye at the show. Don&#8217;t miss TechCrunch&#8217;s Rita Liao&#8217;s Chinese automotive coverage that also came out of the auto show, including how Tesla is working on vehicles<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tesla-china-backlash/"> tailored to Chinese consumers</a> as complaints increase about the quality of its electric vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Audi</h2>
<p>Audi shared the spotlight with its Chinese partner companies FAW and SAIC this year. The companies showed four world premieres, including the Audi A6 e-tron concept vehicle, an updated Audi Q5L, the Audi A7L and an SUV study, which is still under wraps, named Audi concept Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Audi Q5L SUV will continue to be manufactured in the Changchun plant in the FAW-VW joint venture. Meanwhile, the Audi A7L limousine, which will go into production in 2021, will be manufactured by the SAIC Audi joint venture. The Audi A7L is in Shanghai and reserved for the Chinese market and includes features such as adaptive air suspension, rear-wheel steering and four-wheel drive.</p>
<h3>A6 etron</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141391" style="width: 5056px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141391" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141391 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg" alt="audi a6 etron" width="5046" height="3364" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg 5046w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5046px) 100vw, 5046px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141391" class="wp-caption-text">An Audi A6 e-tron on display. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wu Kai/VCG via Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>The A6 etron concept is not the A6 with which you might be familiar. This all-electric vehicle is built off of Audi&#8217;s &#8220;Premium Platform Electric,&#8221; or PPE platform, which will be the underlying architecture for its C- and B-segment production cars beginning in late 2022.</p>
<p>The Audi A6 e-tron concept shares the same dimensions as the A6 and that&#8217;s about it. The A6 etron is designed as a sportback with a wide coupe roof arch and short overhangs. The large 22-inch wheels complete the look. The A6 e-tron concept is outfitted with two electric motors that can deliver a total output of 350 kW and a torque of 590 pound-feet. The vehicle has 800-volt charging architecture — the same as its Porsche Taycan cousin — with an estimated range of 434 miles based on the WLTP measurement.</p>
<h2>BYD</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warren Buffet-backed BYD has competed for high sales with Tesla, with units sold increasing steadily on the &#8220;Han&#8221; series since its launch last year. </span></p>
<h3>BYD Han</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141376" style="width: 2136px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141376" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141376 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg" alt="" width="2126" height="1418" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg 2126w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2126px) 100vw, 2126px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141376" class="wp-caption-text">A BYD Han car is on display. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> VCG/VCG via Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>BYD’s Han flagship series<span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes three electric vehicles and one hybrid vehicle. Named after China’s Han dynasty, the luxury electric sedan series launched sales last year. BYD’s long-range EV can go for about 375 miles, and the company claims its vehicle’s “blade” battery pack is safer than traditional battery packs.  </span></p>
<h2><strong>Geely Holdings Inc.</strong></h2>
<p>The Chinese automotive conglomerate took up a lot of the Shanghai Auto Show floor this year with several of its brands &#8212; including a brand new one &#8212; on display. Polestar, Volvo Cars, Lynk &amp; Co, Geometry and the new Zeekr brand all brought EVs to the show.</p>
<h3><strong>Geometry Pro</strong></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141319" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141319" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141319 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg" alt="Geely Geometry ev" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141319" class="wp-caption-text">The 几何A-Pro revealed at the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Geometry/Geely Holdings</p></div></p>
<p>Geely&#8217;s mass market brand launched the new extended-range version of its Geometry A vehicle. The so-called Geometry A Pro comes with a 150kW battery and can travel 600 km (372 miles) on a single charge. The brand launched in 2019 and unveiled three models to date. The A and C models are on sale in the Chinese market. The brand has plans to export the Geometry C later this year to select global partners.</p>
<h3><strong>Lynk &amp; Co. 05</strong></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141337" style="width: 5392px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141337" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141337 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg" alt="lynk-and-co-shanghai electric" width="5382" height="3588" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg 5382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5382px) 100vw, 5382px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141337" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Geely holdings/Lynk &amp; Co.</p></div></p>
<p>The company unveiled their newest plug-in hybrid variant of the Lynk &amp; Co. 05. The company also showcased the Scalable Product Architecture for the first time that will be used by a future Lynk &amp; Co. products to be unveiled later this year with an electrified powertrain.</p>
<h3><strong>Polestar 1 Special Edition</strong></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141320" style="width: 5482px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141320" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141320 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg" alt="polestar lineup shanghai auto show" width="5472" height="3648" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg 5472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5472px) 100vw, 5472px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141320" class="wp-caption-text">The lineup of Polestar vehicles at the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Polestar/Geely Holdings</p></div></p>
<p>The EV performance brand of Volvo, which is owned by Geely, displayed the Polestar 1 hybrid electric and the all-electric Polestar 2. It was the 2021 Special Edition in matte gold that got our attention. Granted this is not an all-electric vehicle, just a hybrid, but this special version is worth noting.</p>
<p>This special edition has a lightweight body made from carbon fiber reinforced polymer, twin rear electric motors with genuine torque vectoring and high-performance components like Akebono brakes and adjustable Öhlins dampers. The vehicle&#8217;s powertrain produced 619 hp and 738 lb.-ft. of torque, and a purely electric driving range of 60 miles based on the WLTP standard. The vehicle also features a bespoke matte gold exterior paint job with matching calipers and black wheels</p>
<h3><strong>Volvo XC40 Recharge</strong></h3>

<p>The Swedish brand, which plans to only sell pure battery-electric models beginning in 2030, brought its first all-electric vehicle to the show: the XC40 Recharge. The company&#8217;s next EV will be the C40, the company announced.</p>

<p>And finally, Zeekr brought its flagship (and first) EV called the Zeekr 001. What is a Zeekr? It&#8217;s the combination of Z as in Generation Z and &#8220;geek,&#8221; and its aim is to put software at the forefront.</p>
<p>Zeekr said its cars will also be sold online and through experience centers across China, with plans also to eventually expand to Europe and North America. The Zeekr 001 comes with a dual motor, which sends power to all four wheels &#8212; delivering 566 lb-ft. of torque and allowing it to accelerate from 0 to 60mph in less than 4 seconds. The car has a claimed estimated range of more than 700 km (434 miles) on a single charge.</p>
<p>The Zeekr brand said it plans to bring five cars to market in the next five years, all of which will be based on Geely Holdings&#8217; pure electric SEA architecture.</p>
<h2><strong>Mercedes </strong></h2>
<p>The German automaker showed off several vehicles at the Shanghai Auto Show, notably the EQB and EQS. Both of these all-electric vehicles are part of the company&#8217;s growing EQ brand.</p>
<h3><strong>EQB</strong></h3>

<p>The German automaker revealed the compact mass-market all-electric SUV at the show. The vehicle, which looks a lot like the GLB, especially the interior, will launch in China this year. A global variant will be produced in Hungary for Europe followed, by the U.S. market launch in 2022.</p>
<p>While there are some obvious links to the internal combustion engine GLB, the EQB does have some differences in the exterior design, including the continuous light strip at front and rear that is consistent with other models in the electric EQ brand. The EQB also has light-alloy wheels in a bi- or tri-color design that come in up to 20 inches in size. Some even have rosé gold-colored or blue decorative trim. Mercedes has not yet revealed details on the powertrain, range or price.</p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz held its own world premiere of its EQ brand flagship ahead of the Shanghai Auto Show. The EQS is the first all-electric luxury sedan under the automaker&#8217;s new EQ brand. The first models being introduced to the U.S. market will be the EQS 450+ with 329 hp and the EQS 580 4MATIC with 516 hp. This will be an important vehicle for the Chinese market as well.</p>
<p>This all-electric counterpart to the S-Class is loaded with tech. For instance, there are 350 sensors in the vehicle that are used to record distances, speeds and acceleration, lighting conditions, precipitation and temperatures, the occupancy of seats as well as the driver’s blink of an eye or the passengers’ speech. TechCrunch also had a chance to take the EQS for a spin.

<h2>NIO</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nio revealed the interior of its flagship sedan at the auto show, giving us more details on the ET7 which was initially revealed in January. It also announced it will deploy a total of 100 of its branded power swap stations as well as other infrastructure, including 500 charging stations and more than 10,000 destination chargers in eight provinces in China. </span></p>

<h3>Nio ET7</h3>
<p>The ET7 is Nio&#8217;s electric flagship sedan. The company officially debuted the interior of the vehicle, which it described as a second living space. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The interior comes in three earth-tone color schemes: Storm Gray, Sand Brown and Edelweiss White. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company dropped some hints about possible exterior colors, as well, such as Sunrise Beige, Luminous Orange and Arctic Green, in addition to the established Cloud White, Star Gray, Deep Black and Southern Star.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ET7’s 150kWh battery gives the car a whopping range of 621 miles under China’s NEDC testing protocol. The NEDC testing is notorious for providing optimistic estimates and will likely be much less than that under Europe’s WLTP testing. </span></p>
<p>Nio also boasted about its so-called NIO Autonomous Driving technology, which it claims will  &#8220;gradually deliver the relaxing and safe point-to-point autonomous driving experience in scenarios like an expressway, urban, parking, and battery swap.&#8221; That phrasing suggests that this is aspirational and is still squarely under the driver assistance system category. Plus, China regulations require drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and be able to take control at any time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nio is expected to begin production of the ET7 in the coming months, with a launch scheduled for Q1 2022. </span></p>
<h2>SAIC-GM</h2>
<p>SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co., a joint venture between SAIC Motor Corp., General Motors and Liuzhou Wuling Motors Co. showed off their latest vehicle: the budget-friendly Hong Guang Mini EV that costs less than $5,000.</p>

<p>The Wuling Hong Guang Mini EV, which is also the main photo in this article, <span style="font-weight: 400;">is one of the most popular EVs in China this year, with more than 57,000 units sold in February alone, and at $4,230, it’s not hard to see why. The featherweight EV is produced with max efficiency and few parts. A new car is made every minute at the Lizhou, Guangxi factory, and it only takes about four hours to make one from start to finish. The most basic models are truly made for that A to B utility. Both the interior and what’s under the hood make for a very simple, yet functional, vehicle. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The smooth ride of this adorable mini won’t go faster than 62 miles per hour, and a cap of around 75 to 110 miles of range per charge makes it the perfect car for short trips around urban environments. Upgrading to the $5,600 model includes air conditioning and power windows, which really points to the near Spartan nature of the standard model, which comes with an HVAC ventilation system and a simple radio.</span></p>
<h2>Toyota</h2>
<p>The Japanese automakers said it will introduce 15 all-electric vehicles, including seven Toyota bZ branded models, globally by 2025. The new bZ brand debuted at the Shanghai Auto Show.</p>

<p>The Toyota bZ4X is technically just a concept, but its importance shouldn&#8217;t be disregarded. The concept, which was revealed at the Shanghai Auto Show, kicks off a new all-electric lineup for Toyota.</p>
<p>Toyota&#8217;s new bZ brand &#8212; which stands for beyond zero &#8212; will have a dedicated underlying platform that can be used with multiple variations in terms of size and design. The company said that since it is difficult to prepare such a wide range of choices by itself, it is jointly developing the series with partners who boast expertise in various fields. Toyota tapped Subaru to develop the bZ4X. BYD, Daihaitsu and Suzuki are other partners in the bZ line.</p>
<p>Toyota plans to produce the Toyota bZ4X in Japan and China said it hopes to begin worldwide sales of the model by the middle of 2022.</p>

<p>The Xpeng P5 is the Chinese automaker’s third vehicle, but it’s among the first to be produced with a built-in lidar sensor. The company says the two sensors, which are built into both sides of the sedan’s front, can detect and identify pedestrians, other cars, cyclists, scooters and more, no matter the weather or darkness.</p>
<p>Xpeng&#8217;s chairman and CEO He Xiaopeng called the P5 is its most advanced and technically ambitious model yet.</p>
<p>The lidar sensors combined with software deliver an advanced driver assistance system that the automaker says pushes it toward full automation. While the sensor and software system is robust, the vehicle is not self driving. As TechCrunch&#8217;s Liao reported, Xpeng&#8217;s Navigation Guided Pilot system is benchmarked against Tesla’s Navigate On Autopilot and can automatically change lanes, enter or exit ramps, overtake other vehicles and maneuver another car’s sudden cut-in, a common sight in China’s complex road conditions. However, drivers&#8217; hands must remain on the wheel. The carmaker’s ambition is to remove the driver, that is, reach Level 4 autonomy two to four years from now, but real-life implementation will hinge on regulations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today&#8217;s Apple event, chock-full of the company&#8217;s products that will help decide whether the company meets, exceeds or undershoots Wall Street expectations for its future growth and performance, had little to no impact on its share price.</p>
<p>By now this is the theme: Apple announces a slew of new products, services, software or peripherals, and its share price does nothing. It&#8217;s almost humorous; certainly Apple&#8217;s shares can move in the wake of an earnings release, but a new product digest? Not so much.</p>
<p>Or at least not as long as TechCrunch has been paying attention (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/heres-how-apples-stock-fared-during-the-wwdc-keynote/">here&#8217;s more evidence</a>). It&#8217;s almost like Apple&#8217;s customers &#8212; and the press &#8212; care rabidly about what the company builds. And are very vocal about it. While investors are essentially at lunch the entire time.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FWJN2i2ppl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-spring-loaded-event-today/">Here&#8217;s everything Apple announced at its &#8216;Spring Loaded&#8217; event today</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Here&#8217;s everything Apple announced at its &#8216;Spring Loaded&#8217; event today&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-spring-loaded-event-today/embed/#?secret=FWJN2i2ppl" data-secret="FWJN2i2ppl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, for example, Apple shares closed the day off 1.28% and have since fallen a further 0.36%. Apple stock closed the day worth $133.11 per share and was worth $133.40 at the time its event kicked off. So, the event hardly prevented the company from losing more ground.</p>
<p>The broader Nasdaq index lost 0.92%, per <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Finance</a>.</p>
<p>Put another way, news that Apple is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-announces-apple-card-family-for-spouses-to-build-credit-together-and-over-13s-to-use-it-too/">revamping its credit card</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">rebuilding its podcast app</a> and will support paid subscriptions, that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-adds-a-new-purple-color-option-to-its-iphone-12-and-iphone-12-mini-lineup/">purple iPhones are coming</a>, that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-officially-unveils-its-lost-item-finder-airtag/">AirTags are real</a>, that there is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/the-new-apple-tv-4k-comes-with-a-new-siri-remote/"><em>finally </em>a new Apple TV</a>, that there are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-introduces-a-colorful-new-imac/">new iMacs coming that look hot as heck</a>, that there are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/the-new-ipad-pro-features-apples-m1-chip/">new iPads (including a new iPad Pro) on the way</a> and more, was essentially a shrug from investors.</p>
<p>To avoid being cliché I won&#8217;t paste the <em>are you not entertained </em>gif here, but it&#8217;s warranted. In short, this is what Apple stock did today, as investors were too focused on numbers to look upstream from revenue at the products that will drive the numbers that they later parse and come to a firm conclusion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smartphones will be included in the scope of a planned &#8220;security by design&#8221; U.K. law aimed at beefing up the security of consumer devices, the government said today.</p>
<p>It made the announcement in its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-consumer-smart-product-cyber-security-government-response">response</a> to a consultation on legislative plans aimed at tackling some of the most lax security practices long-associated with the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p>The government introduced a security <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-practice-for-consumer-iot-security">code of practice</a> for IoT device manufacturers back in 2018 &#8212; but the forthcoming legislation is intended to build on that with a set of legally binding requirements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A draft law was aired by ministers<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/uk-connected-devices-security/"> in 2019</a> &#8212; with the government focused on IoT devices, such as webcams and baby monitors, which have often been associated with the most egregious device security practices.</p>
<p>Its plan now is for virtually all smart devices to be covered by legally binding security requirements, with the government pointing to <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/2020/12/mobile-phone-brands-putting-customers-at-risk-with-inadequate-update-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.which.co.uk/news/2020/12/mobile-phone-brands-putting-customers-at-risk-with-inadequate-update-support/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619005307421000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRYFl9wyYzqVCRupVejmxcaVtruw">research</a> from consumer group &#8220;Which?&#8221; that found that a third of people kept their last phone for four years, while some brands only offer security updates for just over two years.</p>
<p>The forthcoming legislation will require smartphone and device makers like Apple and Samsung to inform customers of the duration of time for which a device will receive software updates at the point of sale.</p>
<p>It will also ban manufacturers from using universal default passwords (such as &#8220;password&#8221; or &#8220;admin&#8221;), which are often preset in a device’s factory settings and easily guessable &#8212; making them meaningless in security terms.</p>
<p>California already passed legislation banning such passwords in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/05/california-passes-law-that-bans-default-passwords-in-connected-devices/">2018</a> with the law coming into force last year.</p>
<p>Under the incoming U.K. law, manufacturers will additionally be required to provide a public point of contact to make it simpler for anyone to report a vulnerability.</p>
<p>The government said it will introduce legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, digital infrastructure minister Matt Warman added: “Our phones and smart devices can be a gold mine for hackers looking to steal data, yet a great number still run older software with holes in their security systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are changing the law to ensure shoppers know how long products are supported with vital security updates before they buy and are making devices harder to break into by banning easily guessable default passwords.</p>
<p>“The reforms, backed by tech associations around the world, will torpedo the efforts of online criminals and boost our mission to build back safer from the pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>A DCMS spokesman confirmed that laptops, PCs and tablets with no cellular connection will not be covered by the law, nor will secondhand products. Although he added that the intention is for the scope to be adaptive, to ensure the law can keep pace with new threats that may emerge around devices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix added 4 million net new subscribers in the first quarter of 2021, bringing its total subscriber base to 207.6 million, according to <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">its latest earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>Any year-over-year comparison was inevitably going to make this latest quarter seem disappointing, since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/neflix-q1-earnings/">Netflix grew by an unprecedented rate</a> (15.77 million net new subscribers) during the same period last year, when the pandemic first trapped global audiences at home. But these new numbers also fall short of the 210 million subscribers that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/netflix-q4-earnings-4/">Netflix had been predicting</a>.</p>
<p>While the streaming market has certainly become more competitive (with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision">Disney+ recently passing 100 million subscribers</a>), Netflix suggested that its lackluster growth had less to do with &#8220;competitive intensity&#8221; and more with the simple fact that it released fewer original shows and movies, thanks to pandemic-related production delays.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big COVID-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to COVID-19 production delays,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;We continue to anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hits and an exciting film lineup. In the short term, there is some uncertainty from COVID-19; in the long term, the rise of streaming to replace linear TV around the world is the clear trend in entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Netflix noted that retention was &#8220;in line with our expectations,&#8221; and that the main issue was new user acquisition. It also said that &#8220;in early Q1, with the benefit of &#8216;Bridgerton,&#8217; &#8216;Lupin&#8217; and &#8216;Cobra Kai,&#8217; we were following a growth trajectory similar to recent years,&#8221; before growth dipped in March.</p>
<p>Pandemic-related delays will also affect the release schedule in Q2, so Netflix is only projecting 1 million net new subscribers. The release of high-profile titles should pick up again in the second half of the year, the company said, with production having resumed &#8220;in every major market, with the exception of Brazil and India.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the company&#8217;s finances, revenue grew 24% year over year to $7.2 billion (in line with the forecast), with diluted earnings per share of $3.75. (Analysts had been <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/analysis?p=NFLX">predicting EPS of $2.97</a>.) Netflix shares were down more than 11% in after-hours trading, as of 4:33 p.m. EDT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.blablacar.com">BlaBlaCar</a> has raised a new $115 million funding round (€97 million). While the company is better known for its long distance carpooling marketplace, BlaBlaCar has also added a bus marketplace with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/12/blablacar-to-acquire-ouibus-and-offer-bus-service/">acquisition of Ouibus</a> and an online bus ticketing platform with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/blablacar-to-acquire-online-bus-ticketing-platform-busfor/">acquisition of Busfor</a>.</p>
<p>Existing investor VNV Global is leading the round. Two new investors are also participating — Otiva J/F AB and FMZ Ventures. Otiva J/F AB is a fund created by Avito founders Jonas Nordlander and Filip Engelbert. If you’re not familiar with Avito, they specialize in classified ads for the Russian market. Classified giant and global tech investor <a href="https://www.naspers.com">Naspers</a> acquired Avito. As for FMZ Ventures, it’s a growth fund created by Michael Zeisser, who previously led investments for Alibaba and was a board member at Lyft and Tripadvisor.</p>
<p>It’s a convertible note, which means that the valuation will depend on the next financial event, such as another fundraising round or an initial public offering. But BlaBlaCar co-founder and CEO Nicolas Brusson consider it as a “pre-IPO convertible” round as BlaBlaCar still has a ton of cash on its bank account.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We already had a lot of cash before this round and we still have more than €200 million in cash following this funding round,” Brusson told me.</p>
<p>Even if BlaBlaCar doesn’t go public right away (or doesn’t raise), there’s a clause with a time frame. After a while, those $115 million will convert into BlaBlaCar shares at a $2 billion valuation in case there’s no financial event.</p>
<p>BlaBlaCar’s strategy and goal with today’s funding round could be summed up with three pillars — carpooling, buses and aggregation.</p>
<p>Let’s start with carpooling, BlaBlaCar’s core business. The company started 15 years ago with a simple goal — matching empty car seats with passengers going in the same direction. While last year’s lockdown has impacted carpooling, it shouldn’t be compared with trains or flights.</p>
<p>“With our carpooling network, there’s no fixed costs,” Brusson said. So BlaBlaCar isn’t paying to put empty cars on the road as everything is community-powered. But, of course, as BlaBlaCar takes a cut from each transaction, revenue took a hit during last year’s lockdown.</p>
<p>Activity bounced back last summer and it’s been up and down ever since depending on current restrictions. “Car is and will be the universal connector that doesn’t rely on train stations or bus stops,” Brusson said.</p>
<p>The carpooling marketplace will always remain a strong revenue generator. In 2020 alone, BlaBlaCar had 50 million passengers across 22 markets overall. In other words, never bet against carpooling.</p>
<p>For the past few years, BlaBlaCar’s second pillar has been buses. In particular, buses represent a huge opportunity in emerging markets and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>There are already a ton of buses on the road, you simply can’t buy tickets online. BlaBlaCar’s total addressable market in this category is huge and the company is mostly focused on moving offline supply to its online marketplace.</p>
<p>That’s why the company is also acquiring Octobus, a Ukrainian company working on an inventory management system for bus supply. “It consolidates our tech stack in the region,” Brusson said.</p>
<p>Finally, BlaBlaCar’s third pillar is all about creating loyal users that keep coming back to the platform. The company wants to build a multimodal app where you can find all shared travel — carpooling, buses and soon trains.</p>
<p>The startup will add train operators on its marketplace by the end of 2021 or early 2022. I asked Brusson whether he wanted to build an <a href="https://www.omio.com">Omio</a> competitor. Formerly known as GoEuro, Omio lets you book train tickets, bus tickets and flights on a single platform.</p>
<p>BlaBlaCar wants to follow a different strategy. It wants to focus first on a handful of countries so that it can sell everything a local would expect.</p>
<p>Eventually, you could imagine opening the BlaBlaCar app to find the best way to go from A to B. It could involve a train ticket followed by a carpooling ride to reach a tiny town. Or it could mix carpooling with bus rides. Thanks to BlaBlaCar’s reach, the French startup is uniquely positioned to connect two small cities through shared transportation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A month after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/microsoft-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-discord-for-more-than-10b">reports</a> that Microsoft sought to buy the hot voice chat app Discord surfaced, those talks are off, a source familiar with the deal confirmed to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Discord is considering plans to stay independent, possibly charting a path to its own IPO in the not-too-distant future. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/discord-ends-deal-talks-with-microsoft-11618938806?st=566xw655qf2bo0d&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">The Wall Street Journal</a> first reported news that the deal was off.</p>
<p>The two companies were deep in acquisition talks that valued Discord at around $10 billion before Discord walked away. According to the WSJ, three companies were exploring the possible acquisition, though only Microsoft was named.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Discord&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/discord-now-has-a-3-5b-valuation-and-100m-for-a-sales-pitch-lighter-on-the-gaming/">valuation doubled in less than six months last year</a> and its stock is only looking hotter in 2021. A well-loved voice chat app originally built for gamers, Discord was in the right place well ahead of the current voice chat trend that Clubhouse ignited. As companies from Facebook to Twitter scramble to build voice-based community tools, Discord rolled out its own support for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">curated audio events last month</a>.</p>
<p>Discord&#8217;s decision to veer away from a sale makes sense for a company keen to keep its unique DNA rather than being rolled into an existing product at a bigger company. The choice could also keep the company distant from a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">protracted antitrust headache</a>, as lawmakers mull legislation that could block big tech deals to prevent further consolidation in the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After visits by unnamed masked intruders and the cancellation of its lease, <a href="https://imaguru.by/">Imaguru</a> — the country’s key startup hub, event and co-working space in Minsk — has effectively been shut down by the Lukashenko regime, which has led a brutal crackdown on its own people in recent months. But the company behind the space says it will defy the authorities and continue its activities online.</p>
<p>Since 2013, Imaguru had become known as being the birthplace of a large number of startups from Belarus, including MSQRD, acquired by Facebook in 2017 — as well as a landing pad for international investors visiting the country. Startups that have emerged from the space have attracted over $100 million in investments in recent years.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Imaguru Startup HUB&#8221; leased the space from &#8220;Horizon Holding&#8221; in 2013, when it took over a dilapidated building from a state-owned company. But on April 16, 2021, Horizon told Imaguru it was unilaterally terminating its lease and the startup space has been given until April 30 to vacate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Imaguru says there has been no reason given for the lease termination, despite Horizon calling Imaguru a “flagship” leasehold for its property business.</p>
<p>To outside observers, it looks like Horizon has come under pressure because of Imaguru&#8217;s active support of the pro-democracy protests inside the country.</p>
<p>In early March, unidentified men wearing masks broke into the office, &#8220;blocked the exit, put young event attendees against the wall, and brought them to the police station” said the company.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://help.imaguru.by/en?fbclid=IwAR3yUYfDt_aCKrFCsS77oLSUx6WtnqMeoJ6h0qCrb-ZnVyetIlrx8925okk">statement</a>, Imaguru said it is &#8220;not silent about lawlessness, repressions and persecution against civilians who defend their rights to an honest and fair choice … Not silent about the regime shutting down the business, investment and startup environment … Not silent about the massive relocation of startups from Belarus, about the catastrophe of this for the country and the role of the HTP in this process.”</p>
<p>Named after the phrase “I’m a guru,&#8221; and transcribed literately by Belarusian entrepreneurs, Imaguru held countless conferences, events, startup pitches and courses. It also organised <a href="https://venturedayminsk.com/">Venture Day Minsk</a> (which will still be run online on April 29).</p>
<p>Since 2013 Imaguru says it has helped over 300 Belarusian startups, including Splitmetrics, MSQRD, PingFin, DEIP and TrackDuck; created 250+ jobs; educated over 12,000 people; held over 3,500 events; organised study tours to the U.S., U.K., Finland, Spain and, most recently, launched the TechMinsk accelerator program.</p>
<p>In recent months, the startup hub came out in solidarity with the protests inside the country following last year’s tainted elections, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/belarus-tech-industry-rallies-around-arrested-pandadoc-colleagues-in-new-video/">recorded videos</a> of solidarity with PandaDoc, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/05/pandadoc-employees-arrested-in-belarus-after-founders-protest-against-lukashenko-regime/">who’s employees have been jailed,</a> and supported the general strike on October 26, 2020.</p>
<p>The Global Entrepreneurship Week Belarus, which was organized by the Imaguru team, was opened by the Belarusian leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.</p>
<p>Imaguru was founded by Belarusian businesswoman Tania Marinich (<a href="https://twitter.com/taniamarinich">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taniamarinich/?originalSubdomain=by">Linkedin</a>, <a href="http://t.me/tmarinich">Telegram</a>) whose husband died in jail after standing at elections in opposition to the Lukashenko regime.</p>
<p>The below is a statement by Marinich on the closure of the Imaguru space:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/LQfD39hc4gs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>A startup hub in Minsk was a totally new idea in Belarus in 2013, but Marinich has championed the ecosystem ever since.</p>
<p>After the protest last year, Marinich joined the core team of the opposition party’s Coordination Council, leading the business group.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Privacy isn&#8217;t dead, as many would have you believe. New regulations, stricter cross-border data transfer rules and increasing calls for data sovereignty have helped the privacy startup space grow thanks to an uptick in investor support.</p>
<p>This is how we got here, and where investors are spending.</p>
<h2><b>The rise of privacy tech</b></h2>
<p>With strict privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA already listing big-ticket penalties — and a growing number of countries following suit — businesses have little option but to comply. It&#8217;s not just bigger, established businesses offering privacy and compliance tech; brand-new startups are filling in the gaps in this emerging and growing space.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last decade, privacy tech was trumpeted as one of the next &#8216;big things&#8217; for investors, but never delivered. Startup business models were too academic, complex and did not appeal to VCs, or crucially, consumers were used to getting free web services,&#8221; Gilbert Hill, chief executive at Tapmydata, told Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Some privacy companies — including privacy hardware companies — are chasing profits and less focused on hustling for outside investment.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Today, privacy is big business. Crunchbase lists <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/privacy-startups">207 privacy startups</a> (as of April 2021) that have together raised more than $3.5 billion over hundreds of individual rounds of funding. The number of privacy companies rockets if you take into account enterprise privacy players. Crunchbase currently has 809 listed <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/privacy-companies">under the wider &#8220;privacy&#8221; category</a>.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/2021TechVendorReport.pdf">Privacy Tech Vendor Report 2021</a> names 356 companies exclusively dealing in enterprise privacy technology solutions, up from 304 companies a year earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since 2017, the privacy landscape underwent a metamorphosis,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;The emergence of the California Consumer Privacy Act, Brazilian General Data Protection Law and other privacy laws around the world have forced organizations to adhere to a new array of compliance requirements, and in response, the demand for privacy tech grew exponentially.&#8221;</p>
<p>That also presents an opportunity for investors.</p>
<h2><b>Increasing investments</b></h2>
<p>Privacy tech was catching the attention of investors even before the recent wave of new privacy laws came into effect. The sector amassed nearly $10 billion in investment in 2019, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/almost-10b-invested-in-privacy-and-security-companies-in-2019/">according to Crunchbase,</a> compared to just $1.7 billion in 2010. Investments remained active in 2020, despite the pandemic.</p>
<p>Case in point: In December, enterprise privacy and compliance firm OneTrust <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/onetrust-nabs-300m-series-c-on-5-1b-valuation-to-expand-privacy-platform/?tpcc=ECTW2020">announced</a> a $300 million Series C funding. The deal valued the 4-year-old privacy tech firm at $5.1 billion, making it one of the first modern privacy unicorns. Three months later, <a href="https://www.onetrust.com/company/news/press-releases/onetrust-extends-series-c-softbank-franklin-templeton/">it extended its Series C funding</a>, with SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Franklin Templeton pumping in another $210 million.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now that Apple&#8217;s lost item finder AirTag has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-introduces-airtag/">officially been introduced</a>, competitor Tile is going on record ahead of its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/senate-to-call-spotify-match-at-apple-google-antitrust-hearing?sref=gni836kR">testimony</a> in front of Congress tomorrow about how it perceives Apple&#8217;s latest product. The company says it will be asking Congress on Wednesday to take a closer look into Apple&#8217;s business practices, and specifically its entry in this lost item tracking category.</p>
<p>Tile has been a strong Apple critic since it learned that Apple would soon launch its own device to take on Tile&#8217;s leading lost item finder beacons. Tile had successfully carved out a market for its Bluetooth-powered keychain dongles that allow consumers to find the lost items Tile attaches to &#8212; like purses, luggage, keys, bikes, wallets and more. It also introduced the idea of a &#8220;finding network,&#8221; where everyone with the Tile app installed on their phone could help to locate someone else&#8217;s Tile, in the case that a lost item was out of Bluetooth range of its owner.</p>
<p>With AirTag, Apple is reproducing these capabilities, while also adding support for more precise ultra-wideband technology, integrating AirTag into its first-party &#8220;Find My&#8221; app, and leveraging its larger iPhone install base to help find missing items. This presents significant competition to Tile, which is not only expected to face off with Apple&#8217;s AirTag across Apple&#8217;s own devices, but also share a portion of its subscription revenues from in-app purchases with Apple thanks to App Store policies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ahead of AirTag&#8217;s launch, Apple moved to head off any sort of anti-competitive claims by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/e-bikes-and-earbuds-among-the-first-third-party-hardware-to-support-apples-find-my-tracking/">opening up access to its &#8220;Find My&#8221; app to third parties</a>. It even partnered with a Tile competitor, the Chipolo ONE Spot, to serve as proof that it&#8217;s giving other lost item finders that compete with AirTag equal footing on its iPhone platform. But Tile&#8217;s argument to date has been that it doesn&#8217;t want to give up the direct relationship it has with customers via its own iOS app to instead support Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Find My&#8221; users, and that Apple&#8217;s mere decision to enter this market with its own item-locating tracker will allow it to easily dominate because of its first-party advantage and ecosystem power.</p>
<p>Tile had <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/meeting/house/110386/witnesses/HHRG-116-JU05-Wstate-DaruK-20200117.pdf">previously testified</a> before Congress about Apple&#8217;s alleged anti-competitive behavior back in 2020 and will now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/senate-to-call-spotify-match-at-apple-google-antitrust-hearing?sref=gni836kR">do so again on Wednesday</a> alongside other Apple critics, including Match and Spotify.</p>
<p>The companies are arguing against Apple&#8217;s in-app commissions, the so-called &#8220;Apple tax,&#8221; which Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">recently reduced</a> for smaller businesses. Many larger companies do not want to pay Apple at all &#8212; they want to process their own payments directly to retain all the revenue collected. They also want a more direct relationship with customers, not one where Apple is the middleman. And in some cases like Tile and Spotify, the companies don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s fair that they&#8217;re paying money to Apple when Apple directly competes with their business through its own first-party apps.</p>
<p>In addition, Tile intended to compete with AirTag via its own ultra-wideband powered device, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">announced earlier this year</a>. But it has yet to receive access to Apple&#8217;s U1 chip to make such a device work, we understand  (Apple has released a draft specification for chipset manufacturers would come later this Spring.)</p>
<p>In a statement released today following Apple&#8217;s event, Tile CEO CJ Prober again publicly criticized Apple&#8217;s move into a market Tile created, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our mission is to solve the everyday pain point of finding lost and misplaced things and we are flattered to see Apple, one of the most valuable companies in the world, enter and validate the category Tile pioneered.</p>
<p>The reason so many people turn to Tile to locate their lost or misplaced items is because of the differentiated value we offer our consumers. In addition to providing an industry leading set of features via our app that works with iOS and Android devices, our service is seamlessly integrated with all major voice assistants, including Alexa and Google. And with form factors for every use case and many different styles at affordable prices, there is a Tile for everyone.</p>
<p>Tile has also successfully partnered with top brands like HP, Intel, Skullcandy and fitbit to enable our finding technology in mass market consumer categories like laptops, earbuds and wearables. With over 30 partners, we look forward to extending the benefits of Tile to millions of customers and enabling an experience that helps you keep track of all your important belongings.</p>
<p>We welcome competition, as long as it is fair competition. Unfortunately, given Apple’s well-documented history of using its platform advantage to unfairly limit competition for its products, we’re skeptical. And given our prior history with Apple, we think it is entirely appropriate for Congress to take a closer look at Apple’s business practices specific to its entry into this category. We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues further in front of Congress tomorrow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple, in response, points out that its Find My network pre-dates Tile&#8217;s founding, and that Tile is able to use Find My if it chooses. It also notes Tile has 90% market share and Apple will need to sell a lot of AirTags to catch up with that lead.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s statement reads, as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have worked from the very beginning of iPhone to help protect the privacy of users&#8217; location data, giving them transparency and control over how all apps may access and share their location. Apple created Find My over a decade ago to help users locate and manage lost devices in a private and secure way. Since then, we have expanded Find My to help users keep tabs on the other important things in their life — from sharing location with friends and family members, to locating third-party products like Van Moof bikes and Chipolo item finders. We have always embraced competition as the best way to drive great experiences for our customers, and we have worked hard to build a platform in iOS that enables third-party developers to thrive.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s Apple event day!</p>
<p>From tweaks to the Apple Card to all new iMacs and iPads, Apple crammed this one-hour event with news. Don&#8217;t have time to sit down and click through every last announcement? We&#8217;ve slimmed it down to just the key points for maximum skimmability. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Apple Card</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1864387" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1864387" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1864387" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?w=680" alt="Apple Card" width="680" height="424" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png 1119w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=768,478 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=680,424 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1864387" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Apple kicked things off with a quick but key mention outlining a shift <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-announces-apple-card-family-for-spouses-to-build-credit-together-and-over-13s-to-use-it-too/">in how Apple Card works</a>. &#8220;Apple Card Family&#8221; will allow you to share your card with anyone in your family over the age of 13, with customizable spending limits for each added user. You&#8217;ll also now be able to &#8220;co-own&#8221; an Apple card with another adult, with both owners building up their credit equally.</p>
<h2>Apple Podcasts</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2141036" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141036" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141036" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?w=680" alt="apple podcasts 2021" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg 1878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141036" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Apple will launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">a redesigned Podcast app</a>, including an option for paid subscriptions (monthly or annual) to individual podcasts.</p>
<h2>Purple iPhones</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2141038" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141038" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141038" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/purple.jpg?w=680" alt="purple iphone" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/purple.jpg 1882w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/purple.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/purple.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/purple.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/purple.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/purple.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/purple.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141038" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>No new iPhone this time (those come later in the year, generally), but the existing iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-adds-a-new-purple-color-option-to-its-iphone-12-and-iphone-12-mini-lineup/">getting a new color option: purple</a>. They used a song from Willy Wonka to announce it, because … well, purple.</p>
<h2>AirTag</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2141048" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141048" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141048" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?w=680" alt="apple airtag $99 4 pack" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg 1894w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141048" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>After literal <em>years</em> of rumors and leaks, Apple has at long last officially announced its accessory for tracking things like keys, wallets and bags through the same &#8220;Find My&#8221; app you use to find your various Apple devices when you lose them in the couch.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-officially-unveils-its-lost-item-finder-airtag/">Called &#8220;AirTag&#8221;</a> (curiously, not &#8220;AirTags&#8221;), Apple says they&#8217;ll cost $29 each or $99 for a four pack, and launch on April 30. They&#8217;ll have user-replaceable batteries but, oddly, no built-in attachment loop; if you want to attach it to something like a keyring, you&#8217;ll need to add a case. Which, of course, they&#8217;ll be making and selling.</p>
<p>Each AirTag has a built-in speaker for helping you track down lost items, and you can engrave them with texts and/or select emoji for free when you buy them online.</p>
<h2>Next-gen Apple TV 4K</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2141067" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141067" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141067" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg 1894w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141067" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Apple announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/the-new-apple-tv-4k-comes-with-a-new-siri-remote/">big refresh to the Apple TV 4K</a> it first launched back in 2017. Here&#8217;s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Powered by Apple&#8217;s A12 Bionic chip.</li>
<li>You can use an iPhone to calibrate the picture. Start the calibration process, put your iPhone&#8217;s front-facing camera near the TV, and Apple TV 4K will automatically optimize its own color/contrast output accordingly.</li>
<li>They&#8217;ve redesigned the remote! They&#8217;ve moved away from the much lamented touchpad remote, building this new remote around a five-way clickpad complete with iPod-esque scroll wheel. There&#8217;s a Siri button on the side, in case you feel like talking to your TV instead of pushing buttons. Word is (via <a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern/status/1384565971193585664">WSJ&#8217;s Joanna Stern</a>) they&#8217;ll also be selling this remote separately for $59 for use with the previous-gen Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD.</li>
<li>$179 for 32 GB model or $199 for 64 GB.</li>
</ul>
<h2>New iMacs</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2141098" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141098" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141098 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-03-e1618940845775.jpg?w=680" alt="back and side views of red 2021 Apple iMac" width="680" height="370" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-03-e1618940845775.jpg 1909w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-03-e1618940845775.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-03-e1618940845775.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-03-e1618940845775.jpg?resize=768,418 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-03-e1618940845775.jpg?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-03-e1618940845775.jpg?resize=1536,835 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-03-e1618940845775.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141098" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Time for the iMac to shift over to M1! Apple announced a new lineup of iMacs — and in a throwback to the iMacs of yesteryear, these new ones <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-introduces-a-colorful-new-imac/">will come in an array of fancy colors</a>. Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built around the absurdly zippy M1 chipset Apple first introduced into its laptops last year.</li>
<li>24-inch &#8220;4.5K&#8221; display.</li>
<li>At last, a decent webcam! These new iMacs will ship with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apples-new-imac-finally-gets-an-actually-good-webcam/">1080p FaceTime camera.</a></li>
<li>Pre-orders start April 20, shipping in late May.</li>
<li>$1,299 gets you an 8-core CPU/7-core GPU setup, while $1,499 will bump it up to 8-core CPU/8-core GPU.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll come in seven colors: green, yellow, pink, orange, blue, purple and silver. Some colors will only be available in the more expensive model.</li>
<li>Both models come with a 256 GB SSD, and two Thunderbolt ports. The $1,499 model adds two USB 3 ports.</li>
<li>Apple will ship a new version of its Bluetooth Magic Keyboard, now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-brings-touch-id-to-the-magic-keyboard/">complete with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-introduces-a-colorful-new-imac/">announced the new iMac</a> powered by Apple&#8217;s own M1 silicon. Among the numerous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-brings-touch-id-to-the-magic-keyboard/">updates</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apples-new-imac-finally-gets-an-actually-good-webcam/">upgrades</a> is a new power brick that sports something special to Apple&#8217;s lineup: an Ethernet port. On the surface, this seems like a silly placement of a critical I/O port, but there&#8217;s a good chance this feature could hit future Apple laptops where it makes much more sense.</p>
<p>The M1 iMac sports a new design that&#8217;s much thinner than the last generation and Apple likely didn&#8217;t want to make room for the Ethernet port. The only I/O ports appear to be a 3.5mm jack and several USB-C ports. The power adapter itself has a new magnetic connector and doesn&#8217;t use one of the computer&#8217;s USB-C ports. The Ethernet port was relegated to the power supply.</p>
<p>There are several advantages for this placement. It reduces clutter on the back of the computer and streamlines connectivity &#8212; items that are even more critical in a portable computer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple famously shares components and accessories across its product line, making it very likely this power brick will come to other products. Apple started removing the magnetic MagSafe power connector when its laptops adopted USB-C in 2016, and it would be fantastic to see a similar product return to the product line. Apple removed the Ethernet port on the MacBook Pro in 2012.</p>
<p>Several companies offer add-ons for Apple power adapters. These, like the Twelve South PlugBug Duo, add  USB ports to the adapters, but none have yet to offer Ethernet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The big news from today&#8217;s Spring Loaded event is, as anticipated, a new version of Apple&#8217;s high-end tablet. The new iPad Pro is the first in the line to adopt the M1 chip introduced on the company&#8217;s Mac line. The new chip sports an 8-core CPU, with performance up to 50% faster than the A12Z Bionic found on the previous generation. There&#8217;s also an 8-core GPU, which it claims is up to 40% faster. The system can be decked out to up to 16 GB of RAM and 2 TB of storage.</p>
<p>The device further blurs the line between the company&#8217;s tablet and desktop offerings, as well as improved battery life now listed as &#8220;all day.&#8221; The Pro also adds Thunderbolt support to the USB-C, which allows for a number of new features including external display support and wired transfers up to 40 Gbps.</p>

<p>The Pro also joins the iPhone line with the addition of 5G connectivity. Like the new iMac, the Pro features improved imaging, courtesy of the new ISP aboard the Apple silicon. That&#8217;s coupled with a new ultrawide camera. That should allow for improved teleconferencing ability, with a 120-degree field of view and the new “Center Stage” feature, which follows the users around, similar to tech we&#8217;ve seen on some smart displays. The company describes the experience thusly,</p>
<blockquote><p>As users move around, Center Stage automatically pans to keep them in the shot. When others join in, the camera detects them too, and smoothly zooms out to fit everyone into the view and make sure they are part of the conversation. So whether whiteboarding with co-workers or attending a virtual family gathering, the experience of connecting is now more engaging than ever.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s coupled with a Dolby Atmos-powered four speaker array.</p>

<p>As reported, the new tablet (12.9-inch only for now) features an improved display &#8212; Liquid Retina XDR, according to Apple&#8217;s marketing terms. Among other things that brings much improved high dynamic range. The display is powered by 10,000 micro-LED. That allows for a hugely improved contrast ratio and 1,000 nits of brightness, without hammering the battery life.</p>
<p>The 11-inch version starts at $799 and the 12.9-inch, which adds the Liquid Retina display, starts at $1,099. Pre-orders on the tablets starts April 30 and the product is set to start shipping in the second half of May &#8212; along with a number of other products introduced at today&#8217;s show.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has unveiled a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-introduces-a-colorful-new-imac/">new, colorful iMac</a> today with an Apple-designed M1 chip. But that was just part of the story as the company used that opportunity to release new Mac accessories. In addition to a Magic Trackpad and a Magic Mouse with multiple color options, Apple is bringing Touch ID to desktop Macs with a new Magic Keyboard.</p>
<p>Touch ID on desktop works as expected. There’s a fingerprint sensor located at the top right of the keyboard. It replaces the ‘Eject’ key that you can find on existing Apple keyboards. It lets you unlock your computer, pay with Apple Pay, unlock a password manager and more.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Touch ID works wirelessly, which means that you don’t have to connect your keyboard to your Mac with a Lightning cable. There’s a dedicated security component built in the keyboard. It communicates directly with the Secure Enclave in the M1, which means that it only works with modern Mac computers with an M1 chip. It&#8217;s going to be interesting to see the security implementation of this new take on Touch ID.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customers can choose between three keyboard models when they buy a new iMac. Some iMac models probably don’t come with Touch ID by default. You may be able to buy the keyboard separately, but we’ll have to wait for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-spring-hardware-event-2021">the event</a> to end to find out how much the new keyboard costs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple announced a new Apple TV 4K today, which will come with a new Siri Remote.</p>
<p>In addition to the existing Siri support, this new aluminum remote features a redesigned clickpad that allows for circular gestures in the outer ring, which viewers can use to quickly find the scene they&#8217;re looking for. And to eliminate the need to reach for another remote, it also includes a mute button and a power button for your actual TV.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-unveils-the-next-generation-of-apple-tv-4k/"> new Apple TV 4K</a> is built with Apple&#8217;s A12 Bionic chip, which the company says will allow it to support higher-quality video, specifically high frame rate HDR and Dolby Vision at 60 frames per second.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, picture quality also depends on the TV itself. But Apple announced a new feature to address the situation, and it&#8217;s not limited to people who purchase the new device. To improve the color balance on their TV, any Apple TV owner should be able to use the light sensor in their iPhone to measure their current balance, and the output from their Apple TV will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>The new Apple TV 4K will be available for $179 for 32 gigabytes (or $199 if you want to double the storage capacity), with orders starting on April 30 and availability in the second half of May. You&#8217;ll also be able to buy an Apple TV HD with the new Siri Remote for $149, or the remote alone for $59.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the A12 Bionic and the all-new Siri Remote, Apple TV 4K lets customers enjoy their favorite shows, movies, and more in the highest quality, with simple and intuitive controls,&#8221; said Apple Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Bob Borchers in a statement. &#8220;And of course, Apple TV 4K offers easy access to Apple services, along with thousands of apps on the App Store for even more entertainment options.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple introduced new iMacs at its event on Tuesday, outfitted with its M1 processor and redesigned inside and out from the ground up. The hardware is impressive, but one of the biggest improvements for everyone&#8217;s Zoom-heavy life might be the webcam. Apple said it&#8217;s the &#8220;best camera ever in a Mac,&#8221; which honestly wouldn&#8217;t take much, but its specs suggest it actually is a big upgrade.</p>
<p>The camera finally achieves 1080p video capabilities, and Apple has also equipped it with a larger sensor that should provide greatly improved low-light performance. The M1 chip has better image signal processing capabilities, and uses computational video powers to correct and improve the image on the fly, which has brought benefits to the image quality even on existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro hardware with the same old, bad webcam equipment.</p>
<p>That should mean this iMac actually has really good image quality — or at least not image quality you need to be embarrassed about. The on-board machine learning processor in the M1, which Apple calls the Neural Engine, will be working in real-time to optimize lighting and do noise reduction, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On top of the camera, Apple touts new beam forming mics in a three-mic array that will optimize audio, focusing on your voice and eliminating background noise. All told, this should finally be a Mac that provides a videoconferencing experience that doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s stuck in the early 2000s.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Research papers come out far too frequently for anyone to read them all. That&#8217;s especially true in the field of machine learning, which now affects (and produces papers in) practically every industry and company. This column aims to collect some of the most relevant recent discoveries and papers — particularly in, but not limited to, artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter.</p>
<p>It takes an emotionally mature AI to admit its own mistakes, and that&#8217;s exactly what this project from the Technical University of Munich aims to create. Maybe not the emotion, exactly, but recognizing and learning from mistakes, specifically in self-driving cars. The researchers <a href="https://www.tum.de/nc/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/details/36509/">propose a system</a> in which the car would look at all the times in the past when it has had to relinquish control to a human driver and thereby learn its own limitations — <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9310689">what they call &#8220;introspective failure prediction.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>For instance, if there are a lot of cars ahead, the autonomous vehicle&#8217;s brain could use its sensors and logic to make a decision <em>de novo</em> about whether an approach would work or whether none will. But the TUM team says that by simply comparing new situations to old ones, it can reach a decision much faster on whether it will need to disengage. Saving six or seven seconds here could make all the difference for a safe handover.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important for robots and autonomous vehicles of all types to be able to make decisions without phoning home, especially in combat, where decisive and concise movements are necessary. The Army Research Lab is <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/244778/army_researchers_work_to_make_robots_self_sufficient">looking into ways</a> in which ground and air vehicles can interact autonomously, allowing, for instance, a mobile landing pad that drones can land on without needing to coordinate, ask permission or rely on precise GPS signals.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WzF8mHlZds4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Their solution, at least for the purposes of testing, is actually rather low tech. The ground vehicle has a landing area on top painted with an enormous QR code, which the drone can see from a fairly long way off. The drone can track the exact location of the pad totally independently. In the future, the QR code could be done away with and the drone could identify the shape of the vehicle instead, presumably using some best-guess logic to determine whether it&#8217;s the one it wants.</p>

<p>In the medical world, AI is being put to work not on tasks that are not much difficult but are rather tedious for people to do. A good example of this is tracking the activity of individual cells in microscopy images. It&#8217;s not a superhuman task to look at a few hundred frames spanning several depths of a petri dish and track the movements of cells, but that doesn&#8217;t mean grad students like doing it.</p>
<p>This software from<a href="https://www.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/english/research-news/03291709/"> researchers at Nagoya City University</a> in Japan does it automatically using image analysis and the capability (much improved in recent years) of understanding objects over a period of time rather than just in individual frames. <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59187">Read the paper here</a>, and check out the extremely cute illustration showing off the tech at right … more research organizations should hire professional artists.</p>
<p>This process is similar to that of tracking moles and other skin features on people at risk for melanoma. While they might see a dermatologist every year or so to find out whether a given spot seems sketchy, the rest of the time they must track their own moles and freckles in other ways. That&#8217;s hard when they&#8217;re in places like one&#8217;s back.</p>
