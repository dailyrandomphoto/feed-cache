										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An electric vehicle is, essentially, just ‘software on wheels’, and requires lots of moving parts, not physical but, of course, virtual. That software needs to continually optimize the performance, efficiency, and safety of the EV it’s running. But a problem has arisen: Not enough auto-makers unpack their software for others to help improve it. So, the more this embedded automotive software is de-coupled from the underlying electronic hardware, the more this optimization can take place, and the more efficient vehicles can become. That has important implications for things like battery range and performance overall.</p>
<p>This is part of the reason why UK-based <a href="https://eatron.com/">Eatron</a>, which makes this ‘intelligent automotive software’, has managed to attract an $11 million Series-A funding round led by the UK&#8217;s MMC Ventures.</p>
<p>Also participating was Aster Capital and Vietnamese Carmaker VinFast. Eatron has previously collaborated with Vinfast on its range of electric cars. The startup also has a strategic partnership with the Hirschvogel Group from German, which invested $1.5M</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236589" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s technology enables OEMs and Tier-1s to de-couple automotive software from its hardware for the purposes of battery management, intelligent motion control, and advanced driver assistance. This has the effect of increasing supplier choice for OEMs and reduces cost, risks and time to market, says the company.</p>
<p>Part of the Series-A funding will be used to expand the platform with additional partnerships for third-party software modules and semiconductor and hardware component suppliers. It will also grow its sales teams in Germany, India and USA.</p>
<p>Dr Umut Genc, co-founder and CEO at Eatron said: “Mobility and Automotive in particular, is in the middle of a dramatic transformation and as part of this change needs to become a software-driven industry. An intelligent automotive software platform, embedded at the edge and connected to the cloud, will play a critical role in this transformation.” <br />
  <br />
Mina Samaan, Investor at MMC Ventures said: “We have seen many software businesses building interesting algorithmic concepts to support OEMs, but none have had the expertise to meet the regulatory, security and safety requirements for automotive production. Eatron is the exception. Its software has been built from the ground up to be automotive grade and has the potential to drive the battery and autonomy features in hundreds of thousands of vehicles in the coming years.” </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://partyround.com/">Party Round</a> is building software that it hopes will make the process of raising early-stage corporate capital far simpler than it is today. And the company just used its own service to raise $7 million.</p>
<p>A host of names took part in the, well, <em>party round</em>, including <a href="https://sevensevensix.com/">Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six fund</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/illscience">Anish Acharya from a16z</a>, along with checks from groups like <a href="https://www.shrug.vc/">Shrug Capital</a>. Angels took part as well, including writers-cum-investors <a href="https://twitter.com/packyM">Packy McCormick</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/austin_rief">Austin Rief</a>, and well-known folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/emiliemc">Emilie Choi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mrsharma">Nik Sharma</a>.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s view, as detailed by Party Round CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordi-hays-559199113/">Jordi Hays</a> during an interview, is that tech founders have disrupted many methods of investing, but not the way that they raise capital themselves. His startup wants to work on the problem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236416" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Per Hays, even using a modern fundraising structure like a SAFE doesn&#8217;t preclude a startup from dealing with lots of back-and-forths over documents, lawyers and tracking wire transfers. As the old saw goes &#8212; that startup fundraising is a distraction is rooted in reality &#8212; Party Round could be onto something by wanting to lower the overall friction present in raising capital.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early days. Party Round is focused on automating seed deals today. Its service has founders create a round, set terms and invite investors to participate. It then helps handle the requisite documents, signatures and capture of raised funds. Smaller checks than are normally considered economically viable &#8212; lawyers are expensive, as is CEO time &#8212; can be accepted, Hays said, opening up the investor pool to one&#8217;s larger network instead of merely the already wealthy.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t share much in the way of metrics, a somewhat standard level of disclosure for early-stage companies. But it did say that during a beta period, a collection of founders raised in the low six figures per day using its service.</p>
<p>Which, today, is free. The startup will monetize later on, with Hays saying that there are a number of ways for it to do so. Normally I&#8217;d protest at delayed monetization, but given that Party Round intends to sit atop an artery of capital, it should be able to tap the vein to feed itself when it chooses to. Close proximity to money, and especially money in motion, is never a bad place to build a business.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it&#8217;s fun that Party Round calls itself Party Round. After all, the phrase &#8220;party round&#8221; used to sport a skein of sophisticated investor disapproval. The argument from years ago was that if a company raised a bunch of little checks, a lack of a traditional venture lead would leave the company adrift if it ran into trouble. How things change!</p>
<h2>How do you get corporate software to go viral?</h2>
<p>Party Round stood out from the regular deluge of startup fundraising events not because its own capital raise is a meta-proof point of its model, but because the company is good at culture. By that, I mean I was actually aware of Party Round far in advance of it getting ahold of TechCrunch, even if we didn&#8217;t know it at the time.</p>
<p>The startup has put together a series of viral events, products that it calls <a href="https://partyround.com/drops">drops</a>. Before talking to Hays, I had already seen Party Round&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://helpfulvcs.com/">helpful VCs</a>&#8221; NFT drop in the wild, as well as <a href="https://bigtechfellowship.com/">its dare</a> for employees at major tech companies to quit and found their own company.</p>

<p>The startup is good at making noise, which could help the company keep a steady flow of new founders looking to raise entering its front door, and at a low cost to acquire, we&#8217;d reckon.</p>
<p>I am in favor of any service that makes the process of raising capital for business formation simpler because it could help make the startup world more equitable. In theory, at least.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how Party Round turns some early momentum and earned hype into funding volume for its users, how quickly it can add more products &#8212; SPVs, later-stage checks, debt, the possibilities are broad &#8212; and when it starts to ask for payment for its services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For most of the world&#8217;s industries, sustainability is an exercise in correcting the mistakes of the past — from changing mindsets to the very machinery used.</p>
<p>But for the fledgling cannabis industry, there is still hope. A slew of startups and industry bodies are trying to make sure that for once, an industry starts off on the right path.</p>
<p>“What I have seen across Fortune 500 companies is, they&#8217;re trying to improve efficiency to reduce the environmental impact of operations that already exist,&#8221; said Annie Davis, vice president of marketing for Flow Cannabis Co, an outdoor cannabis cultivator. &#8220;But what if, from the start, we could build a different model?”</p>
<p>That would be ideal. However, even though cannabis as a legal business is only about a decade old, it still has a long history of illegal cultivation that set a precedent of avoiding the cops rather than saving the planet. Moreover, that has meant that cannabis cultivation has missed out on the massive advancements in traditional agriculture.</p>
<p>&#8220;The agricultural research that’s related to cannabis is anecdotal and driven from its history as an illegal product. It hasn’t benefited from the level of research that traditional agricultural products have,&#8221; said Shawn Cooney, co-founder of the <a href="https://www.sustainablecannabiscoalition.com/">Sustainable Cannabis Coalition</a> (SCC), a coalition of 20 cannabis or cannabis-adjacent companies, including cannabis producer <a href="https://www.trulieve.com/">Trulieve</a> and Flow Cannabis. &#8220;So there’s a history of using less efficient technologies.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Hotboxing is bad for the planet</h2>
<p>As of 2020, <a href="https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com/article/2020-state-of-the-industry-report-nexus-greenhouse-systems/">40%</a> of legal cannabis growers cultivate solely indoors, which leaves a huge energy footprint. According to Travis Higginbotham, vice president of production at cannabis retailer and producer <a href="https://shopharborside.com/">Harborside</a>, consumers prefer cannabis that&#8217;s grown indoors, and so it has a higher retail value.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			In Colorado, the cannabis industry alone accounts for 1.3% of the state’s total annual emissions, equal to that of coal mining and trash collection.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Cannabis farmers moved inside because they had to hide from law enforcement, Davis said, and those that grew outside planted under the shade of large trees to avoid being spotted by helicopters — not optimal for producing cannabis with high levels of THC. Such early decisions, made when cannabis was illegal, are still influencing consumer preferences and business operations.</p>
<p>The high energy costs associated with growing indoors are the cannabis sector&#8217;s biggest environmental problem — one that is both operational and reputational. Indoor systems use a combination of lights and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to control the climate and simulate ideal conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drug development space is continuing to attract more and more investment. On Thursday, another major player, Generate Biomedicines, announced a $370 million Series B round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate Biomedicines is touting a platform-based approach to drug development, but with its own spin: a focus on proteins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate&#8217;s thesis is simple: Rather than making connections between targets and proteins that already exist in nature (or, most often, in scientific data and literature), it aims to understand the big picture &#8212; “foundational principles” about how proteins are made and why they do what they do (which is, basically everything, in the body). The ultimate goal is to use this knowledge to make novel proteins that could one day perform “the majority of life’s functions,” as Mike Nally, the CEO of Generate Biomedicines, told TechCrunch. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236472" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last three years, the company has managed to put such fundamental principles to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve been able to generate novel proteins across all protein modalities, and so that includes antibodies, peptides, enzymes and cell and gene therapy,” Nally said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate Biomedicines is another one of a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/flagship-pioneering-raises-1-1-billion-to-spend-on-sustainability-and-health-focused-biotech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing cadre</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of companies fostered by Flagship Pioneering &#8212; the investor behind Moderna. The company emerged from stealth <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/generate-biomedicines-emerges-from-stealth-mode-and-takes-aim-at-covid19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2020</a> with an initial investment of $50 million from the firm, in line with what we’ve seen in other Flagship companies, like the newly launched </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/flagship-pioneerings-new-venture-is-betting-on-trna-to-treat-thousands-of-diseases/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alltrna</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This most recent round is Generate Biomedicines&#8217; first significant attempt at external financing. The round will include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alaska Permanent Fund, Altitude Life Science Ventures, ARCH Venture Partners and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as additional investment from Flagship Pioneering. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Generate Biomedicines seems to have had little trouble generating interest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On one hand, the company could be benefitting from general trends. Venture capital investment in drug discovery nearly doubled between 2019 and 2020, reaching </span><a href="https://nvca.org/healthcare-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$16.2 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Meanwhile, investment in AI-based drug development has also snowballed. Per a Stanford University 2020 report, it reached </span><a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report_Master.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$13.9 billion in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, over four times the level of funding in 2019. In August 2021, funding had reached $10.7 billion, per a </span><a href="https://www.signifyresearch.net/healthcare-it/total-vc-funding-ai-drug-development-clinical-trials-hits-10-7bn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signify Research report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round is large, but isn’t too far off of numbers seen this year for companies occupying a similar space: like Insilico Medicine’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-i-drug-discovery-platform-insilico-medicine-announces-255-million-in-series-c-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$255 million Series C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="https://cellarity.com/news/cellarity-raises-123-million-in-series-b-funding-to-pioneer-a-new-approach-to-drug-discovery-treating-disease-at-the-level-of-the-cell-as-opposed-to-a-single-molecular-target" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cellarity’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (another Flagship Pioneering Company) $123 million Series B. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate Biomedicines&#8217; leadership chalks up the size of this round to the company’s new take on protein biology, and protein-based drug development as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therapeutic proteins, particularly monoclonal antibodies, are making up a bigger and bigger share of the drug market. In 2018, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d43747-020-00765-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven of the top 10</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> best-selling drugs were monoclonal antibodies. A 2020 report by </span><a href="https://www.bdo.com/getattachment/92a59a05-185f-4416-a599-7cff17c080f5/attachment.aspx?BPI-The-Therapeutic-Monoclonal-Antibody-Product-Market.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bioprocess International Magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that global sales of monoclonal antibodies have grown faster than all other biopharmaceuticals in the last five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monoclonal antibodies are perhaps most well-known in the realms of </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551545/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oncology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and immunology. But use cases are expanding. For example, monoclonal antibodies, like those manufactured by </span><a href="https://www.lilly.com/news/stories/covid19-treatment-monoclonal-antibodies-infusion-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eli Lilly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to treat COVID-19, is an example of a therapeutic protein that you’ve likely already heard of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate Biomedicines is focused on all protein modalities, but they have initially focused on developing antibodies, which Nally says make up about 60% of the protein-based biotherapeutics market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, generating antibodies is just part of the picture. The focus on foundational principles of protein function allows for an untapped level of bespoke protein design, adds Molly Gibson, co-founder and chief strategy innovation officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To wrap your head around the scale, think of all the proteins that have been honed by natural selection since the beginning of life. Those proteins only represent a tiny fraction of the total possible proteins that our building blocks of life are capable of forming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The amount of sequence space that nature has sampled through the history of life would equate to almost just a drop of water in all of Earth&#8217;s oceans,” said Gibson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate Biomedicines&#8217; approach is to use artificial intelligence to understand what other functional proteins we might be capable of making, as opposed to identifying untapped extant proteins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, therapeutic proteins aren’t the easiest drugs to make. </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/biologics-research-projects/immunogenicity-protein-based-therapeutics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the immune system </span><a href="http://www.iptonline.com/articles/public/IPTTEN79NoPrint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hasn’t exactly been receptive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to novel proteins. Gibson says the company&#8217;s technology can work around this roadblock. She says the company can “co-optimize” for immunogenicity and protein function. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to do this, we have developed a proprietary experimental approach to measure and ML approach to learn how proteins are recognized by the immune system, so we can ultimately avoid it,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Generate Biomedicines sees itself as both a drug maker and a platform. The company has several drug candidates in preclinical stages (the focus is infectious disease, oncology and immunology, says Nally). The goal is to pursue Investigational New Drug status by 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Generate Biomedicines&#8217; major upside, per Nally, is that it’s a platform for others to smooth out the process of protein-based drug development in general. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past Nally has indicated that partnerships would be part of Generate Biomedicines&#8217; strategy. But so far, the company hasn’t disclosed any. Though he added the company is looking for partners with deep disease area expertise, or expertise on certain targets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this current round of funding, Generate Biomedicines plans to scale up its workforce to 500 &#8212; the company has 80 employees at the moment. The company is also building two facilities to expand its wet lab, machine learning and data generation capabilities. </span></p>

<p>With this, the company has now raised a total of $257.9 million and its valuation is now north of $1 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235892" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Expel offers what is essentially a managed security service for cloud applications, infrastructure, networks and endpoints, with its own analysts monitoring a company&#8217;s network 24&#215;7 (and performing remediation if necessary), as well as a preemptive threat hunting service for on-premises and cloud environments. By building what the company calls an &#8220;automation-forward&#8221; system, its systems are able to quickly react to potential issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;These past two years have presented unique challenges that, I think it’s safe to say, most of us couldn’t have anticipated. Yet, during this time we scaled our platform to handle an 82% increase in security events a day, doubled the number of technology partners, more than doubled the number of security investigations, while increasing automation which improved our analyst effectiveness by 260%, all while maintaining an 80+ NPS rating,” said Expel CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davemerkel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/davemerkel/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637253320682000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0PTFuYEBn4KhnNjXmsdsaS">Dave Merkel</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Defending against ransomware, phishing and other emerging threats requires professional management and response, and the need for enterprises to adopt more than just best-in-class MDR has become abundantly clear. <span class="il">Expel</span> is at the forefront of this industry revolution, helping its customers and the security community navigate the complexity of detection and response across on-premise and, increasingly, cloud-based environments,&#8221; said Gene Frantz, general partner at CapitalG and <span class="il">Expel</span> board member.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alexa is learning to have more natural conversations. Amazon today <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/conversation-mode-helps-interactions-with-alexa-feel-more-natural">announced</a> it&#8217;s rolling out the new &#8220;Conversation Mode&#8221; feature to its Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen.) devices which allows the virtual assistant to engage in free-flowing conversations that don&#8217;t require you to say the wake word, &#8220;Alexa.&#8221; This mode is enabled and disabled by the user via voice commands, so it can be something you only turn on as needed.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/amazons-alexa-becomes-a-better-conversationalist-and-can-now-ask-you-questions-too/">introduced</a> Alexa Conversations alongside other A.I. developments at its hardware event last year, where Amazon VP and head scientist Rohit Prasad demoed new Alexa capabilities like its more personalized answers, ability to ask clarifying questions, and ability to take natural turns in a conversation.</p>
<p>These types of interactions are easy enough for humans, but present significant challenges for an A.I.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236519" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At its event, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/amazons-alexa-becomes-a-better-conversationalist-and-can-now-ask-you-questions-too/">showed off how</a> Conversation Mode could work when two people talked about ordering a pizza.</p>
<p>After enabling the feature by saying, &#8220;Alexa, join our conversation,&#8221; the people discussed their pizza order, at times talking over the virtual assistant. When Alexa landed on the pizza topping they liked, a person said &#8220;that one!&#8221; and Alexa adjusted the order. Alexa <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/25/tech/amazon-alexa-conversational-ai/index.html">also appeared</a> to understand which questions were meant for it versus those that were part of the conversation between the two people, like &#8220;do you think a medium is going to be enough?,&#8221; for example. Then, when one person said they weren&#8217;t that hungry and wanted a smaller pizza, Alexa automatically changed the order.</p>
<p>The company explains Amazon uses a combination of visual and acoustic cues to recognize when customer speech is being directed at the device and whether a reply is expected. This can be a very difficult problem for an A.I., as many questions could be meant for either a device or a person, Amazon explains today &#8212; like &#8220;How about a comedy?,&#8221; in a conversation about movie selection.</p>
<p>In addition, a conversational mode feature would need to have low latency in order to more accurately detect the start of an utterance meant for Alexa. (Typically, a wake word triggers Alexa to listen).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Amazon says it developed a method for visual device directedness by estimating the head orientation of each person in the device&#8217;s field of view.</p>
<p>&#8220;We trained a deep-neural-network model to infer the coefficients of the templates for a given input image and to determine the orientation of the head in the image,&#8221; the company shares, <a href="https://www.amazon.science/blog/new-alexa-feature-enables-natural-multiparty-interactions">in an Amazon Science blog post</a>, offering a high-level view of the A.I. technology. &#8220;Then we quantized the weights of the model, to reduce its size and execution time. In our experiments, this approach reduced the false-rejection rate (FRR) for visual device directedness detection by almost 80% relative to the [ standard perspective-n-point] approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon also uses an audio-based device voice activity detection (DVAD) model to process the audio cues that signal whether or not Alexa should respond to speech it&#8217;s hearing. By adding this to the visual-only mode, Amazon was able to reduce false wakes due to ambient noise by 80% and cut down false wakes triggered by Alexa&#8217;s own responses by 42%, without increasing latency, it says.</p>
<p>To use Conversation Mode, users can say, &#8220;Alexa, join the conversation.&#8221; When enabled, there&#8217;s a solid blue border around the Echo Show 10 screen, and a light blue bar at the bottom of the screen, which lets you know when your requests are being sent to the cloud. When you&#8217;re finished, you can exit by saying, &#8220;Leave the conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexa will also automatically exit the mode if there&#8217;s no more interaction for a short period of time.</p>
<p>The company has been working on this conversational development for some time.</p>
<p>In July 2020, it presented <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2020/07/introducing-alexa-conversations-beta-a-new-ai-driven-approach-to-providing-conversational-experiences-that-feel-more-natural">a beta version of an Alexa Conversations feature</a> to Alexa Skills developers, to help them create voice apps that allow for more natural-feeling conversations where people can talk to Alexa in a &#8220;less constrained way,&#8221; using the phrases they prefer. Before this, Amazon had <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/how-to-string-multiple-alexa-commands-together/">developed a feature</a> called Follow-Up Mode, that allowed people to give their Alexa smart device multiple commands at the same time, without having to say &#8220;Alexa&#8221; each time.</p>
<p>While the new Conversation Mode technology was announced last year, Amazon tells TechCrunch it&#8217;s officially launching today and the Echo Show 10 is the first device to receive it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram has <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1461034689632686082?s=20">introduced</a> a new &#8220;Rage Shake&#8221; feature that lets users shake their phones to report a problem with the app. Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced the launch of the new feature in a video on Twitter and explained how it works.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ever use Instagram and it wasn&#8217;t working like it was supposed to? Maybe Stories didn&#8217;t load, maybe the audio wasn&#8217;t working, maybe you just couldn&#8217;t upload a photo and it was just really getting you, really just pissing you off? Now, you can literally shake the phone and a little option will come up that allows you to report a problem,&#8221; Mosseri said in the video.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Once you shake to report, you can explain what happened with the app and report the issue. Mosseri says this will help the company prioritize bugs and learn about other things to fix in the app. For now, the feature is only available in the U.S. for both iOS and Android users.</p>
<p>The social media giant is also rolling out the ability to delete single items from a carousel post with at least three images or videos. For context, carousel feed posts can combine up to 10 photos and videos in one post. With this latest update, you can delete items from an existing carousel. It&#8217;s worth noting that you can&#8217;t add to the carousel, replace one item for another, or reorder items in the carousel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2236536" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236536" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2236536" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236536" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Mosseri says this new option should have been rolled out a while ago and that it was a highly requested feature. The social media giant notes that sometimes users have made a mistake, no longer want a certain photo on their grid but still want to keep the overall carousel, or they just want to change things up with a certain post.</p>
<p>To remove an image or a video from a carousel, you have to tap on the three dots in the right-hand corner of a post and then select &#8220;edit.&#8221; Then, you can swipe to the photo or image you want to get rid of and click the &#8220;delete&#8221; icon in the top left corner. The new feature is currently only available on iOS, with support for Android coming soon.</p>
<p>These two new launches come as Instagram has been introducing several new features over the past few weeks. Last week, it began testing a new feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/">“Take a Break,”</a> which allows users to remind themselves to take a break from Instagram after either 10, 20 or 30 minutes. The social media giant also recently rolled out a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/instagram-rolls-out-an-add-yours-sticker-in-stories-to-create-threads-users-can-respond-to/">“Add Yours” sticker</a> that creates public threads in Stories. The new feature allows users to respond to other users’ Stories with their own following a prompt or a certain topic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before we get started, two quick notes. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We’re launching Actuator as a newsletter in a few short weeks! Make sure you’re in on the ground floor </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">by signing up (for free!) over here.</a> Also, t<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he powers that be helpfully noted that I’ve not taken any days off this year, so I’ll be doing that next week.

<p>Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/cmus-new-robotics-institute-director-on-the-future-of-robot-research/">Carnegie Mellon announced that it had appointed Matthew Johnson-Roberson</a> the sixth director of its Robotics Institute. We’ve spoken to Johnson-Roberson a number of times in the last few years, primarily in his capacity as Refraction AI’s co-founder and CTO. When I sat down with him again last week to discuss his new role, he called me from the University of Michigan’s Ford-funded robotics wing, where he served as co-director.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a smart hire for a number of reasons &#8212; not the least of which is the CMU grad’s experience in both founding a startup and working as part of a corporate-university alliance. We’ve devoted a lot of words to Pittsburgh and CMU on this site over the past few years, and the consensus is that the former has been doing a better job incubating startups, but things could always improve.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235842" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2164730" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164730" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2164730" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg" alt="Matthew Johnson-roberson" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164730" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin</p></div></p>
<p>Pittsburgh is quite possibly the strongest example of how a vibrant startup scene can revitalize a region suffering from economic depression. There are, of course, broader economic issues around potentially leaving residents behind through gentrification, but on the whole, Pittsburgh has largely been regarded as a success story, bouncing back from the rust belt region’s economic devastation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clearly something U of M is focused on for the Ann Arbor/Detroit regions. And Ford’s model will likely prove an increasingly popular one, as corporations look to research facilities for bleeding-edge technologies, while universities look for funding beyond the traditional endowment model (something which, granted, has worked for a university named for two of America’s most powerful industrialists).</p>
<p>As Johnson-Roberson tells TechCrunch:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>So many of the technologies that were developed in the 90s and 00s are now reaching a level of maturity where they are getting rolled out in commercial products and making a big difference to the future of a lot of industries. I think it’s a natural extension of that. You begin to see relationships between universities and companies. Even if you look at Pittsburgh as a city, the transformation that it’s undergone from heavy industry focused around natural resources and steel, that transformation is only going to accelerate.</p>
<p>Part of my goal is to continue relations and build new ones. Beyond just industries, thinking about government and policy and all the other things that are now going to become more relevant for robotics — making sure we make those relationships and build on the strengths of the technical work that already goes on at the institute. That is something I’m particularly excited about.</p></blockquote>

<p>Part of me is hoping the robotics news slows down a bit next week, if only for my nagging FONB (fear of not blogging) while I’m out. It’s not healthy, I know. But there are worse addictions (maybe?). I get the sense things will slow down a bit for American Thanksgiving week, if only because it seems like everyone is rushing to get their news out this week. There’s a LOT to crawl through here.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a pair of acquisitions. As we noted in this column last week, iRobot has been getting aggressive about smart home. That’s largely meant things like Amazon Alexa integration up to now, but today’s news marks an interesting new angle. The Roomba maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/irobot-is-buying-air-purifier-maker-aeris/">purchased a Swiss company that makes air purifiers</a> &#8212; a move it believes can improve its footprint in users&#8217; homes.</p>
<p>CEO Colin Angle says in a release:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s acquisition of Aeris is an important step in iRobot’s strategy to expand our total addressable market and diversify our product portfolio in ways that will provide consumers with new ways to keep their homes cleaner and healthier. We are enthusiastic about the growth potential for Aeris’ products, especially as the pandemic has raised greater consumer awareness of the value of maintaining a cleaner, healthier home. We are also excited about the potential to leverage our Genius Home Intelligence platform and existing ecosystem of home robots to bring the iRobot experience to air purification.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/home-star-trucker/">As we noted last week</a>, most of iRobot’s biggest non-Roomba successes have come in the form of acquisitions of brands like Braava and Root. So hopefully this will open up some interesting avenues, in terms of having devices that can double as smart home beacons and improve home mapping.</p>

<p>In the agtech space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/fieldin-buys-fellow-agtech-firm-midnight-robotics/">Fieldin has acquired Midnight Robotics</a>. It’s a deal that makes a lot of sense. Fieldin makes technology that allows farms to collect data for accelerating automation, while Midnight’s tech retrofits tractors and other farming machinery with lidar-based sensors.</p>
<p>Here’s Fieldin CEO Boaz Bachar:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past eight years we’ve digitized hundreds of farms and over 10,000 tractors and pieces of farming equipment — more than anyone else in the high-value crop world — and amassed a trove of invaluable data that can offer insights into best practices in farm management. By acquiring Midnight Robotics, we’re helping farmers close the loop from insight to autonomous action, so they know exactly what they need to do and execute it autonomously, all through the same platform.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/autonomous-tractor-maker-monarch-raises-61-million/">Monarch’s tractor</a>, meanwhile, is more of an all-in-one solution. The company just announced a $61 million Series B. Like Fieldin, the company cites pandemic-related job shortages as a driving force in interest around its technology.</p>

<p>From fields to the dinner table, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/nommi-announces-plans-for-rollout-of-its-food-bowl-making-kitchen-robot/">Nommi just announced a distribution deal</a> with C3 (Creating Culinary Communities) that is set to bring up to 1,000 of its robotic food prep kiosks to locations across the country. The deal also brings Iron Chef’s Masaharu Morimoto’s Sa’Moto brand to the machines, which can operate 24/7, unlike even the ironest of human chefs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235415" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235415" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2235415" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235415" class="wp-caption-text">The robot is partially made of plastic, but teams up with Zume to reduce plastics. Excellent work, Judas. <strong>Photo:</strong> ABB</p></div></p>
<p>As hot as robotics are becoming in food, however, there’s probably an even brighter future in sustainable packaging &#8212; because, let’s face it, whatever direction we’re currently headed in isn’t great. In one of the wilder pivots in recent memory, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/zume-kills-plastics/">Zume moved from pizza robots to bio-degradable packaging.</a> The company is, however, returning to robotics (in a sense) courtesy of a new deal with industrial giant ABB to produce its food packaging.</p>
<p>And one final Tiger Global investment before I leave you (it wouldn’t be a robotics roundup without it). The firm<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/17/2336690/0/en/SVT-Robotics-Announces-25-Million-in-Series-A-Funding-Round-Led-by-Tiger-Global.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> just led a $25 million Series A</a> for SVT Robotics. The Virginia-based company is working to develop a “plug-and-play” solution for industrial robotic deployment. Here’s co-founder and CEO A.K. Schultz:</p>
<blockquote><p>The demand for industrial automation is even higher, but industry growth has been limited by capacity to execute. Integrations are typically all custom coded, meaning long development cycles. It’s expensive, and companies wait as much as a year or more for new automation to go live. Solving that problem with the SOFTBOT Platform empowers the market to grow at its full potential.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s it for me this week. Happy Turkey Day to those who celebrate. And don&#8217;t forget to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">sign up for Actuator here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you had &#8220;my shower head needs a small turbine, a Bluetooth connection, an app and a fine-spray mist&#8221; on your 2021 bingo card, congratulations, you win the prize. The prize is knowing that <a href="https://gethai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hai</a> exists &#8212; and this fine news story, which will tell you all about how the company raised $6 million to get all up in your biz. And we&#8217;ll probably have some good, clean fun &#8212; i.e. shower puns &#8212; thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p><em>A propos</em> good measure, that, in a nutshell, is kind of the point of Hai. The founders claim that your daily de-grimification routine is one of the biggest users of water in a residential context. A lot of people care about the environment, but how do you know how much water you actually blast through on your way to a haven of godliness-adjacency? The answer is some really expensive electronics, or this (possibly equally expensive) $250 shower head. Hai is designed to be easy to install and remove using just your hands. Aimed in particular at apartment-dwellers who want &#8220;a spa-like shower experience&#8221; that they can take with them as they nomad their way from apartment to apartment, the Hai shower head is somewhat of a platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;During my 20s I moved to a new apartment every year. One of the things that I looked at every time I moved was the shower. I&#8217;m quite tall, and it was very important for me to have a shower that was tall enough &#8212; and the pressure was obviously important,&#8221; Leah Stigile, co-founder and CEO of Hai reminisced. &#8220;I&#8217;m a mom to two small children, and the time that I get in the shower every day is crucially important to my personal well-being. As I talked to other people, I realized the ritual of showering is super important to other people as well, but for a whole variety of different reasons. I was inspired to be a part of building a company that delivered an amazing experience but also helps you be mindful of the resources that you&#8217;re using.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236180" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It appears that a gaggle of investors agree with the Hai team that this is a space worth exploring in more depth. <a href="https://trousdalevc.com/">Trousdale Ventures</a> led the $6 million round, and is joined by Will Smith’s <a href="https://www.dreamers.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreamers VC</a>, <a href="https://www.arodcorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A-Rod Corp</a>, The <a href="https://najafi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Najafi Companies</a> (owners of the Phoenix Suns and McLaren F1), Amity Supply (Jesse Derris), social media stars Josh Richards and Griffin Johnson, Noah Beck’s Animal Capital (Marshall Sandman), former board member and early investor in Peloton, Howard Draft and Local Globe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We invested in Hai because they have created an innovative, high-quality showerhead that meets consumer demand for sustainable home products,&#8221; said Phillip Sarofim, founder of Trousdale Ventures. &#8220;We believe that Hai delivers the best shower experience as consumers continue to shift toward personalized and environmentally conscious products.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are looking at a $9 billion market. In my calculation when you look at the size of the space, there&#8217;s room for five or six big new entrants in this market. The interesting thing is that the $9 billion has been carved out by the same five companies for the last 75 years. What is interesting is that brand was almost irrelevant in the space,&#8221; explains Leonard Brody, co-founder of Hai. &#8220;More than <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">85% of millennials said the shower was the most important self-care ritual in their home, but the vast majority of them couldn&#8217;t tell you the brand of shower head they stood under every day. That is highly unusual in a consumer space. I bet you 60% of the same people could tell you what toilet paper brand they use.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236262" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PXL_20211117_220023699.MOTION-01.COVER_.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236262" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2236262" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PXL_20211117_220023699.MOTION-01.COVER_.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PXL_20211117_220023699.MOTION-01.COVER_.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PXL_20211117_220023699.MOTION-01.COVER_.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PXL_20211117_220023699.MOTION-01.COVER_.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PXL_20211117_220023699.MOTION-01.COVER_.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PXL_20211117_220023699.MOTION-01.COVER_.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PXL_20211117_220023699.MOTION-01.COVER_.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PXL_20211117_220023699.MOTION-01.COVER_.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2236262" class="wp-caption-text">Hai&#8217;s shower head was super easy to install &#8212; taking the old shower head off took longer than installing the new one. Best of all: No leaks and no tools required. Photo by Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So, with a huge market and no clear winner, we&#8217;ve seen a number of new companies enter the fray. It seems like the newest dribble of companies started with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nebia/nebia-shower-better-experience-70-less-water" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter darling Nebia pre-selling $3 million of fine-misting shower heads</a> back in 2015, before <a href="https://www.moen.com/press-room/press-releases/nebia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising investment from</a>, and later getting swallowed up by, bathroom giant Moen.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the largest wastes of water in the shower is actually when you flip on the water and you wander away and are busy while you&#8217;re waiting for it to warm. The shower is running and before you know it you&#8217;ve done three loads of laundry. We&#8217;ve developed a little hydropower Bluetooth turbine and it does a couple of things. First of all, it powers the LED light on the shower that will notify you when the water is warm and ready to get in. Also, if you&#8217;ve wandered away, it&#8217;ll send you a push notification to your phone,&#8221; explains Brody. &#8220;Secondly, with a partner app that we developed, it will you can set the number of gallons of water that you want to use during your shower. The average shower is about 20 gallons of water. You can configure that, of course, but our product default is set to 20 gallons. When you hit that limit, a little light will notify you, reminding you to wrap up and hop out of the shower.&#8221;</p>
<p>The device tracks your water consumption over time, which takes care of one of the first challenges of awareness; namely, awareness. The company suggests that by measuring your baseline and then setting goals for yourself, you can do your bit for the environment and use a bit less water. The company also wants to use the data it gathers to make the shower experience more custom.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next step on the roadmap for us that&#8217;s coming in early 2022, we are taking our product and adding a layer of consumables. First up, we have what we&#8217;re calling infusions. We&#8217;ve developed a single-use no-waste pill that can be added to a capsule that fits onto the existing showerhead,&#8221; explains Stigile. &#8220;You can infuse aromatherapy or hair and skin treatments directly into the water. That really helps deliver that spa experience that we are trying to create in your home bathroom. And then the next step beyond that is filtration. With the sensors we have, we can actually be quite sophisticated about telling you what&#8217;s in your water delivering, a very personalized experience. We can even take the temperature you like to shower at into consideration and recommend the consumables that are best for your particular use case. That&#8217;s a huge opportunity there for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company only started shipping its products a few weeks ago, but so far they&#8217;re off to a <em>lather</em> good start, with promising sales through its direct channels and retail presence <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/hai-4-spray-bluetooth-enabled-handheld-showerhead/5655910" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond website</a> and its New York flagship store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">California Pizza Kitchen has revealed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-breach/">data breach</a> that exposed the Social Security numbers of over a hundred thousand current and former employees.</p>
<p>The U.S. pizza chain, which has more than 250 locations across 32 states, confirmed the incident in a data breach notification posted this week. The company said it learned of a “disruption” to its systems on September 15 and moved to “immediately secure” its environment. By October 4, the company said it had determined cybercriminals had infiltrated its systems and gained obtained access to certain files, including employee names and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/social-security/">SSNs</a>.</p>
<p>While CPK didn&#8217;t confirm how many people are impacted by the breach, <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/ea812f00-c605-4b8e-a6e2-9dd53169b256.shtml">a notification from the Maine attorney general&#8217;s office</a> reported a total of 103,767 current and former employees — including eight Maine residents — are affected. CPK employed around 14,000 people as of 2017, suggesting the bulk of those affected are former employees. (TechCrunch contacted CPK for more but did not immediately hear back.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236522" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Information security is among our highest priorities, and we have strict security measures in place to protect information in our care,” CPK added. “Upon discovering this incident, we immediately took steps to review and reinforce the security of our computing environment. We are reviewing existing security policies and have implemented additional measures to further protect against similar incidents moving forward.”</p>
<p>However, while CPK is shoring up its security in light of the incident, it&#8217;s unclear why it took the company two months to notify state authorities of the intrusion. The company said its data breach notification “has not been delayed by law enforcement.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As machine learning becomes a more integral part of running businesses, the model-building process still requires iteration and experimentation. <a href="http://comet.ml">Comet</a> has created an entire platform to get models from idea to product, and today the company announced a $50 million Series B.</p>
<p>The investment comes on the heels of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/comet-announces-13m-series-a-for-ml-model-building-tool/">$13 million A round</a> in April.</p>
<p>OpenView led the round with participation from existing investors Scale Venture Partners, Trilogy Equity Partners and Two Sigma Ventures. The company has now raised almost $70 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236494" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Gideon Mendels said that the product works on any platform from a laptop to the cloud to an on-prem cluster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comet is a platform that empowers data scientists and machine learning engineers to accelerate machine learning development, and the way we do that is by managing and optimizing the entire machine learning lifecycle, so all the way from experiment tracking to model production monitoring,&#8221; Mendels told me.</p>
<p>He said that the approach has been working: The company&#8217;s annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew 5x this year, and Comet now counts 150 businesses using the platform, including Uber, Zappos and Etsy.</p>
<p>Mackey Craven, partner at lead investor OpenView, said that he was attracted to Comet because he sees it as a startup building a viable product for an emerging market with a big opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we see that rare combination of an exceptional founding team that can be the core of a large and enduring market opportunity that is large enough to support them and then transition in that market, either because it&#8217;s the creation of a new market or [because of] technological dislocation that allows a new entrant to create and capture the value in that market going forward, we step up and we step up big,&#8221; Craven explained.</p>
<p>Today, the company has 50 employees in nine different countries on four continents with plans to reach 100 by next year. Mendels said that diversity and inclusion are a key part of the company&#8217;s value system.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just really a key part of our culture,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have 35% of the team from underrepresented groups today and that continues to be a focus for future hires.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is also launching a new product called Artifacts, a data versioning tool that works in the same way as a document versioning function, letting data scientists track the ways that the data has changed over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Comet Artifacts, essentially when you&#8217;re working on a machine learning pipeline, we automatically version every snapshot of the data. So every time you make a change, we make a version of it,&#8221; Mendels said, adding that this offers a number of advantages, primarily enabling data scientists to see how the data they used to train the model changes over time and compare the training model data to what&#8217;s in the model in production.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The battle between the appetites of European Union Member States&#8217; governments to retain their citizens&#8217; data &#8212; for fuzzy, catch-all &#8216;security&#8217; purposes &#8212; and the region&#8217;s top court, the CJEU, which continues to defend fundamental rights by reiterating that <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">indiscriminate mass surveillance is incompatible with general principles of EU law (such as proportionality and respect for privacy) &#8212; has led to another pointed legal critique of national law on bulk data retention.</span></p>
<p>This time it&#8217;s a German data retention law that&#8217;s earned the slap-down &#8212; via a CJEU referral which joins a couple of cases, involving ISPs SpaceNet and Telekom Deutschland which are <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">challenging the obligation to store their customers’ telecommunications traffic data.</span></p>
<p>The court&#8217;s judgement is still pending but an influential opinion put out today by an advisor to the CJEU takes the view that general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data can only be permitted exceptionally &#8212; in relation to a threat to national security &#8212; and nor can data be retained permanently.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236466" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In a press release announcing the opinion of advocate general Manuel Campos Sánchez-Bordona, the court writes that the AG &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">considers that the answers to all the questions referred are already in the Court’s case-law or can be inferred from them without difficulty&#8221;; going on to set out his view that the German law&#8217;s &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">general and indiscriminate storage obligation&#8221; &#8212; which covers &#8220;a very wide range of traffic and location data&#8221; &#8212; cannot be reconciled with EU law by a time limit imposed on storage as data is being sucked up in bulk, not in a targeted fashion (i.e. for a specific national security purpose). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The AG notes that indiscriminate bulk collection generates a</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;serious risk&#8221; &#8212; such as the people&#8217;s data might leak or be improperly accessed. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And reiterates that it</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> also entails a &#8220;serious interference&#8221; with citizens&#8217; fundamental rights to private and family life and the protection of personal data.</span></p>
<p>While the opinion is not legally binding, CJEU rulings tend to align with its advisors. But it will be months more before a final ruling on this particular challenge is issued.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The CJEU ruled on a similar case <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">over a year ago</a> &#8212; involving legal challenges brought by a couple of digital rights groups to national bulk data collection and retention regimes operating under UK and French law &#8212; when the court ruled that only limited data collection and temporary retention was permissible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>(Although France has since been seeking to circumvent the judgement, per <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-data-retention-bypass-eu-top-court/">Politico</a> &#8212; which reported back in March that the government had asked its highest administrative court not to follow the ruling.)</p>
<p>In a landmark ruling back in 2014 the CJEU struck down a 2006 EU directive that had been intended to harmonize data retention rules across the bloc &#8212; finding the regime had constituted a disproportionate interference with citizens&#8217; rights. So you&#8217;d think Member States would have got the message by now.</p>
<p>However it seems unlikely this legal clash will be put to bed any time soon &#8212; not least because there are fresh moves afoot by national governments to revive a pan-EU data retention law, per a <a href="https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/07/wk07294.en211.pdf">leaked discussion paper</a> that <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2021/urgently-needed-france-spain-push-for-new-eu-data-retention-law/">Netzpolitik</a> obtained and reported on this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This summer, Netflix <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/introducing-netflix-shop">launched</a> its own shopping <a href="https://www.netflix.shop/">site</a> that allowed fans to purchase apparel, accessories and other lifestyle products from their favorite shows, like &#8220;Stranger Things.&#8221; Now, Hulu is doing the same thing. The Disney-owned streamer announced the launch of <a href="https://shop.hulu.com/">Shop Hulu</a>, which will feature limited-edition collections of apparel and lifestyle products from Hulu Originals and other titles in the company&#8217;s on-demand library, as well as Hulu-branded swag. The site will also make Hulu&#8217;s annual release of its &#8220;Ugly Holiday Sweaters&#8221; available for purchase for the first time.</p>
<p>Hulu began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandTV/comments/e5loxg/hulu_is_giving_away_free_christmas_sweaters_in/">giving away</a> its ugly sweaters to random fans as a promotional perk in 2019. The giveaway was popular enough that Hulu turned it into a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIYjW_xh6xL/">sweepstakes</a> event last year, giving everyone a chance to win one of the sweaters, which had then <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/hulu-has-live-sports-and-ugly-holiday-sweaters">featured</a> Hulu shows like &#8220;Little Fires Everywhere,&#8221; &#8220;Shrill,&#8221; &#8220;The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale,&#8221; and others.</p>
<p>Its 2021 selection of holiday sweaters will be available for purchase starting on Tuesday, November 30.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236469" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This year, the lineup includes &#8220;Love, Victor,&#8221; &#8220;Solar Opposites,&#8221; &#8220;The Great,&#8221; &#8220;The Handmaid’s Tale,&#8221; and &#8220;Wu-Tang: An American Saga,&#8221; many of which had proved popular in previous years. However, unlike Netflix &#8212; which invested in its online store as a new arm of its broader retail business &#8212; Hulu&#8217;s leading product line is designed to raise funds for charity. Through December 31, 100% of the purchase price from the sale of the Ugly Holiday Sweater collection, minus taxes and shipping fees, is being donated to Feeding America, says Hulu.</p>
<p>In the fine print, the company notes it&#8217;s capping its donation at 1,000 sweaters, which is $54,950.</p>

<p>Hulu&#8217;s shop will continue to feature other products throughout the year, outside its charitable fundraising initiative for the holidays.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fans of &#8220;Solar Opposites&#8221; will be able to shop apparel, glassware, stickers, and more as the show&#8217;s holiday special premieres on November 22. The collection was designed in collaboration with Executive Producers Mike McMahan, Justin Roiland, and Josh Bycel, the company says.</p>
<p>Also available are household items and apparel from shows like &#8220;The Orville,&#8221; &#8220;Wu-Tang: An American Saga&#8221; (select items from the capsule collection from Mitchell &amp; Ness are available), and themed merchandise from acquired shows like &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy,&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,&#8221; &#8220;American Horror Story,&#8221; and &#8220;What We Do In The Shadows,&#8221; among others.</p>
<p>Hulu will offer shoppers a discount for signing up for its newsletter and plans to make special offers available throughout the year, starting with Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>

UK healthtech investment has risen from just $420m in 2016, an increase of nine times, whilst US investment has increased by 3.4 times. <br />
 <br />
US-based healthtech companies continue to attract the lion’s share of global VC investment, clustered around the Bay Area, New York and Boston. Over the last two years investment has started to become more globally distributed, with investment less concentrated around the US and China, said the research findings released by Dealroom.co for London &amp; Partners.</p>
<p>UK healthtech growth has traditionally been driven by the so-called “Golden Triangle” of London, Oxford and Cambridge, a region home to five universities in the top 25 for life sciences and medicine.</p>
<p>Europe is now the fastest-growing region globally for healthtech according to the findings, with European healthtech startups raising $8.1B in 2021, up from $1.7B in 2016 and growing at a rate of 4.9 times (compared to North America at 3.5x and Asia 3.7x).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236504" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin, Texas, is becoming the new home for large companies (Tesla), investors and startups alike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is now also the new home for Tim Draper’s newest initiative to help support early-stage founders: Draper Startup House Accelerator Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backed by Draper, of course, the program will launch in April 2022. As founder of the famed Silicon Valley venture capital firm known as Draper Fisher Jurvetson, or DFJ, Draper in 2018 introduced the Startup House </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">concept. Today, there are more than 15 locations globally that are either hostels and/or co-working spaces aimed at traveling startup founders, digital nomads and other remote workers. Locations include Bali, Indonesia; Bangalore, India; and Valencia, Spain, among others. Besides Austin, the only other site in the U.S. is located in San Mateo, California, but that is a co-living space inside of Draper University.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236247" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This latest effort marks Draper Startup House’s only accelerator program, according to Daniel Wiegand, co-founder and president of DSH Accelerator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DSH will hold two cohorts in 2022 &#8212; both in Austin, consisting of 10 startup teams from around the world. The first cohort will take place in April and the second in August. As part of the program, DSH will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">invest up to $100,000 in pre-seed startups.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each cohort will last three months, take place two times per year and be located in Austin in 2022 and across the globe in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will not be your typical accelerator, but in addition to standard practices such as investment from the newly raised Draper Startup House Accelerator Fund, mentors, workshops and a demo day, DSH plans to incorporate a strong leadership building component as well as unique activities that will test the founders’ grit, creativity and push them outside of their comfort zone,” Wiegand said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be a mix of Draper University and a typical accelerator, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program will feature “unconventional twists to the standard accelerator model,” Wiegand told TechCrunch, and will be focused on early-stage deals across all industries. While the accelerator will accept applications from startups all over the world, the hope is that many of the startups will decide to continue their growth from Austin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups will be required to live together for the entirety of the program, dedicating the three months entirely to building their business. Interested entrepreneurs, founders or startups that want to learn more or apply to be in either cohort can fill out the application </span><a href="http://dshaccelerator.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We look for really great founders who are building big companies and have huge ideas,” Wiegand told TechCrunch. “It&#8217;s really all about the founder, which is why through the program, we will do a lot of leadership training to see if they are founders that are poised to take their company to where they want to take it.”</span></p>
<div class="gmail_default">DSH has also decided to add a co-living option for entrepreneurs who want to live in the house amongst the portfolio companies and participate in the programming, which is a paid program. They can get a single room for $2,500 a month or a shared bunk room for $900/month.</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, Draper’s intent was to launch its first U.S. location in Austin at SXSW as a hostel for entrepreneurs. The vision was to create a landing pad for entrepreneurs and startups traveling to Austin to get familiar with the local startup scene as well as the greater Draper network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then the COVID-19 pandemic led to SXSW being canceled and the city essentially shutting down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing that the pandemic would present extreme challenges, founders Katie Russel and Wiegand quickly pivoted to turn what was to be a hostel into a flexible coworking space for startups and entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 18 months or so, Draper Startup House helped facilitate funding rounds for multiple Austin startups such as CoachTube, Mentor Method and Tabella.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw the talent in Austin, as well as inquiries from startups across the globe looking to enter the U.S. and talent-rich Austin ecosystem,” Wiegand said. “We wanted a way to really hone in and double down on the startups we saw great potential in. As Katie and I grappled with how to do this, it became clearer and clearer that a pop-up accelerator was the right path forward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model is designed to eventually allow DSH to reach even more startups all over the world. While the accelerator will continue to have at least one cohort located in Austin, DSH Accelerator plans on moving the second cohort to a new destination each year. Future plans consist of programs emerging in multiple cities simultaneously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wiegand and Russel intentionally advocated to locate the accelerator somewhere other than in Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ve been working for four or five years in Silicon Valley. We&#8217;ve seen all the great opportunities and tools and resources that are here, but it&#8217;s just not accessible to everyone,” Wiegand explained. “It’s very expensive in Silicon Valley, especially for a startup that is bootstrapping. So what we pitched to him [Draper] was ‘hey, let us take this ecosystem and this brand that you&#8217;ve built over the last 20-30 years, and let us bundle up everything you have in San Mateo and spread it across the globe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Draper said in a statement: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are very excited about how the Draper Startup Houses around the world</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are becoming beacons for entrepreneurs everywhere. The DSH Accelerator, based in Austin,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will take advantage of the amazing startup environment in Austin and bring more activity to the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Draper Ecosystem.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DSH will be conducting a month-long pilot in January.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fora is one of the latest startups seeing venture capital attraction to push more of the travel industry into the digital age and tapping into the creator economy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel is back, at least according to experts who say <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/14/1054878036/thanksgiving-travel-airlines-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travel bookings for over the Thanksgiving holiday</a> are showing to be even higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Anyone who loves travel or is that friend who always plans the best vacations, <a href="https://www.foratravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fora</a> has a tool for you. The company was co-founded by onefinestay’s Evan Frank, Virtuoso agency owner Henley Vazquez and entrepreneur Jake Peters, to redefine what we think of the travel agency and enable people who want to sell travel as a career, or in their spare time, a way to do it.</p>
<p>Frank and Vazquez had known each other for five years when the idea for Fora came up.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236066" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We always talked about doing something together, but this past March, we connected again,” Vazquez said. “I was in Costa Rica and talking about opportunities for women sitting on sidelines due to the pandemic and looking for interesting work. Content creators are circulating around the travel world, and we saw a big opportunity for technology to modernize the industry.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bplans.com/travel-agency-upscale-business-plan/market-analysis-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travel agencies are a $100 billion market in the U.S.</a>, but it is still largely one that works with fax machines and phone calls. Fora is one of the latest startups seeing venture capital attraction to push more of the travel industry into the digital age and <a href="https://skift.com/2021/06/28/travels-creator-economy-is-poised-for-next-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tapping into the creator economy</a>. Another is Thatch, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/thatch-using-3m-round-to-put-travel-creators-on-the-map/">took in $3 million</a> in August to enable travel creators to monetize their recommendations.</p>
<p>However, Fora has a unique approach compared to some of its competitors: It is actually teaching people to sell travel through training sessions, content authoring tools and negotiated rates at the world’s top hotels.</p>
<p>“A lot of companies sell content or expertise, but we saw a bigger opportunity to empower more people to sell travel,” Frank said. “The booking of travel without a system or knowledge is janky and hard. We are focused on tooling to help our advisors be successful themselves.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since its soft launch in August, Fora has already booked $2 million in travel, and today, the company announced $5 million in a seed round. It was led by Forerunner Ventures with participation from Heartcore Capital, Uncommon Capital and individual investors, including Katrina Lake, Gokul Rajaram, Ran Makavy and Ben Rubin.</p>
<p>The company decided to go after venture capital to help build out its technology more quickly. Fora plans to use the new investment to onboard new advisors, product development and go-to-market. Its advisor waitlist has grown to more than 2,000 people, and the company will also spend the time onboarding and training them over the next few months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brian O’Malley, general partner at Forerunner Ventures, said that his firm was looking at the creator space and found that what will make Fora successful is having the advisor with a circle of friends and a passion for travel.</p>
<p>“In our eyes, that fits the entrepreneur next store versus the person on Instagram getting free stuff,” he added. “The cost of customer acquisition is skyrocketing, and Fora is coming in as a ‘Trojan horse’ by getting networks that already existed. It’s also a next-generation platform that is getting people back into the workforce.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Starbucks has teamed up with Amazon to <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2021/starbucks-pickup-and-amazon-go-collaborate-to-launch-new-store-concept-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">open a cashierless store</a> in NYC. The new location — at 59th Street between Park &amp; Lexington Avenues — will combine the Starbucks app&#8217;s order ahead feature with Amazon&#8217;s Just Walk Out technology. In fact, the store sounds a like a cross between the cafe and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-amazon-big-go-grocery-store-seattle-cashless.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Amazon Go</a> store, which served as the launching pad for the e-commerce giant&#8217;s cashierless tech experience.</p>
<p>It has a lounge area customers can enter by using the &#8220;In-Store Code&#8221; in the Amazon Shopping app, by scanning their credit cards or by scanning their palm registered with Amazon One on the terminals onsite. Once they&#8217;re in, they&#8217;ll find a small Amazon Go market containing a curated selection of customer favorites from both companies. Anything they take from the shelf will be added to their virtual carts, and they will be charged after they leave like in any other location that uses Amazon&#8217;s Just Walk Out tech.</p>
<p>Over the past year-and-a-half, Amazon has expanded the availability of its cashierless technology. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-11-amazon-just-walk-out-cashier-less-newark.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">teamed up</a> with airport stores to implement the check-out free experience and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fresh-just-walk-out-technology-washington-114044465.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">opened</a> the first full-size Fresh grocery store with the technology in June. Amazon also added the technology to a few <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-just-walk-out-tech-comes-to-two-whole-foods-stores-101036042.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Whole Foods</a> locations and, more recently, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sainsburys-amazon-just-walk-out-shopping-store-151027993.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">licensed</a> it for use to UK supermarket chain Sainsbury&#8217;s. This partnership with Starbucks is yet another step towards making Just Walk Out more ubiquitous than before.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236475" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Starbucks and Amazon are planning to open three joint stores in the coming year, including this one. The second location is planned for The New York Times Building located at 40th Street &amp; 8th Avenue. For now, New Yorkers can head to the first location at 59th Street to check out the concept.</p>

And Sweetgreen <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001477815/000119312521332761/d263540ds1mef.htm">sold 500,000 more shares</a> in its IPO than its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001477815/000119312521331589/d104360ds1a.htm">final S-1/A filing indicated</a>.</p>
<p>Given that investors made a larger, more expensive bet on Sweetgreen than we might have anticipated, there&#8217;s work to do.</p>

Then we&#8217;ll dig into Sweetgreen&#8217;s final IPO revenue multiple to understand how investors are truly valuing the company. From there, we&#8217;ll see if the company&#8217;s valuation squares up with what we&#8217;ve seen from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/sweetgreens-ipo-pricing-guidance-illuminates-valuation-range-for-tech-enabled-companies/">other recent technology-enabled IPOs</a>.</p>
<p>Why are we paying attention to Sweetgreen? Because it started raising external capital in the mid-aughts and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/sweetgreen-series-i--77f42f82">kept at it through a Series I in 2019</a>. More simply, a host of private investors, including venture capitalists, bet on Sweetgreen. So, we care.</p>
<h2>Sweetgreen&#8217;s IPO valuation</h2>
<p>Before it added 500,000 shares to its IPO &#8212; 575,000 if we include 75,000 shares placed into its underwriters&#8217; option pool &#8212; Sweetgreen expected that it would have 106,311,529 shares outstanding after its IPO. That figure rises to 108,761,529 shares if we count the additional equity sold and the full total of shares reserved for underwriters.</p>
<p>At that new share count at $28 per share, Sweetgreen is worth $3.05 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a YouTube star &#8212; honestly, it&#8217;s not impossible, given that now, <a href="https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/how-many-youtube-channels-have-over-1-million-subscribers-56881000f35a">some estimate</a> that over 20,000 YouTubers have at least 1 million subscribers. You&#8217;re going to monetize through YouTube ads, probably, but you might also sell merch, run a Patreon membership, or write a subscription-only newsletter. More and more startups like <a href="https://fourthwall.com/">Fourthwall</a> are emerging to help creators consolidate their various income streams within one all-in-one creator platform, aiming to take away some of the backend administrative stress of running your own business. The goal is to give creators more time to focus on creating.</p>
<p>Fourthwall announced today that it raised $17 million from investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Initialized Capital, and Alexis Ohanian’s <a href="https://sevensevensix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sevensevensix.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637187227892000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ITwtgeqW5bLC-wJv_hh0F">Seven Seven Six</a>. Like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/08/patronage-empire/">Memberful</a>, a subsidiary of Patreon, Fourthwall offers a white-label website with built-in tools for setting up merch stores, membership programs, tipping and more. When fans buy something, there&#8217;s an integrated Cameo-like feature that lets creators send personalized video and audio messages as a thank you. Fourthwall partners with manufacturers to offer over 200 different types of products that creators can develop to sell through their website, which creators can control down to the code itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We genuinely think Fourthwall is ready to really materially help creators succeed in this area, so they&#8217;re able to focus more thoroughly on the content and community side,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Will Baumann told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235751" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Still, creators are often skeptical of all-in-one solutions. Especially when the future of any given startup can look so uncertain, creators are encouraged to diversify their income streams. We saw this most recently with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content/">almost-ban</a> of adult content on Only Fans &#8212; if the ban was enacted, creators would have had to start from zero, since they wouldn&#8217;t have had any way to contact their existing subscriber list (some platforms like Substack and Patreon give creators access at the get-go to their subscribers&#8217; emails). Even among safe-for-work creators, what happens if a microinfluencer gets locked out of their Instagram account? Even <a href="https://medium.com/@shessomickey/3-lessons-for-podcasters-from-someone-who-lived-through-youtubes-buyout-1beacbcfbcb">acquisitions</a> like Google&#8217;s purchase of YouTube or Spotify&#8217;s absorption of Anchor and Gimlet can drastically change a creator&#8217;s payouts from those platforms.</p>
<p>Fourthwall told TechCrunch that it has three months of emergency operating expenses set aside to ensure that if they were to fail, they could help transition creators to other platforms. The company said it would also make its platform open source if this were to happen. Fourthwall expects to be in business for a long time, but these contingency plans are necessary for creators who are gambling their livelihoods with emerging startups.</p>

<p>To onboard onto Fourthwall, creators have to <a href="https://fourthwall.com/request-an-invite/">request an invite</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Nobody gets rejected. This is just sort of our gating function to make sure we&#8217;re actually getting creators in the platform, as opposed to spam entries,&#8221; Baumann said. &#8220;Fourthwall is designed for anybody that has a community and wants to connect with that community and grow that community, and hopefully, make money off of the platform as things scale up.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no fee to join Fourthwall, but the platform takes 5% of creator earnings, plus a standard credit card processing fee of 2.9% plus $0.30 on all transactions. For creators producing merchandise through Fourthwall&#8217;s manufacturers, there are additional costs involved.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the funding announcement, Fourthwall is also revealing its new Chief Creative Officer, Phil DeFranco, a YouTuber with over six million subscribers who has been making videos for over fifteen years. DeFranco started out using Fourthwall about a year and a half ago and said that his merchandise revenue increased tenfold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil&#8217;s number one focus is just making sure that the types of work that we&#8217;re building and shipping to other creators like him are meeting the bar and basically are able to solve their problems,&#8221; Baumann said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really to make sure that we&#8217;re always putting our creators first. That&#8217;s our focus: creator ownership, creator brand and greater control.&#8221;</p>
