										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with a more spacious cockpit, more storage and some upgraded cupholders, Audi has packed in some serious new tech into its upcoming all-electric Q4 e-tron compact crossover, including an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">augmented reality head-up display (HUD) that’s reactive enough to accurately stick to a driver’s real environment. </span></p>
<p>Audi revealed Tuesday the interior of the Q4 e-tron, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/audis-new-2022-e-tron-gt-is-a-real-electric-performance-sedan-not-just-another-electrified-crossover/">fifth electric vehicle in its lineup</a> and part of the German automaker&#8217;s plan to launch more than 30 EVs and plug-in hybrids by 2025. The Q4 e-tron has been expected for some time; it was first revealed as a concept at the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show.</p>
<p>The exterior of the production version of the Q4 is still camouflaged, but we know its dimensions. The takeaway: An electric vehicle that fits in the larger compact SUV segment with a short overhang and wheelbase of 9.1 feet — a combination that gives it a rather stout look. However, that allows for an interior of 6 feet in length, the kind of space found in a large full-size class SUV.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The underlying architecture of the vehicle is based on its parent company VW&#8217;s modular electric drive toolkit chassis, or MEB platform. This flexible modular system, first introduced by VW in 2016, was developed to make it more efficient and cost-effective to produce a variety of EVs. It has also given designers more room to play with thanks to the flat floor. And they took advantage of that space, popping in a center console with two cup holders, a 4.4-liter stowage compartment with a cover, two (or four as an option) USB-C sockets and the Audi phone box (which charges wirelessly and boosts your phone&#8217;s signal) upon request.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123276" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123276" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2123276" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg 3508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123276" class="wp-caption-text">Head-up-Display. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Audi</p></div></p>
<p>The real story here is the tech — and most notably an option to add an AR-enabled windshield. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The AR windshield provides a wider field of view and more accurate and dynamic animations versus a standard windshield HUD. The Q4 e-tron will break down important displayed information via two sections: one for status and one for AR. The former, appearing about 3 meters ahead of the driver, will display the driving speed, traffic signs, the assist system and navigation symbols as static displays. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the AR section, the driver will perceive the floating symbols to be about 10 meters away. That&#8217;ll display information like lane departure warnings that superimpose a red line on the real-life lane marking and a colored stripe over an active car driving in front when in adaptive cruise control.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Head-up displays aren&#8217;t new,&#8221; states Audi. &#8220;This just takes the field of vision farther out so it enables more active use.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AR will also display navigation information. Audi calls the turning arrows “drones,” probably because the arrows fly ahead when driving straight and then disappear, reappearing before the next point of action. When the driver approaches an intersection, the drone announces the turn before steering the driver onto the road with precision.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123277" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123277" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2123277" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg 3508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123277" class="wp-caption-text">Head-up-Display. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Audi</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the software side of things, the Q4 e-tron’s processing unit, called the AR Creator, picks up raw data from the car’s front camera, radar sensor and GPS navigation to render display symbols at a rate of 60 frames per second and adapt them to the surrounding environment. The quality of these displays, shown via a bit of advanced smoke and mirrors on what Audi calls the EV&#8217;s &#8220;picture generation unit (PGU)&#8221; — basically, a lot of mirrors — will obviously be key to how well it works in real life. With only simulations to show for it currently, it’s not clear how well Audi will pull this off. A wider frame with dynamic symbols must deliver on its promise to show up “just as clearly as their real-life environment” otherwise they’ll become a hindrance to the driver, and if they don&#8217;t pull off the depth effect exactly, they could even cause driver discomfort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Q4 e-tron also features updated natural-language voice control, activated by saying “Hey Audi.” The new car will also ditch physical buttons on the steering wheel in favor of touch-sensitive ones. But with a haptic feedback loop, it’ll still feel somewhat like you’re pressing a button. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://insideevs.com/news/465756/2020-audi-etron-electric-car-sales/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 3% of the company’s sales in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or 47,000 vehicles, were the electric e-tron SUV and the e-tron Sportback, a number that will surely increase as the company continues to roll out luxury EVs. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mobilecoin.com/">MobileCoin</a>, a cryptocurrency that has received technical guidance from Moxie Marlinspike, the creator of private messaging app Signal, has raised $11.35 million in fresh venture funding across two rounds from Future Ventures and General Catalyst.</p>
<p>The round, shared with us by a source familiar with the company, seems to suggest the cryptocurrency is one step closer to its possible use on the Signal platform, where it does not appear to be available currently.</p>
<p>We were unable to reach Marlinspike today. MobileCoin founder Joshua Goldbard, who lists himself as &#8220;janitor&#8221; of MobileCoin on LinkedIn, declined to answer questions this afternoon after being reached on Signal. Investors pointed us back to the company when asked about how MobileCoin compares to other crypto-related outfits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was back in 2017 that Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/">first profiled</a> MobileCoin, describing it as on a mission to overcome many of the early, and in some cases, lingering, challenges with cryptocurrencies, including that they&#8217;re too complicated for most people and merchants to use, they aren&#8217;t adequately scalable and transaction times take too long.</p>
<p>For example, Dapper Labs, the company behind the ventures CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot, developed its own blockchain and &#8220;Flow&#8221; token last year owing to scalability issues it encountered with Ethereum, as well as its interest in developing a platform that was more &#8220;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/the-team-behind-cryptokitties-is-one-step-closer-to-leaving-ethereum">consumer oriented</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time, Wired noted that while it &#8220;may feel like the last thing the world needs is yet another cryptocurrency&#8221; &#8212; there are now <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/">more than 4,000</a> of them in digital circulation &#8212;  Marlinspike&#8217;s track record with Signal &#8220;makes this a project worth watching.&#8221;</p>
<p>Based on its website, MobileCoin&#8217;s ambition appears to be focused around privacy-protecting payments made through &#8220;near instantaneous transactions&#8221; over one&#8217;s phone, even while the risks involved in storing cryptocurrency on a phone include potentially losing that value if the phone is left unlocked or the radio on the phone is hacked or if, say, iOS itself is hacked. (It happens, despite the robust permissions system that iOS uses to grant apps access to particular services and information.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pLtS6cy5dR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/paypal-to-acquire-cryptocurrency-custody-startup-curv/">PayPal to acquire cryptocurrency security startup Curv</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;PayPal to acquire cryptocurrency security startup Curv&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/paypal-to-acquire-cryptocurrency-custody-startup-curv/embed/#?secret=pLtS6cy5dR" data-secret="pLtS6cy5dR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>According to the site, one feature of MobileCoin is that it allows users to &#8220;securely recover&#8221; their wallet if they lose their phone, though it isn&#8217;t immediately clear how without trusting a provider with private keys, which MobileCoin says isn&#8217;t necessary. (More on this soon, presumably.)</p>
<p>If MobileCoin becomes a de facto way to transact over Signal &#8212; Goldbard and Marlinspike told Wired they envisioned it first as an integration in chat apps like Signal or WhatsApp &#8212; its reach could potentially be massive.</p>
<p>Though Signal doesn&#8217;t disclose how many users are on the platform, an estimated <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/signal-statistics/">40 million people</a> now use its encrypted messaging app, which saw a surge in downloads earlier this year, in the waning days of the Trump presidency. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">According to Sensor Tower, which provides mobile app analytics, Signal was downloaded 17.8 million times during the week of January 5, compared to the 50,000 downloads per day it typically sees.</span></p>
<p>Still, if heavy use over Signal is how MobileCoin aims to gain value, the currency &#8212; which became <a href="https://ftx.com/trade/MOB/USD">available</a> to purchase on the exchange FTX after launching on the platform in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/mobilecoin-mainnet-launch-ftx-trading">early December</a> &#8212; would seemingly have an upward battle.</p>
<p>While Marlinspike&#8217;s early involvement is a definite plus, cryptocurrencies and messaging apps haven&#8217;t historically mixed well together, owing to regulators. Kik Messenger, the mobile messaging app founded by a group of University of Waterloo students in 2009, created a digital currency called Kin for its users to spend inside the platform. The project ultimately led to a years-long battle with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission that nearly decimated the company, though it&#8217;s currently mounting a comeback.</p>
<p>(In fairness to MobileCoin, which has turned to venture capitalists, Kik tried raising money from Kin through an initial coin offering or ICO, a relatively untested and unregulated type of funding mechanism at the time.)</p>
<p>Telegram, a much bigger messaging app than Signal &#8212; it had an estimated 400 million users as of last April &#8212; similarly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256407/telegram-cryptocurrency-shutdown-sec-gram">abandoned plans</a> to offer its own decentralized cryptocurrency to anyone with a smartphone after years of battling with the SEC. Like Kik, part of Telegram&#8217;s drama dated to early sales of its tokens through ICOs.</p>
<p>Even Facebook, despite scaling back more ambitious plans around a new cryptocurrency and resolving instead to launch a single digital coin backed by the dollar, hasn&#8217;t launched anything yet, though it&#8217;s expected soon.</p>
<div id="node-0" class="article-pharagraph">
<p class="text">Possibly, MobileCoin simply plans to operate outside of the U.S. Indeed, in December, according to a public post on Medium, the MobileCoin Foundation <a href="https://mobilecoinfoundation.medium.com/mobilecoin-main-net-8e355d82c726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote </a>that the project is not available to U.S. users or “persons or entities in other prohibited jurisdictions.”</p>
<p>Either way, the new round is not, notably, MobileCoin&#8217;s first outside round. In May 2018, it disclosed in an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739466/000173946618000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filing</a> that it had raised a $29.7 million from investors. Reportedly, Binance Labs, the venture arm of the cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance, <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/binance-labs-leads-30-million-fundraising-mobilecoin/">led that financing</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Earth Fund will invest in scientists, NGOs, activists, and the private sector to help drive new technologies, investments, policy change and behavior. We will emphasize social justice, as climate change disproportionately hurts poor and marginalized communities,&#8221; Steer wrote.</p>
<p>With a $100 million award <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/16/jeff-bezos-names-first-recipients-of-his-10-billion-earth-fund.html">from the first rounds of grants</a> the Bezos Fund issued in November, the World Resources Institute was one of the largest recipients of Bezos&#8217; largesse. Other big recipients from the first block of grants included the Environmental defense Fund, The Natural Resources Defense Council, The Nature Conservancy and The World Wildlife Fund.</p>

<p>“I feel incredibly fortunate to join the Bezos Earth Fund as its CEO, where I will focus on driving systemic change to address the climate and nature crises, with a focus on people. Too many of the most creative initiatives suffer for a lack of finance, risk management or the right partnerships. This is where the Earth Fund will be helpful,” Steer said in a statement issued by the WRI.</p>

<p>While at the WRI, Steer oversaw its international expansion from an advocacy organization centered primarily in Washington to a global organization with offices in Indonesia, the UK and Colombia along with hubs in Ethiopia and the Netherlands. Steer also expanded the offices in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and Mexico.</p>
<p>His tenure also involved creating coalitions and initiatives that changed the understanding around the economics of climate change, including the launch of a $10 million annual initiative to support the implementation of climate plans by 100 countries, according to a statement from the WRI.</p>
<p>“The $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund has the potential to be a transformative force for good at this decisive point in history. Andrew’s global reputation, deep technical knowledge and experience, and commitment to social justice make him a perfect leader for the fund,” said Christiana Figueres, co-founder of Global Optimism and former Executive Security of the UNFCCC.</p>

<p>In light of Women’s History Month, we’re taking a look at the status of gender diversity in investment portfolios because women remain underrepresented in the field of entrepreneurship. Let’s delve into the numbers — and why your deal flow may not be diverse enough.</p>
<h2>Women entrepreneurs and fundraising</h2>
<p>There is an unmet need of $260 billion to $320 billion for women-owned company funding, according to a 2013 <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/335791468167041761/pdf/949160WP0Box380cessCreditMSME0Final.pdf">study</a> conducted by the International Finance Corporation. A <a href="https://www.kauffman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sources_of_economic_hope_womens_entrepreneurship.pdf">survey</a> of women from 350 tech startups reinforced this: 72% of women respondents said that they faced difficulty attaining financial capital when they were starting their businesses and nearly 80% of them had to rely on personal funding. Furthermore, women founders receive <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/03/02/female-founders-funding-2019/">less than 3%</a> of all VC dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The stark contrast between the ease of fundraising for men compared to women is apparent. <a href="https://financialallianceforwomen.org/download/access-to-capital-by-high-growth-women-owned-businesses/">Data show that men were four times as likely as women to access equity financing from angel investors or VCs</a> (14.4% against 3.6%). The ease with which men tap into multiple sources for capital explains why they start companies with almost twice the capital of women founders on average.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>

	</div>
	</p>
<h2>So, why is fundraising harder for women-led startups?</h2>
<p>Women’s struggle to attain capital can perhaps be explained by looking into the diversity in fund management firms. Fund managers’ lack of diversity ultimately contributes to the resulting funding inequality when it comes to their portfolios. <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/jh572x5wd4r0/7qRourAWPj0U9R7MN5nWgy/711a6d8344bcd4fbe0f1a6dcf766a3c0/WVC_Report_-_The_Untapped_Potential_of_Women-Led_Funds.pdf">Data from Women in VC</a> show that only 5.6% of U.S. VC firms are women-led and only 4.9% of VC partners in the U.S. are women.</p>
<p>“Empowering women and people of color to drive the investment strategy of venture firms is the fastest and most effective course correction” for the lack of gender-diverse portfolios, the Women in VC report said. “Venture investors have extraordinary power to impact broader society norms. They decide what founders get funded, what businesses stand a chance at success, and what products get brought to market. These things, in turn, exert a determining influence on our culture.”</p>
<p>Investors must address the diversity issue within their ranks first; they must be aware of the existing unconscious bias and take extra actions toward improving their efforts in actively trying to source and invest in women-led startups.</p>

<h2>Why is diverse deal flow important?</h2>
<p>Diversifying an investment portfolio to include more women-led ventures means trusting in the leadership of women, which research has shown to be worth believing in. A 2012 <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-012-1553-6">study</a> of company performance showed that more than 150 listed German firms excelled when they had at least 30% women representation on their executive boards.</p>
<p>Even more interesting, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a7db/04f990334daf8f0c47e587f61055b16518d0.pdf">another study</a> argues that women make better board directors than men. The findings revealed that women are more effective at accounting for multiple competing interests, solving problems creatively and building consensus. By comparison, male directors often made decisions based on rules, regulations and tradition.</p>
<p>Undeniably, companies managed by effective women leaders are set to provide a lucrative return on investment. Roy Adler, a Fulbright scholar and professor of marketing at Pepperdine University, conducted a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267822127_Women_in_the_Executive_Suite_Correlate_to_High_Profits">19-year study</a> that found a correlation between companies with the best record of promoting women to senior positions and higher profitability — between 18% to 69% higher than the median Fortune 500 companies in their respective industries.</p>
<p>While the numbers prove that the financial returns can be promising, the bigger impact and importance of investing in gender diversity is the overall economic growth and prosperity that follows. Increasing opportunities for women entrepreneurs sets off a domino effect that local and global markets can benefit from.</p>
<p>McKinsey estimated that if total gender equality was achieved, the global gross domestic product (GDP) could be increased by up to<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth#:~:text=How%20advancing%20women's%20equality%20can%20add%20%2412%20trillion%20to%20global%20growth,-September%201%2C%202015&amp;text=A%20McKinsey%20Global%20Institute%20report,gaps%20in%20work%20and%20society."> $28 trillion globally by 2025</a>. In fact, by not investing in women, the downsides prove to be quite massive. <a href="https://www.unescap.org/resources/economic-and-social-survey-asia-and-pacific-2007">A study by the United Nations</a> showed that the Asia-Pacific region, including China and the United States, loses at least $42 billion annually in GDP by not fully engaging women’s participation in their economy.</p>
<p><a href="https://seedstars.com/">Seedstars</a>, the Swiss investment holding group that focuses on investing in high-growth tech companies from emerging markets, <a href="https://cares.seedstars.com/the-benefits-of-developing-women-entrepreneurship">provides a more in-depth view</a> of the benefits of developing women entrepreneurship, specifically in developing countries.</p>
<p>The numbers make it evident that gender diversity is underutilized but highly valuable. In Melanne Verveer and Kim K. Azzarelli’s book “Fast Forward,” experts weigh in on the topic of gender inclusivity.</p>
<p>“The biggest destroyer of wealth creation is patriarchy,” Pax World Funds CEO Joseph Keefe said. “It’s not just up to women to ‘lean in.’ Shareholders seeking better returns would do well to lean on companies to appoint and promote more women.”</p>
<p>“Women remain hugely underrepresented at positions of power in every single sector across this country,” Barnard College president Debora Spar noted. “We have fallen into what I call the 16% ghetto, which is that if you look at any sector, be it aerospace engineering, Hollywood films, higher education or Fortune 500 leading positions, women max out at roughly 16%. That is a crime, and it is a waste of incredible talent.”</p>
<h2>Moving gender inclusivity forward</h2>
<p>Taking active measures to ensure that we are fully including women is necessary to make an impact. Since 2018, Seedstars has been actively working on gender equity within its core activities, highlighted in the group&#8217;s theory of change, such as sourcing of ventures, capacity-building programs and investment activities.</p>
<p>To date, Seedstars has supported more than 600 women-led enterprises and invested in 14 businesses co-founded by women. Additionally, Seedstars is working on gender equity when it comes to mentors, jury members and training delivery experts. Recent numbers show that about 30% of all Seedstars program participants are women, a number that Seedstars is proud to have increased over the past years (2018 numbers were more around 20%, depending on the region) and is committed to increasing that figure in the coming years.</p>
<p>Through the combined efforts of our own initiatives and those from investors who do their part in promoting gender diversity, the world is bound to reap the benefits of investing in what is proving to be one of the most powerful demographic groups the world is yet to fully embrace.</p>
<p>Recognizing the issue is the first step to solving any problem. The increase in awareness and action is sure to bring forth important development that makes the future brighter for women entrepreneurs everywhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.mercadolibre.com/">Mercado Libre</a>, one of the largest e-commerce and financial services company from Latin America by market cap, has selected the startup and Y Combinator alumni Pachama as its strategic partner in developing projects to restore ecosystems in Latin America.</p>
<p>The selection of <a href="https://pachama.com/">Pachama</a> is part of a program initiated by Mercado Libre, Latin America&#8217;s answer to Amazon, which is called <a href="https://regeneraamerica.com/">Regenera America</a>. The $8 million that Mercado Libre is investing will be in two reforestation projects: The &#8220;Mantiqueira Conservation Project,&#8221; organized under the auspices of The Nature Conservancy and the &#8220;Corridors of Live Project,&#8221; designed and implemented by the Instituto de Pesquisas Ecologicas.</p>
<p>Both projects will focus on the reforestation of over three thousand hectares, through natural regeneration and planting over 1 million trees, restoring biodiversity corridors and protecting hydrological basins in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, the two companies said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pachama will provide satellite and machine learning technologies to verify and monitor the carbon sequestration produced by the sweeping reforestation efforts in a deal that leapfrogs Mercado Libre ahead of Microsoft as the young startup&#8217;s largest customer.</p>
<p>Software tools provided by Pachama will also increase the efficiency and transparency of the actual reforestation efforts on the ground, the companies said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>The deal between the two companies and Mercado Libre&#8217;s big buy was announced earlier today at a press conference in Argentina and the agreement marks the first time Mercado Libre has tapped money from a recently issued $400 million Sustainability Bond that was designed to finance projects of what the e-commerce giant called &#8220;triple impact&#8221; in the Latin American region. The bond was issued by JP Morgan and BNP Paribas.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re taking our first steps. We have always tried to do things the hard way and go to the core of problems. We have had a very interesting debate internally about when is the right time to start buying carbon offsets and carbon credits but we also realize that the … getting up and running of projects that generate carbon credits in Latin America was potentially even more of a challenging situation and more of a long-term solution,&#8221; said Mercado Libre chief financial officer Pedro Arnt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a building block of a longer-term strategy thinking through not just what we can do for the next two or three years,&#8221; Arnt said. </span></p>
<p>The Regenera America project has four pieces, Arnt said: measuring and reporting emissions internally for the company; buying clean energy for the company&#8217;s operations; providing electric vehicles for its own fleet and assisting its last mile and logistics partners in electrifying their own transportation; and the development of reforestation efforts across Latin America.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is setting up an example for more traditional industries across Latin America,&#8221; said Diego Saez-Gil, the co-founder and chief executive of Pachama. Mercado Libre is the largest company by market cap in Latin America and serves as a standard bearer for the forward-thinking businesses in the region, he said. &#8220;Latin America is one of the biggest holders of biodiversity and carbon stocks in the world and should be playing a more active role in climate mitigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big step for Pachama as well. The deal marks the first time the young company has involved itself in project origination and provides a new revenue stream to complement its existing lines of business.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are incredibly excited to start helping new reforestation projects get off the ground that have the capabilities to plant millions of trees and remove millions of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere. If we are to solve climate change we need more projects like these to start as soon as possible,&#8221; said Saez-Gil in a statement. &#8220;We are confident that technologies such as AI and satellite imagery are key to scaling these efforts with high integrity, efficiency and transparency. Partnering with world-class organizations such as Mercado Libre, The Nature Conservancy and IPE for our first projects represents an incredible opportunity for us.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Introduced in late-2019, the Move was a very Sonos approach to the Bluetooth speaker. It was an attempt to bring the company’s long-standing premium approach to a more portable form factor. Accordingly, the press photos feature a lot of shots of the product on porches and around pools.</p>
<p>Today’s arrival of the Roam, however, takes an even bigger step to full portability, with a smaller, lighter, more ruggedized and waterproof design that puts it more in line with popular offerings from companies like JBL. It’s also priced at a much more palatable $169, more than half the Move’s starting price.</p>

<p>Of course, you can still get plenty of cheaper (and quite good) portable Bluetooth speakers. JBL’s Flip 5, for instance, retails for about $40 less. But what you’re paying for, in part, is the Sonos ecosystem. As such, I suspect the clearest play from the outset here is Sonos’ base. And thankfully, for the company, there are no doubt a lot of Sonos users who have been waiting for a long time for a compatible speaker they can toss in their suitcase &#8212; or, rather, will be able to toss into their suitcases when they use suitcases again.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections, the system utilizes Sonos’ new Sound Swap feature, which switches the music to the next closest speaker when the play/pause button is held down. The speaker works with more than 100 streaming services, per the company’s count, including, of course Sonos Radio. It also can be controlled with Alexa and Google Assistant or via AirPlay 2.</p>

<p>I got all of this information by way of a virtual briefing, as is how business is done these days, so I can’t speak specifically to the sound. That said, I’d imagine it’s a step down from the very good and quite expensive Move. But again, this is a speaker you’re buying specifically with flexibility in mind. On that note, the speaker gets about 10 hours of playback on a charge and can go 10 days when not in use.</p>
<p>The speaker arrives on April 20th.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos&#8217; Blue Origin will be providing NASA with a valuable scientific tool ahead of the U.S. space agency&#8217;s goal of returning to the Moon: The ability to run experiments in simulated lunar gravity much closer to home, in suborbital space.</p>
<p>NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/feature/nasa-blue-origin-to-bring-lunar-gravity-conditions-closer-to-earth.html">revealed</a> that Blue Origin will be modifying its reusable New Shepard sub-orbital launch vehicle to add Moon gravity approximation via rotation of the spacecraft&#8217;s capsule. That&#8217;ll effectively turn it into one big centrifuge, which will mean that objects inside will experience a gravitational force very close to that found on the lunar surface.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like there aren&#8217;t already ways to simulate lunar gravity, but the way that New Shepard will implement its system will provide two benefits that none of these existing methods can match: Longer duration, offering over two minutes of continuous artificial Moon gravity exposure, and larger payload capacity, which will unlock experimental capabilities that are currently impossible just due to space restrictions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Blue Origin anticipates that this new capability for New Shepard will be ready to roll by 2022 – important timing because the whole idea is to help support NASA&#8217;s Artemis program, which is its mission series that will see a return to human Moon exploration, including establishment of a more permanent crewed research presence both in lunar orbit and on the surface.</p>
<p>Gravity on the surface of the Moon is about one-sixth as powerful as that here on Earth. NASA also points out that it will require experimentation not only in preparation for lunar missions, but also to support eventually crewed launches to Mars, which has gravity that&#8217;s just over one-third as strong as it is here.</p>
<p>Blue Origin is also working with NASA on human landers for its lunar missions, through a space industry team-up that includes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://foundation.app/NyanCat/nyan-cat-219">creator of the Nyan Cat</a>, Chris Torres, has organized an informal collection of meme originators &#8211; the creators or original popularizers of meme images &#8212; into a two-week-long auction of their works. Under the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=memeconomy&amp;src=typed_query">#memeconomy</a> the creators of memes like <a href="https://foundation.app/badluckbrian/bad-luck-brian-4263">Bad Luck Brian</a>, <a href="https://foundation.app/IdasCreatures/coughing-cat-4587">Coughing Cat</a>, <a href="https://foundation.app/steveibsen/the-kitty-cat-dance-4567">Kitty Cat Dance</a>, <a href="https://foundation.app/realscumbagsteve">Scumbag Steve</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PRguitarman/status/1368995286434127877">Twerky Pepe</a> and some others are finally finding a way to monetize the creation of genuine cultural phenomenons that have been used freely for decades.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re mostly being hosted on booming new crypto art and collectibles platform Foundation, which launched in February and has <a href="https://fnd.info/">already hosted $6M</a> in sales of over 1,000 NFTs. I have a lot to say about NFTs and can&#8217;t say them all here, but I found this project fascinating and wanted to note it. The fact is that memes are Internet art (sorry). They are unique creations that took elements of participatory and performance art and injected them into the veins of the internet. In many ways, they have millions of creators, as the original editions may have planted the seed but every use and permutation gave them additional strands of DNA, crafting their cultural importance upload by upload. They have let us express ourselves &#8212; our desire, disgust, joy and lust &#8212; when words just wouldn&#8217;t suffice.</p>
<p>These &#8220;originals&#8221; are made original by the act of them being minted on the blockchain by the original artists. I know, it&#8217;s a distinction that may seem slim when the same images can be had anywhere at any time, but that&#8217;s the beauty of the re-organization that is happening within all of DeFi and crypto at the moment. We are stripping out layers of commerce and communication that benefited only platforms and participants that took part in the origination and sale of art from the perspective of frameworks like the DMCA and DRM. Those relationships are being rethought. The recapture of value for works that have already been broadly distributed has been historically relegated to &#8216;licensing them for t-shirts&#8217;. And extremely rarely elevated to the <a href="https://foundation.app/NyanCat/nyan-cat-219">level of fine art sale.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now that we&#8217;re all living on the Internet, Internet art is just art. And so are memes.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s fascinating to see some of the people who have created things that have let so m​any of us express ourselves get paid.</p>
<p>One famous case of this, of course, is the Pepe and its creator Matt Furie. Though Furie&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/sundance-feels-good-man-charts-a-path-of-redemption-for-pepe/">attempts to redeem Pepe</a> have focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/pepe-the-frog-creator-reaches-settlement-over-infowars-usage/">attempting to reclaim</a> him from a legacy of racist and hateful memes, Pepe and his friends are a cool cast of characters and it would be heartening to see Furie reclaim them by minting them himself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spoke a bit to Torres about the project and why he got interested in it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why did you decide to organize this informal schedule of meme NFTs?</strong></p>
<p>Torres: The idea has always kind of been in the back of my mind since discovering the NFT universe. The idea of NFTs were always so attractive to me, a place where you can create your own original art and gain proper attribution for your work. Memes have always had a rough time on the Internet, because their creators are usually taken advantage of, and I have personally seen artists have their works stolen and monetized to the tune of millions of dollars without even proper credit. So the idea has always been down deep in my subconscious but this week things have really amped up enough to finally give me the power I need to make it happen!</p>
<p><strong>TC: How did you get in contact with the creators?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, they all contacted me! It&#8217;s unbelievable knowing I&#8217;m in direct contact with some fantastic iconic internet legends from the past. Some of these have existed solely as enigmas on the Internet, it&#8217;s great connecting with them. Things started with casual conversations with Bad Luck Brian, but then Trollface messaged me, then Me Gusta, then Kitty Cat Dance, then things just kept amping up.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How has it felt to have your creation formally rewarded after spending so long in the cultural meme-ory?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s still very surreal, to be honest. The NFT community is full of very talented people with so many thoughts and ideas on how to build a better future for the crypto space. I&#8217;ve actually used this power for good this week by starting up #Memeconomy with all these talented meme creators and will be trying my hardest to get these guys the recognition they deserve.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What excites you about NFTs and art?</strong></p>
<p>The number one thing that&#8217;s kept me excited for NFTs is just knowing that it&#8217;s a perfect way to empower artists to take ownership of their own works. I&#8217;ve been hanging out in the Clubhouse chats, reading everything I can on Twitter, and just have been losing sleep being so enthralled by it all. Every day I wake up and there&#8217;s a new meta of NFTs out there. It&#8217;s cool to see all this artistic knowledge evolving in real time. I absolutely live off that energy, and it&#8217;s inspired me to be more creative than ever.</p>
<p>The world of NFTs is complex and fascinating and deserves a deeper look that looks at the economic, ecological and technical aspects. We&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/what-the-nft-vc-david-pakman-dumbs-down-the-digital-collectibles-frenzy-and-why-its-taking-off-now/">already hosted</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/explosive-inclusive-potential-nfts/">written about</a> various <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/if-you-havent-followed-nfts-heres-why-you-should-start/">projects in the space</a>.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The introduction of GPT-3 in 2020 was a tipping point for artificial intelligence. In 2021, this technology will power the launch of a thousand new startups and applications. GPT-3 and similar models have brought the power of AI into the hands of those looking to experiment &#8212; and the results have been extraordinary.</p>
<p>Trained on trillions of words, GPT-3 is a 175-billion parameter transformer model — the third of such models released by OpenAI. GPT-3 is remarkable in its ability to generate human-like text and responses &#8212; in some respects, it’s eerie. When prompted by a user with text, GPT-3 can return coherent and topical <a href="https://twitter.com/OthersideAI">emails</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sushant_kumar/status/1283314235842297856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1283314235842297856%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevminator.com%2Fforums%2Ftopic%2Ftweet-generator-gpt-3-openai-api-example%2F">tweets</a>, <a href="https://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html">trivia</a> and much more.</p>

<p>Suddenly, authoring emails, customer interactions, social media exchanges and even news stories can be automated &#8212; at least in part. While large companies are pondering the pitfalls and risks of generating text (remember Microsoft’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/25/microsoft-apologizes-for-hijacked-chatbot-tays-wildly-inappropriate-tweets/">disastrous</a> Tay bot?), startups have already begun sweeping in with novel applications &#8212; and they will continue to lead the charge in transformer-based innovation.</p>
<p>OpenAI researchers first released the paper introducing GPT-3 in May 2020, and what started out as some nifty use cases on Twitter has quickly become a hotbed of startup activity. Companies have been formed on top of GPT-3, using the model to generate emails and marketing copy, to create an interactive nutrition tracker or chatbot, and more. Let OthersideAI take a first pass at writing your emails, or try out Broca or Snazzy for your ad copy and campaign content, for instance.</p>
<p>Other young companies are harnessing the API to accelerate their existing efforts, augmenting their technical teams’ capabilities with the power of 175 billion parameters and quickly bringing otherwise difficult products to market with much greater speed and data than previously possible. With some clever prompt engineering (a combination of an instruction to the model with a sample output to help guide the model), these companies leverage the underlying GPT-3 system to improve or extend an existing application’s capabilities.</p>
<p>Sure, a text expander can be a useful tool for shorthand notation &#8212; but powered by GPT-3, that shorthand can be transformed into a product that generates contextually aware emails in your own style of writing.</p>
<p>As early-stage technology investors, we are inspired to see AI broadly, and natural language processing specifically, become more accessible via the next generation of large-scale transformer models like GPT-3. We expect they will unlock new use cases and capabilities we have yet to even contemplate.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/music">Techstars Music</a> is announcing 11 new companies that have joined its ranks, along with a partnership with Atlanta media company/record label Quality Control.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s easy to mentally bunch everything Techstars does together under the singular &#8220;Techstars&#8221; name, it&#8217;s actually made up of 40+ interconnected accelerator programs each with its own focus and portfolio. The majority of these are focused on a specific region — programs like Techstars Boulder, Boston or LA. Others focus on a specific vertical or industry — like sports, space, or, in this case, music.</p>
<p>So what all does that &#8220;music&#8221; focus cover? It&#8217;s not just music creation tools, or apps for artists. As Techstars Music Managing Director Bob Moczydlowsky put it in a Q&amp;A <a href="https://www.techstars.com/the-line/5-questions/bob-moczydlowsky">last year</a>, &#8220;we don’t invest in music companies — we invest in companies solving problems for music.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Their past portfolio includes <a href="https://endel.io">Endel</a>, which generates &#8220;personalized soundscapes&#8221; meant to help you focus or fall asleep faster, and <a href="https://blinkidentity.com">Blink Identity</a>, a company looking to replace the paper/digital concert ticket with facial recognition machines at the venue&#8217;s entrance.</p>
<h2><strong>The companies in the 2021 class, in alphabetical order:</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Epic Games is quickly becoming a more dominant force in gaming infrastructure M&amp;A after a string of recent purchases made to bulk up their Unreal Engine developer suite. Today, the company announced that they&#8217;ve brought on the team from photogrammetry studio Capturing Reality to help the company improve how it handles 3D scans of environments and objects.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed.</p>
<p>Photogrammetry involves stitching together multiple photos or laser scans to create 3D models of objects that can subsequently be exported as singular files. As the computer vision techniques have evolved to minimize manual fine-tuning and adjustments<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, designers have been beginning to lean more heavily on photogrammetry to import real-world environments into their games. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QL1gGw8efz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/cloud-gaming-platforms-were-2020s-most-overhyped-trend/">Cloud-gaming platforms were 2020&#8217;s most overhyped trend</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Cloud-gaming platforms were 2020&#8217;s most overhyped trend&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/cloud-gaming-platforms-were-2020s-most-overhyped-trend/embed/#?secret=QL1gGw8efz" data-secret="QL1gGw8efz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Using photogrammetry can help studio developers create photorealistic assets in a fraction of the time it would take to create a similar 3D asset from scratch. It can be used to quickly create 3D assets of everything from an item of clothing, to a car, to a mountain. Anything that exists in 3D space can be captured and as game consoles and GPUs grow more capable in terms of output, the level of detail that can be rendered increases as does the need to utilize more detailed 3D assets.</p>
<p>The Bratislava-based studio will continue operating independently even as its capabilities are integrated into Unreal. Epic announced some reductions to the pricing rates for Capturing Reality&#8217;s services, dropping the price of a perpetual license fee from nearly $18,000 to $3,750. In FAQs on the studio&#8217;s site, the company notes that they will continue to support nongaming use clients moving forward.</p>
<p>In 2019, Epic Games acquired Quixel, which hosted a library of photogrammetry &#8220;megascans&#8221; that developers could access.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://detail.co">Detail</a>, a new startup working on an app for iOS and macOS so that you can turn your iPhone into a software-optimized camera for live video. The startup wants to make it easy to use the phone that you have in your pocket with the livestreaming platform that you already use, such as Zoom, Google Meet, Twitch, Hopin or YouTube Live.</p>
<p>Over the past year, if you have had to present something to a large audience over a livestream, chances are you’ve faced a few challenges. First, as Joanna Stern of the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/webcam-showdown-macbook-air-dell-xps-theyre-pretty-bad/415D393C-4320-442B-974D-1887E20C057F">demonstrated</a>, laptop webcams suck. There’s no way you’re going to look good with your computer.</p>
<p>Second, if you’re willing to invest some money, you can buy a ring light, a dedicated camera, a good microphone, etc. The issue is that it’s expensive. More importantly, it’s been really hard to buy some of this stuff as many remote workers have been looking for those devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Third, you might be good at teaching something, but not good at video production. Those are different skills and somehow people are telling you that you should know everything about white balance, anti-flickering and more.</p>
<p>As for Detail, the company wants to make it as easy as possible to go from zero to livestream. The best camera that you have is most likely the one in your pocket, right there on the back of your smartphone. For the past few years, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/the-future-of-photography-is-code/">computational photography</a> has led to tremendous improvements when it comes to taking photos with your phone. But there’s still some work to do on the livestreaming front.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Detail founder Paul Veugen <a href="https://medium.com/detailapp/the-third-act-1a6472bd1932">rightly points out</a> that hosting a live video has become a commodity. But everything that happens before you send the video feed over the internet could be improved.</p>
<p>At first Detail is going to be an iPhone and Mac app that works hand in hand like <a href="https://reincubate.com/camo/">Camo</a> and <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/epoccam">EpocCam</a>. There are going to be some easy-to-use settings to tweak color grades, add filters, etc. It’s going to be a more opinionated take on the smartphone-as-a-webcam movement.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the team is composed of some of the people that worked on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/human/">Human</a>, an app I started covering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/03/meet-human-a-beautiful-fitness-tracking-app-to-effortlessly-stay-healthy/">way back in 2013</a>. Human was a passive fitness tracking app — you could set it up and get insights about how active you had been over the past few days. Essentially, it was like Apple’s activity rings before Apple introduced the Apple Watch. Human was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/mapbox-is-acquiring-passive-fitness-tracking-app-human/">acquired by Mapbox</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>Detail raised a $2 million pre-seed round led by Connect Ventures. Hustle Fund, Alexander Ljung, Anke Huiskes, Arthur Kosten, Elodie and Tony Jamous, Hiten Shah, Janis Krums, Mart Kelder, Micha Hernandez van Leuffen, Othman Laraki, Omri Amir and Sten Tamkivi are also participating in the round.</p>

<p>As you can see, Detail is still in active development and the beta test is going to start soon. But it’s an intriguing app and I’m going to keep an eye on it to see how it pans out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://capsule.social">Capsule</a>&#8216;s plan to launch a super simple decentralized social media platform which is safe from censorship by Big Tech has advanced another stage: The nascent startup has closed a seed round of funding ($1.5M) led by Beacon Fund, a dedicated crypto fund by Polychain Capital &#8212; which is itself focused on startups building on Dfinity&#8217;s decentralized network for next-gen &#8216;open&#8217; apps (aka, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/dfinity-launches-an-open-source-platform-aimed-at-the-social-networking-giants/">the Internet Computer</a>).</p>
<p>As we reported in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/cryptocat-author-gets-insanely-fast-backing-to-build-p2p-tech-for-social-media/">January</a>, the idea for Capsule started with a tweet that almost immediately pulled in a pre-seed raise of $100k. That&#8217;s now been topped up with seed financing to get a prototype to market later this month.</p>
<p>Mobile apps are also on the cards and the funding will be used to build out Capsule&#8217;s team as well (currently it&#8217;s around four people).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Capsule founder Nadim Kobeissi, a cryptography researcher who previously authored the open-source E2E-encrypted desktop chat app Cryptocat, says they&#8217;re on track to put out an MVP this month &#8212; once they&#8217;ve made a few tweaks to the infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prototype is ready,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We’re investigating switching some of the infrastructure from GUN to IPFS [InterPlanetary File System; aka a p2p hypermedia protocol], and improving the user interface. We could launch an MVP now but are choosing to hold off by a few weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Polychain Capital outted its Beacon Fund last September. The $14.5M investment vehicle is funded by Polychain, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Dfinity Foundation &#8212; and aims to support entrepreneurs and teams building on Dfinity&#8217;s the Internet Computer (TIC); aka a serverless architecture for natively hosting software and services (which it refers to as the &#8220;first blockchain computer that runs at web speed with infinite capacity&#8221;).</p>
<p>Kobeissi&#8217;s original concept for Capsule, meanwhile, was to create self-hosting microservices. He says that hasn&#8217;t changed &#8212; but sees potential for TIC to help solve some specific technical issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Internet Computer will hopefully be helping us build a &#8216;customized mini-blockchain&#8217; to solve two issues with Capsule: Global authenticated timestamps for posts as well as a root of trust for user’s authentication keys for posts,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We were looking to solve these issues somehow before this investment and were already considering Dfinity as the potential solution given that it has a programming language that allows for building these &#8216;custom mini-blockchains&#8217; as we see them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest will still be a self-hosting, self-contained, precisely engineered micro-services concept, with IPFS (previously GUN) as a decentralized database/connectivity back-end,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Given the intent with TIC is to hosts all sorts of decentralized apps it&#8217;s possible &#8212; indeed, likely &#8212; that a bunch of decentralized social media plays will emerge. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/dfinity-launches-an-open-source-platform-aimed-at-the-social-networking-giants/">Last year</a>, for example, Dfinity launched a proof of concept for an &#8216;open&#8217; version of the professional social network, LinkedIn &#8212; which it punningly called &#8216;LinkedUp&#8217;.</p>
<p>It went on to demo a TikTok clone &#8212; and to open TIC up to outside developers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/dfinity-demos-its-tiktok-clone-opens-up-its-internet-computer-to-outside-developers/">last summer</a>. So there could soon be a bunch of apps built atop its network touting social networking services without the meddling hand of Big Tech. Where, then, does Kobeissi see Capsule&#8217;s USP &#8212; i.e. if/when there&#8217;s a sea of decentralized &#8216;mega-apps&#8217; that can also claim resilience to censorship?</p>
<p>&#8220;We think Capsule’s value will lie in its exceptional user experience, quality, performance, ease of use and high quality engineering that draws on advanced technologies such as TIC and IPFS without saddling bloat,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Others may use the same technology but I think we can do a good job on building something simple that just works and that is a pleasure to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, I think that Capsule will be to Facebook what healthy, vegetarian diets are to a McDonald’s diet,&#8221; he adds more generally of his intent for the service. &#8220;Capsule may be a social media service but its relationship with its users and developers will be fundamentally different than Big Tech platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Below are a few screenshots showing current mock-ups of the Capsule interface.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In December, Walmart partnered with TikTok on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">the first pilot test of a new livestreamed shopping experience</a> in the U.S. on the video platform. That test seemingly performed well, as today Walmart announced it will return to TikTok to host another livestream shopping event, the &#8220;Spring Shop-Along: Beauty Edition,&#8221; which will feature TikTok creators and influencers in an hour-long livestream.</p>
<p>The retailer didn&#8217;t disclose to what extent its first TikTok live shopping event drove sales, but noted that it netted 7x more views than it had anticipated and was able to grow its TikTok follower base by 25%. These metrics were encouraging enough to send Walmart back to the platform for another go &#8212; this time, to promote beauty products instead of apparel, which had been the focus of the holiday livestream.</p>
<p>The new Spring Shop-Along will run this Thursday, March 11 at 9 p.m. EST on the Walmart TikTok channel. Like the prior holiday event, the new livestream shopping event will see various TikTok creators joining to talk about and demonstrate their favorite items. One participating creator has already been announced: Gabby Morrison (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gabbymorr?lang=en">@GabbyMorr</a>) who has over 3.5 million TikTok followers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2123002" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123002" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123002" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="443" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png 1840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=768,501 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=1536,1002 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123002" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>Gabby and others will demo their skincare, makeup and hair routines and reveal the Walmart beauty products they&#8217;re using during the 60-minute live event. Featured beauty brands will include NYX, Maybelline, The Lip Bar, Bliss, Kim Kimble and Marc Jacobs fragrances.</p>
<p>Viewers watching the event will be able to get beauty tips as well as shop the products featured directly in the TikTok app by tapping on product &#8220;pins.&#8221; This will allow them to add items to their cart that they can then check out either during or after the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brands have found a unique home on TikTok to create content that speaks to the community and inspires engagement, whether it&#8217;s participating in trends or discovering new products,&#8221; said Blake Chandlee, president of TikTok Global Business Solutions, in a statement about Walmart&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the shoppable livestream experience, it&#8217;s exciting to see how the TikTok community loves engaging with their favorite creators and discovering new products. We look forward to continue building innovative ways to power the path from discovery to purchase, and seeing brands like Walmart bring their creativity to users,&#8221; Chandlee added.</p>
<p>Walmart had already signaled its interest in leveraging TikTok for e-commerce ahead of the holiday livestream. Notably, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/tiktok-deal/">had planned to invest in TikTok</a> when the video app was threatened with a ban under the Trump administration, unless it sold its U.S. operations to an American company. That forced sale, which would have spun out TikTok&#8217;s U.S. business to new owners Oracle and Walmart, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tiktoks-forced-sale-to-oracle-is-put-on-hold/">shelved</a> for the time being as the Biden administration <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-sale-to-oracle-walmart-is-shelved-as-biden-reviews-security-11612958401">reviews</a> the agency action under Trump.</p>

<p>Livestreamed shopping is an area of increasing interest and investment in the U.S. The trend has seen a number of startups enter the market, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/26/ntwrk-moves-into-live-events/">NTWRK</a> and recently funded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/bambuser-live-video-shopping/">Bambuser</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/popshop-live-gets-3-million-to-bring-live-streaming-to-shopping/">Popshop Live</a>, among others. Larger tech companies are also taking part &#8212; including across mobile video and live video shopping.</p>

<p>Walmart had said its plan to partner with TikTok on livestream shopping wasn&#8217;t a result of its deal talks, however &#8212; it&#8217;s been an active brand on TikTok&#8217;s platform for well over a year. The retailer even <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/a-true-influencer-program-inside-walmarts-growing-army-of-employee-tiktokers/">tasked its employees to make TikTok videos</a>, in addition to running its own TikTok channel.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, the retailer declined to provide further metrics about its first livestream on TikTok, but felt the pilot test delivered above expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were happy with getting 7x more views than anticipated and the 25% increase in TikTok follower growth after the first event. We were also pleased with the smooth checkout experience,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We aren’t able to share sales numbers, but can share that we hit the projections we set ahead of the event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following this week&#8217;s live shopping event, Walmart says it plans to bring more shopping experiences to TikTok in the months to come, by continuing to partner with creators to highlight different products via different formats.</p>

The removal and sequestration will be done by CE’s plant development partner, <a href="https://www.1pointfive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.1pointfive.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615385146024000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3WRJFnmCJ3-jSSRVOdwL3srk2Kw">1PointFive</a> — the U.S. development company that&#8217;s currently engineering CE’s first industrial-scale facility, the company said. That facility is due to be completed in 2024. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Early customers for direct air capture (DAC) &#8212; especially companies with ambitious climate goals &#8212; can have outsized impact today: not only does procuring DAC services enable companies to hit &#8216;net-zero&#8217; pledges faster, but it helps DAC technology come down the &#8216;learning curve,&#8217; driving cost reductions and making DAC services more affordable and accessible for a wider customer base in the future,&#8221; said Noah Deich, president and founder of the climate focused advocacy group Carbon180. &#8220;I&#8217;m very excited to see Carbon Engineering announce a way for early corporate leaders &#8212; and hopefully a wave of fast followers &#8212; to devote more of their climate spend toward DAC.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Their timeframe puts the Carbon Engineering timetable on roughly even footing with Climeworks for getting to market. Luckily for both firms, given the billions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions that need to be captured and sequestered it&#8217;s a market that&#8217;s definitely big enough for both of them. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">With its commitment, Shopify becomes the largest publicly announced purchaser of direct-air-capture-based carbon removal.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Carbon Engineering’s mission has always been to deliver a highly scalable and affordable solution for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,” said CE CEO, Steve Oldham, in a statement. “We’re on the brink of large-scale deployment of our technology and the next critical step is accumulating market interest and securing customers. This new service allows us to do that. It also makes it easy for companies and governments to include permanent carbon removal in their net-zero plans. We’re thrilled to expand our relationship with Shopify and welcome them as our first carbon removal customer, and we look forward to supporting others so we can collectively make large-scale carbon removal a reality.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Carbon removal unit purchases will be fulfilled by distributed air capture facilities deployed by 1PointFive, Carbon Engineering&#8217;s development partner, which is backed by deep-pocketed investors including <a href="https://www.oxylowcarbon.com/">Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, LLC</a>, a subsidiary of Occidental, and <a href="https://www.rusheen.com/">Rusheen Capital Management</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Carbon Engineering is also working with<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> <a href="https://pale-blu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pale-blu.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615385146024000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuF-j_Fv-oA8qeD_Z-ckz2rymsZQ">Pale Blue Dot Energy</a> out of the U.K. to bring its direct air capture technology across the Atlantic.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“We welcome this news and applaud Shopify on their climate leadership position,” said 1PointFive Chairman Richard Jackson. “Alongside climate experts like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we recognize that permanent carbon removal is going to be necessary to achieve our vision of a sustainable low-carbon world. 1PointFive looks forward to bringing large-scale carbon removal capability based on CE’s technology to the market, helping customers worldwide to achieve their climate goals.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of cybersecurity has seen a huge proliferation of new technology and services over the years. But with the primary focus being on solutions for larger enterprises, it leaves a big gap in the market for small and medium businesses, not least because they are increasingly finding themselves to also be a focus of malicious hackers. Today, a startup called <a href="http://actzero.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActZero</a> is coming out of stealth with a set of solutions aimed specifically at SMBs. Along with its public launch, it&#8217;s also announcing that it has raised a seed round of $40 million to get its business going.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our main focus is SMB security,&#8221; Sameer Bhalotra, the co-founder and CEO, said in an interview. The way he and the others at ActZero see it, many startups have emerged to target the security issues faced by big government and large enterprises. &#8220;But we want to help the small and medium businesses who we feel might need help the most. No one has stitched the products together the way SMBs need them to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>That solution is focused around monitoring, managed detection and response, he said, not just to discover but to contain cyber threats, which ActZero powers by way of a comprehensive, cloud-based AI platform. The AI in turn helps automate some of its services, bringing down the pricing and making it all something within the budgetary reach of a typical SMB. ActZero&#8217;s smallest customers have a few hundred employees, while the biggest have a headcount of around 3,500.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are bringing technology to bear to democratize access,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a single investor, Point72 Hyperscale, a VC firm backed by Stephen Cohen, who may be most well known for his track record in private equity. That money was raised, Bhalotra said, &#8220;on day one&#8221; of ActZero being founded in 2019.</p>
<p>$40 million may sound like a lot for a seed round, especially for a company that had yet to launch a service or acquire a customer. But it&#8217;s money that has been put to work already.</p>
<p>Some of the funding was used to acquire IntelliGo, a security startup out of Canada, last year, to give the company a head start on training its AI models with IntelliGo&#8217;s data, and also to bring on the startup&#8217;s customers to be its first users.</p>
<p>Another reason for the large funding round and strong confidence in what was just a concept at the time is the track record of the startup&#8217;s executives.</p>
<p>A previous security company co-founded by Bhalotra, StackRox, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/redhat-is-acquiring-container-security-company-stackrox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by RedHat</a>, and another, Impermium, where he was a key executive, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/15/impermium-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Google</a> where he became a cybersecurity executive. He was also senior director for cybersecurity in the Obama White House, among many other critical roles.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;RedHat is acquiring container security company StackRox&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/redhat-is-acquiring-container-security-company-stackrox/embed/#?secret=NjHQmCgk2L" data-secret="NjHQmCgk2L" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Co-founder Ed Gardner was a longtime security architect and program manager first at Akamai, then Amazon and then Microsoft. ActZero&#8217;s COO Chris Finan also spent years at Impermium, Shape Security and in a number of security roles over many years in Washington.</p>
<p>The work that they and others on the ActZero team put into managing cybersecurity in years past saw their primary focus train on formidable opponents that came in the form of state actors or those financed by large entities intent on stealing state intelligence, intellectual property from major companies, money laundering and disrupting networks and normal activity for other motives. &#8220;Cyberdefense was mostly about big banks and government agencies,&#8221; Bhalotra said, speaking with just a little wistfulness in his voice, maybe because it was, relatively speaking, a lot simpler back then.</p>
<p>These are not exactly the same kinds of issues that SMBs have traditionally faced, but times are changing. In more recent years, the evolution of cybercrime has been swift and &#8212; ironically &#8212; democratized in the process, where not even the smallest companies are totally safe.</p>
<p>In some ways, the threat is proportionately worse for less well-equipped smaller companies not set up to weather risky financial events. Recent research from the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/security/data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ponemon Institute and IBM</a> found that the average cost of a breach can reach into the millions of dollars, which can cripple smaller businesses.</p>
<p>You can liken the situation in enterprise security somewhat to the offline world of organized crime, where there are higher levels of groups that are dealing with huge sums of money and engaging in major industries, while there are also lower levels involved in more localized and smaller activities, and even low runs working in petty crime.</p>
<p>A lot of the primary threat for SMBs in recent years has been around ransomware &#8220;and criminal organizations have innovated on their business models and they have now moved beyond ransomware to data extortion,&#8221; said Finan. &#8220;It&#8217;s actually been fascinating to see how vertically integrated these organizations have become. You might have accounts receivable arms, R&amp;D arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes malicious hackers will attack SMBs as part of their &#8220;testing&#8221; process, he added. Their arsenal of tools of course now also include artificial intelligence, giving them machine speed to fuel malicious human intent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rise of COVID-19, which has led to so much more business and activity being carried out online, has led to a growing &#8220;opportunity&#8221; for them, Finan said. &#8220;I have been astounded by the level of sophistication, and COVID has accelerated that shift downmarket.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that SMBs, even those with thousands of employees, may lack the knowledge, budget or human resources to hire the kinds of security teams they need to have to address all of this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish that these small businesses were still under the radar because they are not up to the challenge for dealing with these groups,&#8221; said Bhalotra. &#8220;It&#8217;s just not the case any longer that they&#8217;re being ignored. We want to democratize cyber defense because hackers target everyone. We see multiple attacks daily, and they vary tremendously.&#8221;</p>
<p>There have been tools built to address security for SMBs before, although traditionally the focus has been around antivirus, firewalls and other basics. The key with what ActZero is doing is that it&#8217;s conceiving of SMB solutions on par with what is being built for their larger counterparts. It&#8217;s a next-generation security approach being taken also by a few others, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/enterprise-cybersecurity-startup-bluevoyant-raises-82-5m-at-a-430m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueVoyant</a> and <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2019/09/skout-cybersecurity-raises-25m-in-funding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skout</a>, both of which have also raised <a href="https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/temasek-bluevoyant-197626/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizeable rounds of funding</a>.</p>
<p>The bet is that the ActZero team&#8217;s track record and knowledge sets them up to be leaders in this area.</p>
<p>“ActZero has developed an elegant solution for addressing the most pressing security concerns of SMBs today with its unified, AI-powered platform,” said Dan Gwak, head of Point72 Hyperscale, in a statement. “ActZero is unique in its appreciation for and realization of a combined people and automation model. We believe that ActZero has the potential to transform how security solutions are delivered to help businesses achieve better security posture more affordably. We’re excited to partner with them on this critical journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoFi, more formally known as Social Finance, announced today that it has agreed to acquire Golden Pacific Bancorp (GPB) for about $22.3 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar amount is not staggering. What is more notable about the acquisition is that it’s giving SoFi a quick route to getting a national bank charter. SoFi, a digital personal finance company, got </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sofi-bank-charter/fintech-startup-sofi-gets-preliminary-approval-for-u-s-bank-charter-idUSKBN27D27W"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preliminary approval for a bank charter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last October. By acquiring Golden Pacific, the company gets a fast track into that process. Once the transaction closes later this year, GPB will become a subsidiary of the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A national bank charter will give SoFi the ability to accept deposits and make loans that use SoFi’s member deposits as opposed to funding its loan offerings as a nonbank, by contracting external underwriters at a premium.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the proposed acquisition, SoFi said it would switch its current de novo (i.e., net new) bank application to a change of control application. GPB currently has about $150 million in assets, but if the OCC and Federal Reserve grants SoFi a national bank charter, the company said it will then put $750 million toward its national, digital business plan. At the same time, it will maintain GPB’s community bank business and footprint, including its current three physical branches. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoFi expects the acquisition to close by year’s end. At that time, GPB’s community bank business will operate as a division of SoFi Bank, N.A., a renaming of GPB&#8217;s bank entity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GPB President and CEO Virginia Varela will continue to lead the GPB community bank business under the direction of Paul Mayer, who will serve as president of SoFi Bank, N.A.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that by pursuing a national bank charter, we will be able to help even more people get their money right with enhanced value and more products and services,” said SoFi CEO Anthony Noto in a written statement. “We are thrilled to have found a partner in Golden Pacific Bank to both accelerate our pursuit to establish a national bank subsidiary, as well as begin to expand our offerings in SoFi’s financial products and Galileo’s technology platform to serve local communities.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoFi expects to file shortly with the Federal Reserve for Bank Holding Company status and, together with GPB, to file an updated business plan with the OCC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based SoFi is the latest in a string of fintechs that are either becoming banks, or launching bank arms.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many companies have turned to self-serve sales, which may encourage people to try freemium or open-source versions of a product. Some percentage of these users may turn into paying customers, and in the best case will act as leaders to bring a product into their organization.</p>
<p><a href="https://calixa.io/">Calixa</a>, an early-stage startup, believes that this type of sale, known as a bottom-up sales motion, requires a new kind of tool to manage the process, and today it announced a $4.25 million seed round.</p>
<p>Kleiner Perkins led the round with help from Operator Collective, Liquid 2 Ventures and a bunch of individual investors. The round closed in February 2020, but is only being announced today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Calixa co-founder and CEO Thomas Schiavone says the roots of the company began when he was working at Twilio in 2010 and saw how powerful it was for developers to purchase tooling themselves. An idea began to form that CRM tools like Salesforce weren&#8217;t built to deal with this kind of sales motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I realized [at Twilio] was that developers were just signing up more and more every day and that if you really wanted to stay on top of what was going on and try to effectively grow and retain those accounts, you weren&#8217;t looking in Salesforce,&#8221; Schiavone told me.</p>
<p>He said that he decided to start Calixa in 2019 to solve this problem once and for all. While this kind of user-driven, bottom-up sale has been in place at software companies for years, he still saw a dearth of tools for dealing with its unique qualities in one place.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw a great opportunity to build something that democratizes [ … ] running a bottom-up company by not only giving all customer-facing teams the ability to see what&#8217;s going on with customers, but also take action,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This ability to manage the process and maybe extend a trial, issue a credit or even reset a password while letting these teams see and understand the underlying customer data was what set it apart from traditional CRMs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The central thesis here is that Salesforce and other CRMs don&#8217;t have that data. They&#8217;re too divorced or too much in this rigid world of the typical sales model, and you need something different to be an effective company,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To use the product, you simply sign up and then link the various accounts the product needs to compile the data it needs. It uses various API connectors to make this happen and all it requires is that you enter your username and password to access the accounts and begins pulling together the data.</p>
<p>Bucky Moore, a partner at lead investor Kleiner Perkins says that the pandemic has accelerated the move to a bottom-up approach as in-person sales models have been impossible. &#8220;Core to the success of this strategy is a data-driven understanding of each customer and user. By democratizing this capability to companies of all sizes, Calixa&#8217;s opportunity is to become the de facto customer operations platform for the modern software business,&#8221; Moore said.</p>
<p>Schiavone reports the company has seven employees spread across the U.S., Canada and Columbia. He says that as he hires, he will have offices in cities close to his clusters of employees, but he sees a hybrid approach where employees can decide just how much they want to be in the office.</p>
<p>The company spent last year building the product and working with 21 beta customers. The product will be generally available starting today.</p>
