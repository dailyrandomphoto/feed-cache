										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two years after launching its $56 million debut fund, <a href="https://kindredventures.com/">Kindred Ventures</a>, a San Francisco-based pre-seed and seed-stage venture fund founded by Steve Jang and Kanyi Maqubela, has closed its second fund with $100 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>Jang is himself a founder who later jumped into investing. In more recent years, he cofounded <a href="https://www.bitski.com/">Bitski</a>, a crypto-asset wallet startup, and previously founded Schematic Labs, an early social music app that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/04/rhapsody-soundtracking/">brought into</a> Rhapsody in 2014, and co-created the music streaming service imeem, whose assets were later <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/12/myspace-music-acquires-shutters-imeem/">acquired</a> by MySpace.</p>
<p>Jang was also an early advisor to Uber, and individually invested in a number of breakout companies, including the delivery company Postmates, the synthetic biology company Zymergen, the fitness company Tonal, and the crypto exchange Coinbase.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maqubela has similarly worn the hats of both founder and investor, spending six years as an investor with the seed- and early-stage firm Collaborative Fund before joining forces with Jang, as well as cofounding <a href="https://www.heartbeathealth.com/">Heartbeat Health</a> &#8212; a platform that invites patients who are at risk of heart disease and other chronic ailments to talk remotely with experts for care management.</p>
<p>The fund is notable, including because it doesn&#8217;t zero in on one or two sectors of tech. Why is that interesting? Well, because the venture landscape is now so crowded that institutional investors typically prefer to see seed-stage funds with a specific sector focus or an angle of some sort. It&#8217;s a way for these limited partners to better diversify their own investments and keep from backing managers who are investing in the very same deals.</p>
<p>Indeed, that Jang and Maqubela secured commitments from a mix of major university endowments, foundations, fund-of-funds, and strategic investors <em>despite</em> being generalists is something a feat.</p>
<p>No doubt investor interest ties to some of their earlier investments, like Coinbase &#8212; bets that underscore they are in the right entrepreneurial circles. Yet they say that another aspect of their pitch also resonated with investors, which is their &#8220;high concentration, high conviction&#8221; approach. Part of their workflow, for example, involves creating a Signal group or Slack channel as soon as they invest in a team so there can be a constant back-and-forth and to bolster the sense that Jang and Maqubela are extensions of a founding team.</p>
<p>Kindred says it also schedules weekly one-on-one chats with the founders it funds until their startup has designated a product launch date, after which &#8220;we move into a less rigorous, less frequent meetings,&#8221; says Jang, describing the firm&#8217;s approach very &#8220;programmatic and designed.&#8221;</p>
<p>But another way Kindred tries to gain an edge over competitors is by moving as close to the concept stage as possible &#8212; even helping to form startups. Jang and Maqubela point back to Heartbeat Health and Bitski, which they helped incubate and spin out. Another startup born of their &#8220;formation investing&#8221; approach is a payments company called <a href="https://www.ottopay.com/">Otto</a>, and they say to expect more to come.</p>
<p>In some cases, they start the company and assemble the founding team. In other cases, they help a new founder evolve from concept to prototype to landing the right cofounder. What it asks for in exchange is an ownership stake that ranges from between 5% of a company to 20% percent, with an average ownership position of 11%, they say, and ticking upward as the firm matures.</p>
<p>As for deal flow, they say they source their deals through introductions from the founders in their portfolio, through their own outreach based on ideas that excite them, and from employees of past portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though the bets they make range widely in focus, different themes do emerge, including around digital health, where in addition to Heartbeat Health and Tonal they backed <a href="https://www.color.com/">Color</a>, whose at-home tests can help people understand if they are at risk of hereditary cancer, as well as whether they have been exposed to COVID-19. (It closed its newest round at a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/color-raises-167-million-funding-at-1-5-billion-valuation-to-expand-last-mile-of-u-s-health-infrastructure/"> $1.5 billion</a> valuation earlier this month.)</p>
<p>Kindred is focused on community, too, with bets that include the audio social network Clubhouse. And Kindred is writing checks to the occasional security company, including <a href="https://www.anjuna.io/our-team">Anjuna Security</a>, which aims to protects applications and data from insiders by seamlessly encrypting everything end to end.</p>
<p>Not last, finance is plainly an area of interest. In addition to Coinbase, for example, Kindred more recently invested in <a href="https://dydx.exchange/">dYdX</a>, an open trading platform for crypto assets that just last announced it had raised $10 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>As for how the two &#8212; who wound up funding 25 companies altogether in their first fund &#8212; can continue to cover so much ground as they set out to invest this new, bigger vehicle, Maqubela says the question came up &#8220;more than half the time&#8221; in conversations about this next fund with its investors. But their secret sauce is no great mystery, they insist, saying they just happen to be highly curious people who are willing to get up to speed however possible when they meet a founder with whom they want to partner.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ultimately comes down to who Kanyi is and who I am,&#8221; says Jang, &#8220;and we&#8217;re both voracious about learning, it&#8217;s what drives us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though both have experience and know-how about a wide number of verticals at this point, they&#8217;re &#8220;absolutely novices&#8221; at times, and they don&#8217;t let that stop them, both say.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re inspired by the founder, their intellect, their dedication to a problem, and why they&#8217;re doing what they&#8217;re doing, we&#8217;re happy to go learn as quickly as possible,&#8221; offers Jang. &#8220;We&#8217;re very dutiful students.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20210201">Google has agreed</a> to pay $2.59 million to more than 5,500 current employees and former job applicants as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor over allegations of systemic discrimination as it relates to compensation and hiring. Google has also agreed to reserve $250,000 a year for the next five years to address any potential pay equity adjustments that may come up. That brings Google&#8217;s total financial commitment to $3.8 million &#8212; a drop in the bucket for the company, whose parent company Alphabet has a market cap of $1.28 trillion.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OFCCP/foia/files/2021-01-15_Google_ERCA_PA_Redacted.pdf">The settlement</a> comes after the DOL&#8217;s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs found pay disparities affecting female software engineers at Google&#8217;s offices in Mountain View, as well as in offices in Seattle and Kirkland, Washington. The OFCCP also found differences in hiring rates that &#8220;disadvantaged female and Asian applicants&#8221; for engineers roles at Google&#8217;s locations in San Francisco, Sunnyvale and Kirkland. The OFCCP&#8217;s evaluation covered September 1, 2014 through August 31, 2017.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Google has agreed to pay $1.35 million in back pay and interest to 2,565 female software engineers at the company ($527.50 per employee), and $1.25 million in back pay and interest to 1,757 women and 1,219 Asian applicants for software engineering roles for which they were not hired ($414 per person).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lastly, Google will reserve $1.25 million of the money to go toward pay-equity adjustments for the next five years for U.S. engineers at Google&#8217;s Mountain View, Kirkland, Seattle and New York offices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe everyone should be paid based upon the work they do, not who they are, and invest heavily to make our hiring and compensation processes fair and unbiased,&#8221; a Google spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;For the past eight years, we have run annual internal pay equity analysis to identify and address any discrepancies. We’re pleased to have resolved this matter related to allegations from the 2014-2017 audits and remain committed to diversity and equity and to supporting our people in a way that allows them to do their best work.&#8221;</p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">&#8220;The U.S. Department of Labor acknowledges Google’s willingness to engage in settlement discussions and reach an early resolution,&#8221; Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs</span> Regional Director Jane Suhr said in a press release. &#8220;The technology industry continues to be one of the region’s largest and fastest growing employers. Regardless of how complex or the size of the workforce, we remain committed to enforcing equal opportunity laws to ensure non-discrimination and equity in the workforce.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a creator-economy world, if you’re only as good as your last YouTube video, then your next YouTube video had better be bigger and louder than the last.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vibely.io/">Vibely</a>, a new startup co-founded by Asana alumni<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/teriyu/"> Teri Yu</a> and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theresaylee/"> Theresa Lee</a>, wants to turn the constant, and often exhausting, beast of content creation on its head. The startup has created a premium, creator-controlled community platform that allows fans to gather and be monetized in new ways, beyond what is possible on YouTube or TikTok.</p>
<p>The core of Vibely, and what the co-founders hope will keep users coming back, is the ability to let any creator make a challenge for their fans to enjoy. For example, a creator whose brand evokes thoughtfulness could ask fans to sketch out their personal growth goals or take action around a new year’s resolution everyday. Or a fitness influencer could motivate fans to work out for a sprint of days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Most people in the creator economy are thinking about how to immediately monetize and get that instant gratification of like money here,” Yu said, which is why creators sell merchandise or hop on Cameo. “We’re focusing on long-term strategic communities.” Yu describes her startup’s shift as a mindset change, from a linear relationship between creators and fans to a multi-directional relationship between fans, superfans, new fans and creators.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106186" style="width: 348px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106186" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2106186" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png" alt="" width="338" height="731" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106186" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vibely</p></div></p>
<p>Vibely’s pitch is two-fold. For fans, the platform gives them a chance to chat with other fans from around the world. It also lets fans participate in community challenges and have a place to plan virtual hangouts over shared love for makeup or dance. The startup helps creators simultaneously, by giving them a one-stop shop to announce plans, do call to actions and create an ambassador program. It lets the “creator scale their time and have a multi-directional relationship with the community under or beneath them.”</p>
<p>Notably, Vibely is trying to be different from Patreon or OnlyFans, which is basically paywalled content for fans. Vibely doesn’t need creators to post more content, it just needs them to pop into a premium community and interact with fans in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>The startup is formalizing a sporadic daily occurrence: When a creator posts content, their comment sections in YouTube, Instagram and TikTok light up with fans discussing every detail you can imagine, from a suggestive hair flip to if that background poster has a hidden message. Creators often pop in to respond to a spicy thread or a random compliment, which incentivizes fans to keep swarming the content section.</p>

<p>The startup has spent little on customer acquisition cost and relied heavily on word of mouth. In December, Vibely launched a part-in-person, part-virtual creator house to pair top TikTok creators with their followers, generating some buzz. In 2020, Vibely had more than 600 communities with 392,000 messages sent and 37,000 challenges completed. Creators include Lavendaire, with 1.3 million YouTube subscribers and Rowena Tsai, who has 520,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>Yu says that there is one day where Kim Kardashian might have a community on the platform, but the main &#8220;bread and butter&#8221; of Vibely is searching for creators who represent a true interest, value or belief system. This can be a book influencer or a religious creator, for example.</p>
<p>“[Creators] are controlling their own destiny,” Yu said. “On Instagram or Facebook, you might create content but the algorithm decides at the end of the day whether or not your audience sees it. With Vibely, they have 100% control since this is their community.” The startup is planning to make money through membership dues and in-app mechanics like social currencies and rewards.</p>
<p>Vibely’s moonshot goal is to be a more positive, and supportive, Discord, a platform used by gamer communities across the world. So far, Yu says that less than .1% of Vibely users have been flagged by other users, although notably would not share total user numbers. There is also an ambassador program that appoints a user to oversee a community, as well as a global community manager on the team.</p>
<p>“The ceiling of where [Discord] can support is really only going to be gamers,” she said. “But creators want to protect their brand right now and make sure people have a positive experience,” so they are looking for another place to set up.</p>

<p>While moderation is apparently going well so far, Vibely will most certainly encounter problems as more and more users join its platform. In the world of challenges, craze and hype led by fanatics could potentially become harmful if someone takes it too far. While Vibely aims to be a judgement-free zone for people to connect around the world, scale has a uniquely pessimistic way of forking that from time to time. Some consumer apps have responded to this truth by aggressively hiring on-staff moderators, but that<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa"> too can become grueling work.</a></p>
<p>To hit the ground running, Vibely announced today that it has raised $2 million in seed financing from backers including Steve Chen, the co-founder of YouTube; Justin Rosenstein, the co-founder of Asana and co-creator of Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Social Dilemma&#8221; documentary; Scott Heiferman, the co-founder of Meetup; Turner Novak, formerly an investor at Gelt, and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google rethinks its gaming strategy, Microsoft rolls out its quantum computing platform and UiPath is now valued at $35 billion. This is your Daily Crunch for February 1, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Google shutters internal game studios</strong></p>
<p>When Google announced its Stadia cloud platform, it also said it was forming Stadia Games and Entertainment, an internal studio that would create titles for the platform. Now it seems <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/google-shuts-down-its-internal-stadia-game-studios/">the company is abandoning this approach</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a surprising move, not just because Google has yet to release a single game from the studio, but also because the company opened studios in Montreal and Los Angeles, as well as acquiring Typhoon Studios — so it seems like a real investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given our focus on building on the proven technology of Stadia as well as deepening our business partnerships, we’ve decided that we will not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from our internal development team SG&amp;E, beyond any near-term planned games,” Google exec Phil Harrison said in a blog post.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Batteries are the latest landing pad for investors.</p>
<p>In the past week alone, two companies have announced plans to become publicly traded companies by merging with special purpose acquisition companies. European battery manufacturer FREYR said Friday it would become a publicly traded company through a special purpose acquisition vehicle with a<a class="c-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128006233/en/FREYR-a-Developer-of-Clean-Next-Generation-Battery-Cells-to-List-on-NYSE-Through-a-Business-Combination-with-Alussa-Energy-Acquisition-Corp." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128006233/en/FREYR-a-Developer-of-Clean-Next-Generation-Battery-Cells-to-List-on-NYSE-Through-a-Business-Combination-with-Alussa-Energy-Acquisition-Corp." data-sk="tooltip_parent"> valuation at $1.4 billion</a>. Houston-area startup Microvast announced Monday its own SPAC,<a class="c-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/battery-maker-microvast-said-to-agree-to-merger-with-tuscan-spac?sref=AwwRcx4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/battery-maker-microvast-said-to-agree-to-merger-with-tuscan-spac?sref=AwwRcx4b" data-sk="tooltip_parent"> at a $3 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>A $4.4 billion combined valuation for two companies with a little over $100 million in revenue (FREYR has yet to manufacture a battery) would seem absurd were it not for the incredible demand for batteries that&#8217;s coming.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Legacy automakers like GM and Ford have committed billions of dollars to shifting their portfolios to electric models. GM said last year it will spend $27 billion over the next five years on the development of electric vehicles and automated technology. Meanwhile, a number of newer entrants are either preparing to begin production of their electric vehicles or scaling up. Rivian, for instance, will begin delivering its electric pickup truck this summer. The company has also been tapped by Amazon to build thousands of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/amazon-debuts-its-first-fully-electric-delivery-vehicle-created-in-partnership-with-rivian/">electric vans</a>.</p>
<p>The U.S. government could end up driving some of that demand. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/president-joe-biden-commits-to-replacing-entire-federal-fleet-with-electric-vehicles/">President Biden announced last week that the U.S. government would replace the entire federal fleet of cars, trucks and SUVs with electric vehicles</a> manufactured in the U.S. That&#8217;s 645,047 vehicles. That&#8217;s going to mean a lot of new batteries need to be made to supply GM and Ford, but also U.S.-based upstarts like Fisker, Canoo, Rivian, Proterra, Lion Electric and Tesla.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;President Joe Biden commits to replacing entire federal fleet with electric vehicles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/president-joe-biden-commits-to-replacing-entire-federal-fleet-with-electric-vehicles/embed/#?secret=ZRNfYrpSNa" data-secret="ZRNfYrpSNa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, some of the largest cities in the world are planning their own electrification initiatives. Shanghai is hoping to have electric vehicles represent roughly half of all new vehicle purchases by 2025 and all public buses, taxis, delivery trucks and government vehicles will be zero-emission by the same period, according to research from the <a href="https://www.rbcinsightresearch.com/ui/main/report/ea118c8a-e221-4b6d-a026-8f23464b169d">Royal Bank of Canada</a>.</p>
<p>The Chinese market for electric vehicles is one of the world&#8217;s largest and one where policy <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/chinas-electric-car-strategys-implications-for-us-energy-security.html">is significantly ahead of the rest of the world</a>.</p>
<p>A potential windfall from China&#8217;s EV market is likely one reason for the significant investment into Microvast by investors including the Oshkosh Corp., a 100-year-old industrial vehicles manufacturer; the $8.67 trillion money management firm, BlackRock; Koch Strategic Platforms; and InterPrivate, a private equity fund manager. That&#8217;s because Microvast&#8217;s previous backers include CDH Investments and CITIC Securities, two of the most well-connected private equity and financial services firms in China.</p>
<p>So is the company&#8217;s focus on commercial and industrial vehicles. Microvast believes that the market for commercial electric vehicles could be $30 billion in the near term. Currently, commercial EV sales represent just 1.5% of the market, but that penetration is supposed to climb to 9% by 2025, according to the company.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2008, we set out to power a mobility revolution by building disruptive battery technologies that would allow electric vehicles to compete with internal combustion engine vehicles,&#8221; said Microvast chief executive Yang Wu, in a statement. &#8220;Since that time we have launched three generations of battery technologies that have provided our customers with battery performance far superior to our competitors and that successfully satisfy, over many years of operation, the stringent requirements of commercial vehicle operators.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roughly 30,000 vehicles are using Microvast&#8217;s batteries and the investment in Microvast includes about $822 million in cash that will finance the expansion of its manufacturing capacity to hit 9 gigawatt hours by 2022. The money should help Microvast meet its contractual obligations, which account for about $1.5 billion in total value, according to the company.</p>
<p>If Chinese investors stand to win big in the upcoming Microvast public offering, a clutch of American investors and one giant Japanese corporation are waiting expectantly for FREYR&#8217;s public offering. Northbridge Venture Partners, CRV and Itochu Corp. are all going to see gains from FREYR&#8217;s exit &#8212; even if they&#8217;re not backers of the European company.</p>
<p>Those three firms, along with the International Finance Corp., are investors in <a href="https://24-m.com/">24M</a>, the Boston-based startup licensing its technology to FREYR to make its batteries.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">FREYR&#8217;s public offering will also be another win for Yet-Ming Chiang, a serial entrepreneur and professor who has a long and storied history of developing innovations in the battery and materials science industry.</p>
<p>The MIT professor has been working on sustainable technologies for the last two decades, first at the now-defunct battery startup A123 Systems and then with a slew of startups like the 3D printing company Desktop Metal; lithium-ion battery technology developer, 24M; the energy storage system designer, Form Energy; and Baseload Renewables, another early-stage energy storage startup.</p>
<p>Desktop Metal went public last year after it was acquired by a special purpose acquisition company, and now 24M is getting a potential boost from a big cash infusion into one of its European manufacturing partners, FREYR.</p>
<p>The Norwegian company, which has plans to build five modular battery manufacturing facilities around a site in its home country, intends to develop up to 43 gigawatt hours of clean batteries over the next four years.</p>
<p>For FREYR chief executive Tom Jensen there were two main draws for the 24M technology. &#8220;It&#8217;s the production process itself,&#8221; said Jensen. &#8220;What they basically do is they mix the electrolyte with the active material, which allows them to make thicker electrodes and reduce the inactive materials in the battery. Beyond that, when you actually do that you remove the need for a number of traditional production steps&#8230; Compared to conventional lithium battery production it reduces production from 15 steps to 5 steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those process efficiencies combined with the higher volumes of energy-bearing material in the cell leads to a fundamental disruption in the battery production process.</p>
<p>Jensen said the company would need $2.5 billion to fully realize its plans, but that the float should get FREYR there. The company is merging with Alussa Energy Acquisition Corp. in a SPAC backed by investors including Koch Strategic Platforms, Glencore, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, Franklin Templeton, Sylebra Capital and Van Eck Associates.</p>

<p>All of these investments are necessary if the world is to meet targets for vehicle electrification on the timelines that have been established.</p>
<p>As the Royal Bank of Canada noted in a December report on the electric vehicle industry. &#8220;We estimate that globally, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) will represent ~3% of 2020 global demand, while plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles (PHEVs) will represent another ~1.3%,&#8221; according to RBC&#8217;s figures. &#8220;But we see robust growth off these low figures. By 2025, when growth is still primarily regulatory driven, we see ~11% BEV global penetration of new demand representing a ~40% CAGR from 2020’s levels and ~5% PHEV penetration representing a ~35% CAGR. By 2025, we see BEV penetration in Western Europe at ~20%, China at ~17.5%, and the US at 7%. Comparatively, we expect internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to grow (cyclically) at a 2% CAGR through 2025. On a pure unit basis, we see &#8216;peak ICE&#8217; in 2024.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canon is embracing the AI-infused future with a strange new robotic camera called the PowerShot PICK. This little device swivels and keeps its subjects in view, taking commands or snapping shots on its own.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit like a smart security camera or Facebook&#8217;s Portal, but meant to be taken with you wherever you go, attached to a selfie stick, and so on. Its body is about the size of a juice box, making it portable but not quite pocketable.</p>
<p>The camera company appears to be hedging its bets by offering the PICK not as a retail product but through the <a href="https://www.makuake.com/project/powershotpick/">Japanese crowdfunding site Makuake</a>, where it has already blasted through its trumpery $10,000 goal (currently at about 10 times that, which is still just a fraction of what it must have cost to develop this thing).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106980" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pick-guy.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106980" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2106980 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pick-guy.gif" alt="The Canon Pick camera tracks a strange looking guy on a BMX bike." width="800" height="460" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2106980" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;PICK&#8230; stop watching me.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t do that, Dennis.&#8221; <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canon</p></div></p>
<p>A promo video for the campaign shows the PICK being used in a variety of circumstances: recognizing faces and shooting during a party; tracking a person riding a bike around their yard; activating itself on demand in someone&#8217;s kitchen and following their position.</p>
<p>The idea is fun — a device you just set down and it snaps candid photos while you do your thing, or keeps you in view while you do your vlog — but the proof is in the pudding.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/dXkpxB_iDuM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The sensor is small, an old point-and-shoot&#8217;s 1/2.3&#8243; 12MP, though the F/2.8 zoom lens and image stabilization should help it out in uneven light. We won&#8217;t know what the shots look like until they send a few of these out to backers and reviewers.</p>
<p>Is this a ridiculous dead-end gadget from a company desperate to escape the photography industry&#8217;s death spiral? Or is it a smart, easy solution for people tired of thinking &#8220;ah &#8211; someone should get a shot of this&#8221;? You can still, of course, tweak and operate the camera from a companion app.</p>
<p>One thing it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> appear to be is a webcam, which seems like a missed opportunity. A swiveling, smart webcam that takes voice commands would be a godsend to many people tired of taking every call in the same shabby rectangle of their improvised home office. Now that we&#8217;ve all thoroughly stopped caring about &#8220;looking professional&#8221; (and if you haven&#8217;t stopped&#8230; this is your cue), maybe we can start taking meetings while cleaning the kitchen or sitting on the patio.</p>
<p>Hopefully this little experimental device bears fruit for Canon and we&#8217;ll all have robot camera buddies we take around with us everywhere. Sounds creepy now, sure, but just wait a few years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year I penned a post positing that Salesforce’s propensity to purchase mature enterprise companies not only provided new technology, but was also helping to produce<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/salesforce-has-built-a-deep-bench-of-executive-talent-via-acquisition/"> a profusion of executive talent</a>. As though to prove my point, the company announced today that it was promoting former Vlocity CEO David Schmaier to president and chief product officer.</p>
<p>Schmaier came to the organization last year when Salesforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/salesforce-grabs-vlocity-for-1-33b-a-startup-with-1b-valuation/">acquired his company for $1.33 billion</a>. It seemed like a good match, given that Vlocity sold Salesforce solutions designed for certain niches like financial services, health, energy and utilities and government and nonprofits.</p>
<p>As a result, Schmaier knew the product set and the company well. Last June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/salesforce-names-vlocity-founder-david-schmaier-ceo-of-new-salesforce-industries-division/">he was named CEO of the Salesforce Industries</a> division, which was created after the Vlocity acquisition. The connection was clear to Schmaier as he told me at the time of his promotion last year:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>“I’ve been involved in various mergers and acquisitions over my 30-year career, and this is the most unique one I’ve ever seen because the products are already 100% integrated because we built our six vertical applications on top of the Salesforce platform. So they’re already 100% Salesforce, which is really kind of amazing. So that’s going to make this that much simpler,” he said.</p></blockquote>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce has built a deep bench of executive talent via acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/salesforce-has-built-a-deep-bench-of-executive-talent-via-acquisition/embed/#?secret=Pna05ibYMd" data-secret="Pna05ibYMd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says that Schmaier&#8217;s history in building Vlocity makes this promotion pretty easy given the direction of the company, as well as the industry. &#8220;Over the last several years we&#8217;ve seen just how important developing industry-specific solutions have become to the major players in the space, and Schmaier&#8217;s promotion reaffirms this while illustrating how important creating verticals is to their platform [and] to the future of Salesforce,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-names-david-schmaier-president-chief-product-officer/">a Q&amp;A on the Salesforce website</a> announcing the promotion, Schmaier talked about the challenges companies faced in the last year. &#8220;There’s no question 2020 was a challenging year. We are operating in this all-digital, work from anywhere world and things won’t go back to where they were, nor should they. One of the silver linings has been seeing what companies can do when there is no alternative and the imperative is to connect with their customers in entirely new ways,&#8221;</p>
<p>In his new position it will be Schmaier&#8217;s job to figure out how to help them do that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there has been some turnover in the C Suite recently at Salesforce. Just today the company also announced that long-time CFO <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/salesforce-cfo-hands-reins-to-successor-after-more-than-six-years-at-helm-11612186200">Mark Hawkins was retiring</a>. He will be replaced by Amy Weaver, who was formerly the company&#8217;s chief legal officer. Meanwhile, last week the company hired former <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/thoughts-from-day-1-ceo-service-cloud-clara-shih/">Hearsay Social co-founder and CEO Clara Shih</a> to run Salesforce Service Cloud.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps Public is correct in deciding that it needed another way to stand out from its in-market competitors.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Soon all tech news will be fintech news, all fintech news will be trading platform news and all trading platform news will concern the business mechanics of such services.</p>
<p>So, after looking into Robinhood&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/">fourth-quarter payment for order flow (PFOF) revenues</a> this morning, we&#8217;re back with a related story. This time, however, we&#8217;re talking about Public.</p>
<p><a href="https://public.com/">Public</a>, like Robinhood, is a zero-cost trading service. Its founders have worked to build a community-first platform, including<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/as-investing-apps-boom-public-doubles-down-on-its-social-focus/"> offering ways to let groups chat about their investments</a>.</p>
<p>And like Robinhood, Public has seen its growth skyrocket in recent days. Company representatives told TechCrunch today it was seeing &#8220;steady ~30%&#8221; month-over-month growth until Thursday, when &#8220;new user signups went up 20x.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both share strong backing from investors: Robinhood <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">raised billions</a> in new capital this week to ensure it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">enough cash to meet clearinghouse deposit requirements</a>. It managed to do so in part because its Q4 2020 numbers show that its PFOF business is ticking along nicely.</p>
<p>Public, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/">flush with a recent $65 million Series C</a>, took a different tack this morning and announced it would &#8220;stop participating in the practice of Payment for Order Flow.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">ANNOUNCEMENT: To better align our incentives with those of our members, we will stop participating in the practice of Payment for Order Flow.<a href="https://t.co/s9Vd2MyLcJ">https://t.co/s9Vd2MyLcJ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Public.com (@public) <a href="https://twitter.com/public/status/1356231585562034180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>To which we say … <em>all right</em>.</p>
<p>On one level, this is neat. Public is not going to sell its order flow to market makers for fees. That&#8217;s good for users, but how will it make up the lost revenue? Tips, which will prove an interesting experiment in monetization.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked the company if it believes tips will compensate for PFOF revenue, to which founders Leif Abraham and Jannick Malling replied via email that they were &#8220;optimistic that the difference will be offset by the optional tipping feature.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, dropping payment for order flow is only so brave a move from Public. After all, Public was not making Robinhood-level amounts of fetti from its PFOF business. Indeed, as we wrote when Public raised its Series C:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before chatting with Public, I dug into its <a href="http://public.s3.com/rule606/apex/">trading partner Apex’s filings</a> to learn about its payment for order flow results from its recent filings. The resulting sums are somewhat modest for Apex’s collected clients. This means that Public’s revenue metrics, a portion of the aggregate sums, are even more unassuming.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathaliewalton/">Nathalie Walton</a> almost didn’t become a mother. Her risky pregnancy caused her placenta to burst during childbirth, almost killing her and her son last year. Walton, who feels lucky to have survived, says the haunting experience made her an example of a reality she had long known: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr69/nvsr69-02-508.pdf">To be a pregnant Black woman is to be at risk</a>, regardless of economic background.</p>
<p>The stress of her pregnancy led Walton to download Expectful, a meditation and sleep app for new mothers. She recalls stabilizing, emotionally and physically, within a week, bringing an otherwise “soft landing” to a volatile pregnancy.</p>
<p>Weeks after delivering her son, Everett, Walton just so happened to hear of an advisory role opening at Expectful. Even though she was mid-maternity leave from her managerial role at Airbnb, she jumped at the opportunity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I definitely had a full-time job, I had a newborn baby,” Walton said. But, she says, it was an opportunity to be entrepreneurial in a sector she cared about. Even if it was just for a few months.</p>
<p>And now, Walton is the chief executive of the company. The business is pivoting its product strategy to grow beyond recorded meditations. Walton helped it raise its first millions in venture capital, making her one of the <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/02/black-women-female-founders-venture-capital-funding-vc-2020-project-diane/">few dozen Black </a>female founders to do so. New financing and the boom of the mental health focus amid the coronavirus pandemic puts Expectful in a coveted spot. And it puts Walton, who is at the helm of a company for the first time, in a pressure-cooker spotlight.</p>
<p>Even in the world of startups, going from user to chief executive in less than a year is a remarkable feat. But it’s not one that she rushed.</p>
<h2>A quarter-life crisis</h2>
<p>Walton graduated from Georgetown and immediately joined the New York banking world. After a few years as an analyst at JP Morgan, though, she became unsatisfied with the work.</p>
<p>“I think I had a quarter-life crisis,” Walton said. Searching for new opportunities, she ended up at a prospective students day at Stanford University in what would become a pivotal moment in her life.</p>
<p>“For the first time, I met entrepreneurs and saw an actual concept that you can pursue a career you like, be successful and make a difference in the world,” she said. Walton eventually applied, and got accepted, to Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB), a prestigious program that produces founders and top executives. It was then that she realized she wanted to be a chief executive one day.</p>
<p>“I admired them, but I just didn’t see the pathway for me to get there,” she said, of the entrepreneurs she met, who were then largely white and male. “I didn’t have the confidence.”</p>
<p>So, she set that hope aside and pursued intrapreneurship, which would let her join a stable organization and act as a mini-founder within it. Employees in this role are tasked with building a startup within a startup, whether that is rooting an innovative idea or leading an experiential team. Corporations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/29/how-big-companies-are-becoming-entrepreneurial/">have long embraced this idea</a> to bring momentum to otherwise red-tapey processes.</p>
<p>Walton joined eBay and soon rose to work as the head of business operations and development. Her work helped the company break into 3D printing.</p>
<p>Over the years, this has been the defining characteristic of Walton: join an organization, build a scrappy idea from scratch, and then do it all over again. She has held roles in Airbnb and Google that all required her to have the agility of a founder convincing people on a moonshot vision, and the rigor of a manager who can get a deal done.</p>
<p>She had the same vision heading into an advisory role at Expectful. But when Walton landed a key Expectful partnership with Johnson &amp; Johnson, then-CEO and founder Mark Krassner had an idea.</p>
<h2>‘It was on my mind from day No. 1’</h2>
<p>Before starting Expectful, Krassner experienced the benefits of meditation firsthand. He also saw his mother face depression, which made him realize how meditation could have a positive impact on others. After seeing research that showed how meditation could positively impact a pregnancy, he began thinking of a solution in this cross-section. He eventually started a course on Teachable, a startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/teachable-raises-4m-to-create-a-tool-to-turn-any-online-class-into-a-true-business/">lets anyone create and monetize an online class</a>, with 15 moms and a guided meditation.</p>
<p>Over time, the idea stuck. Krassner eventually turned his course into a 12-person startup. Under his leadership, Expectful grew to profitability and over 13,000 paid users. Its conversion rate from free to paid users was five times higher than industry standards, the company claims.</p>
<p>That said, from the moment Mark Krassner started Expectful, he knew he was an <a href="https://expectful.com/blog/man-in-a-mothers-world/">unlikely founder</a>. He doesn’t have any children, so leading a meditation and sleep app for new mothers comes with its own hurdles.</p>
<p>“As a male founder with no kids, it was on my mind from day No. 1,” Krassner said. He eventually wanted to put a female at the head of the company, he says. Walton was the obvious choice.</p>
<p>Walton returned to Airbnb after her maternity leave right as Airbnb had aggressive<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/citing-revenue-declines-airbnb-cuts-1900-jobs-or-around-25-of-its-global-workforce/"> COVID-19 layoffs</a>. While her job was saved, her team disappeared as part of the cuts. She started looking for jobs, and received lucrative offers from Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon. When she told Krassner she was leaning toward a lead product manager position at Amazon, he replied with an offer to take over Expectful’s entire business.</p>
<p>“I think it caught her off guard,” Krassner said, who is still a board member at the company. “Usually you don’t think a CEO is looking for [a new CEO] unless things are going to hell in a handbasket.”</p>
<h2>The new Expectful</h2>
<p>Expectful began as a guided meditation library, which will continue to be its core. But now, Walton wants to take advantage of that momentum and evolve the company into a “go-to wellness resource for hopeful, expecting and new parents.”</p>
<p>The language suggests that the startup is evolving in how it markets itself. Right now, the site has a number of references to &#8220;motherhood&#8221; and women. But Walton says Expectful defines a mother by anyone who identifies themselves as one. While the startup primarily has content geared toward the gestational parent, or the one who gives birth to the child, Walton says they have a &#8220;a partner&#8217;s library for non-gestational parents that identify as non-gestational mothers, fathers, or however they choose to identify.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walton plans to pivot the startup in three phases: content, marketplace and community.</p>
<p>For content, Expectful wants to organize pregnancy-related information. Currently, a lot of information or advice around pregnancy lives in books or in-person classes. But the learning experience, which Walton says is similar to middle school-style lectures, doesn’t feel built for this century.</p>
<p>The next step in her plan is digitizing the service providers that help women through pregnancy. In simpler words, replace the disorganized recommendations in Facebook groups for parents.</p>
<p>“When I went to ask my OB-GYN for recommendations for a doula, she gave me a sheet of paper with the names of 10 doulas,” she said. “You have to text the doula, ask them questions and if they want to meet up &#8212; it all feels yucky.” Expectful wants to put all that information in one platform so moms can access tips and recommendations from the ease of their homes.</p>
<p>The end-product here would be a peer-reviewed platform that can help a mom find everything from a therapist to a live-in nanny, with reviews built-in.</p>
<p>Finally, Walton wants to invest in the community. Expectful recently launched <a href="https://expectful.com/mother-circle/">Mother Circles</a>, which connects postpartum mothers into support cohorts led by a doula facilitator. The circles include six weekly video calls, a group chat and 500 hours of on-demand doula support.</p>

<p>Part of Walton’s focus through all of these priorities is to invest in Black maternal health outcomes. Her own experience, she says, showed her how even a “<a href="https://medium.com/@nathaliewalton/72-of-pregnant-and-new-moms-are-overwhelmed-with-anxiety-im-on-a-mission-to-change-that-1293cd2feaf9">Stanford-educated wellness junkie</a>” such as herself can be at a high-risk for pregnancy because of her skin color.</p>
<p>It’s a lofty goal, even with the promising growth and strong library of guided meditations. The competition is steep. One of Expectful’s closest competitors is Peanut, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/social-network-for-women-peanut-raises-12m-series-a-amid-pandemic/">social network for moms used by over 1.2 million people</a>. Mahmee, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/serena-williams-mark-cuban-invest-3-million-in-mahmee-a-digital-support-network-for-new-moms/">digital support network</a> for postpartum mothers, has raised $3 million and views itself as complementary to Expectful. Headspace has launched its own motherhood meditation series, but it is not as comprehensive as Expectful’s.</p>

<p>“I think we&#8217;re able to connect with women in a way that some of these other companies aren’t,” Walton said. “People are paying for the service, so they clearly need it.”</p>
<p>While Walton declined to share new user metrics, she said that the company’s revenue has grown 100% since March 2020.</p>
<p>Long-term, Expectful wants to mimic Peloton’s playbook in terms of getting premium content and community to the right audience. Still, growing from a startup to a venture business requires more than just ambition and market fit. It requires the ability to exponentially grow and keep growing.</p>
<p>A handful of investors believe that Walton’s Expectful can do it. Expectful raised $3 million in a seed financing round led by Harlem Capital. Indicator Ventures, Sequoia Scout Fund, Joyance Partners, Break Trail Ventures, Chinagona Ventures, Powerhouse Capital, AVG Basecamp Fund and Babylist also participated. Angel investors included Ellen Pao, Mike Smith and Ashley Mayer. The round also included $1.2 million in convertible SAFE notes, making the financing round a total of $4.2 million.</p>
<p>“Historically when I look at what black women raise fundraising, I feel fortunate that I’ve been able to raise this round,” Walton said.</p>
<p>Harlem Capital founding partner Henri Pierre-Jacques said that “obviously, given our focus we weren’t going to invest in a white male.” Walton’s “founder-market fit” is what made the firm invest, even with the hairy dynamic of an exiting CEO.</p>

<p>Mayer, head of communications at Glossier, was the one who introduced Walton to the woman who told her about the advisory role of Expectful. She says that Nathalie’s “path to entrepreneurship feels inevitable.</p>
<p>“It was always just a question of finding the space where her passions collided,” Mayer said.</p>
<p>As a new mother and new founder, Walton has had a busy balancing act of a year.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m working more now than I have really in the last decade,” she said. “But I&#8217;ve never been more fulfilled because, as someone who went through this, and I&#8217;m still going through this, I feel so personally the level of pain that so many women suffer through.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise IT has been completely transformed by SaaS the past decade. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/okta-saas-report-finds-office-365-wins-the-cloud-sort-of/">Okta last week published a report</a> that showed that the largest companies now use 175 apps, a doubling over the past few years. More professionals have more tools to do their jobs than ever before. It’s an explosion of creativity and expressiveness and operational latitude — but also a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to give people and businesses tools — and something else to train them to use those tools effectively. Worse, as the number and complexity of software has skyrocketed the past decade, it’s only become harder for end users to grapple with offering their customers the best possible experience.</p>
<p>That’s the opportunity for a range of new tools that are designed to guide — sometimes forcefully — people to use the software they have in the best possible way, in what you might dub &#8220;best practices as a service.&#8221; It’s software that is opinionated on what “best” looks like within its domain, and ensures that as many people follow that model as possible with minimal dissension. It’s simplicity-in-a-box for a complex world.</p>
<p>Let me give some examples from a few major fields of startups in e-commerce, security, web development and finally, in my chosen profession, writing to illustrate what I mean.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005905/en/World’s-First-All-Civilian-Mission-to-Space-Will-Usher-in-New-Era-of-Commercial-Space-Exploration">announced</a> its first all-civilian private spaceflight mission, a high-priced galactic tourism launch that it hopes to fly by the fourth quarter of 2021. The mission, which will use SpaceX&#8217;s Dragon crew spacecraft and its Falcon 9 rocket, will include Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman, as well as three crew members to be selected and sponsored by Isaacman, his company and St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital. That&#8217;s one way to drive product adoption.</p>
<p>The mission is being called Inspiration4, and there&#8217;s already a significant digital presence for it, including a website with a countdown timer. Two of the seats on the four-person ride will be donated to St. Jude recipients, with one (which is already assigned, though the person hasn&#8217;t yet been identified beyond Isaacman confirming she&#8217;s a diverse selection) going to a frontline healthcare worker at the children&#8217;s medical research center, and another going to a member of the public that will be chosen from entrants to an online contest based on making a donation to St. Jude&#8217;s. The final seat will go to an entrepreneur who builds a business on Shift4&#8217;s e-commerce platform for online stores.</p>
<p>Isaacman has committed $100 million to St. Jude&#8217;s as part of the Inspiration4 campaign, and will be looking to raise another $100 million or more from contributions made through the program. While he actually began Shift4 Payments when he was just 16, which now processes more than $200 billion per year in transactions, Isaacman also created and led a private air force, which he later sold to Blackstone, the large global private military contractor. Isaacman&#8217;s business trained pilots for the U.S. Air Force, and he himself is a trained pilot certified on both commercial and military aircraft.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>He&#8217;ll serve as the Dragon flight&#8217;s commander, which makes sense, given that although the spacecraft flies in a fully automated fashion, there should still be someone with some kind of expertise on board in case of emergency. Isaacman&#8217;s history as a pilot, combined with the fact that he&#8217;s extremely rich, make him a great candidate for that role.</p>
<p>As to the nature of the mission, it&#8217;ll involve pre-launch commercial astronaut training, including instruction in orbital mechanics and zero gravity maneuvering. The flight itself will take off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and it&#8217;ll then circle the globe for multiple orbits (approximately one every 90 minutes, the company says), while the spacecraft remains aloft for multiple days &#8212; SpaceX founder Elon Musk said that it&#8217;s ultimately up to Jared, but that a range of two to four days is what the company suggests. It&#8217;ll then re-enter Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and make a water landing in the Atlantic Ocean, where it&#8217;ll be recovered by a SpaceX crew. Musk said that the mission intends to use the SpaceX Dragon capsule currently docked at the International Space Station for this flight, and that it has NASA&#8217;s approval and cooperation for the launch.</p>

<p>SpaceX previously revealed that it would be looking to host private missions with Dragon once it was rated for human flight by NASA. Now we know when the first dedicated private mission is looking to take off &#8212; and it might even beat other private space tourism efforts out the door, including Virgin Galactic&#8217;s suborbital spaceplane day tours.</p>
<p>Asked what orbit the flight will target, Musk quipped, &#8220;<span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">I</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">do</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">want</span> to <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">emphasize</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">this</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">is</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">really</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">up</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">to,</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">you</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">know,</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">you</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">go</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">where</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">where</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">you</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">want</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">to</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">go</span> &#8212; w<span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">e&#8217;ll</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">take</span> you there,&#8221; with Isaacman noting that they&#8217;ll be determining and posting that in the coming days. In response to another question about what kinds of accoutrements passengers could bring up, Musk again deferred to the mission commander, who added &#8220;if we can get some creature comforts up there, that&#8217;s kind of cool.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Google originally announced Stadia, its cloud gaming service, the company also announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/google-is-creating-its-own-first-party-game-studio/">first-party game studio</a>. Stadia Games and Entertainment was supposed to release exclusive titles for the new platform. And yet, Google has changed its mind and is now <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/focusing-on-stadias-future-as-a-platform-and-winding-down-sge/">shutting down</a> its internal game studios.</p>
<p>“Given our focus on building on the proven technology of Stadia as well as deepening our business partnerships, we’ve decided that we will not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from our internal development team SG&amp;E, beyond any near-term planned games,” Google Stadia VP and GM Phil Harrison wrote in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/focusing-on-stadias-future-as-a-platform-and-winding-down-sge/">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>That’s right, the company has yet to release a single game under the Stadia brand but it&#8217;s already over. This is an odd move as Google has made some significant investments in the space. It originally created a studio in Montreal Canada and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-12-19-stadia-acquires-typhoon-studios">acquired Typhoon Studios</a>. It then opened another studio in Los Angeles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jade Raymond was leading Google’s first-party studios. She has been working in the video game industry for more than 15 years. In particular, she was a producer for Ubisoft in Montreal working on the first Assassin’s Creed games. She also worked for Electronic Arts on an unreleased single-player Star Wars video game.</p>
<p>Today’s news also means that Raymond is leaving Google. Other Google employees working for Stadia Games and Entertainment will move on to new roles.</p>
<p>Going forward, Stadia will focus on third-party games. The company says that Cyberpunk 2077 has been quite popular on the cloud gaming platform for instance. It lets you launch the game on a server in a data center near you and stream the video feed to your device.</p>
<p>Many readers will likely think that Google might shut down Stadia soon as the company has shut down <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/we-were-the-1000-goodbye-google-reader/">many</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/and-thats-really-it-for-google/">many</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22google+shuts+down%22+site%3Atechcrunch.com">services</a> in the past. The company tries to be reassuring.</p>
<p>“We’re committed to the future of cloud gaming, and will continue to do our part to drive this industry forward. Our goal remains focused on creating the best possible platform for gamers and technology for our partners, bringing these experiences to life for people everywhere,” Harrison writes.</p>
<p>But do you believe him?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Otonomo, the cloud-based software startup that help companies capture and monetize connected car data, is headed to the public market. The Israeli-based startup said Monday it has agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition company Software Acquisition <span style="font-weight: 400;">Group Inc. II </span>with a valuation of $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Otonomo is joining a growing pool of automotive startups that have sidestepped the traditional IPO path in favor of merging with a SPAC, or blank check company.  Arrival, Canoo, Lordstown Motors, Luminar, ChargePoint, The Lion Electric and Proterra are just some of the transportation-related companies that have announced or closed their SPAC mergers in the past several months.</p>
<p>The capital provided by public markets has become too tempting for companies that either have capitally intensive projects — like attempting to become a vehicle manufacturer — or for those that are hoping to speed up their growth. Otonomo falls in the latter camp.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Otonomo said it raised $172.5 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from investors that included Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, BNP Paribas Asset Management Energy Transition Fund and Senvest Management LLC, with support from strategic investors Dell Technologies Capital, and Hearst Ventures. Current Otonomo shareholders will own a majority of the combined company at closing. Otonomo will have more than $307 million in cash proceeds once the companies combine.</p>
<p>Otonomo said it plans to use cash proceeds from the transaction to fund growth and accelerate its entry into new markets and use cases.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otonomo launched in 2015 with a cloud-based software platform that can capture and anonymize vehicle data, which can then be used to create apps to provide services such as electric vehicle management, mapping, subscription-based services, parking, usage-based insurance, traffic management, media and emergency services. The company&#8217;s platform is used by 16 vehicle manufacturers, fleets and more than 100 service providers, according to Otonomo.</span></p>
<p>The company has landed a dozens of customers on its pitch that it can help companies monetize all the date running through their connected vehicles. Otonomo says it securely collects the data, where its then modified so companies can use it to develop apps and services for fleets, smart cities and individual customers. The platform also enables GDPR, CCPA and other privacy regulation-compliant solutions using both personal and aggregate data.</p>
<p>Otonomo&#8217;s growth can be measured — at least in one way — by examining the number of data points that run through the platform. A year ago, the company said its platform was taking in 2.6 billion data points a day from more than 20 million vehicles through partnerships with automakers, fleets and farm and construction manufacturers. Today, the company said the platform ingests <span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 4 billion data points per day from over 40 million global connected vehicles. </span></p>
<p>The merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. Ben Volkow continuing to serve as CEO of Otonomo, which will trade on the NASDAQ exchange.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every sport has its practice drills and exercises to help players hone skills between games. Why would esports be any different?</p>
<p><a href="https://gwoop.com/">Gwoop</a>, a startup out of Minnesota, wants to be the place where gamers go to train between matches. They&#8217;re building up a collection of free browser-based training tools meant to help you measure and improve vital stats like reaction time, mouse control, and aim, and see how your stats compare to the best.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the training games currently up and running:</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reaction Training</strong>: Wait for it … click! As soon as the screen changes from grey to orange, you click the mouse button. The lower your reaction time (measured in milliseconds), the better. Harder levels throw in more colors to fake you out and give you a bit of pause.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Speed</strong>: Targets spawn one-at-a-time all around a 2D plane. Click one and another appears. The more targets you click before time runs out, the higher your score.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard speed</strong>: Straightforward keyboard key-finding practice, because any time spent looking at your keyboard is time not spent dodging shots.</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2106829" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106829" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2106829 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="430" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg 1469w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg?resize=768,486 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg?resize=680,430 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106829" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gwoop</p></div></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mouse control</strong>: If you can&#8217;t get your mouse to go where you want it, you can&#8217;t aim. Gwoop&#8217;s mouse control exercise has you drag a ball through a curved track. If your cursor strays outside the track, the ball returns to the beginning. The more tracks you successfully complete before time is up, the higher your score.</li>
<li><strong>FPS Training Arena</strong>: Strafe around a 3D arena (pictured up top), scanning for randomly generated targets and clicking them as they appear. Bonus points for hitting the dead center of a target.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the tools are linked back to an analytics dashboard, allowing you to gauge your performance metrics over time. Each skill gets its own leaderboard so you can see, for example, how your average reaction time compares to others worldwide and amongst your friends.</p>
<p>Even in its 3D exercises, Gwoop&#8217;s graphics are pretty simple — and that&#8217;s intentional. They want it to work for as many players as possible. They&#8217;ve got no reason to try to look like a AAA title; the more graphically intense a game is, the more powerful your computer would have to be to run it smoothly. Co-founder Gavin Lee tells me that their goal is to keep it so that &#8220;all you need is a computer and the internet. It doesn&#8217;t matter if your device is 10 years old.&#8221; Even its 2D exercises have switches you can flip to further simplify the graphics and improve performance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same reason they&#8217;ve built everything to work in the browser: not requiring any downloads means more people can train, with the added benefit for the Gwoop team of not having to worry about maintaining separate Mac/PC clients.</p>
<p>While the existing exercises might seem focused around improving first-person shooter skills, Lee tells me that they&#8217;re aiming to be &#8220;genre-agnostic&#8221; and are planning expansions tailored to other kinds of games. He mentions a &#8220;MOBA Arena&#8221; in the works meant to help polish skills required for games like League of Legends or DOTA, and another exercise in progress that&#8217;s &#8220;very Rocket League-centric.&#8221; Their training tools seem mostly focused on keyboard/mouse users right now, but they&#8217;re working on more functionality for players who prefer controllers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106830" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106830" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2106830 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="412" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg 1161w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg?resize=768,466 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg?resize=680,412 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106830" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gwoop</p></div></p>
<p>Gwoop is entirely free to players — so how will they make money? Lee tells me they&#8217;ve got two different strategies there: They&#8217;ll sell additional advanced analytics tools to teams, and, once they&#8217;ve got enough players clicking around, hopefully be able to serve as a platform for esports recruiters. Lee says players should be able to opt-in to having their data shared with potential sponsors and esports teams, with Gwoop getting paid to connect the dots. &#8220;All these division one schools have these platforms where you can upload football films and get recruited,&#8221; says Lee &#8220;we want to become that platform [for esports].&#8221;</p>
<p>Why the name &#8220;Gwoop&#8221;? Is it a bit of super cool gaming lingo, or some sort of acronym? Nope! It was just a quick, memorable domain Lee had been holding onto for decades. &#8220;I wish I had a better story for you,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but I bought the domain in 2002 just because I wanted a five-letter domain that you could pronounce and was available.&#8221; It&#8217;s okay, Gavin: Most people don&#8217;t care why Google is called Google, after all.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s timing is pretty good here. With most people being stuck at home, more people are getting into gaming than ever before. Battle Royale games like Fortnite, PUBG and Apex Legends are blowing up … but it&#8217;s hard to get better in a game where you spend the first 10 minutes looting only to get shredded in 10 seconds when a skilled team rotates through. While many titles have dedicated training areas or firing ranges to practice in, they&#8217;re usually meant more for quick pre-game warmups and don&#8217;t do things like help you track metrics and improvements over time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106824" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106824" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2106824 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="397" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg 1333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg?resize=768,449 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg?resize=680,397 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106824" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gwoop</p></div></p>
<p>The Minneapolis-based team is currently comprised of its three co-founders. It&#8217;s self-funded to date, but I&#8217;m told a seed round is underway.</p>
<p>Gwoop is currently in semi-closed beta and generally requires an invite to signup, but Lee tells me that the code #TC2021# should let our readers past the signup gate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/event-discovery-network-irl-raises-16m-series-b-after-refocusing-on-virtual-events/">$16 million Series B last fall</a>, event discovery network <a href="https://www.irl.com/">IRL</a> is launching a new website that adds more social features around events, including profiles, chats and the ability to join group events, among other things. With the changes, users will also be able to receive personalized event recommendations, participate in group events, as well as talk about events with their friends, across both web and mobile. The combined efforts make IRL.com feel less like an online event search engine and more like a real social network.</p>
<p>The startup, which had previously focused on real-world events, could have easily imploded last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which effectively shut down the in-person events industry overnight. But it instead <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/streaming-events-calendar/">quickly pivoted</a> its event discovery app to include virtual events. In April, IRL adapted to the government lockdowns and restrictions on in-person gatherings by indexing online events, like livestreamed concerts, esports events, Zoom parties and more.</p>
<p>The changes, in a way, made IRL more accessible because it became a tool that anyone could use &#8212; not only those with the time and money to travel and attend real-world events.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2106750" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106750" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106750" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="469" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png 1385w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png?resize=768,530 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png?resize=680,469 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106750" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IRL</p></div></p>
<p>In fitting with those changes, the company also last year redesigned its mobile app to make it easier for users to find new events to attend remotely.</p>
<p>It organized events into categories like gaming, music, tv, wellness, sports, podcasts, lifestyle and more &#8212; including those sourced from partners like TikTok, Meetup, Twitch, Spotify, SoundCloud, HBO, Ticketmaster, Eventbrite and others. (We&#8217;re also seeing Apple TV+ shows on the site, but IRL can&#8217;t officially confirm if Apple is a partner. We&#8217;re told IRL does have permission to display these events, however.)</p>
<p>The new IRL website is meant to better mirror the recently redesigned mobile experience.</p>
<p>As users join IRL.com for the first time, they can pick event categories they&#8217;re interested in and find their friends who are already using the service.</p>
<p>Also like the mobile app, you can now click across filters at the top of the website to drill down into events by category &#8212; like gaming, music, TV, sports, wellness, lifestyle, podcasts and others. And you can filter to see events taking place this weekend or view IRL&#8217;s own suggestions of &#8220;Top Picks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The site directs users to create their own group events with friends through the new built-in chat feature, which had previously only been available on mobile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because everybody&#8217;s at home, there&#8217;s a big demand for a web messenger,&#8221; notes IRL founder and CEO Abraham Shafi.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106752" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106752" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106752" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106752" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IRL</p></div></p>
<p>He explains that the startup&#8217;s focus around messaging as the basis for a group is what allows IRL to differentiate itself from other groups-focused products. Facebook Groups, for example, are built around the idea of discussion boards, he says. But IRL is instead building its social network around messaging.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no group chatting app that also allows you to add events,&#8221; Shafi says. &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing that become really valuable for any groups that have upcoming and scheduled activities. It could be a TV show that you really like. Or it could be your friends playing Among Us or playing video games. [On IRL], you can imagine, literally, any type of group &#8212; like a book club that meets weekly and has weekly events coming up,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>In addition, students who sign up with an .edu email address can now find on-campus events and groups that are available only to those who attend the same school. These aren&#8217;t typically indexed publicly and won&#8217;t appear on the IRL homepage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106751" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106751" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106751" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="632" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png 1406w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png?resize=150,139 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png?resize=300,279 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png?resize=768,714 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png?resize=680,632 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106751" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IRL</p></div></p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s focus on group messaging has helped the app grow, despite the pandemic.</p>
<p>The company now reports over 10 million monthly active users, and its group messaging feature has been growing at around 30% month over month since August. Today, there are over 30 million chats sent on IRL per day, with over a billion chats that have been sent to date, Shafi says.</p>
<p>In time, IRL plans to expand the site to include more local events as well as deepen its relationship with partners.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.irl.com/tiktok">the IRL TikTok account</a> has been the first to reach over a million followers. But currently, all the events TikTok posts to the site are hand-curated. IRL says it&#8217;s working on a deeper integration that will help pull in more TikTok content, including top trends.</p>
<p>The company also expects to attract more influencers with the website launch, like those who want to build a name for themselves as a &#8220;cool curator&#8221; of a specific type of event &#8212; such as the <a href="https://www.irl.com/sneakerheads">Sneakerheads account</a>, for instance, which tracks sneaker drops.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106749" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106749" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106749" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/search-results-user-typing-inside-search.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="524" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/search-results-user-typing-inside-search.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/search-results-user-typing-inside-search.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/search-results-user-typing-inside-search.png?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/search-results-user-typing-inside-search.png?resize=768,591 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/search-results-user-typing-inside-search.png?resize=680,524 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/search-results-user-typing-inside-search.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106749" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IRL</p></div></p>
<p>As users participate on the website and app by following events, adding friends, and joining chats, IRL will be able to make better recommendations as to what sort of events they might like to try next.</p>
<p>And as the world recovers from COVID, allowing in-person events once again, the company believes usage will jump.</p>
<p>&#8220;When in-person returns &#8212; because that&#8217;s inevitable &#8212; we&#8217;ll be supporting that, for sure,&#8221; says Shafi, adding that he expects IRL to then &#8220;explode.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to take virtual away. Virtual will always be there … quite honestly, it will probably always be a hybrid,&#8221; he says. &#8220;This pandemic has allowed us to focus on something that will actually help us grow once we can support both the real and the remote.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me and the team are very grateful that we&#8217;ve had the opportunity to build something deeply meaningful in these times &#8212; even though at the outset, it would have seemed like we were screwed,&#8221; Shafi adds.</p>
<p>Initially, IRL tested the web app&#8217;s revamp only with its existing users. But the relaunch of the site now makes the changes accessible to all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another hour, another billion-dollar round. That&#8217;s how February is kicking off. This time it&#8217;s <a href="https://databricks.com/">Databricks</a>, which just raised $1 billion Series G at a whopping $28 billion post-money valuation.</p>
<p>Databricks is a data-and-AI focused company that interacts with corporate information stored in the public cloud.</p>
<p>News of the new round <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/sources-databricks-raising-at-27">began leaking last week</a>. Franklin Templeton led the round, which also included new investors Fidelity and Whale Rock. Databricks also raised part of the capital from major cloud vendors including AWS, Alphabet via its CapitalG vehicle, and Salesforce Ventures. Microsoft is a previous investor, and it took part in the round as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But we&#8217;re not done! Other prior investors including a16z, T. Rowe Price, Tiger Global, BlackRock and Coatue were also involved along with Alkeon Capital Management.</p>
<p>Consider that Databricks just raised a bushel of capital from a mix of cloud companies it works with, public investors it wants as shareholders when it goes public and some private money that is enjoying a stiff markup from their last check into the company.</p>
<p>The company has made its mark with a series of <a href="https://databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse">four open-source products</a> with a core data lake product call Delta Lake leading the way. You may recall that another hot data lake company, Snowflake, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/09/after-479m-round-on-12-4b-valuation-snowflake-ceo-says-ipo-is-next-step/">raised almost a half a billion dollars</a> on a $12.4 billion valuation a year ago before going public last September with a valuation twice that. Databricks has already exceeded that public valuation with this round &#8212; as a private company.</p>
<p>When we spoke to Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi at the time of his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/databricks-announces-400m-round-on-6-2b-valuation-as-analytics-platform-continues-to-grow/">company&#8217;s $400 million round in 2019</a>, one which valued the company at $6.2 billion at the time, he said his company was the fastest-growing enterprise cloud software companies ever, and that&#8217;s saying something.</p>
<p>The company makes money by offering each of those open-source products as a software service and it&#8217;s doing exceedingly well at it, so much so that investors were tripping over each other to be part of this deal. In fact, Ghodsi said in a conversation with TechCrunch today that his company had targeted a much more modest $200 million raise, but that figure grew as more parties wanted to invest funds into the company. Even with that, Databricks had to turn capital away, he added, after deciding to cap the round at $1 billion.</p>
<p>The extra $800 million that the company raised will be used for M&amp;A opportunities with an eye on talent, spend on establishing a <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/01/30/what-is-a-data-lakehouse.html">Lakehouse</a> concept, international expansion, while also expanding its engineering team, the CEO said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lE1MdGVRtL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/databricks-crossed-350m-run-rate-in-q3-up-from-200m-one-year-ago/">Databricks crossed $350M run rate in Q3, up from $200M one year ago</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Databricks crossed $350M run rate in Q3, up from $200M one year ago&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/databricks-crossed-350m-run-rate-in-q3-up-from-200m-one-year-ago/embed/#?secret=lE1MdGVRtL" data-secret="lE1MdGVRtL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ghodsi also made clear that he does not intend to let the percentage of revenue that the company spends on R&amp;D to drop, as is common at modern software companies &#8212; as many SaaS companies grow, they expend more of their revenue on sales and marketing efforts over product spend, something that Databricks wants to avoid by continuing to invest in engineering talent.</p>
<p>Why? Because Ghodsi says that the pace of innovation in AI is so rapid that IP becomes outdated in just a few years. That means that companies that want to lead in this space will have to stay on the bleeding edge of their market or fall back swiftly.</p>
<p>The Databricks model appears to be working well, with the company closing 2020 at $425 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR. That figure, up 75% from the year-ago period, is also up from a $350 million run rate at the end of its Q3 2020. (For more on Databricks&#8217; business, product and growth, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/databricks-crossed-350m-run-rate-in-q3-up-from-200m-one-year-ago/">head here</a>.)</p>
<p>Notably Ghodsi told TechCrunch that this deal only started to come together in December. It&#8217;s February 1st today, which means that it took on this bushel of new funding remarkably quickly.</p>
<p>Finally, at $425 million in ARR, is the CEO worried about having a valuation sitting at roughly a 65x multiple? Ghodsi said that he is not. He said that he told his company during an all-hands earlier today that the AI market is a long journey, one that he hopes to be on for decades, and the stock market will go up and down. His point, as far as I could read into it, was that so long as Databricks keeps growing as it has, its valuation will take care of itself (and that seems to be the case so far with this company).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s certainly true is that Databricks is now as rich as it has ever been, as large as it has ever been, and in a market that is maturing. Let&#8217;s see what it can do with all this money.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Companies become industry leaders because of sparks: Ideas that lead to innovation, which shakes up a category. Apple changed the world when it realized that people wanted a PC in their pocket and it had to feel and look good.</p>
<p>Research makes sparks possible. In the modern economy, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/19/steven-johnson-good-ideas">“eureka” moments are rare</a>, and product-market fit like the iPhone, PayPal, and so many others are the outcome of sparks of innovation, yes — but more importantly, rigorous research. People still have great ideas in the shower, but most of the time, big advances happen after countless hours of market research, A-B testing and the like.</p>
<p>As one might expect, the pandemic has forced research online. The companies that figure out remote research will find success and profitability more quickly than those who are still struggling to. Remote research will remain the rule even as the worst of the pandemic mercifully ends, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/21/health/us-vaccination-timeline-analysis/index.html">as our lives will still be upended for months or even years</a>. For those investing in tech companies, newly honed remote research capabilities are a critical yet undervalued asset and a stealth indicator of company health.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			The companies that figure out remote research will find success and profitability more quickly than those who are still struggling to.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The pandemic has been a major challenge for good corporate research. Most researchers — myself included — historically relied on in-real-life, face-to-face conversations with current and potential customers. Now that 2021 is underway, the onus is on organizations to explain how they’ve figured out the remote research problem. They’ve had 10 months to do so, and if they haven’t, they better have a plan for how they’re going to fix it.</p>
<p>Investors, executives and teams from the bottom-up must see — and demand — that companies get research right. Billions of dollars ride on it. No one wants to be Quibi, where good <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/23/why-quibi-is-a-cautionary-tale-shortform-netflix">consumer research would have made all the difference</a>.</p>
<p>There are ways to recreate effective research techniques digitally. Leaders should ask what tools researchers are using; what hacks they’ve developed to serve their needs in new and different ways. Are researchers using collaboration tools to draw out ideas and get to know people better? For example, I ask for photo collages of a person’s home life to help understand a person’s context. The next question should be how the research team is using these tools. Are they just giving a presentation, or are they using these tools in an open-ended fashion to spur dynamic conversation? I often use a digital whiteboard to provide a personal touch with real-time drawing and diagramming, which can be fun and even silly. It helps people let their guard down.</p>
<p>Next, leaders need to make sure the company is incorporating research into the design process, regardless of the collaboration difficulties the pandemic has imposed. Researchers and the design team need to answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is research just a box to check? Or are designers and developers constantly referring to it?</li>
<li>Is the research team properly elevated, ideally reporting into the chief product officer and sharing insights frequently with the executive team to provide a sharper sense of consumer desires?</li>
<li>Are researchers given the freedom to learn more about the hacks that consumers are implementing in today’s unusual reality?</li>
<li>Are designers and developers using the research as a jumping-off point, and do they have permission to design and create in new ways?</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, research should be a core dimension of good product decisions, of sound digital product design and development. If it isn’t, organizations should make changes in 2021.</p>
<p>There is quantitative data to back up this statement. According to <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-better/design-maturity-model/">InVision’s industry research</a>, only 10% of 2,300 teams surveyed deploy the most design-mature research practices, which increase speed-to-market, revenue and valuation. Only 7% say they rely on customer reviews and co-create products alongside their customers (important research practices).</p>
<p>Put more starkly, it’s likely the companies that are getting investment are not using research in the best possible way. Fewer than 10% of thousands of teams surveyed elevate design research. That means fewer than 10% of organizations are able to meet today’s remote research challenges easily, adapt to new realities quickly and succeed in this extreme time of change. In the throes of a pandemic, that is a problem.</p>
<p>Even after COVID, companies that thrive — or even simply survive — will be design-mature and digital-first. They will derive more of their revenue, interact with customers and gain new research insights digitally. In such an economy, technical and engineering prowess are critical, but all the technical ability in the world is worthless without understanding what consumers want a company to create. It is worthless without feedback. It is worthless without insight that leads to innovation.</p>
<p>It is worthless without a mature design process that uses research to validate, understand and turn the spark of an idea into reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.uipath.com/">UiPath</a>, one of the leaders in the quickly growing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> robotic process automation (RPA) space,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.uipath.com/newsroom/uipath-closes-750-million-series-f-funding"> announced</a> Monday that it has closed on $750 million in Series F funding at a staggering post-money valuation of $35 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Alkeon Capital and Coatue co-led the round, which also included participation from other returning investors such as Altimeter Capital, Dragoneer, IVP, Sequoia, Tiger Global, and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. The financing brings the New York-based company’s total raised to nearly $2 billion since inception, according to </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uipath/company_financials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UiPath was founded in 2005 but didn’t raise institutional capital until 2015, according to </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uipath#section-overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNBC </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/17/uipath-files-for-ipo-could-become-one-of-nycs-biggest-tech-companies.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in December that the company had annual revenue of about $360 million and over 6,300 customers including Amazon, Bank of America and Verizon.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UiPath’s self-proclaimed mission is “to unlock human creativity and ingenuity by enabling the Fully Automated Enterprise<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and empowering workers through automation.” Its Automation Platform aims to “transform the way humans work” by giving companies a way to build out and run automations across departments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in an effort to “automate millions of repetitive, mind-numbing tasks for business and government organizations all over the world, improving productivity, customer experience and employee job satisfaction.” Its goal is to give workers the mental energy and time to focus on more complex jobs. Competitors include Microsoft Power Automate, Blue Prism, Automation Anywhere. SAP also recently </span><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/robotic-process-automation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">entered the space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has been growing like crazy. Back when I covered its </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/ai-powered-uipath-scores-568m-at-7b-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$568 million Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in April of 2019, UiPath had 4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">00,000 users in 200 countries. At the time, the company said it had increased its annual recurring revenue (ARR) from $8 million in April 2017 to over $200 million. UiPath said then it had grown its headcount by 16 times over a two-year period, to more than 2,500 employees. It also hinted that it was considering an IPO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True to its word, UiPath in December submitted a draft registration to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering. So it’s especially interesting that it raised such a huge round now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some, UiPath’s going public could be the Snowflake IPO of 2021. Alternative payments provider Affirm followed a similar path recently — raising $500 million before filing for an IPO weeks later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UiPath declined to comment on its latest funding round beyond a </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005753/en/UiPath-Closes-750-Million-in-Series-F-Funding."><span style="font-weight: 400;">press release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In addition to AirPlay support for Fitness+, today’s iOS 14.5 developer beta is bringing some key new features to mobile operating system. At the top of the list is undoubtedly Apple Watch unlock for users wearing face coverings.</p>
<p>The long-awaited feature arrives a year or so into a pandemic that has made face masks a reality in parts of the world that previously had not seen wide scale adoption. The Apple Watch has, of course, long had the ability to unlock Macs, so this integration seems like a pretty sensible addition.</p>

<p>Starting with iOS 14.5, Apple Watch wearers will be able to opt-in to iPhone unlock under the phone’s Face ID &amp; Passcode settings. Once enabled, the Watch will give a haptic buzz to notify the wearer that the handset has been unlocked. The Watch needs to be unlocked, on a wrist and in close proximity to the iPhone in order to work.</p>
<p>It beats having to pull your mask down in public (even if some folks are still feeling nostalgic for Touch ID).</p>
<p>The addition should be included in the consumer version of the software when it launches. Also included are the ability to ask Siri to call emergency contacts and app tracking controls that require permissions from developers. Support for new Xbox and PlayStation game controllers has been added, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today<a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2021/02/01/azure-quantum-preview/"> announced</a> that <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/quantum/">Azure Quantum</a>, its cloud-based platform for using quantum hardware and software tools from partners like Honeywell Quantum Solutions, IonQ, 1QBit and others, is now in public preview. Azure Quantum went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/microsofts-quantum-computing-platform-is-now-in-limited-preview/">into limited preview</a> last May. At the time, it was only open to a small number of select Microsoft partners and customers, but starting today, anyone with an interest in quantum computing can start experimenting with the service.</p>
<p>The service offers a small free allowance to get started. After that, using it could get pricey pretty quickly, though. You can find the complete pricing chart <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/azure-quantum/">here</a>, but to use the system for trying out the basics, you&#8217;re looking at about $10 per compute hour.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s still early days in quantum computing, so building on a specific platform, be that Microsoft&#8217;s or that of competitors like IBM and Rigetti, means buying into a specific toolset as well. For Microsoft, that&#8217;s the open-source Quantum Development Kit and its Q# language, as well as its recently announced hardware-agnostic Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) intermediate language based on <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The transition to Public Preview of Azure Quantum is a key milestone for quantum computing and our ecosystem,&#8221; writes Krysta Svore, the GM of Microsoft Quantum &#8220;This continues the momentum we saw last year, which includes selection for the National Quantum Initiative Quantum Research Centers, the addition of new Azure Quantum partners, and hardware advances in scaling control circuitry for qubits.&#8221;</p>

<p>Microsoft&#8217;s own efforts to build a quantum computer haven&#8217;t resulted in a working qubit yet, but the company has made <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/full-stack-ahead-pioneering-quantum-hardware-allows-for-controlling-up-to-thousands-of-qubits-at-cryogenic-temperatures/">strides in other areas</a>. For the time being, though, Microsoft is betting on partnerships with other players in the space to power this platform. This also allows the company to claim that it offers the &#8220;world’s first full-stack, public cloud ecosystem for quantum solutions.&#8221;</p>
