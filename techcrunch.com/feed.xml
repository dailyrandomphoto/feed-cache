										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Federal Trade Commission appears to be preparing to consider a rule aimed at digital platforms that either invasively track their users or allow others to do so. The &#8220;Trade Regulation Rule on Commercial Surveillance&#8221; is at a very early stage but could be the first major anti-Big-Tech action by new FTC Chair Lina Khan.</p>
<p>It is currently only described in <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202110&amp;RIN=3084-AB69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Office of Management and Budget summary</a>, after the FTC submitted information to that agency on potential upcoming regulatory actions. According to the listing, the rule would &#8220;curb lax security practices, limit privacy abuses, and ensure that algorithmic decision-making does not result in unlawful discrimination.&#8221; There is no public draft of the rule and no indication of whether the rule-making is more than notional at this point.</p>
<p>An FTC spokesperson offered the following statement, but declined to comment further: &#8220;The FTC is prepared to use all of our tools to combat harmful commercial surveillance practices and protect Americans&#8217; privacy.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248263" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Senator Brian Schatz called attention to the filing, lauding the agency (perhaps a bit prematurely) for taking this on: &#8220;I’m glad to see Chair Khan and the agency take this step to crack down on companies using discriminatory algorithms. It’s crucial that we address this,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The rule-making would use the FTC&#8217;s Section 18 authority to regulate &#8220;Unfair or deceptive acts or practices,&#8221; which is an established source of authority for establishing a variety of requirements and prohibitions.</p>
<p>This rule could potentially be along the lines of the proposed (and discarded) Broadband Privacy Act, among other attempts to shield consumers from the hidden depredations of everything from social media companies to internet providers.</p>
<p>Of course the FTC cannot simply invent rules out of thin air — they do establish rules, but it&#8217;s often when a new or changing industry has managed to circumvent rules that already exist for good reason.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, if a yogurt label says it&#8217;s fat-free and testing shows it has fat, that&#8217;s obviously false advertising. But if a social media company says (as they often do) that you &#8220;own your data&#8221; or some such, but you can&#8217;t download it, prevent them from selling it or completely delete it from their platform, is <em>that</em> false advertising? It might not be until the FTC updates its rules and guidance to include the practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlawful discrimination&#8221; might also occur when an algorithm fed with badly configured data ends up favoring or disfavoring a group of people based on a protected status like religion, race or medical status. At present there is little in the way of formal requirements for vetting algorithms, as they and their sources are often trade secrets or otherwise shielded from public view and inquiry. An FTC rule could help make this a requirement rather than a voluntary action.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pUYjnqGfH2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">Biden elevates tech antitrust crusader Lina Khan to FTC chair</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Biden elevates tech antitrust crusader Lina Khan to FTC chair&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/embed/#?secret=pUYjnqGfH2" data-secret="pUYjnqGfH2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sometimes these efforts are backed up by legislation or executive action, and Khan certainly has something of a mandate from the White House to rein in Big Tech (her rapid ascendance from legal adviser to top of the heap is a strong endorsement of actions like this potential rule).</p>
<p>To be clear, at this point this is more or less a twinkle in the FTC&#8217;s eye, but the filing with the OMB does establish it as a likely priority in 2022 — an election year when the current administration would like to appear effective. Taking on Big Tech is one of very few bipartisan efforts extant so work on these lines could be a plank in a few political platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What if instead of watching your favorite TikTok star stream on Twitch, you could watch them play video games live on TikTok? For the last few days, according to the platform, TikTok has been testing a Windows program called <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/studio/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Live Studio</a>.</p>
<p>Once downloaded to your desktop, the program allows users to log in with their TikTok account and stream directly to TikTok Live. Within the program, you can communicate with viewers through the chat feature, and you can stream content from your computer, your phone or a gaming console. TikTok told TechCrunch that this program is currently available only in a handful of Western markets for a few thousand users.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; Zach Bussey (@zachbussey) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachbussey/status/1471172519226916865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>An obvious benefit for TikTok in testing this feature is that creators might be motivated to stay within their app, instead of asking their audience to watch them stream on Twitch or YouTube Gaming. From the look of TikTok&#8217;s promotional images, it seems that the company is catering toward people looking to stream video games. But in its nascent form, TikTok Live Studio lacks the features that seasoned streamers can find on broadcast software like OBS or Streamlabs &#8212; which makes sense, as the product is still in testing. For example, even though you can hook up a video game console to TikTok Live Studio, you can&#8217;t use browser windows as a source, and you can&#8217;t set up in-stream alerts for tips or new follows.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248267" style="width: 2890px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248267" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2248267 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png" alt="" width="2880" height="942" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=300,98 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=768,251 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=680,222 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=1536,502 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=2048,670 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/310ca031b66cac4cc9cf.png?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248267" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/studio/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Live Studio </a><span class="screen-reader-text"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/studio/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(opens in a new window)</a></span></p></div></p>
<p>But a goal of this feature test is to see how creators use the software. TikTok Live Studio isn&#8217;t guaranteed to roll out, the company told TechCrunch &#8212; whenever TikTok tests a feature, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s here to stay forever. But if we do see a true launch of TikTok Live Studio, the platform will study what creators are using the software for, then tailor it to better suit those use cases.</p>
<p>Already, creators are using TikTok&#8217;s livestreaming tools to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/tiktok-expands-live-platform-with-new-features-for-creators-and-fans/">monetize</a> and expand their followings. Creators can accept <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/live-gifting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tips</a>, schedule events, use live Q&amp;A tools, go live with other users, filter certain keywords and assign moderators. Right now, TikTok Live Studio allows users to choose whether they want to enable gifting and comments, and they can set up keyword filters. But other existing livestreaming features like assigning moderators and scheduling streams could potentially be incorporated into a future, more robust product.</p>
<p>This streaming software could also mark an opportunity for TikTok to reach more desktop users. For creators, a desktop streaming software is essential, since a smartphone simply isn&#8217;t built to connect to your gaming console and stream at the same time. Though people do watch video game streams on their phones, the user experience is generally better on desktop, which could help users create the habit of using TikTok on their computer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The trend that is instant grocery delivery &#8212; online ordering of essentials with your purchases being delivered to you in under an hour &#8212; continues to proliferate across multiple markets, and in the latest development, Sequoia is leading an investment in one out of Australia.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getvoly." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voly</a>, a five-month-old Sydney-based startup that offers thousands of SKUs and promises deliveries in 15 minutes at a flat fee of A$2.99 ($2.14), has raised A$18 million (just under $13 million at today&#8217;s rates) in a seed round of funding that it will be using to expand its business to cities and towns across the country.</p>
<p>In addition to Sequoia, by way of Sequoia Capital India, other investors in the round include Global Founders Capital (GFC) and Artesian Capital, an Australian firm; the latter two also previously backed Voly in a $1 million pre-seed round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248211" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At a time when the instant grocery market is very crowded in certain regions like Europe &#8212; where a number of local startups are coexisting and competing with some very heavily capitalised players with international ambitions like Gopuff, Gorillas, Flink and Getir &#8212; Voly has picked a ripe moment to ramp up in Australia.</p>
<p>The market for groceries in the country is estimated to be worth some A$90 billion ($64.6 billion) annually, but while there are some services for delivering so-called &#8220;big basket&#8221; purchases that are typically made weekly, the field appears to be pretty open for those offering deliveries in under an hour.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Instant delivery is still very revolutionary here,&#8221; Mark Heath, the co-CEO and co-founder, said in an interview earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were the country that got left behind by the other delivery startups,&#8221; joked Thibault Henry, the other founder and CEO. &#8220;We are a breath of fresh air.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It currently offers some 2,000 SKUs and the plan is to grow that to 3,000, with groceries and essentials also complemented by modular shopping that mimics the concept of meal kits: A customer can select recipes based on preparation time, and then buy the ingredients needed to make them.</p>
<p>Heath said this has helped the company market itself not just to the younger, urban-dwelling millennials that typical are the early adopters of instant grocery services; but also working parents &#8220;who still want to cook tasty food for their families.&#8221; Henry believes the typical Voly user will use its service several times a week.</p>
<p>That lack of competition could be one reason investors have been bullish on Voly; the other might be the track record of the founders.</p>
<p>Heath helped launch Uber in Australia heading up operations and logistics, and then he worked as the country manager for CloudKitchens. Henry, meanwhile founded and ran a last-mile refrigerated delivery startup, Balto Logistics, which racked up a long list of on-demand food delivery brands as customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Australia&#8217;s grocery market, which sees $90 billion in annual spends, is a large and profitable space that continues to be dominated by offline retail,&#8221; said Abheek Anand, MD, Sequoia India, in a statement. &#8220;The Sequoia Capital India team was impressed by the strong consumer love for VOLY, their compelling value proposition, and an impressive team of repeat founders that has blitzscaled businesses in Australia before. With on-demand models traditionally scaling very successfully in the country, the decision to lead their seed round and help them scale their business across Australia was an easy one to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Voly may be a very new and likely very small outfit &#8212; it&#8217;s not disclosing customer numbers but says that right now its growing at a rate of 100% each month &#8212; it&#8217;s indeed the collective experience and network that the two have that&#8217;s helping them build their platform and establish supply chains that don&#8217;t completely kill Voly on margins while still aiming to sell goods at retail, rather than marked-up, prices.</p>
<p class="p1">Another point of distinction in how Voly is growing is that it&#8217;s choosing to make its drivers full-time employees rather than contractors. &#8220;That&#8217;s our choice,&#8221; Heath said. &#8220;Uber and DoorDash are gig economy companies. We&#8217;ve chosen a different model.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ubqmaterials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UBQ Materials</a>, which claims it has developed a plastic-like material made from 100% unsorted household waste, has raised a $170 million funding round led by TPG Rise, TPG’s global impact investing platform, made through TPG Rise Climate, the firm’s dedicated climate investing fund, and The Rise Funds, its multisector impact investing fund.</p>
<p>The financing round also included participation from existing investor, Battery Ventures, and others including M&amp;G’s Catalyst strategy, a U.K.-based investor.</p>
<p>UBQ Materials says it can turn landfill-destined municipal solid waste, including all organics, into recyclable plastic substitute. Its “UBQ” product can then be used both on its own and in conjunction with conventional oil-based resins in construction, automotive, logistics, retail and even 3D printing, it says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248295" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Steve Ellis, co-managing partner of The Rise Funds said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to converting municipal waste into functional thermal plastics, UBQ’s material solution is energy efficient, uses no water and produces no effluents UBQ can be utilized in a broad array of industrial and consumer applications.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company is vague on how it achieves all this but we will be following its claims with interest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year, we&#8217;ve seen plenty of evidence that NFTs can shake up the economics of selling visual art, but there&#8217;s been less activity when it comes to web3 upending the economics of different verticals in the art world, including music.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sound.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sound.xyz</a> is a new startup looking to help recording artists monetize their community through NFTs, as the startup looks to build out a suite of tools designed to bring musicians into the so-called &#8220;web3&#8221; fold. The startup released is first product earlier this month, Listening Parties, which enable artists to sell NFTs tagged to the release of new songs.</p>
<p>The startup tells TechCrunch it has raised $5 million in a seed raise led by Andreessen Horowitz. Other investors in the round include Variant Fund, Weekend Fund, Scalar Capital, Flamingo, Packy McCormick and 21 Savage, among others.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248140" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup is looking to push emerging artists to monetize their work more effectively by leveraging NFTs and help them rise above earning minute fractions of pennies per stream on platforms like Spotify.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building a suite of economic tools to help artists monetize their songs in new ways,&#8221; Sound CEO David Greenstein tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The problems that we want to solve are: Can we get music heard and can we get artists paid?&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup has partnered with a number of &#8220;crypto-friendly&#8221; recording artists that have been engaging with the community. The early drops have been limited to a couple dozen limited-edition NFTs that have sold out instantly.  While selling $10,000 worth of NFTs may not sound too noteworthy in an industry friendly to million-dollar sales, Greenstein says the proceeds make a big difference to artists who might need hundreds of thousands of streams to earn that same amount on Spotify. As the startup gauges demand for NFT drops tied to song drops for certain artists, they have ambition to release more NFTs to the community. The startup notably does not take a commission on the sales and the NFTs.</p>
<p>The team has been experimenting with other features for the drops like enabling NFT holders to leave comments on the streams for artists to read. Down the road, the startup wants to create broader tools that allow musicians to crowdfund from fans to create new works and tackle new projects while also creating new incentive models for curators to discover and showcase new music.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sound is not the only player in the NFT music space. Last month, a16z Crypto backed <a href="https://royal.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Royal</a>, an NFT music platform looking to tokenize royalties and sell them to fans. <a href="https://audius.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audius</a>, a music-streaming platform on the blockchain, has raised over $13.5 million in funding from firms including General Catalyst and Coinbase Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investment from VC and PE into climate tech is booming, reaching $87.5bn over H2 2020 and H1 2021, with in excess of $60bn in the first half of 2021 alone, according to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/climatetech">a new report from PWC</a>.</p>
<p>This is a 210% increase from the $28.4bn invested in the 12 months prior. Some 14¢ of every dollar of VC now going to climate tech.</p>
<p>However, not all is rosy. The investment is mostly focused on technology solutions accounting for 20% of emissions reduction potential. So PWC says there is an opportunity to shift the focus to areas and technologies with a more direct impact on emissions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248277" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>And despite this overall growth, the number of early VC, seed, and Series A investments in climate tech has remained largely stagnant since 2018.</p>
<p>Of 15 solutions analyzed, the top five, representing more than 80% of emissions reduction potential by 2050, received just 25% of the climate tech investment between 2013 and H1 2021.  </p>
<p>In other words, VC needs to put more into directly affecting emission, not just SaaS platforms etc which track them.</p>
<p>Emma Cox, Global Climate Leader, PwC UK, said: “The world has 10 years to halve global greenhouse emissions if we are to have hope of achieving net-zero by 2050… However, our research has found there is potential to better channel and incentivize investment in technology areas that have the greatest future emissions reduction potential. This raises the question of why these sectors are missing out – are investors missing a valuable opportunity or is there an incentive problem that needs the attention of policymakers?”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Climate tech encompasses technologies focused on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Climate tech investment plateaued in 2018-2020, but has rebounded in the first half of 2021 driven by a refreshed focus on ESG in private markets, emerging regulations and standards, and more companies committing to net-zero strategies.</p>
<p>Here are some extracts from PWC’s report:</p>
<blockquote><p>    •   The average climate tech deal size nearly quadrupled in H1 2021 to US$96M, from US$27M one year prior.  <br />
    •   About 1,600 investors were active in H1 2021, compared to fewer than 900 active investors in H1 2020 as the wider investment community becomes familiar with the opportunities in climate tech as an asset class. <br />
    •   SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) were tested to further stimulate climate tech’s growth and raised US$25bn in H1 2021, accounting for more than a third of all funding. <br />
    •   Mobility and Transport continues to receive the lion’s share of climate tech funding as electric vehicles (EVs), micro-mobility and other innovative transit models attract investor attention.  This challenge area raised nearlyUS$58bn between H2 2020 and H1 2021, representing two-thirds of total climate tech funding raised in the period. <br />
    •   Mobility and Transport, Industry, Manufacturing and Resource management (IM&#038;R) and Financial Services saw the fastest growth year over year between H2 2019 &#8211; H1 2021, each more than 260%, reaching US$58bn, US$6.9bn and US$1.2bn respectively.  <br />
    •   The top five technologies representing over 80% of future emissions reduction potential include: Solar Power, Wind Power, Food Waste Technology, Green Hydrogen Production, and Alternative Foods/Low GHG Proteins. </p></blockquote>
<p>PWC said the United States leads in climate tech investing, attracting nearly 65% of VC investment, $56.6bn from H2 2020 to H1 2021. China is estimated to have seen $9bn in climate tech investment in the same period, while Europe totaled $18.3bn, driven by a nearly 500% (494%) increase in Mobility and Transport in H2 2020 and H1 2021, compared to the prior 12 month period.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Meta is expanding its bug bounty program to reward researchers who report data scraping. The change will allow researchers to report both bugs that could enable scraping activity, as well as previously scraped data that has already been published online.</p>
<p>In a blog post, Meta says it believes it is the first to launch a bug bounty program to specifically target scraping activity. “We&#8217;re looking to find vulnerabilities that enable attackers to bypass scraping limitations to access data at greater scale than what we initially intended,” Security Engineering Manager Dan Gurfinkle told reports during a briefing.</p>
<p>Data scraping is different than other “malicious” activity Meta tracks as it uses automated tools to mass-collect personal information from users’ profiles, such as email addresses, phone numbers, profile photos and other details. Even though users often willingly share this information on their public Facebook profiles, scrapers can expose these details more widely, such as publishing the information in searchable databases.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248242" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It can also be difficult for Meta to combat this activity. For example, in April the personal information of more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-533-million-user-personal-data-leak-180156777.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><ins>500 million</ins></a> Facebook users was published on a forum. In that case, the actual data scraping had occurred years prior, and the company had already addressed the underlying flaw. But there was little it could do once the data started circulating online. In some cases, the company has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-lawsuit-instagram-profile-scraping-220032564.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><ins>also</ins></a> <a href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><ins>sued</ins></a> individuals for data scraping.</p>
<p>Under the new bug bounty program, researchers will be rewarded for finding “unprotected or openly public databases containing at least 100,000 unique Facebook user records with PII [personally identifiable information] or sensitive data (e.g. email, phone number, physical address, religious or political affiliation).” Instead of its usual payouts though, Meta says it will donate to a charity chosen by the researcher in order not to incentivize the publishing of scraped data.</p>
<p>For reports of bugs that can lead to data scraping, researchers can choose between a donation or a direct payout. Meta says each bug or dataset is eligible for at least a $500 award.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stanford’s made a lot of progress over the years with its gecko-inspired robotic hand. In May, a version of the “gecko gripper” even found its way onto the International Space Station to test its ability to perform tasks like collecting debris and fixing satellites.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.abi9773" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a paper published today in Science Robotics</a>, researchers at the university are demonstrating a far more terrestrial application for the tech: picking delicate objects. It’s something that’s long been a challenge for rigid robot hands, leading to a wide range of different solutions, including soft robotic grippers.</p>
<p>The team is showing off FarmHand, a four-fingered gripper inspired by both the dexterity of the human hand and the unique gripping capabilities of geckos. Of the latter, Stanford notes that the adhesive surface “creates a strong hold via microscopic flaps &#8212; Van der Waals force – a weak intermolecular force that results from subtle differences in the positions of electrons on the outsides of molecules.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248205" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/km_M9KyTpsY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The team refers to the issue at hand as the “heirloom tomato problem.” Specifically, standard grippers are best suited to the repetitive task of picking up similarly sized hard objects, one after another. In tests, FarmHand has worked with bunches of grapes, uncooked eggs, basketballs and plates, among others.</p>
<p>“You’ll see robotic hands do a power grasp and a precision grasp and then kind of imply that they can do everything in between,” said Biomimetics and Dextrous Manipulation Lab grad Wilson Ruotolo. “What we wanted to address is how to create manipulators that are both dexterous and strong at the same time.”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 2021 H-1B lottery process has been quite a rollercoaster! </strong></p>
<p><strong>We sponsored several people in this year’s lottery. One of our registrants was selected in the first round in March, but none were selected in the second round in July. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We just found out another of our registrants was selected in November, however, he’s from South Africa and restricted from traveling to the U.S. due to Omicron. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What should we do? Any suggestions for what to do about our other prospective hires who didn’t get selected?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Eager Employer</strong></p>
<p>Dear Eager,</p>
<p>Congrats on getting two of your registrants selected in the most recent year’s H-1B lottery! Our clients had many candidates who got selected in subsequent selection rounds as well. This year’s H-1B lottery was a drawn-out process, and it’s great to see that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is committed to reaching the 85,000 H-1B cap. I touched on this in a recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/101-the-immigration-outlook-for-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a> in which I talked about immigration changes and trends I expect to see in the year ahead.</p>
<p>I’m anticipating that granting as many of the 85,000 H-1B visas as possible each year will continue to be a priority for the Biden administration. To reduce immigration backlogs, they are working to rebuild resources and staffing levels at USCIS and the U.S. Department of State that had been gutted during the previous four years.</p>

<h2>The new travel ban</h2>
<p>As you know, the Biden administration instituted a travel policy on Nov. 29 due to the Omicron variant. The most recent policy bars individuals who have been in South Africa, as well as Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe within the previous 14 days from entering the United States. U.S. citizens, permanent residents and the spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents are exempted from this new travel ban.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of its recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">2022 lineup</a>, Volvo subsidiary Polestar introduced a new single-motor variant of its Polestar 2 electric sedan. If you were waiting on an EPA estimate before reserving one, wait no more. You can expect to get about 270 miles of range on a single charge from the car’s 75 kWh battery, Polestar announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>That puts the FWD model in the company of vehicles like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Volkswagen ID.4</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-3-2021-refresh-offers-more-range-and-other-improvements-114539380.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Model 3</a>. With the entry-level models of those two cars, you can expect 249 miles and 263 miles of range, respectively. That’s not bad given the Polestar 2’s $47,200 starting price, but not nearly as good as the 303 miles of EPA-rated range Hyundai will offer with the $44,875 version of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-300-mile-ioniq-5-crossover-ev-makes-its-official-north-american-debut-190054008.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Ioniq 5</a>.</p>
<p>The automaker also announced today it’s rolling out an over-the-air update for all Polestar 2 vehicles. The new software allows you to schedule when you want your car to charge, so that you can take advantage of off-peak pricing. The update also includes refinements for the car’s driver-assist systems. In the coming months, Polestar plans to release a software upgrade that will allow owners of the dual-motor Polestar 2 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-over-the-air-update-torque-horsepower-acceleration-151000748.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">unlock additional torque and horsepower</a> from their car for a fee.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248228" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Katie Haun, who co-leads Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s $2.2 billion crypto fund, is splitting off from the firm and taking a number of colleagues with her &#8212; including operating partner Rachael Horwitz &#8212; to start a new crypto-centric fund, <a href="https://www.axios.com/crypto-investor-katie-haun-leave-andreessen-horowitz-e11aa2f2-6ad9-4b27-abb4-b44e461174ec.html">Axios</a> reports.</p>
<p>Haun <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/andreessen-horowitz-has-a-new-crypto-fund-and-its-first-female-general-partner-is-running-it-with-chris-dixon/">joined the firm in 2018</a> after a career as a federal prosecutor for the Justice Department working on cyber crimes. She has been a highly visible public face for the firm&#8217;s crypto efforts, discussing the regulatory landscape of the industry at events like TechCrunch Disrupt.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the firm confirmed the news to TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248185" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz has grown to be a major presence in the crypto investment world as they&#8217;ve rapidly deployed capital into a number of startups in the space. They were an early mover with their first $300 million crypto investment fund in 2018, which they have since followed up with two larger funds, including their current vehicle, the $2.2 billion Fund III.</p>
<p>Haun has co-led the fund alongside long-time a16z GP Chris Dixon. The firm has maintained its edge among legacy firms but is seeing increased competition among a swatch of so-called &#8220;crypto native&#8221; investment funds like Paradigm and Variant Fund. Paradigm recently closed a $2.5 billion crypto fund, the largest of its kind.</p>
<p>Haun currently site on the boards of Coinbase and OpenSea, among others, where she is expected to retain her board seats. Andreessen Horowitz will be a large limited partner in her fund alongside personal investments from Andreessen, Horowitz, and Dixon. Haun notified her colleagues of the departure earlier today.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be forever grateful to Chris, Marc, and Ben for believing in me early on. Our work together and your continued support have been invaluable. Thank you for cheering me on and supporting me in this new chapter,&#8221; an emailed statement from Haun reads, in part.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A team at Google is today launching a new service called <a href="https://qaya.area120.google.com/">Qaya</a>, which will allow creators to easily set up new web storefronts where they can sell their products and services directly to their audiences. The project is the latest to emerge from Google&#8217;s in-house project incubator, Area 120, which was recently a part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/google-reorg-moves-ar-vr-starline-and-area-120-into-new-labs-team-reporting-directly-to-sundar-pichai/">reorganization</a> at the company that elevated its status after many of its earlier projects exited to different parts of Google, including its Cloud, Search, Shopping and Commerce divisions.</p>
<p>The new project, Qaya, was co-founded by Nathaniel Naddaff-Hafrey, a founder-in-residence at Area 120 who previously worked on <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/03/11/google-area-120-kormo-job-seekers/">jobs marketplace</a> Kormo aimed at the &#8220;next billion&#8221; internet users, specifically those in markets like India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>After hearing from dozens of creators about how difficult and time-consuming it is to build their digital businesses, he got the idea for <a href="https://qaya.area120.google.com/">Qaya</a>, a service that would allow them to sell directly to fans. Several other members on the Qaya team are also creators, who bring with them their own experiences with existing creator tools. They understood from their own efforts and other creators they spoke to, there&#8217;s demand for a flexible, no-code product that could function as a one-stop-shop where creators can make money from their work and better connect with their audience.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248079" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Qaya&#8217;s solution allows creators to build personalized web storefronts featuring their products and services, and other digital downloads, which can then be linked to their YouTube Merch Shelf, and integrated with Google Search and Google Shopping. Through these stores, creators could include things like photos, files or ebooks, digital art, photo filters and presets, productivity templates, knitting patterns, fitness videos and much more. The company says up to 1,000 products can be hosted per storefront.</p>

<p>In addition, if the creator sells physical goods or services on other platforms, an import function will allow them to feature these items on their Qaya page, complete with their own personal branding.</p>
<p>Each store also gets its own custom URL in the form of qaya.store/your-name or yourname.channel, which could be used in place of the links they place on social media sites created with the &#8220;link in bio&#8221; solutions available today like <a href="https://linktr.ee/">Linktree</a> or <a href="https://beacons.ai/">Beacons</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These services let creators build micro-websites pointing to their various online presences, including social media channels, shops, blogs, music or podcasts, and more.</p>
<p>And like those services, the Qaya stores also allow creators to feature links to their other online profiles, which sit at the top of the page underneath the creator&#8217;s name and bio. But the larger purpose of the site is to connect fans directly to the content the creator has for sale, not just as a landing page to connect fans to the creator&#8217;s profile on other services.</p>
<p>Google Pay is built into Qaya, and supports a variety of monetization types including subscription, tipping, and one-time payments. Qaya also offers insights and analytics about how the creators&#8217; products are performing in terms of sales.</p>
<p>Currently, the product is free to use with monetization managed on a transactional basis. That is, creators will keep the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of the revenue they generate from products they upload and sell on Qaya, notes Google.</p>

<p>The company is now rolling out the YouTube Merch Shelf integrations for eligible YouTube creators who join Qaya&#8217;s beta, and in time, hints that Qaya aims to allow creators to sell even more products, including &#8220;other types of digital goods,&#8221; which sounds like a veiled reference to NFTs, though Google isn&#8217;t yet saying if that&#8217;s the case.</p>

<p>Google says the new service is launching today into beta testing in the U.S., though non-U.S. users can join a waitlist while they wait for Qaya to roll out to their country. Creators who want to gain access to Qaya&#8217;s beta can request an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrnVCQI8oBzWv3NyQOcSnHBUbFlOgnv25nJx-sXrDxwa63Xg/viewform">invitation</a> from the Qaya website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wonderdynamics.com/">Wonder Dynamics</a> aims to make &#8220;blockbuster-level&#8221; visual effects achievable by living-room-level creators using AI and cloud services, though it has kept its product closely under wraps. The secretive company, which boasts a star-studded set of advisors, has raised a $10M A round ahead of a planned launch later in 2022.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Nikola Todorovic and actor Tye Sheridan; they joined forces some years back after working on a film together and finding they shared a belief in democratizing cinema tools. Of course many tools have come down in price and difficulty, such as high-resolution cameras and the computing power to edit and color footage.</p>
<p>But serious VFX are another matter, and the higher fidelity of today&#8217;s cameras and displays demand improved quality in CG, something that has kept the cost and barrier to entry high.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248127" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wonder Dynamics is a VFX platform that utilizes AI and cloud services to make these things easier, though exactly how is still something of a secret.</p>
<p>&#8220;The platform uses a completely new process, and it is an end-to-end solution for content creators who lack the technical knowledge necessary to produce CG and VFX content,&#8221; explained Todorovic. &#8220;For the professional artist, the output is exportable into existing workflow and software (Unreal, Blender, Maya, etc.). It is focused on post-production, but it will drastically reduce the need for hardware, equipment and additional effort in production as it exists today.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="521nwT9hCi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/wonder-dynamics-raises-2-5m-seed-to-equip-indie-filmmakers-with-ai-powered-vfx/">Wonder Dynamics raises $2.5M seed to equip indie filmmakers with AI-powered VFX</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wonder Dynamics raises $2.5M seed to equip indie filmmakers with AI-powered VFX&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/wonder-dynamics-raises-2-5m-seed-to-equip-indie-filmmakers-with-ai-powered-vfx/embed/#?secret=521nwT9hCi" data-secret="521nwT9hCi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll know more when they debut the platform at SXSW in 2022, but until then skeptics might be comforted by the presence of Steven Spielberg and Joe Russo on its advisory board. Both are of course seasoned directors and picky about the looks of their films; Russo (and his brother Anthony Russo) in particular is known for preferring practical effects to CG where the latter is not absolutely required, so his support is notable.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we got deeper into our development we knew that this could be more than just software for Visual Effects,&#8221; said Sheridan in a press release. &#8220;Our platform can be used for film and TV, but also video games, social media content, and even the Metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latter provides additional justification for two of the new investors, Epic Games and Samsung Next. Horizon Ventures led the $10M round, with seed round investors Founders Fund and MaC Venture Capital returning as well.</p>

<h2>AirTags</h2>

<p>Earlier this year, Apple debuted the AirTag — a little puck-shaped widget meant to be thrown into your bag or attached to your keys to track their location. Know your bag is in the house somewhere but just can&#8217;t find it? Tap a button, make it beep.</p>
<p>And, well, these things are quite good! I bought four expecting to not find a use for all of them, then pretty much immediately went back and bought four more. I put one in my wallet, one in my pool bag, one in my favorite jacket so I never lose it at a party, one in my car because I&#8217;m bad at parking lots and more. The battery lasts a long time and is easily replaceable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One catch: They really only work with iOS devices, so consider alternatives for Android users.</p>

<p>Apple didn&#8217;t invent the concept of fully wireless headphones with the AirPods — but they definitely helped to explode the category.</p>
<p>Lots of competition has since hit the market, much of it worth checking out. Our own Brian Heater <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/nothing-ear-1-review/">checked out Nothing&#8217;s $99 Ear (1) buds</a> (pictured above) and found them to be &#8220;solid&#8221;; Jabra&#8217;s Elite 3 in-ear wireless buds, meanwhile, are basic (don&#8217;t expect much in the way of noise cancellation) but good.</p>
<p>If they specifically asked for AirPods, you&#8217;re gonna have to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PXGQC1Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07PXGQC1Q&amp;linkId=7234e5c616800e4404be43d347e2aaa6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jump back a generation to get&#8217;em for under $100</a>. Gen 2 AirPods are still quite good, but compared to Gen 3 they&#8217;ve got a different design, weaker battery life, no water resistance and a few other key differences.</p>

<p>I started tinkering with Philips Hue smart bulbs a few years ago, and they&#8217;re slowly taking over my house. They&#8217;re a dead simple and relatively affordable way to make any room feel <em>way</em> fancier, allowing you to tweak the lighting (brightness, color, temperature, etc.) in an instant with your phone or, if you&#8217;ve got smart speakers around your house, your voice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a dozen of them around my house now and they&#8217;ve been absolutely rock solid for years. Want more smart home gift ideas? Check out our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/smart-home-gift-guide-ideas/">smart home starter guide</a> here.</p>

<p>There are a zillion e-book readers out there … but, for most people, and as much as it pains me, it&#8217;s hard to recommend anything over a Kindle. They&#8217;re well built, polished and the process of getting a book onto it is about as simple as could be.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re trying to stay under $100, the $75 base model Kindle will get the job done. You won&#8217;t get the waterproofing or much brighter LEDs of the $140 Kindle Paperwhite or the $250 Kindle Oasis … but if what you want is a device that&#8217;ll let you carry around a zillion books at once with a battery that lasts days/weeks, the base model checks all the boxes. Plus, if ads on the home screen don&#8217;t seem like a big deal, they&#8217;ll cut the price down to $55.</p>

<p>The charging cables that come with most phones aren&#8217;t great. They&#8217;re too quick to fall apart, and way too short — especially if you like to look at your phone in bed. Is looking at your phone in bed a good idea? Nope! Do we all do it anyway? Yep!</p>
<p>Anker&#8217;s woven cables are a huge step up. They&#8217;re nice and long (6-10 ft), come in lightning or USB-C forms, and the woven nylon cable lasts <em>way</em> longer, in my experience, than the quick-to-fray plastic of the included cables. I keep a few of these around as stocking stuffers and back up gifts.</p>

<p>Speaking of Anker, I&#8217;m a big fan of their PowerCore Fusion backup battery.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the highest-capacity backup battery by any means, but it&#8217;s got a neat trick: It&#8217;s a wall charger <em>and</em> a backup battery, all-in-one. It&#8217;ll charge your phone first, then charge its own internal 10,000 mAh battery — so, assuming you use it as your regular charger, you&#8217;ll never reach for your backup battery to find that it, too, is dead. This thing has earned a forever spot in my travel bag and has saved my butt multiple times.</p>

<p>I friggin&#8217; love streaming sticks. They&#8217;re ridiculously affordable for all the services they can push to your TV (Netflix! Hulu! Paramount+! Disney+! HBO Max!) and are almost always far <em>far</em> better than the apps built into most smart TVs.</p>
<p>I like the Chromecast a lot — both the standard $30 Chromecast and the $40 Chromecast with Google TV — because I primarily control my TV through apps on my phone. If you want 4K support, Apple TV+ support, or a remote control, go with the latter option.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Amazon&#8217;s Firestick range and Roku&#8217;s streaming sticks are all quite good.</p>

<p>Basically a Google smart speaker with a display, the Nest Hub hits far above its weight. I put one in my kitchen a year or so back and now use it almost every time I cook — for asking Google &#8220;what temperature is medium rare?&#8221; for the 37th time, starting timers without touching anything or for playing something from Hulu (read: &#8220;Bob&#8217;s Burgers.&#8221; Always &#8220;Bob&#8217;s Burgers&#8221;) when making a recipe I&#8217;ve made a million times before. Plus it&#8217;s on sale right now.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been driving <em>way less</em> since the pandemic started. No commute/less socializing will do that.</p>
<p>The unexpected side effect? My podcast listening time plummeted. Turns out I really only listened to podcasts in the car or on the bus.</p>
<p>A few months back, though, I started listening to podcasts in the shower with one of these simple-but-solid JBL GO 2 waterproof speakers, and I love it. It takes me like four showers to get through an episode I used to listen to in one commute, but hey — I&#8217;m back to listening!</p>
<p>I tend to just throw this speaker in my bag and take it with me wherever; something I can&#8217;t say of the many, many Bluetooth speakers I&#8217;ve owned before it. It&#8217;s small, feels indestructible, the battery life is good enough that I don&#8217;t really worry about it and it&#8217;s loud enough to provide tunes at a picnic without annoying everyone else at the park.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The challenges facing the U.S. transportation system are plentiful and worsen each year. As demand on our nation’s roadways increases, so do safety, efficiency and sustainability issues.</p>
<p>The historic $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, one of the largest and wide-reaching infrastructure packages in decades, is a massive down payment on the investment needs of the nation and will unlock thousands of important projects in every state. But public funds alone, especially when allocated over a period of five years, are insufficient to keep pace with the emerging needs of our population, cities and the vehicles that travel the roads every day.</p>
<p>For example, the plan allocates $100 billion for repairing aging and dilapidated highways, bridges and roads. Unfortunately, the U.S. has underfunded its roadways for years, leaving 43% of our public roadways in poor or mediocre condition and resulting <a href="https://infrastructurereportcard.org/cat-item/roads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a backlog of $435 billion in road repair needs</a>. Even with public funds dedicated to repairing our roads, we’re still behind where we need to be.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247975" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The transportation infrastructure industry has historically been risk-averse and limited by the availability of public transportation funds. However, there are several historic examples of early technology networks that we all rely on to this day that have had dramatic impacts on the national economy. These projects were spurred by public investment, required local implementation by local public works agencies, and were largely delivered and maintained by private organizations.</p>
<p>Paved roads were introduced a little more than 100 years ago to support the early automobile. The interstate system has been known as the <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/homepage.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;greatest public works project in history&#8221;</a> since President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. It’s a means of everyday travel, commerce and culture.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t be reading this article on a computer, tablet or smartphone screen without the benefits afforded by the national power grid, cable and cell networks. As we rely upon, trust and relinquish more of our lives to technology, a growing number of transportation researchers and smart infrastructure providers are embracing creative new methods of improving safety, efficiency and sustainability.</p>
<p>There are more than 4 million miles of public roadways crisscrossing the United States. Smart roads are an obvious, accessible solution to transform infrastructure for the next generation of vehicles, people and cities. Too often we invent new technology to improve old technology. Transforming roads into networks is a solution that <em>enables</em> technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By transforming roads into a data and communications platform, we can collect anonymous data brick-and-mortar stores can use to have the same level of insight for vehicle traffic as online retailers get from internet traffic. Online retailers are informed about their customers’ demographics, shopping and buying habits, market trends and traffic patterns because traffic data is automatically and passively collected because of internet infrastructure and services.</p>
<p>Comparatively, brick-and-mortar stores essentially know nothing about their customer base. The entrepreneur invests millions into the local economy after spending months finding and fitting out a location, stocking and staffing it, all before a single transaction can be made. The anonymous data collected from roadways can help business owners improve their operations and enable traditional retailers to remain competitive with online retailers.</p>
<p>If we leverage these smart infrastructure services, roads can pay for themselves by relying on the cash flow from these new capabilities — much like cell and internet infrastructure markets have been mostly self-supporting. This means some public roads can be sustainably financed and self-funding, which allows cities to shift their limited budgets away from roads and toward other community needs.</p>
<p>The infrastructure plan’s $65 billion for broadband access would aim to improve internet services for rural areas, low-income families and tribal communities. The plan’s $7.5 billion allocated for electric vehicle charging stations aims to accelerate electric vehicle adoption to help curb climate change and reduce the nation’s dependence on oil.</p>
<p>If smart roads offered a menu of capabilities, including 5G wireless access and wireless EV charging, designed from the outset to be software-upgradeable, our nation’s road networks would be able to keep pace with evolving technology. Roads are already available in rural areas, so there&#8217;s no need to construct new cell towers. Embedding the roads with wireless EV charging capabilities would eliminate the need for charging stations to follow a gas station model — in fact, EV owners and drivers wouldn’t have to pull off the road and plug in to charge at all.</p>
<p>Assessing fees for the use of the commercial services delivered via these roadways &#8212; whether for communication services paid for by network operators, EV charging and navigation paid for by the vehicle owners, or data services paid for by the businesses that use them &#8212; enable smart roads to pay for themselves by relying on the cash flow from these new capabilities.</p>
<p>The main challenge to the adoption of smart roads is that public owners have gotten into the mindset that they cannot, and should not, take risks with public money. Historically, public money is risk capital and the first money in on these opportunities. We must get public owners out of this risk-free mindset and battle the idea that public agencies cannot or should not enable economic development through infrastructure.</p>
<p>Putting public investment into infrastructure opportunities that enable massive economic development is how we got paved roads 100 years ago and interstates 60 years ago. Therefore, it’s an approach that’s already been vetted and with some notable proof points that Americans are using every day. These aren&#8217;t new ways of doing things. These are old ways of doing things we&#8217;ve done many times, packaged in an updated way for the emerging needs of society.</p>
<p>Another challenge is how prolonged public projects are compared to market activities. In the 18 months it takes a public agency to issue a road work permit, we can see an entire generation of software and hardware pass by but not a single shovel has hit the ground. The slow pace of public works means we must look far, far ahead. We can&#8217;t focus on short-term goals because those will be gone before the project leaves the design stage. Public works&#8217; scope, scale and speed (or lack thereof) means we must take an extremely long time horizon.</p>
<p>Investing in our nation’s roadways is key to growing a thriving economy and critical to our future. Today, cities face pressure to respond to urbanization, streamline traffic flow, reduce pollution and help improve safety.</p>
<p>Smart road technology helps city planners and governments address these challenges head-on. From traffic management to pedestrian and vehicle safety to environmental monitoring, the Internet of Things (IoT) is making roadways more intelligent, efficient and well managed.</p>
<p>The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a first step to help tackle the current state of our nation’s infrastructure. How this investment is used will be the change-maker. If it is distributed to apply Band-Aid solutions on aging processes simply because it’s how things have been done in recent years, then the money will go fast and soon be forgotten without any meaningful improvements.</p>
<p>But suppose we use this investment as a down payment on innovative infrastructure projects. In that case, we have an opportunity to build the proper cadence of consistent and meaningful upgrades that progress toward a stronger future and allow emerging technologies to be integrated easier and at a faster rate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sqream.com/">SQream</a>, a <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3835636,00.html">well-funded</a> Israel-based data analytics platform, today <a href="https://blog.panoply.io/panoply-has-joined-the-sqream-data-family">announced</a> that it has acquired no-code data platform <a href="https://panoply.io/">Panoply</a> in an effort to expand its cloud services.</p>
<p>At the core of SQream&#8217;s service is its GPU-centric &#8220;<a href="https://sqream.com/product/data-acceleration-platform/">data acceleration platform</a>,&#8221; which promises to speed up SQL queries and enable users to run their queries on more data. Panoply, on the other hand, offers its users a no-code data integration platform with support for over 300 different sources, which its users can then query in their favorite BI and analytics tools, or analyze using SQL queries in Panoply itself. In addition, Panoply also helps its users automate their data warehouse configurations. As such, it looks like the two platforms are quite complementary, with Panoply providing SQream with the tools and expertise to expand its platform to a wider user base.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a significant step towards implementing SQream’s vision to provide our customers with the fastest data analytics platform in the industry, at any scale of data for multi-size enterprises, and in any environment &#8212; cloud, on prem and on the edge,&#8221; said SQream co-founder and CEO Ami Gal. &#8220;With Panoply’s acquisition, we are combining SQream&#8217;s GPU-powered, cutting edge technology with Panoply’s phenomenal ease of use and seamless integration and onboarding. This is a huge milestone on our journey to provide the world with the new category of analytics platform that is ready for tomorrow’s data challenges.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248072" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Panoply raised $24 million in outside capital since its inception in 2015. Investors include the likes of Ibex Investors and C5 Captial, which led the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/panoply-raises-10m-for-its-cloud-data-platform/">$10 million round</a> in 2020, as well as Blumberg Capital, 500 Startups, FundersGuild and Intel Capital. The two companies did not disclose the price of today&#8217;s acquisition.</p>
<p>Panoply will continue to operate as a separate business unit, but as Panoply co-founder and CEO Yaniv Leven notes in today&#8217;s announcement, the acquisition means that the 160+ strong team will now have access to additional resources and expertise. SQream says it has &#8220;ambition growth plans&#8221; for the service in order to meet demand for the platform&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since our inception, we’ve taken a different approach to cloud analytics,&#8221; Leven. &#8220;We’ve made it our mission to transform the focus of cloud architecture from data-centric to information-centric, by focusing on the insights you can gain from your data, rather than just the technical process of moving and storing it. SQream’s focus on driving fast data insights echoes this mission. The synergy between SQream and Panoply holds great promise for data practitioners as it expands Panoply’s reach to a wider audience and provides Panoply’s advantages of automation, no-code and simplicity to larger and larger organizations.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Olist said it tripled its size in 2021 and closed on four acquisitions within the last year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.olist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olist</a>, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace integrator, confirmed it is now valued at $1.5 billion after securing $186 million in Series E funding, led by Wellington Management.</p>
<p>The new round follows quickly behind a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/goldman-sachs-leads-23m-in-funding-for-brazilian-e-commerce-startup-olist/">$23 million Series D extension</a> the company announced in April, led by new investor Goldman Sachs Asset Management to bring its total Series D financing to $80 million.</p>
<p>It was then we profiled Olist, which connects small businesses to larger product marketplaces to help entrepreneurs sell their products to a broader customer base. Its technology enables small merchants to gain market share across the country through a SaaS licensing model to small brick and mortar businesses.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248119" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Joining Wellington in the round were funds managed by SoftBank, Corton Capital, Valor Capital Group, Goldman Sachs, Globo Ventures and Kevin Efrusy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Olist said it tripled its size in 2021 and closed on four acquisitions within the last year, including social commerce startup Clickspace, logistics company PAX and VNDA and Tiny ERP, both offering commerce tools for small businesses.</p>
<p>“With more than 45,000 shopkeepers and retailers as clients, Olist has always been at the forefront of digital retail, long before the e-commerce hype that helped drive the search for our solutions,” said Tiago Dalvi, founder and CEO of Olist, in a written statement. “With this new round, we want to go beyond what we do today and deliver more and more value to our customers.”</p>
<p>In fact, the company wants to go beyond marketplaces, and the new capital will enable it to offer a fulfillment operation, set to open early next year, and financial services. Retailers on Olist already have access to credit lines for working capital, but the company plans to expand that technology to include risk management, accelerated sales and internal credit models for merchants.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company recently began operations in Mexico and intends to expand its footprint across Latin America next year.</p>
<p><em>Update, 12/15 at 10:50 a.m. PST: Olist errored in saying Wellington&#8217;s investment was its first contribution to a private company in Latin America.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.prellisbio.com/">Prellis Biologics</a>, a company developing the tools to create 3D printed organs, announced a $14.5 million Series B round on Wednesday. Prellis has spent years developing tissue engineering capacity, but has focused recently on developing one type of structure in particular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until this point, Prellis </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/11/3d-printing-organs-moves-a-few-more-steps-closer-to-commercialization/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has focused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 3D printing vascular scaffolds that would allow companies to grow healthy and oxygenated human organs (or miniature versions, called organoids) for drug testing, and eventually transplant. But the company has recently debuted a new product, called EXIS (short for Externalized Immune System): a lab-grown version of a human lymph node. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lymph nodes are critical parts of the human immune system – they store certain immune cells, and help the body manufacture immune responses. Ideally, those lymph node organoids would aid in drug development by mimicking how a person’s immune system might respond to new treatment. And, perhaps, help create some new drugs along the way. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247290" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By creating this immune system in a dish, we can actually test if those therapeutics are going to elicit an immune response before it goes into a human,” founder and CEO Melanie Matheu told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our company’s edge is that [EXIS] is out of the box fully human.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prellis Biologics, founded in 2016, has raised about $29.5 million to date. This Series B round was led by Celesta Capital and existing investor Khosla Ventures. In addition, the company will add Kevin Chapman, Celesta advisor and former CSO of Berkeley Lights, as Chief Scientific Officer. Yelda Kaya, formerly of J&amp;J Innovation, will join as Chief Business Officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lymph node responses to drugs or pathogens</span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.711307/full#h2"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been recognized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way to predict how the whole immune system might react. Correspondingly, a number of academic labs working on developing in-vitro models of human lymph nodes – from l</span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.711307/full#h3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ymph nodes on chips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to growing lymphoid organoids from</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01145-0#Sec10"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tonsil tissue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prellis has entered the fray by using its scaffolds to facilitate oxygen and nutrient exchange needed to grow functioning lymph node organoids. This method, Matheu says, allows Prellis to “replicate the human immune system outside the human.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This focus on the lymph node, in turn, opens up new angle for the company: antibody drug development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing new antibody treatments and predicting how they’ll work in clinical tests is becoming a more competitive space, and there are a few different approaches underway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some are computational. Nabla Bio, which just raised a $11 million, has used </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/nabla-bio-raises-11m-for-an-end-to-end-antibody-design-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">natural language processing to design antibodies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Generate Bio, which just raised a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/generate-biomedicines-raises-370m-series-b-with-a-focus-on-protein-based-drugs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$370m Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has also used a machine learning approach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prellis’ approach is to model the immune system in miniature and develop a cadre of drug candidates by mining immune responses. Matheu calls it “natural intelligence” as opposed to artificial intelligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company can create 1,200 organoids from one blood draw, challenge those immune systems with a particular antigen, and see what each immune system comes up with. That process, she says, can be done with different blood donors with different immune system characteristics to create a plethora of responses to analyze. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s very rare that all 10 of those people are going to come up with the same antibody solution to the problem of: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does it bind this protein</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? And so from a given human, we&#8217;re averaging anywhere from 500 to 2000 unique antibodies, and then you just multiply that by the number of people, and these are all target binding antibodies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes about 18 days to go from blood draw to “antibody library,” per materials provided by Prellis Biologics. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matheu says the company has developed antibodies responsive to SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (these results haven’t been published). It has also entered into partnership with five drug companies, though Matheu declined to name which ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use this round to move from an R&amp;D driven company to a product focused one – which means developing more drug partnerships, and demonstrating the platform’s capability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major marker of success, she says, would be to bring an antibody treatment into the clinic. That may occur through collaboration with a pharmaceutical partner, though the company hasn’t ruled out creating a drug pipeline of its own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matheu is light on specifics, but says Prellis is developing “internal technology” that would support a therapeutic pipeline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will say, we will move in that direction as the technology develops,” she said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When COVID-19 closed down most of society in 2020, Kian Sadeghi, like many of his then-classmates at the University of Pennsylvania, found himself holed up in his bedroom. He prefers it that way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During those months at home in Brooklyn, Sadeghi filled eight spiral notebooks with research on genetic sequencing, computer science and statistics. The result was the formation of Nucleus Genomics (still listed as a “stealth” startup on his LinkedIn, as of writing), which he has dropped out of Penn to pursue full time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus’ Genomics pitch, per Sadeghi, provides a fresher take on genomic analysis. Users can upload their genetic information obtained through an established company, like 23andMe or Ancestry, or order a genetic testing kit. Then the company’s “proprietary algorithms” will calculate polygenic risk scores – measure of disease risk based on analysis of genetic variants – and display them in a user-friendly platform. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245657" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thesis is a human genome on every iPhone,” Sadeghi told TechCrunch. “So we combine genetic and non-genetic information to eventually calculate the absolute risk scores for people for disease.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus announced a $3.5 million seed round on Tuesday led by Founders Fund. The round includes participation from Adrian Aoun (CEO at Forward Health), Patrick Hsu (Professor at UC Berkeley and co-inventor of CRISPR), Brent Saunders (former CEO at Allergan), Matteo Franceschetti (CEO at Eight Sleep), Joshua Browder (CEO, DoNotPay), Cory Levy, Adam Guild, Pareto Holdings, Pomp, Shrug, Ankur Nagpal, Quiet Capital, Salt Fund, Bluewatch Ventures, Night, and Brandon White. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The background behind Nucleus Genomics is the idea that people will be eager to know more about their genomes. And that they’ll want to learn how to actually interpret that information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadeghi clearly has this interest himself. He traces the ideological origin of his company to the premature death of a cousin from long QT syndrome, which in some cases, is genetically linked. He then started to experiment with genes on his own at Brooklyn-based Genspace, a community biology lab. (He was featured in a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Journal </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">story on </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/diy-gene-editing-fast-cheapand-worrisome-1488164820"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DIY CRISPR enthusiasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadeghi’s interest in genetics is shared by others. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing initially spawned a subculture of people who have uploaded their genetic information to services like </span><a href="https://www.gedmatch.com/how-it-works"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GEDMatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has been used to help people find lost relatives, or under controversial circumstances, </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/22/how-your-family-tree-could-catch-a-killer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solve cold cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But direct-to-consumer genetic testing has truly exploded in recent years. In 2013 fewer than </span><a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/06/DTC_graph.png"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people ordered consumer genetic tests. </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/02/12/145676/2017-was-the-year-consumer-dna-testing-blew-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2018,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it was north of 12 million. By 2021, </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-04/23andme-to-use-dna-tests-to-make-cancer-drugs"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reported that one in five Americans has turned over their genetic data to either 23andMe or a competitor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There could be more fuel left to burn in this fire. One 2018 poll run by the Associated Press NORC Center for Public Affairs Research </span><a href="https://reports.norc.org/issue_brief/genetic-testing-ancestry-interest-but-privacy-concerns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as much as 54 percent of Americans had still heard little or nothing about genetic testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadeghi&#8217;s pitch is many of those who have yet to embrace genetic testing are younger people. There’s some evidence to back this up, though not a huge amount. </span><a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/455006#T02"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2017 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of about 1,600 DTC genetic test consumers (from 23andMe and Pathway), found that the average user was middle aged, white, and, most likely, a college educated female. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average age of a 23andMe user, </span><a href="https://mediacenter.23andme.com/press-releases/23andme-database-surpasses-100000-users"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per the company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s 2011 numbers, is 45. TechCrunch has reached out to 23andMe to confirm the age of their user base, but has not heard back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus, he says, will aim to boil down genetic testing into user-friendly reports that will be distributed through “newfound distribution channels” – an effort to reach younger audiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can tap into a brand-new audience and introduce an entire generation to genetic testing, just as you could say Robinhood introduced an entire generation to the stock market,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus, though, won’t necessarily rely on new users. It also aims to become a third-party platform, where people could upload their genomic data collected by other companies. There are already third-party platforms like impute.me (a nonprofit), and </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210312005140/en/Allelica-Raises-1.75-Million-in-Seed-Financing-to-Advance-Polygenic-Risk-Score-PRS-Analysis-into-Clinical-Practice"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allelica (raised 1.75 million in a recent seed round) </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that provides detailed information on clinical disease risk if users upload genetic information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within that landscape, Nucleus does offer a good incentive to upload: cash for the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus will also be open to sharing genetic information with drug companies, says Sadeghi, if users opt-in to sharing their information. Should they choose to share genetic information through Nucleus they can earn a potential “dividend payment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer data is already being shared anyway. 23andMe has </span><a href="https://blog.23andme.com/news/collaboration-with-gsk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">struck a deal </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with GSK to use genetic information for drug identification and research – only data from users who opt-in to this service is shared. (</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-04/23andme-to-use-dna-tests-to-make-cancer-drugs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23andMe and GSK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already have a cancer drug in </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/29/cancer-drug-first-therapy-to-emerge-from-23andme-glaxosmithkline-collaboration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clinical trials</span></a>.<span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In exchange for the genetic data they provide, which increasingly could be used to develop money-making drugs and other medical products, users get their own payout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, the amount of that dividend payment is undecided, says Sadeghi. </span></p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, 23andMe first debuted reports using genetics to predict health risk. But FDA asked the company to pump the brakes and issued </span><a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/211831908-23andMe-and-the-FDA#:~:text=In%202013%2C%2023andMe%20received%20a,the%20agency's%20regulatory%20review%20process.&amp;text=23andMe%20will%20continue%20to%20seek%20FDA%20authorization%20to%20offer%20new%20reports."><span style="font-weight: 400;">a warning letter.</span></a> <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-allows-marketing-first-direct-consumer-tests-provide-genetic-risk-information-certain-conditions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company has received FDA approval for a </span><a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/211831908-23andMe-and-the-FDA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">number of genetic tests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that quantify health risks for conditions like Parkinson’s or breast cancer, to name a few. A diabetes risk calculation test was debuted in 2019, but didn’t go through FDA approval because it was called a “wellness product”– </span><a href="https://medcitynews.com/2019/03/23andme-launches-new-diabetes-risk-test-but-experts-are-wary-of-its-benefit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sparking some criticism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over its utility.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">23andMe essentially hammered out the process of getting DTC tests and reports approved. And that has opened up the possibility of obtaining 510(k) premarket clearance for other genetic analysis algorithms, should they show equivalent accuracy. (</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1804591/000119312521210858/d154309ds1.htm#tx154309_4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23andMe was concerned about this exact process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and disclosed it as a risk factor in S-1 filings). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Nucleus is still developing its polygenic risk score algorithms. Those are the company’s secret sauce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s extremely technical, extremely hard, extremely cutting edge,” Sadeghi said. But as for regulatory strategy, the company initially plans to go a route </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/10/15/ancestry-health-launch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">once used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Ancestry – order tests from a clinical network, rather than creating their own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That does allow the company to sidestep FDA approval of its algorithms at first (this process is regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid). But perhaps not for long. Eventually Ancestry <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/ancestrys-new-510k-clearances-point-toward-otc-consumer-genetic-health-risk-testing">pivoted</a> and applied for 510(k) market approval for its own DNA testing kit and genetic test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When TechCrunch pointed this out in a followup email: Sadeghi said: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, in the future, we do seek to go that route.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the company plans to launch sometime around January 2022 and has plans to grow the team from three to six or seven members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s an imminent inevitability that every person has the human genome sequence,” said Sadeghi. “The question is who is actually going to respond to collect that data? I&#8217;m hoping that it&#8217;s going to be Nucleus.”</span></p>
