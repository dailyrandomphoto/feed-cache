										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gingko Bioworks, a synthetic biology company now valued at around $15 billion, begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gingko’s market debut is one of the largest in biotech history. It’s expected to raise about $1.6 billion for the company. It’s also one of the biggest SPAC deals done to date – Gingko is going public through a merger with Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp, which was announced in May. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares opened at </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/ginkgo-begins-trading-on-the-nyse-after-completing-spac-merger.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$11.15 each</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this morning under the ticker DNA &#8212; biotech dieharders will recognize it as the</span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2021/05/17/ginkgo-bioworks-genentech-dna-ticker-nyse-nasdaq.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former ticker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used by Genentech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exterior of the NYSE is decked out in Gingko decor. The imagery is clearly sporting Jurassic Park themes, as MIT Tech Review’s Antonio Regalado </span><a href="https://twitter.com/antonioregalado/status/1438882612861358082"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s probably intentional: Jason Kelly, the CEO of Ginkgo Bioworks, has been re-reading </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jurassic Park</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week, he tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decor also sports a company motto: &#8220;Grow everything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ginkgo was founded in 2009, and now bills itself as a synthetic biology platform. That&#8217;s essentially premised on the idea that one day, we’ll use cells to “grow everything,” and Gingko’s plan is to be that platform used to do that growing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly, who often uses language borrowed from computing to describe his company, likens DNA to code. Gingko, he says, aims to “program cells like you can program computers.” Ultimately, those cells can be used to make </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stuff</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: like fragrances, flavors, materials, drugs or food products. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest lingering question over Gingko, ever since the SPAC deal was announced, has centered on its massively high valuation. When Moderna, now a household name thanks to its Covid-19 vaccines, went public in 2018, the company was valued at </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/07/31/3-things-about-moderna-that-smart-investors-know/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$7.5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Gingko’s valuation is double that number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that surprises people to be honest,” Kelly says. </span></p>
<h3><b>How is Gingko going to make money? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ginkgo&#8217;s massive valuation seems even starker when you look at its existing revenues. SEC documents show that the company pulled in </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830214/000119312521161781/d177007ds4.htm#nn_toc177007_32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$77 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in revenue in 2020, which increased to about $88 million in the first 6 months of 2021 (per an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IE5NM1f1t4&amp;t=796s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August investor call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) The company has also </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830214/000119312521161781/d177007ds4.htm#nn_toc177007_32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported losses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: including $126.6 million in December 2020 and $119.3 million in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gingko is aiming to increase revenue a significant amount in 2021. SEC documents initially noted that the company aimed to draw about $150 million in revenue in 2021, but the August earning call updated that total for the year to over $175 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gingko aims to make money in two ways: first it contracts with manufacturers during the research and development phase (i.e. while the company works out how to manufacture a cell that spits out a certain fragrance, bio-based nylon, or a meatless burger). That process happens in Gingko’s “foundry” a massive factory for bioengineering projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This source of money is already starting to flow. Gingko reported $59 million in foundry revenue for 2020, and anticipates $100 million in 2021, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IE5NM1f1t4&amp;t=796s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per the August investor call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This revenue, though, isn’t covering the full costs of Gingko’s operations according to the information shared by the company in SEC documents. It is covering an increasing share, though, and as Gingko scales up its platform, costs will come down. Based on fees alone, Kelly projects Gingko will break even by 2024 or 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second type of revenue comes from royalties, milestone payments, or in some cases equity stakes in the companies that go on to sell products, like fragrances or meatless burgers, made using Gingko&#8217;s facilities or know-how. It’s this source of income that will make up the vast majority of the company’s future worth according to its expectations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the product is made and marketed by another company, it requires little to no more work on Gingko’s part – all the company does is collect cash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is often hesitant to incorporate these earnings into projections, because they rely on other companies bringing products to market. That means it&#8217;s hard to know for sure when these downstream payments will emerge. “In our models, we are very sensitive that, at the end of the day, they’re not our products. I cannot predict when Roche might bring a drug to market and give me my milestones,” says Kelly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly says there’s evidence this model will start to work in the near-term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gingko earned a “bolus” milestone payment of </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3732993-cronos-ginkgo-bio-achieves-equity-milestone-to-produce-cultured-cannabinoids]"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.5 million shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of The Cronos Group, a cannabis company, for developing a commercially viable, lab grown rare cannabinoid called CBG for commercial use (there are seven more in strains development, says Kelly). These milestone payments (in cash or shares) are earned when a company achieves some predetermined goal using Gingko’s platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gingko has also worked with Aldevron </span><a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/aldevron-ginkgo-bioworks-make-breakthrough-in-manufacturing-components-for-mrna-vaccines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to manufacture an enzyme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> critical to the production of mRNA vaccines, and plans to collect royalty payments from that relationship — though no foundry fees were collected from this project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Gingko has negotiated an equity stake in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/motif-foodworks-preps-commercial-production-for-its-first-ingredient-improving-the-flavor-of-beef-substitutes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motif Foodworks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a spinout company based on its technology. That company has so far raised about $226 million, and will aim to launch a lab-grown beef product developed at Gingko’s foundry, paying Gingko the aforementioned foundry fees already for this contribution.</span></p>
<h3><b>&#8220;The biggest value driver&#8221; of Gingko, according to Kelly </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This rich source of cash will depend a lot on the outside contractor’s ability to manufacture and sell products made using Gingko’s platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This opens the company up to some risk that’s beyond its control. Maybe, for instance, it turns people don’t want bio-manufactured meat as much as many anticipated – that means some types of downstream payments may not materialize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly says he’s not particularly worried about this. Even if one particular program fails, he’s planning on having so many programs running that one or two are bound to succeed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m just sorta like: some will work, some won’t work. Some will take a year, some will take three years. It doesn’t really matter, as long as everybody is working with us,” he says. “Apple doesn’t stress about what apps are going to be the next big app in the app store,” he continues.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key metric to watch for Gingko going forward will be how many new cell programs they’re managing to close. So far, Gingko has added thirty programs this year, says Kelly. Last year, there were 50 programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember: some of the projects are Gingko spinouts, like Motif Foodworks, not customers that come to the platform on their own. And historically, the number of companies Gingko has partnered with has been a point of criticism. Per SEC documents, the majority of revenue came from two large partners in 2020 – though Kelly told </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ginkgo-bioworks-stock-15-billion-spac-deal-investor-skepticism-2021-6"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Insider</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that this was a pandemic-related downturn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more programs Gingko has, the more it becomes insulated from the success or failure of any one product. Plus it’s a sign that people are at least using the “app store” for biology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest value driver of Gingko is how quickly we add programs,” Kelly says. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will use personal driving data to determine whether owners who have paid for its controversial “Full Self-Driving” software can access the latest beta version that promises more automated driving functions.</p>
<p>Musk tweeted late Thursday night that the FSD Beta v10.0.1 software update, which has already been pushed out to a group of select owners, will become more widely available starting September 24.</p>
<p>Owners who have paid for FSD, which currently costs $10,000, will be offered access to the beta software through a &#8220;beta request button.&#8221; Drivers who select the beta software will be asked for permission to access their driving behavior using Tesla&#8217;s insurance calculator, Musk wrote in a tweet.</p>
<p>&#8220;If driving behavior is good for seven days, beta access will be granted,&#8221; Musk wrote.</p>
<p>Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system branded as Autopilot. For an additional $10,000, owners can buy &#8220;full self-driving,&#8221; or FSD &#8212; software that Musk has repeatedly promised will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Beta button will request permission to assess driving behavior using Tesla insurance calculator. If driving behavior is good for 7 days, beta access will be granted.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1438751064765906945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>FSD, which has steadily increased in price and has added new functions, has been available as an option for years. However, Tesla vehicles are not self-driving. FSD includes the parking feature Summon as well as Navigate on Autopilot, an active guidance system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, including interchanges and making lane changes.</p>
<p>The latest FSD Beta is supposed to automate driving on highways and city streets. However, this is still a Level 2 driver assistance system that requires the driver to pay attention, have their hands on the wheel and take control at all times. Recent videos posted showing owners&#8217; experiences with this beta software provide a mixed picture of its capability. In some videos, the vehicles handle city driving; in many others, drivers are seen taking control due to missed turns, being too close to the curb, failure to creep forward and, in one case, veering off suddenly toward pedestrians.</p>

<h3>The $49B Developer Landscape</h3>
<p><em>Over the past 20 years, IT has witnessed a power shift from CIOs to developers. Any developer with an idea has been given empowerment and authority to innovate. This has led to the creation of a 1,000 companies that create products used, influenced or bought by software development teams. In this session, we’ll discuss the 17 landscape segments, the CIO transition from decision maker to governor, and the developer “pay for value” mentality causing the emergence of product-led growth (PLG) businesses. Presented by Dell for Entrepreneurs</em></p>
<h3>The Dark Matter of Workflows: Business Technology’s Big Opportunity</h3>
<p><em>According to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, we’re only familiar with 5 percent of matter and energy in the universe. The rest is dark. The same can be said about the nature of work. Organizations only have visibility into a small percentage of the actual work taking place because the complexities surrounding it have been growing exponentially. With enormous amounts of data, systems, applications, workflows and more floating around, leaders and employees feel the gravitational mass of work in their stress levels, yet there’s no clear unified system of record for it. The most successful startups will be the ones that seek to understand, uncover and harness the dark matter of work now — before they launch into hypergrowth mode. Andrew Filev, founder of a leading collaborative work management platform that went from bootstrapping to billion-dollar acquisition, will discuss how he’s helping startups bring to light the dark matter of work and harness workflows for operational efficiencies. Presented by Wrike.</em></p>
<h3>Thrive with an Untethered Workforce</h3>

<p><em>As startup founders scale their companies, increase velocity and eye potential exits, flexibility in talent that can execute a lean, mean go-to-market strategy is quickly becoming not only a necessity but a differentiator. Join Insight Partners’ Hilary Gosher and Ivanti’s Melissa Puls in conversation with Upwork’s Tim Sanders about how hybrid workforces are the new cloud when it comes to accelerating revenue, value creation and businesses overall. Presented by Upwork</em></p>
<h3>How Netflix Saved Cybersecurity &#8211; Roundtable</h3>
<p><em>We’ve all heard that membership has its privileges, right? In fact, the membership Economy has forever changed why and what we buy&#8230;until we go to work. For many of us, the tools we buy at work are still tied to old-school ownership models: The millions of dollars we spend on technology solutions and services tied to multiyear licensing agreements effectively hold us hostage regardless of product efficacy. In cybersecurity specifically,, the transactional nature of such purchases has not and cannot keep pace with the growing costs of breaches or the ease with which hacks can be executed. We’ll show how membership&#8211;the Netflix model&#8211;can successfully replace ownership and usher in a whole new taxonomy of cybersecurity defense. Presented by Cyvatar</em></p>
<h3>CISO2CISO: On the Wrong Side of Disruption &#8211; Roundtable</h3>
<p><em>Disruption isn&#8217;t always a good thing. Often, we fear it. We resist prioritizing even necessary change out of fear that the disruption it may bring will be more detrimental than beneficial. Are we wrong? Are we right? Cyvatar Co-Founder and ex-global CISO Craig Goodwin and Alteryx CISO Billy Spears debate both possibilities as they look at the ways we prioritize risk and disruption at work. Presented by Cyvatar</em></p>
<h3>Why Can&#8217;t We Stop Ransomware? &#8211; Roundtable</h3>
<p><em>This will be an open discussion with participation from audience members about the challenges and consequences of our current approaches to defending against ransomware attacks. The reemergence of REvil over the Labor Day weekend and the uptick in ransomware attacks on schools and universities remind us that hacks for ransom are still among the most attractive and lucrative threats around. Our open forum will uncover ways to combat malicious actors better and thwart the successful execution of ransomware. Presented by Cyvatar</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hackers associated with the hacktivist collective Anonymous say they have leaked gigabytes of data from Epik, a web host and domain registrar that provides services to far-right sites <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/28/far-right-social-network-gab-goes-offline-after-godaddy-tells-it-to-find-another-domain-registrar/">like Gab</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/the-far-rights-favorite-registrar-is-building-censorship-resistant-servers/">Parler</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/8chans-new-internet-host-was-kicked-off-its-own-host-just-hours-later/">8chan</a>, which found refuge in Epik after they were booted from mainstream platforms.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/stevanzetti/status/1437482759241469958">a statement</a> attached to a torrent file of the dumped data this week, the group said the 180 gigabytes amounts to a &#8220;decade&#8217;s worth&#8221; of company data, including &#8220;all that&#8217;s needed to trace actual ownership and management&#8221; of the company. The group claimed to have customer payment histories, domain purchases and transfers, and passwords, credentials and employee mailboxes. The cache of stolen data also contains files from the company&#8217;s internal web servers, and databases that contain customer records for domains that are registered with Epik.</p>
<p>The hackers did not say how they obtained the breached data or when the hack took place, but timestamps on the most recent files suggest the hack likely happened in late February.</p>
<p>Epik initially told reporters it was <a href="https://gizmodo.com/anonymous-claims-to-have-stolen-huge-trove-of-data-from-1847673935">unaware of a breach</a>, but an <a href="https://twitter.com/iaremarkus/status/1438214394442305537">email sent out</a> by founder and chief executive Robert Monster on Wednesday alerted users to an &#8220;alleged security incident.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch has since learned that Epik was warned of a critical security flaw weeks before its breach.</p>
<p>Security researcher Corben Leo contacted Epik&#8217;s chief executive Monster over LinkedIn in January about a security vulnerability on the web host&#8217;s website. Leo asked if the company had a bug bounty or a way to report the vulnerability. LinkedIn showed Monster had read the message but did not respond.</p>
<p>Leo told TechCrunch that a library used on Epik&#8217;s WHOIS page for generating PDF reports of public domain records had a decade-old vulnerability that allowed anyone to remotely run code directly on the internal server without any authentication, such as a company password.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could just paste this [line of code] in there and execute any command on their servers,&#8221; Leo told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Leo ran a proof-of-concept command from the public-facing WHOIS page to ask the server to display its username, which confirmed that code could run on Epik&#8217;s internal server, but he did not test to see what access the server had, as doing so would be illegal.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known if the Anonymous hacktivists used the same vulnerability that Leo discovered. (Part of the stolen cache also <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/epik-hack-far-right-sites-anonymous/">includes folders relating to Epik&#8217;s WHOIS system</a>, but the hacktivists left no contact information and could not be reached for comment.) But Leo contends that if a hacker exploited the same vulnerability and the server had access to other servers, databases or systems on the network, that access could have allowed access to the kind of data stolen from Epik&#8217;s internal network in February.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am really guessing that’s how they got owned,&#8221; Leo told TechCrunch, who confirmed that the flaw has since been fixed.</p>
<p>Monster confirmed he received Leo&#8217;s message on LinkedIn, but did not answer our questions about the breach or say when the vulnerability was patched. &#8220;We get bounty hunters pitching their services. I probably just thought it was one of those,&#8221; said Monster. &#8220;I am not sure if I actioned it. Do you answer all your LinkedIn spams?&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Rolls-Royce, best known in aviation for its jet engines, has taken an all-electric airplane on its maiden voyage. The &#8220;Spirit of Innovation&#8221; completed a 15 minute flight, marking &#8220;the beginning of an intensive flight-testing phase in which we will be collecting valuable performance data on the aircraft’s electrical power and propulsion system,&#8221; the company <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2021/15-09-2021-rr-all-electric-spirit-of-innovation-takes-to-the-skies-for-the-first-time.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">announced</a>.</p>
<p>Rolls Royce said the one-seat airplane has &#8220;the most power-dense battery pack every assembled for an aircraft.&#8221; The <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/~/media/Files/R/Rolls-Royce/documents/innovation/Rolls_Royce_IG_Final_04_RGB_Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">aircraft uses</a> a 6,000 cell battery pack with a three-motor powertrain that currently delivers 400kW (500-plus horsepower), and Rolls-Royce said the aircraft will eventually achieve speeds of over 300 MPH.</p>
<p>The flight comes about a year after the originally scheduled takeoff and about six months after taxi trials. Rolls-Royce is also <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2021/11-03-2021-rr-and-tecnam-join-forces.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">developing</a> an air taxi with manufacturer Tecnam, with the aim of delivering an &#8220;all-electric passenger aircraft for the commuter market,&#8221; according to the companies. It has previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-28-airbus-e-fan-x-hybrid-electric-aircraft.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">teamed with</a> Siemens and Airbus on another e-plane concept.</p>
<p>Aircraft companies have been exploring electric airplanes for a number of years, as air travel and cargo accounts for an increasing amount of greenhouse gases. The World Wildlife Foundation has <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/initiatives/cutting-aviation-pollution#:~:text=Air%20travel%20is%20also%20currently,activity%20an%20individual%20can%20make." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">called it</a> &#8220;currently the most carbon intensive activity an individual can make.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weight is a much bigger problem for airplanes that it is for cars, however. Ford&#8217;s all-electric Lightning pickup weighs 1,800 pounds more than the gas-powered model, and offers a range that&#8217;s slightly under half. However, if you added 1,800 pounds to to a <a href="https://cessna.txtav.com/en/piston/cessna-turbo-stationair-hd" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1">Cessna 206 Turbo Stationair</a>, you&#8217;d exceed its useful load by 500 pounds before you even loaded passengers (or the pilot) — so it wouldn&#8217;t even get off the ground.</p>
<p>The project was half funded by the Aerospace Technology Institute and UK government, with the aim of eventually creating all-electric passenger planes. &#8220;This is not only about breaking a world record; the advanced battery and propulsion technology developed for this programme has exciting applications for the Urban Air Mobility market and can help make ‘jet zero’ a reality,&#8221; said Rolls-Royce CEO Warren East.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In DTC, how companies decide omnichannel strategies depends on how well they know what their customers' choices are and what their ideal strategy will be.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies typically have to settle on strategies that align with their customers, employees, investors, and regulators. The more they know about how the other side will decide, the clearer their own strategies become.</p>
<p>If regulators always prefer choice for consumers, then it is easy for a platform to allow multiple payment choices: Shopify allows multiple payment options from its partners, Apple doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>By regulatory intervention, it will have to now.</p>
<h2>Nash equilibrium and Netflix time</h2>
<p>Nash equilibrium is a fascinating, post-facto explanation for some of the interesting decisions you will often see in business.</p>
<p>In simple terms, Nash equilibrium states that if you have clarity on the other side&#8217;s decision, you can make yours without regret. In other words, there is no incentive to change strategy once each side knows what the optimal position of the other side is, in their combined transaction.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			All physical products cannot escape retail, because ignoring retail means a smaller serviceable market. But it is a choice companies can make.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I see this playing out every weekend at home. I don&#8217;t mind reading a book alone or watching Netflix with my kid, but when I am available for Netflix and my kid decides to read a book, it is a bummer.</p>
<h2>DTCs, DNVBs and game theory</h2>
<p>In DTC, how companies decide their omnichannel strategy depends on how well they know what their customers&#8217; choices are and what their ideal strategy will be. In many transactions, constraints are actually good forcing functions — they narrow down choices and help you arrive at an equilibrium faster and cheaper.</p>
<p>The marketing and public-market filing languages make for a fascinating read into the minds of companies.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://pipecandy.com/companies/warby-parker/">Warby Parker</a> filed its IPO prospectus last month, the company referred to its digitally-native status in the past tense. The model was effectively flipped in 2020, as its share of online sales to total sales dropped from 65% to 40%. Meanwhile, its physical store count increased from 126 to 145.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In May 2020, WarnerMedia launched HBO Max into a crowded streaming landscape. In spite of early struggles, the timing couldn’t have been better. When the world was stuck at home, struggling to find new sources of entertainment amid a global pandemic, HBO’s latest attempt at an app-based platform rose in the ranks alongside fellow newly launched service, Disney+.</p>
<p>The platform builds on HBO’s much-loved original prestige programming, while taking advantage of a day and date approach to streaming films, which many studios have opened up to amid worldwide theater shutdowns. In particular, its sister studio Warner Bros. has premiered a number of big-budget films on the service &#8212; including &#8220;Wonder Woman 1984&#8221; and &#8220;Space Jam: A New Legacy&#8221; &#8212; as the pandemic has shown no sign of slowing.</p>
<p>The past year has brought plenty of channels for the service, as well. Not everyone is thrilled about the pandemic trend of bypassing the theater. Sopranos creator David Chase was recently quoted as being “extremely angry” about the HBO Max release of the prequel &#8212; news that followed Scarlett Johansson’s lawsuit against Disney over its own streaming release of &#8220;Black Widow.&#8221; The company has evolved strategies, removing its offering from Amazon Prime Channels and adding a lower-cost ad-based tier to Max.</p>
<p>WarnerMedia EVP and head of business operations for HBO Max Andy Forssell will be joining us at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">virtual TechCrunch Disrupt</a> next week on September 21-23 to discuss the service’s launch during a turbulent time, as well as what the future holds for the app, and video streaming in general. Prior to joining WarnerMedia in 2019, Forssell served as the COO of Otter Media and Fullscreen, Inc. and was the acting CEO and SVP of Hulu.</p>
<p>Disrupt starts next week. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Get your ticket now</a> for less than $100 before the price goes up in a few short days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/hyundai-completes-deal-for-controlling-interest-in-boston-dynamics/">Hyundai completed a deal</a> for controlling interest in Boston Dynamics. The Korean automotive giant no doubt has some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/experts-from-ford-toyota-and-hyundai-outline-why-automakers-are-pouring-money-into-robotics/">grand plans</a> for integrating the Massachusetts-based firm’s technology into a lot of their forward-looking concept mobility vehicles &#8212; for now, however, it&#8217;s more about putting existing robots to work.</p>
<p>Hyundai today announced the arrival of the drably-named “Factory Safety Service Robot.” It immediately began referring to the unit as “the Robot” for reasons of brevity in <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3396">the announcement release</a>, and I’m inclined to do the same, because who has the time to type out “Factory Safety Service Robot” a dozen times?</p>
<p>The Robot (see?) is essentially a modded up version of Spot designed for safety inspections at factories. Naturally, Hyundai is starting close to home, rolling out its first pilot at a Seoul plant for subsidiary, Kia.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTAJDICCll8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The Spot, er, Robot, comes equipped for lidar and a thermal camera, which scan the space for high-temperatures, fire hazards and open doors. If it senses something off, it will send an alert through a secure site. It shares images and data in real time, and like Spot, can either operate autonomously or be controlled remotely.</p>

<hr />
<p>“The Factory Safety Service Robot is the first collaboration project with Boston Dynamics. The Robot will help detect risks and secure people’s safety in industrial sites,” Hyundai’s Dong Jin Hyun said in a release. “We will also continue to create smart services that detect dangers at industrial sites and help support a safe work environment through continuous collaborations with Boston Dynamics.”</p>

<p>On the whole, if you know what Spot can do, you pretty much get the gist with Robot here, albeit with additional mounted sensors. Earlier this week, Boston Dynamics announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/actuator-5/">additional data collecting features for the robot</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instacart</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘s chief financial officer Sagar Sanghvi has departed from the on-demand grocery delivery company after nearly six years and is returning to his investing roots. Specifically, Sanghvi has joined </span><a href="https://www.accel.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a partner focused on global</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth-stage consumer and enterprise investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to becoming CFO of Instacart, Sanghvi served as the company’s vice president of finance and strategy. Interestingly, when he became CFO of Instacart in 2019, he was succeeding Ravi Gupta, who left the company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/instacart-cfo-ravi-gupta-to-exit-for-sequoia-capital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to join Sequoia Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a partner on its growth team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanghvi and Gupta worked together as investors at KKR (after <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagar-sanghvi-5161a370/">Sanghvi</a> had worked as an analyst for Goldman Sachs), so it is notable they are following similar career paths of first working in finance and then becoming operators before transitioning into VC roles. Both joined Instacart in 2015. And Gupta is the one who introduced Sanghvi to Accel’s </span><a href="https://www.accel.com/people/miles-clements#:~:text=%EF%83%A1%20Miles%20Clements%20joined%20Accel%20in%202009%20and,enterprise%2C%20and%20messaging%20platforms%20for%20the%20cloud-native%20workplace."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miles Clements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Sanghvi joined Instacart, it had approximately 300 employees. By the time he’d left earlier this year, it had more than 1,500.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been through quite the roller coaster of ups and downs along the way. It was the classic Silicon Valley journey. During my time there, a few crazy things happened,” he told TechCrunch. “ Amazon bought Whole Foods. We experienced the COVID pandemic and lockdowns, which led to an amazing wave of demand. It was an interesting time to be navigating the company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Sanghvi says he would definitely rather see a business be smaller “than have COVID happen to the world,” it was a time where he learned a lot in helping grow the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things Sanghvi worked on during his time at Instacart was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/instacart-raises-200m-more-at-17-7b-valuation/">a $200 million venture round</a> in October 2020 that valued the company at $17.7 billion. (Since then it raised another $265 million at a $39 billion valuation.) In fact, during his tenure, the company raised more than $2 billion.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, Sanghvi will be the one investing in other companies’ rounds &#8212; out of Accel’s Palo Alto office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While his Instacart experience is clearly relevant to the consumer space, Sanghvi said he’ll be working with not just consumer-focused startups, but also a lot of enterprise solutions.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that drew me to Miles and the team was the experience and success Accel as a firm has had investing in all different types of companies within the technology sector and so I&#8217;m hoping to diversify my experience,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clements praised what he described as Sanghvi’s “humility and versatility.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He&#8217;s done everything from raising $2 billion of capital to being in the minutiae of evaluating back office automation software. He has led a company that is on its way to being an iconic consumer brand, but he’s also been a media investor at KKR,” Clements said. “He guided Instacart through some massive recent fundraises but only because he has also helped navigate through some previous existential challenges. So he brings a lot of natural empathy to founders and entrepreneurs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Sanghvi is eager to start investing as part of the Accel team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When deciding to move to the venture world, he said, he was looking for a “very well-known brand” that invested across at all stages. He found that in Accel, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things that was important to me was to find the type of people who really care about the success of companies, and in every person I met at Accel, I could see they took that responsibility very seriously,” Sanghvi told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He officially started in his new role last week, so he’s actively scoping out investments as I type.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More spacecraft will be sent to orbit this year than ever before in human history, and the number of satellite launches is only anticipated to increase through the rest of the decade. Under these crowded conditions, being able to maneuver satellites in space and deorbit them when they reach the end of their useful life will be key.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://aurorapt.fi/">Aurora Propulsion Technologies</a>. It’s one of a handful of startups that has emerged in the past few years to help simplify the problem of spacecraft propulsion. Since its founding in 2018, the Finnish company has developed two products &#8212; a tiny thruster engine and a plasma braking system &#8212; and will be testing both in an in-orbit demonstration in the fourth quarter of this year. Aurora’s activities have caught the eye of investors: the company just closed a €1.7 million ($2 million) seed round to bring its technology to market.</p>
<p>The round was led by Lithuanian VC firm Practica Capital, with additional participation from the state-owned private equity company TESI (Finnish Industry Investment Ltd.) and The Flying Object, a fund from Kluz Ventures. Individual investors also participated.</p>
<p>Aurora’s first in-orbit demonstration, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/aurora-propulsion-technologies-will-be-sending-up-space-junk-removal-tech-on-rocket-labs-electron-later-this-year/">Aurora Sat-1</a>, will be heading to space on a Rocket Lab rideshare mission, the company announced last month. On that satellite will be two modules. The first module will contain six Aurora “resistojet” engines, designed to help small spacecraft adjust their attitude (the satellite’s orientation, not its mood) and de-tumble. Aurora will also test its Plasma Brake technology, which could be used to de-orbit satellites or even to conduct deep space missions.</p>
<p>Each resistojet thruster comes in at just around one centimeter long, and it moves the spacecraft using microliters of water and propellant. The six thrusters are distributed around the satellite in such a way to facilitate movement in virtually any direction, and the thruster can also modulate the temperature of the water and the strength of the puff of steam that’s discharged to generate movement.</p>

<p>Aurora CEO Roope Takala, who previously worked for Nokia, likened the innovations in weight and size in the space industry &#8212; which we see in the resistojet &#8212; to what happened to cell phones and computers 20 years ago. “The industry moves very slow,” he said in a recent interview with TechCrunch. “In the old space era, it took a quarter to develop a rocket engine &#8212; that would be a quarter of a century. Now, it takes two quarters of a year. That&#8217;s what we did.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Plasma Brake uses an electrically charged microtether to generate a lump of protons to generate drag. That’s ideal for de-orbiting a spacecraft, but interestingly (and counterintuitively), the Plasma Brake could also be used for traveling away from the planet, Takala said. That’s because when you go outside the Earth’s magnetosphere, the Plasma Brake becomes unstable and moves with solar wind (which is also plasma). “The same product can jump onto that flow of plasma from the sun and extract energy from that,” Takala explained. “In that context we can use it as an interplanetary traveling tool.”</p>
<p>Theoretically, if a spacecraft was equipped with multiple tethers extending different directions, it could be used to rotate and guide the spacecraft, like a sailboat, he added. This technology is only scalable to a certain degree, however, so don’t expect it to be sending a crewed spacecraft into deep space anytime soon. That’s mostly due to limitations in the material strength of the Plasma Brake tethers, but the tech can be used for satellites up to around 1,000 kilograms.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s our future. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re aiming,” Takala said. “We’re focused now for the short term on low Earth orbit with the Plasma Brake and the attitude control [resistojet], and later on when the moon businesses kick off as they are slowly starting to do, then we&#8217;ll probably be looking at that way.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Aurora Propulsion Technologies will be sending up space junk removal tech on Rocket Lab&#8217;s Electron later this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/aurora-propulsion-technologies-will-be-sending-up-space-junk-removal-tech-on-rocket-labs-electron-later-this-year/embed/#?secret=h5XRoEwVX9" data-secret="h5XRoEwVX9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Plasma Brake and resistojet thruster would need to be put on spacecraft before they launch to orbit, but Aurora is in conversation with other companies of the potential of in-orbit installation of Plasma Brakes for existing space junk. Looking to the short term, the company is going to use the funding to productize the technology for low Earth orbit and to serialize its production, as well as to add features to the products to equip them for satellites larger than CubeSats.</p>
<p>In the longer term, Aurora has a vision of conducting missions in deep space. “We started off from the idea that we want to make a technology that fits into a really small spacecraft, [and] travels really fast so that we can catch up with the Voyager probes,” Takala said.</p>
<p>“First to the moon and then to Mars, Venus, and then one day we may be able to catch up with the Voyagers and take a big trip.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Major gains in online advertising have boosted valuations for adtech startups since the pandemic began, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/creative-ad-tech-is-on-the-cusp-of-a-revolution-and-vcs-should-take-note/">one insider says investors are missing the party</a>.</p>
<p>“Adtech is having a moment,&#8221; writes industry veteran Casey Saran.</p>
<p>&#8220;And while much of the oxygen has been soaked up by large legacy companies hitting the public market, there have been smaller deals that indicate a hunger for better creative adtech.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saran shares five reasons &#8220;why VCs should consider ratcheting up their investment into adtech startups building the next generation of creative tools.&#8221;</p>

<p>Congratulations on shipping your product, but how much do you know about your target customers?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Companies that haven&#8217;t created an ideal customer profile and performed a SWOT analysis are making big bets on guesswork and intuition. Sometimes that works out, but more frequently, it leads to tears.</p>
<p>In a guest post that walks readers through the fundamentals of creating customer personas that map to your company&#8217;s goals, Grammarly product marketing lead Bryan Dsouza shares five basic requirements for customer acquisition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understanding and executing on these things can guarantee you that first customer win, provided you do them well and with sincerity,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your investors will also see the fruits of your labor and be comforted knowing their dollars are at good work.”</p>

<p>In school, it&#8217;s highly unethical to copy someone else&#8217;s work and pass it off as your own. In business, however, it is expected.</p>
<p>Xiaoyun TU, global director of demand generation at Brightpearl, wrote a comprehensive guide for how to use the key metric of return on advertising spend (ROAS) to triple your company&#8217;s lead generation.</p>
<p>&#8220;A &#8216;good&#8217; ROAS score is different for each company and campaign,&#8221; she says. &#8220;If your figure isn’t where you’d like it to be, you can leverage ROAS data to create targeted campaigns and personalized experiences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most of us prefer to trust our instincts instead of letting automated tools help us make decisions, particularly when it comes to hiring. But that&#8217;s not smart.</p>
<p>If your startup relies on an ad hoc hiring process, you&#8217;re probably not tracking candidates properly, there&#8217;s likely little consistency regarding how they&#8217;re treated, and bias can play a major role in who gets hired.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine to be skeptical of automated hiring tools — but not ignorant.</p>

<p>In yesterday&#8217;s edition of The Exchange, Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm speculated about the conditions that could combine to cool off a hot startup market currently fueled by low interest rates and a sweeping digital transformation.</p>
<p>&#8220;From where we stand, the factors underpinning the startup fundraising boom appear solid and unlikely to unwind overnight. Still, no golden period shines forever, and even today’s luster will eventually tarnish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before news broke this week that Intuit was acquiring Mailchimp for $12 billion, the &#8217;80s-born fintech giant&#8217;s biggest buy was spending $7.1 billion last year for Credit Karma.</p>
<p>In the last few years, Mailchimp &#8220;has been expanding upon its core email marketing functionality&#8221; with offerings like web design and CRM, writes enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>The industry watchers he interviewed said the move signals Intuit&#8217;s interest in acquiring and serving more SMB customers with a variety of tools:</p>

<p>“One of my favorite long-term issues with the late-stage startup market is that it is far better at creating value than it is at finding an exit point for that accreted value,” Alex Wilhelm writes for The Exchange. “More simply, the startup market is excellent at creating unicorns but somewhat poor at taking them public.”</p>
<p>That’s good news for Forge Global, a technology startup that operates a market for secondary transactions in private companies, with Alex dubbing its plans to go public via a SPAC combination “perfectly reasonable.”</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim continued their tour of U.S. cities after hitting up Chicago and Boston in recent weeks.</p>
<p>This time, they dug into Atlanta’s booming startup scene, which is seeing record capital inflows.</p>
<p>“The picture that forms is one of a city enjoying a rising tide of venture activity, boosted by some local dynamics that may have helped some of its earlier-stage companies scale for cheaper than they might have in other markets,” they write.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/2f996a50-1739-40c6-a8c3-9ca299a2edb7?dark=false" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann </a>and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> were all aboard this week under the guidance of <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a>, which meant we had the full team. And <em>speaking </em>of teams, Mary Ann is joining the Friday show on a weekly basis now. She&#8217;s been a friend for years, and a colleague now twice-over for Natasha and Alex and we could not be more excited.</p>
<p>That personal news aside, here&#8217;s the rundown for today&#8217;s show!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funding rounds in the logistics and infra markets:</strong> We went physical-world with our funding round roundup this week. BridgeLinx put together <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/digital-freight-marketplace-bridgelinx-raises-10-million-in-pakistans-largest-seed-funding/">the largest seed round in Pakistan&#8217;s history</a>, Releaf is doing incredibly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/nigerian-agritech-startup-releaf-secures-4-2m-to-scale-its-food-processing-technology/">interesting agtech work in Nigeria</a> and Stord&#8217;s huge round from earlier in the week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/logistics-startup-stord-raises-90m-in-kleiner-perkins-led-round-becomes-a-unicorn-and-acquires-another-company/">brought us to Atlanta.</a></li>
<li>And oh boy has <strong>Atlanta had a week</strong>. Extra Crunch did a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/atlantas-sundry-startups-join-in-global-vc-funding-boom/">deep dive into the city&#8217;s superlative startup fundraising</a> in recent quarters, and, of course, one of its home-grown startups<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/"> sold to Intuit for $12 billion</a> just a few days ago. We had a <em>few</em> thoughts on the Intuit-Mailchimp transaction, even if we tried to steer clear of territory that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/the-equity-crew-riffs-on-the-intuit-mailchimp-news/">we&#8217;ve already tread. </a>For more about the controversy, Business Insider wrote about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mailchimp-insiders-react-to-employees-getting-no-equity-2021-9">how some Mailchimp employees are reacting to the deal.</a></li>
<li>From there we turned to a layoff story. Casper, the DTC mattress company that is now public, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/casper-cuts-its-cmo-cto-and-coo-amid-further-layoffs/">had another round of layoffs that cut three C-suite executives. </a>It brought us into a conversation about how Apple&#8217;s tracking updates are impacting startups in this category more broadly,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/flockjay-cuts-at-least-half-of-its-workforce-as-it-pivots-away-from-bootcamps-into-b2b-saas/"> and if more layoffs are on the horizon. </a></li>
<li>And then <strong>there were IPOs to discuss</strong>. Natasha talked us through the news that Quizlet may go public soon, which meant we had to chat edtech for a minute. Rounding out the Going Public conversation was notes on both Toast and Freshworks. Alex does not apologize for his lame joke, we hasten to add.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">Disrupt is next week</a>, so expect some possible changes to the regular Equity show lineup if the news cycle gets dicey. Hugs!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Startups are raising record sums around the world, thanks to several contributing factors. But the free ride could be ending.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">raising record sums around the world</a>, thanks to several contributing factors. As The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/what-could-stop-the-startup-boom/">explored yesterday</a>, historically low interest rates have helped venture capitalists raise more capital than ever, to pick an example.</p>
<p>Low rates have helped startups in another manner: As yields fell for certain assets, investors chased returns by betting on growth. And in recent years, the investing classes turned their attention to public software companies, bidding up the value of their revenue to record highs.</p>
<p>This raised the worth of startups in general terms, and private tech companies&#8217; comps enjoyed a steady, upward climb in the value of their revenues. If the value of a dollar of SaaS revenue was worth $1 one year and $2 the next, the repricing was good for private companies even if we were tracking the metrics from the perspective of public companies.</p>
<p>The free ride could be ending.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>I&#8217;ve held back from covering the value of software (SaaS, largely) revenues for a few months after spending a bit too much time on it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/what-the-hell-saas-valuations/">in preceding quarters</a> — when VCs begin to point out that you could just swap out numbers quarter to quarter and write the same post, it&#8217;s time for a break. But the value of software revenues posted a simply incredible run, and I can&#8217;t say &#8220;no&#8221; to a chart.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The pace at which software revenues were repriced upwards in the last few years is simply astounding. Per <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/">the Bessemer Cloud Index</a>, back in 2016, the median revenue multiple for public SaaS companies was around 5x. When 2018 began, median SaaS multiples had expanded to around 7x.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a 40% climb in pricing, but it proved to be just a foretaste of the feast to come.</p>
<p>By the end of 2019, the median figure had appreciated to around the 9x mark. And today it has shot to just under 18x. <em>That</em> is why software companies have been able to raise so much money, earlier, and in larger chunks. Every dollar of recurring revenue they sold was worth $5 in market cap in mid-2016. At the end of 2019, that same dollar of revenue was worth $9. And today, for the <em>median </em>public software company, it&#8217;s valued at around $18.</p>
<p>There are nuances to the data, but we care less about exacting definitions than the directional change it describes: The median value of SaaS revenues more than tripled from 2016 to 2021. That&#8217;s an insane amount of growth.</p>

According to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/chromecast-google-tv-fast-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1"><em>Protocol</em></a>, Google has been in talks with free, ad-supported streaming television providers about the possibility of adding their channels to its smart TV platform. Those channels typically have a similar feel to traditional TV, and its shows will be interrupted by commercial breaks.</p>
<p><em>Protocol</em> says Chromecast users might be able to browse live channels available to them through a dedicated menu similar to YouTube TV&#8217;s. Meanwhile, smart TVs powered by the platform might show the free channels alongside other over-the-air programming that can be accessed with an antenna. The publication says that&#8217;s similar to how companies like Samsung present free TV offerings on their own platforms. Samsung&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-tv-plus-streaming-service-web-034944264.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">free TV service</a> has become so popular, other companies (including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-channel-tribeca-film-festival-channel-172006958.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Roku</a> and Amazon) started giving their customers access to hundreds of free channels, as well.</p>
<p>The addition of linear programming to Google TV could help make Chromecasts and smart TVs powered by the operating system a more enticing option for cord-cutters. Google could officially launch free streaming channels as soon as this fall, though it could also wait to announce the feature until its smart TV partners are also ready to do so next year. <em>Protocol</em> also says that while it&#8217;s unclear what channels are making their way to the platform at this point, Google will likely strike deals that will give it access to &#8220;dozens of free channels&#8221; all at once.</p>

<p>“One of the goals of launching the Zoom SDK was to provide developers with the tools they need to create valuable and engaging experiences for our mutual customers and integrations ecosystem,&#8221; said Zoom&#8217;s CTO Brendan Ittelson via email. &#8220;Aircover’s focus on building sales intelligence directly into the meeting, to guide customer-facing teams through the entire sales cycle, is the type of innovation we had envisioned when we set out to create a broader platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aircover’s founding team of Andrew Levy, Alex Young and Andrew’s brother David Levy worked together at Apteligent, a company co-founded and led by Andrew Levy, that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/apteligent-acquired-by-vmware/">sold to VMware in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>Chatting about pain points on the sales process over the years, Levy said it felt like the solution was always training the sales team more. However, by the time everyone was trained, that information would largely be out-of-date.</p>
<p>Instead, they created Aircover to be a software tool on top of video conferencing that performs real-time transcription of the conversation and then analysis to put the right content in front of the sales person at the right time based on customer issues and questions. This means that another sales expert doesn’t need to be pulled in or an additional call scheduled to provide answers to questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are anticipating that knowledge and parsing it out at key moments to provide more leverage to subject matter experts,” Andrew Levy told TechCrunch. “It’s like a sales assistant coming in to handle any issue.”</p>
<p>He considers Aircover in a similar realm with other sales team solutions, like Chorus.ai, which was recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zoominfo-drops-575m-on-chorus-ai-as-ai-shakes-up-the-sales-market/">scooped up by ZoomInfo</a>, and Gong, but sees his company carving out space in real-time meeting experiences. Other tools also record the meetings, but to be reviewed after the call is completed.</p>
<p>“That can’t change the outcome of the sale, which is what we are trying to do,” Levy added.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used for product development. Levy intends to double his small engineering team by the end of the month.</p>
<p>He calls what Aircover is doing a “large interesting problem we are solving that requires some difficult technology because it is real time,” which is why the company was eager to partner with Bob Rosin, partner at Defy Partners, who joins Aircover’s board of directors as part of the investment.</p>
<p>Rosin joined Defy in 2020 after working on the leadership teams of Stripe, LinkedIn and Skype. He said sales and customer teams need tools in the moment, and while some are useful in retrospect, people want them to be live, in front of the customer.</p>
<p>“In the early days, tools helped before and after, but in the moment when they need the most help, we are not seeing many doing it,” Rosin added. “Aircover has come up with the complete solution.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ketch's OTC enables developers to embed security and governance into a piece of data as they build software.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Six months after securing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/ketch-series-a/">$23 million Series A</a> round, <a href="http://ketch.com/">Ketch</a>, a startup providing online privacy regulation and data compliance, brought in an additional $20 million in A1 funding, this time led by Acrew Capital.</p>
<p>Returning with Acrew for the second round are CRV, super{set} (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/superset/">the startup studio founded by Ketch&#8217;s co-founders CEO Tom Chavez and CTO Vivek Vaidya</a>), Ridge Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank. The new investment gives Ketch a total of $43 million raised since the company came out of stealth earlier this year.</p>
<p>In 2020, Ketch introduced its data control platform for programmatic privacy, governance and security. The platform automates data control and consent management so that consumers’ privacy preferences are honored and implemented.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XZWenTY0Ip"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/ketch-series-a/">Ketch raises $23M to automate privacy and data compliance</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ketch raises $23M to automate privacy and data compliance&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/ketch-series-a/embed/#?secret=XZWenTY0Ip" data-secret="XZWenTY0Ip" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Enterprises are looking for a way to meet consumer needs and accommodate their rights and consents. At the same time, companies want data to fuel their growth and gain the trust of consumers, Chavez told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>There is also a matter of security, with much effort going into ransomware and malware, but Chavez feels a big opportunity is to bring security to the data wherever it lies. Once the infrastructure is in place for data control it needs to be at the level of individual cells and rows, he said.</p>
<p>“If someone wants to be deleted, there is a challenge in finding your specific row of data,” he added. “That is an exercise in data control.”</p>
<p>Ketch’s customer base grew by more than 300% since its March Series A announcement, and the new funding will go toward expanding its sales and go-to-market teams, Chavez said.</p>

<p>This year, the company launched Ketch OTC, a free-to-use privacy tool that streamlines all aspects of privacy so that enterprise compliance programs build trust and reduce friction. Customer growth through OTC increased five times in six months. More recently, Qonsent, which developing a consent user experience, is using Ketch&#8217;s APIs and infrastructure, Chavez said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When looking for strategic partners, Chavez and Vaidya wanted to have people around the table who have a deep context on what they were doing and could provide advice as they built out their products. They found that in Acrew founding partner Theresia Gouw, whom Chavez referred to as “the OG of privacy and security.”</p>
<p>Gouw has been investing in security and privacy for over 20 years and says Ketch is flipping the data privacy and security model on its head by putting it in the hands of developers. When she saw more people working from home and more data breaches, she saw an opportunity to increase and double down on Acrew’s initial investment.</p>
<p>She explained that Ketch is differentiating itself from competitors by taking data privacy and security and tying it to the data itself to empower software developers. With the OTC tool, similar to putting locks and cameras on a home, developers can download the API and attach rules to all of a user’s data.</p>
<p>“The magic of Ketch is that you can take the security and governance rules and embed them with the software and the piece of data,” Gouw added.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As the CEO of a tech company for 15 years, I have seen employees come and go for many reasons. But in the last four months, we have seen more turnover than in the previous two years combined. We’ve lost nearly 20% of our 50-person team. It’s putting a lot of pressure on our existing employees.</p>
<p>What’s driving this? During the current labor shortage, many talented workers now have unprecedented opportunities to increase their salary by making the leap to another company. Nationally, the labor force has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210710171257/https:/www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm">reduced</a> by 3.5 million people — a level not seen since the 1970s — and employees have more negotiating power than almost any time in recent history.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>With big employers looking for remote talent across the country, they can sometimes offer salaries 20% to 30% higher than what we’ve traditionally paid as a small company based in a smaller market.</p>
<p>To stave off the threat of talent poaching, which has long been a factor in the tech world, we’ve invested heavily in our culture and staff. Even before the pandemic, employees owned 40% of the company through an employee stock ownership plan established in 2016. But to make sure our compensation package stays relevant, we’ve tweaked it continually through the pandemic.</p>
<p>One of our biggest moves was to redirect some of the money we’ve traditionally set aside for employee development to help team members pay student debt, recognizing that many aren’t as inclined to take professional development courses as in recent years and there were lots of unused professional development dollars in the budget. After months of pandemic life, people didn’t have the time or desire to go to professional conferences, and many of those conferences weren’t happening anyway.</p>
<p>We were allowed to redirect the funds because of a little-known provision of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act that we learned about when some of our team members saw a tweet about it. Employers are allowed to pay off up to $5,250 a year in student debt for employees without having to treat it as income from 2020 to 2025. This started a one-year program but was extended in December 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To make sure the program was relevant to our company, we did a staff survey before rolling it out. We learned that out of our 40 to 45 employees, 20 said the reimbursement program would have a positive impact on them. That gave us the confidence to move ahead.</p>
<p>We started the program as a pilot, offering $1,200 in reimbursement to each employee per year. When that worked out well, we doubled it to $2,400 per year. It’s a way for us to stand out as an employer: Only 8% of employers had student loan repayment plans as of 2019, according to the Society for Human Resource Management.</p>
<p>There is a bit of setup involved in running a program like this. You need to run an educational assistance program (EAP) that complies with Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. And the program must benefit all employees equally — not just one group of employees. To makes sure those who didn’t have student debt could avail themselves of the funds, we continued our professional development program simultaneously. Any employee can submit for the reimbursement of professional development expenses from the same pool of money.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it did not take long to get set up. Once we did the research, it took us less than a month to draft our policy on the student loan reimbursements, publish it and let employees know about it.</p>
<p>To roll out the program, we announced it during a weekly video meeting with our staff. We made the application process very simple, asking employees to fill out a basic one-page form. To get reimbursed, employees have to submit a copy of a student loan bill from the past 12 months that showed how they made their loan payments. We cut them a check as reimbursement.</p>
<p>So far, the feedback on this program has been very positive. Many employees in our industry are on the younger side and struggling with mountains of student debt. Student debt forgiveness is something our employees need.</p>
<p>There is another benefit to the program: Tax savings. Employees can save on their federal tax and their share of payroll taxes. We, in turn, save on payroll taxes and also receive a compensation deduction equal to the amount of reimbursement we provide.</p>
<p>Although we’re bullish on student loan reimbursements, we recognize that this benefit, alone, isn’t enough to help us stay relevant and win the war for talent. The only way to know what matters to them is to listen to them, so we spend a lot of time doing that.</p>
<p>In response to concerns about the cost of living, we are now looking at programs like retention bonuses and 10-year bonuses. The challenge for a small company like ours is finding the money to support these bonuses. Most of our customers sign one- or two-year contracts, so we’d likely have to raise rates to add programs like this. And even if we do raise rates, it will take a while to see the effects in our budget.</p>
<p>Still, we’re willing to look for creative solutions. We want our employees to know we will take good care of them. It’s not only the right thing to do, but it ensures they can contribute their best to our company and aren’t distracted by concerns like whether they can afford to fill their gas tank to get to work.</p>
<p>My hope is that ultimately, once employees settle into working for us, we’ll be able to attract and hold onto the best talent by offering something that has nothing to do with money or benefit but has become more important to many people during the pandemic: A sense of belonging and purpose.</p>
<p>A job is more than just a job here. In a small company like ours, every person on our team counts. And in a small city like the one where we’re located, every employer matters to the community. By offering a workplace where smart people can come together to exchange ideas, enjoy each other’s company and make a difference outside of the pressure cooker of Silicon Valley, we hope we’ll keep attracting people who are looking for those things.</p>
<p>Will they get competitive benefits and compensation? Yes. But those things ultimately are part of a total experience that we will continue to put a lot of thought into, so we can keep our company thriving and growing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Psychedelics companies are all the rage right now. Compass Pathways is working with the magic mushroom compound psilocybin to treat depression. It’s has raised $290 million in total. Atai Life Sciences — backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel — brought in $258 million from its IPO. In the tech space, this has not gone unnoticed and the same business models that have been used in other platforms for health and wellness startups are coming to psychedelics.</p>
<p>The latest is <a href="http://journey.clinic">Journey Clinical</a>, based out of NYC, which has raised a $3 million seed round led by San Francisco VC firm <a href="https://fiftyyears.com/">Fifty Years</a>. Also participating were Neo Kuma Ventures, Palo Santo, PsyMed Ventures, Lionheart Ventures, Christina Sass co-founder of Andela, ​​Edvard Engesæth, MD co-founder of Nurx and, Hans Gangeskar co-founder of Nurx.</p>
<p>Journey joins other startups in the space looking at psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, where ketamine is used to treat depression, anxiety, PTSD, and trauma, known as ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP). Miami-based startup NUE Life Health <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/nue-life-health-raises-3-3m-for-its-psychedelics-meets-tech-mental-wellness-platform/">raised</a> a $3.3 million seed round for the same purpose back in June. There is also Field Trip and Mindbloom playing in this space.</p>
<p>These startups are pushing at an open door on depression and anxiety. Pre-COVID-19, the National Center for Health Statistics estimated some 50 million Americans were fighting the afflictions. The pandemic has of course exacerbated this issue, with those figures doubling, by some estimates.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still an early market. Journey says the market landscape for legal psychedelic therapies is very disparate, with over a million licensed mental health professionals lacking the infrastructure to offer these treatments as they lack access to prescribing clinicians. On the flip side, patients struggle to find psychotherapists who can prescribe psychedelics as treatment.</p>
<p>Journey says it has a “decentralized clinic model” that allows psychotherapists to offer legal psychedelic therapy treatments in their practice, starting with ketamine. The way it works is that Journey takes care of the pharmacology side, while psychotherapists that sign up to the platform take care of the psychotherapy of the patient. The treatment plans are then customized to meet the patient’s needs.</p>
<p>Jonathan Sabbagh, co-founder and CEO, was previously diagnosed with PTSD, but after discovering psychedelics, he went back to school to study clinical psychology, and went on to co-found Journey. He said: “We are on the verge of a paradigm shift in the field of mental health. Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies are one of the most promising new means of treatment available; they will allow clinicians to tackle the growing global mental health crisis we are facing.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch he added: “When we asked what was the main bottleneck for therapists to offer KAP to their patients, the #1 response was access to a prescribing doctor. Our alpha test group confirmed that guaranteeing access to a trained medical team and building a robust care management system would solve an essential bottleneck of mainstream adoption for KAP.”</p>
<p>Journey has two revenue streams. Psychotherapists pay them a $200 monthly membership fee which gives them access to a number of services including and access to the prescriber, an EHR (achieved through a white label), a KAP training (training materials created by a specialized training company), a profile on Journey’s directory, and a community of peers. Patients pay journey for medical services. They pay $250 for the intake consultation and $150 for follow-up consultations.</p>
<p>Ela Madej, Founding Partner at Fifty Years, said: “I dream of a world where those of us affected by trauma, anxiety, or depression don’t have to fall into learned helplessness. We&#8217;re lucky that powerful psychedelic treatments for the mind exist, but they need to be delivered responsibly, with proper screening, protocols, and follow-up. We&#8217;ve been incredibly impressed by Journey Clinical&#8217;s ambitious plan to empower psychotherapists to better treat their existing patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team also comprises Kyle Lapidus MD, Ph.D., who has over 20 years as a board-certified psychiatrist and has extensive experience working with ketamine;  and Brigitte Gordon DNP a professor at Columbia University and also works for the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple and Google have removed from their respective mobile app stores in Russia a tactical voting app created by the organization of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.</p>
<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-ramps-up-pressure-foreign-tech-firms-eve-election-2021-09-16/">Reuters</a> reported that the Russian state had been amping up the pressure on foreign tech giants ahead of federal elections &#8212; appropriating the language of &#8220;election interference&#8221; to push U.S. companies to censor the high-profile political opponent to President Putin.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/ioannZH/status/1438764837383852033">Twitter</a> today, a key Navalny ally, Ivan Zhdanov, tweeted that his organization is considering suing Apple and Google over removal of the apps &#8212; dubbing the act of censorship a &#8220;huge mistake&#8221;.</p>
<p>Zhdanov has also <a href="https://twitter.com/ioannZH/status/1438750081402953728">published</a> what he says is Apple&#8217;s response to Team Navalny &#8212; in which the tech giant cites the Kremlin&#8217;s classification of a number of pro-Navalny organizations as &#8220;extremist&#8221; groups to justify its removal of the software.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2204225" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2204225" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2204225" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-17-at-09.52.28.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="490" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-17-at-09.52.28.png 1098w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-17-at-09.52.28.png?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-17-at-09.52.28.png?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-17-at-09.52.28.png?resize=768,554 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-17-at-09.52.28.png?resize=680,490 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-17-at-09.52.28.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2204225" class="wp-caption-text">(<strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screengrab of detail from Apple&#8217;s notification to the developer, via Zhdanov&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/ioannZH/status/1438764837383852033">tweet</a>)</p></div></p>
<p>Apple and Google routinely say they comply with &#8220;all local laws&#8221; in the countries where they operate.</p>
<p>However, in Russia that stance means they have become complicit in acts of political censorship.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We note that the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of the Russian Federation and the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of the City of Moscow have also determined that the app violates the legislation of the Russian Federation by enabling interference in elections,&#8221; Apple writes in the notification of takedown it sent to the developer of the tactical voting app.</p>
<p>&#8220;While your app has been removed from the Russia App Store, it is still available in the App Stores for the other territories you selected in App Store Connect,&#8221; Apple adds.</p>
<p>Apple and Google have been contacted for comment on the removal of Navalny&#8217;s app.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Also via Twitter, Zhdanov urged supporters to focus on the tactical voting mission &#8212; tweeting a link to a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVPorDqxE28&amp;feature=youtu.be"> video</a> hosted on Google-owned YouTube which contains recommendations to Russians on how to cast an anti-Putin vote in the parliamentary elections taking place today until Sunday.</p>
<p>Navalny&#8217;s supporters are hoping to mobilize voters across Russia to cast tactical ballots in a bid to unseat Putin by voting for whatever candidate has the best chance of defeating the ruling United Russia party.</p>
<p>Their tactical voting strategy has <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/15/can-navalnys-smart-voting-app-impact-russias-election">faced some criticism</a> &#8212; given that many of the suggested alternatives are, at best, only very weakly opposed to Putin&#8217;s regime.</p>
<p>However, Navalny&#8217;s supporters would surely point out they are having to operate within a flawed system.</p>
<p>After Apple and Google initially refused to remove Navalny&#8217;s &#8220;Smart Voting&#8221; app, last month, the Russian state has been attempting to block access to his organization&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>It has even <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/09/16/russia-elections-google-docs-navalny-putin-smart-voting/">reportedly targeted Google docs</a> &#8212; which supporters of Navalny have also been using to organize tactical voting efforts.</p>

<p>Earlier this month <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-may-treat-us-tech-companies-hosting-navalny-app-meddling-regulator-2021-09-02/">Reuters</a> reported that Russia&#8217;s communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, had threatened Apple and Google with fines if they did not remove the Smart Voting app &#8212; warning that failure to comply could be interpreted as election meddling.</p>
<p>Russian <a href="https://zona.media/news/2021/09/17/app">press</a> has also reported that Apple and Google were summoned to a meeting at the Federation Council on the eve of the election &#8212; as Putin&#8217;s regime sought to force them to do his anti-democratic bidding.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4988129">Kommersant</a>, the tech giants were warned the Russian Federation was preparing to tighten regulations on their businesses &#8212; and told to &#8220;come to their senses&#8221;, facing another warning that they were at a &#8220;red line&#8221;.</p>
<p>The last-ditch effort to force the platforms to remove Navalny&#8217;s app did then pay off.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Roskomnadzor has also been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-consumer-watchdog-bans-vyprvpn-opera-vpn-services-2021-06-17/">targeting VPN apps in the country</a> for removal &#8212; making it hard for Russians to circumvent the local ban on Navalny&#8217;s app by accessing the software through the stores of other countries.</p>
<p>Local search giant Yandex has also reportedly been ordered <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddawkins/2021/09/07/putin-turns-up-heat-on-russias-top-search-engine-after-ban-on-political-smart-voting-search-results/">not to display search results for the Smart Voting app</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/russia-is-trying-to-throttle-twitter/">Earlier this year</a>, Putin&#8217;s regime also targeted Twitter &#8212; throttling the service for failing to remove content it wanted banned, although Roskomnadzor claimed the action was related to non-political content such as minors committing suicide, child sexual exploitation and drug use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply chain and fleet management solutions company <a href="https://ryder.com/expertise/videos/embark">Ryder</a> is partnering with yet another autonomous trucking company. On Thursday, Ryder announced its plans to help Embark launch a nationwide network of up to 100 transfer points that will be owned and operated by the autonomous trucking developer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Ryder’s third public partnership with autonomous trucking companies. It recently announced plans that are currently underway to <a href="https://ryder.com/expertise/videos/embark">help </a></span><a href="https://ryder.com/expertise/videos/embark"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waymo Via </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ryder.com/expertise/videos/embark">scale its autonomous trucking business</a> by helping with standardized fleet maintenance and management. Ryder is also working with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TuSimple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/tusimples-self-driving-truck-network-takes-shape-with-ryder-partnership/">leverage its own facilities as terminals for the startup</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re on the cutting edge and really beginning to understand that AV could have a pretty significant role in the future of transportation logistics, so we want to get in as early as possible and start working with these companies that seem to be dominating the market with their technologies,” Karen Jones, Ryder’s EVP for new product innovation, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OlW1m0DSLX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/tusimples-self-driving-truck-network-takes-shape-with-ryder-partnership/">TuSimple&#8217;s self-driving truck network takes shape with Ryder partnership</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TuSimple&#8217;s self-driving truck network takes shape with Ryder partnership&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/tusimples-self-driving-truck-network-takes-shape-with-ryder-partnership/embed/#?secret=OlW1m0DSLX" data-secret="OlW1m0DSLX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Ryder has been in talks with other AV companies like Kodiak, Aurora and Plus, Jones said no other deals are in the pipeline. Jones says Ryder is hoping to learn and grow through the different use cases its existing partnerships provide, as well as come up with a replicable transfer hub model that will help the company go to market faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think as we move this technology forward there&#8217;s still a lot of unknowns about how to maintain, how to service and how to operate,” said Jones. “Ryder is a natural fit to partner with because we have huge facilities for maintenance, and then we also have our supply chain and logistics business. We are a real operator that knows how these facilities and the complexities of getting vehicles in and out for delivery to larger facilities work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of its partnership with Embark, Ryder will provide yard operations, maintenance and fleet management. It will also play an advisory role on Embark’s network of strategically located transfer points where freight is moved from driverless long-haul trucks to driver-controlled trucks for first- and last-mile delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryder is helping Embark to understand what’s required at the facilities and cooperating with Embark’s third-party partners who will either be constructing or locating sites for these facilities, says Jones. At the start, the companies will select sites in key freight markets in California, Arizona, Texas, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida through which Embark will be able to begin operations early next year in preparation for a larger commercial launch in 2024. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autonomous companies often choose Sun Belt regions to begin operations because it’s rare to have to account for inclement weather patterns like snow and sleet, making the environment optimal for testing. But over the next five years, Embark and Ryder aim to work with a network of real estate operators to open 100 Embark transfer points across the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Embark, which recently</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/autonomous-trucking-startup-embark-to-go-public-in-5-2b-spac-deal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced plans to go public via a SPAC deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, moves freight for companies like HP and Budweiser maker AB inBev, as well as Knight Swift Transportation, Werner Enterprises and other “top 25 U.S. truckload carriers,” according to CEO Alex Rodrigues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodrigues says Embark’s current freight partnerships are either pilots or smaller-scale versions of what the company plans to launch in the future. The company has a fleet of 16 trucks today that operate on highways with a human safety operator in the front seat just in case, but usually, the driver does not have to take over, even if the AV encounters a new scenario. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Autonomous trucking startup Embark to go public in $5.2B SPAC deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/autonomous-trucking-startup-embark-to-go-public-in-5-2b-spac-deal/embed/#?secret=QK1ZgmnTfG" data-secret="QK1ZgmnTfG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operating on highways means building out a network of off-highway transfer hubs, which is actually pretty essential, even though it will require a lot of capital and time to scale. TuSimple, by comparison, is using existing Ryder locations and retrofitting them to serve as TuSimple terminals, rather than building out new terminals, like what Embark is doing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waymo Via is also building its own hubs, and Ryder’s fleet maintenance, inspections and roadside assistance will help the autonomous trucking arm of Waymo scale those sites as well as maximize vehicle uptime and reliability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ryder lends its varied capabilities to all of these different use cases, it is able to consider its own potential in the AV space, and not just in the logistics of it all. Jones said the company is open to operating an autonomous fleet one day if it makes sense to do so on behalf of a customer, and is also very entrenched in its first- and last-mile delivery services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a number of spaces for Ryder to play as the whole AV initiative evolves, but our first foray into this is really servicing and beginning to understand the technology, as well as the requirements for operating hubs,” said Jones. </span></p>
