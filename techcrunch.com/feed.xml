										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.twincocapital.com/">Twinco Capital</a>, a Madrid and Amsterdam-based startup making it easier to access supply chain finance, has raised €3 million in funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is Spanish VC fund Mundi Ventures, with participation from previous backer Finch Capital and several unnamed angels. Twinco Capital also has a debt facility with the Spanish investment bank EBN Banco de Negocios, which is common for any type of lending company.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Sandra Nolasco and Carmen Marin Romano, Twinco Capital offers a supply chain finance solution that includes purchase order funding. To do this, it integrates with large corporates on the purchase side and then funds suppliers by paying up to 60% of the purchase order value upfront and the remainder immediately upon delivery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The entire process is digital, promising a quick decision and fast deployment of funds, and is powered by Twinco’s supply chain analytics and the data it is able to access by partnering with both sides of the supply chain.</p>
<p>“The financing of global supply chains is expensive and inefficient, the burden of the cost is mostly borne by the suppliers and in particular by those that are SMEs in emerging markets,” explains Twinco Capital co-founder and CEO Sandra Nolasco.</p>
<p>“Take any global supply chain, such as apparel, automotive, electronics etc. Exporters in countries like Bangladesh, China or Vietnam that have been supplying European companies for years, with stable commercial relationships. However, their creditworthiness is still measured only on the basis of annual financials, making access to competitive liquidity a major obstacle for growth”.</p>
<p>By having visibility on both sides, including upcoming orders, Twinco provides liquidity to the suppliers “from purchase order to final invoice payment”.</p>
<p>“We do that by analyzing supply chain data &#8211; the performance of the suppliers, the network effects between common suppliers and buyers (and many more data points I am not allowed to mention!),” says the Twinco CEO. “In short, using advanced data analytics we can better assess, price and significantly mitigate risk. The good news is that the more transactions we fund, the more suppliers and buyers we add, the more robust is our risk assessment. We believe there is a strong network effect”.</p>
<p>To that end, Twinco makes money by charging a “discount fee” for each purchase order it funds. “Since default rates are a fraction of that fee, we can unlock significant value,” says Nolasco.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the fintech is also unlocking an asset class for investors and competes with local banks that are much more manual and don’t benefit from increased visibility via network effects. Nolasco says that to ensure interests are aligned, the company uses a portion of equity to also invest in the purchase orders it funds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[PayPal is shutting down its domestic business in India, less than four years after the American giant kickstarted local operations in the world’s second largest internet market. “From 1 April 2021, we will focus all our attention on enabling more international sales for Indian businesses, and shift focus away from our domestic products in India.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal is shutting down its domestic business in India, less than four years after the American giant kickstarted local operations in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>“From 1 April 2021, we will focus all our attention on enabling more international sales for Indian businesses, and shift focus away from our domestic products in India. This means we will no longer offer domestic payment services within India from 1 April,” said a company spokesperson.</p>
<p>In a long statement, PayPal said its priorities had shifted in India, but did not elaborate why it was winding down the business. A report recently said the company, which has amassed over 360,000 merchants in the country, was struggling to make inroads in India.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indian news outlet The Morning Context <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/paypal-india-hits-pause-on-domestic-payments-business">reported</a> in December that PayPal was abandoning its local payments business in India, a claim the company had refuted at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the shift in priorities, some PayPal employees have been reassigned to new teams. Our focus is to always minimize the impact on our people whenever possible. Overall, our workforce is growing in India, not reducing. We are currently recruiting across our sites in India in large numbers,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the move comes as a surprise. The company said last year that it was building a payments service powered by India&#8217;s UPI railroad, suggesting an increase in the level of investments it was making in the country.</p>
<p>Over the years, PayPal also partnered with a range of popular Indian businesses such as ticketing services BookMyShow and MakeMyTrip and food delivery platform Swiggy to offer a faster check out experience. At the time of writing, PayPal website in India appears to have removed all such references.</p>
<p>India has emerged as one of the world&#8217;s largest battlegrounds for mobile payments firms in recent years. Scores of heavily-backed firms including Paytm, PhonePe, Google, Amazon, and Facebook are competing among one another to increase their share in India, where the market is estimated to be worth $1 trillion by 2023. Several of these firms also offer a range of payments services for merchants.</p>
<p>The company, which says it processed $1.4 billion worth of international sales for merchants in India last year, added that it will continue to invest in “product development that enables Indian businesses to reach nearly 350 million PayPal consumers worldwide, increase their sales internationally, and help the Indian economy return to growth.”</p>
<p>PayPal <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has been offering cross-border payments support in India for more than a decade. After entering the country, it allowed consumers in India to pay at online merchants with local currency.</span></p>
<p><em>The story was updated with additional details provided by PayPal.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kuaishou, a Chinese video app that&#8217;s largely underappreciated outside China, has just completed a massive initial public offering in Hong Kong. The app is by far the biggest rival for Douyin, TikTok&#8217;s Chinese version, and unlike many Western video platforms that make money from ads and subscriptions, Kuaishou&#8217;s cash cow is its tipping business.</p>
<p>Kuaishou&#8217;s shares opened in Hong Kong on Friday at HK$338 ($43.6) apiece, a 194% jump from its <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2021/0126/2021012600014_c.pdf">IPO price of HK$115</a> ($14.8). That catapults its market cap to nearly HK$1.4 trillion ($180 billion). The company pocketed approximately $5.4 billion from the listing with a total of 365,218,600 shares, excluding the overallotment option.</p>
<p>Kuaishou, which is backed by Tencent, now has a replenished coffer to invest in growth and hopefully work towards profitability. In the first nine months of 2020, the app posted an adjusted net loss of 7.2 billion yuan ($1.1 billion), compared to an adjusted profit of 1.8 billion yuan in the same period a year earlier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kuaishou&#8217;s stock is a huge hit with both institutional financiers and retail investors from China, many of whom are familiar with the app that boasted 481 million monthly users in the 11 months ended November. The app set a record as the most oversubscribed deal in Hong Kong, attracting retail investor demand totaling $164.8 billion, the South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3119805/tencent-backed-kuaishous-ipo-overbought-1200-times-retail">reported</a>. Its share reached HK$322.8 on the gray market platform operated by Phillip Securities Group and HK$421 on online broker Futu Securities.</p>
<p>Like Douyin, Kuaishou began as a platform for people to create and share 15-second short videos (following a brief period as a GIF app) and later expanded into live streaming. The transition is natural, as creators who have built a name may seek further interaction with followers, and followers may want to express their loyalty and affection to creators. Live streaming and virtual gifting fill that need.</p>
<p>Kuaishou has three main monetization methods, with live streaming making up the majority of its revenue. Fifty-eight million users on Kuaishou spent on live videos monthly in the 11 months ended November, and on average every paying user brought 47.6 yuan ($7.36) in revenue.</p>
<p>The app also sells ads, with each user driving 71.4 yuan ($11) in marketing revenue for the period. Lastly, Kuaishou allows creators to hawk products. The gross merchandise value &#8212; an industry metric used loosely to measure e-commerce transactions &#8212; generated directly on Kuaishou reached 332.7 billion yuan ($51.4 billion) in the period.</p>
<p>For comparison, the live streaming feature on Alibaba&#8217;s Taobao bazaar generated over <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p210202.pdf">400 billion yuan in GMV</a> for the twelve months ended December.</p>
<p>While Kuaishou enjoys growing revenue from live streaming, regulatory risks loom in the background. The Chinese government has banned users under the age of 18 from purchasing virtual gifts. It has also urged platforms to <a href="http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2020/1124/c1004-31941781.html">put a cap</a> on users&#8217; monthly spending on virtual gifts, though regulators haven&#8217;t specified or suggested a limit.</p>
<p>Kuaishou is aware of the risk, noting in its <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/app/sehk/2020/102806/documents/sehk21012400052.pdf">prospectus</a> that &#8220;any limits on user spending on virtual gifting ultimately imposed may negatively impact our revenues derived from virtual gifting and our results of operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until regulators take further action to rein in virtual gifting, Kuaishou will likely continue to thrive while it works on diversifying its business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Democrats in the House voted to strip <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/qanon-congress-house-race-marjorie-taylor-greene/">freshman Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> of some of her responsibilities Thursday, citing her penchant for <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-threats-pelosi-mccarthy-qanon-parkland-163725291.html">violent</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/532534-rep-elect-marjorie-taylor-greene-wears-trump-won-mask-on-house-floor">anti-democratic</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22256258/marjorie-taylor-greene-jewish-space-laser-anti-semitism-conspiracy-theories">at times anti-Semitic</a> conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Greene has expressed support for a range of alarming conspiracies, including the belief that the 2018 Parkland school shooting that killed 17 people was a &#8220;false flag.&#8221; That belief prompted<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/536976-two-major-teachers-unions-call-on-gop-leadership-to-remove-greene-from"> two teachers unions to call for her removal</a> from the House Education Committee — one of her new committee assignments.</p>
<p>The vote on a resolution to remove Greene from her committee assignments broke along party lines, with nearly all Republicans opposing the resolution. Some of her colleagues even voted in Greene&#8217;s defense in spite of condemning her behavior in the past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As the House moved to vote on the highly unusual resolution, the new Georgia lawmaker claimed that her embrace of QAnon was in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never once said during my entire campaign &#8216;QAnon,&#8217; &#8221; Greene said Thursday. &#8220;I never once said any of the things that I am being accused of today during my campaign. I never said any of these things since I have been elected for Congress. These were words of the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-claims-she-never-promoted-qanon-after-her-georgia-election-win-thats-not-true?via=twitter_page">Daily Beast&#8217;s Will Sommer reported</a>, a deleted tweet from December shows Greene explicitly defending QAnon and directing blame toward the media and &#8220;big tech.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marjorie Taylor Greene claimed today that she hasn&#39;t promoted QAnon since being elected. But on Dec. 4, she praised an article promoting Q in a now-deleted tweet. The story Greene praised as &quot;accurate&quot; calls QAnon an &quot;objective flow of information” that&#39;s &quot;uniting Christians.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/nN3bnTCyPa">pic.twitter.com/nN3bnTCyPa</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Will Sommer (@willsommer) <a href="https://twitter.com/willsommer/status/1357400323611058180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In another recently-uncovered post from January 2019, Greene showed support for online comments calling for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-democrats-violence/index.html">&#8220;a bullet to the head&#8221; for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and executing FBI agents</a>.</p>
<p>Greene has also shared openly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/us/politics/kevin-mccarthy-marjorie-taylor-greene.html">racist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic views in Facebook videos</a>, a track record that prompted Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to condemn her statements as &#8220;appalling&#8221; last June. More recently, McCarthy defended Greene against efforts to remove her from committees.</p>
<p>Greene was elected in November to represent a conservative district in northwest Georgia after her opponent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/17/kevin-van-ausdal-qanon-marjorie-greene-georgia/?arc404=true">Kevin Van Ausdal dropped out, citing personal reasons</a>. Greene beat her opponent in the Republican primary in August, winning 57% of the vote.</p>
<p>QAnon, a dangerous once-fringe collection of conspiracy theories, was well-represented in January&#8217;s deadly Capitol riot and many photos from the day show the prevalence of QAnon symbols and sayings. In 2019, an FBI bulletin warned of QAnon&#8217;s connection to &#8220;conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists.&#8221; A year later, at least one person who had espoused the same views would win a seat in Congress.</p>
<p>The overlap between Greene&#8217;s beliefs and those of the violent pro-Trump mob at the Capitol escalated tensions among lawmakers, many of whom feared for their lives as the assault unfolded.</p>
<p>A freshman representative with little apparent appetite for policy or coalition-building, Greene wasn&#8217;t likely to wield much legislative power in the House. But as QAnon and adjacent conspiracies move from the fringe to the mainstream and possibly back again — a trajectory largely dictated by the at times arbitrary <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/twitter-qanon-ban/">decisions of social media companies</a> — Greene&#8217;s treatment in Congress may signal what&#8217;s to come for a dangerous online movement that&#8217;s more than demonstrated its ability to spill over into real-world violence.</p>

<p>The fitness company is among those tech firms that have seen a tremendous rise in interest amid the pandemic. In fact, it seems these days that VCs can’t pump money into at-home fitness solutions quickly enough to appease their interest. 2020 was a banner year for home workout solutions, from LuluLemon’s $500 million acquisition of Mirror to new platforms from Apple and Samsung.</p>
<p>In all, Peloton pulled in $1.06 billion in<a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2021"> revenue last quarter</a>, marking a more than 200% increase, year over year. The numbers beat Wall Street expectations and are showing no sign of slowing, with another massive quarter expected for the connected fitness brand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The market did <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/peloton-pton-reports-q2-2021-earnings.html">balk slightly</a> at Peloton’s admission that, “While this investment will dampen our near-term profitability, improving our member experience is our first priority.” Clearly this big spend on reducing supply bottlenecks is a longer-term play.</p>
<p>Of course, it remains to be seen how the company’s earnings will stabilize after the pandemic. I’d anticipate there will be some slowing for Peloton and other brands when vaccines make returning to gyms a more widescale phenomenon. Still, home workouts &#8212; like remote work &#8212; may well be an aspect that is fundamentally transformed even with COVID-19 in the rearview.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA has awarded Firefly Aerospace a $93.3 million contract to take a lunar lander module loaded with experiments to the surface of the moon. While the company will not be performing the launch itself, it will be providing the spacecraft and <a href="https://firefly.com/lunar-lander/">&#8220;Blue Ghost&#8221; lander</a> for the 2023 mission.</p>
<p>The space agency made the award as part of its ongoing Commercial Lunar Payload Services, under which several other non-prime space companies have been selected for similar work: Blue Origin, Astrobotic, Masten and so on.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rocket startup Firefly signs satellite constellation launch mission with Satlantis&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/rocket-startup-firefly-partners-signs-satellite-constellation-launch-mission-with-satlantis/embed/#?secret=DxJuEu8vif" data-secret="DxJuEu8vif" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This particular contract was first publicized to its CLPS partners back in September, which would have submitted bids for the project; Firefly clearly carried the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re excited another CLPS provider has won its first task order award,&#8221; said NASA associate administrator for science Thomas Zurbuchen <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-firefly-aerospace-for-artemis-commercial-moon-delivery-in-2023">in a release announcing the contract</a>. The last few years have seen many such firsts as NASA has increasingly embraced the commercial sector in providing everything from launch services to satellite and spacecraft manufacturing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not exactly Firefly&#8217;s first order from NASA, though: Its national security subsidiary Firefly Black (ominous) will be launching two cubesats for the Venture Class Launch Service Demo-2 mission. But this is larger and more complex by a huge margin (not to mention more expensive).</p>
<p>This will be the maiden lunar voyage for Firefly&#8217;s Blue Ghost lander, which it&#8217;s been working on for the last few years in anticipation of renewed interest in the moon. It will hold the 10 scientific payloads, which NASA describes <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-firefly-aerospace-for-artemis-commercial-moon-delivery-in-2023">here</a>, including a new laser reflector array and an experimental radiation-tolerant computer. There&#8217;s a lot to be loaded up, but Blue Ghost should have 50kg of space left over for anyone else who wants a ride to the moon.</p>
<p>Everything is going to Mare Crisium, a basin on the &#8220;light&#8221; or near side of the moon, where hopefully they will contribute valuable observations and experiments to inform future visits to and habitation on the moon.</p>
<p>Firefly will also be providing the spacecraft that will take the lander into lunar space, and will be responsible for getting it off the Earth in the first place — the company told me they&#8217;re evaluating options for that. By the time 2023 rolls around there should be plenty of rides to choose from, and indeed Firefly&#8217;s own Alpha launch vehicle may be flying by then, though it&#8217;s not ready to commit to a lunar insertion orbit mission today. The company plans to have its first Alpha flight in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch tuned into <a href="https://500.co/">500 Startups</a>&#8216; 27th demo day today, keen to get our eyes on the accelerator&#8217;s latest companies.</p>
<p>Demo days are regular affairs, but they always feature a crop of startups that could build the next tech giant, so we pay attention. Especially in the COVID-19 era, when demo days have gone virtual. Now it&#8217;s easier than ever for investors, and journalists, to tune in.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/here-are-the-94-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-2/">covered Y Combinator&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">virtual demo days</a>, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/10-favorite-startups-from-techstars-october-2020-class/">regular batches</a> from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/five-favorite-techstars-startups-ahead-of-its-next-rush-of-demo-days/">various Techstars accelerators around the world</a>.</p>
<p>But, today we&#8217;re talking favorites from 500 Startups&#8217; latest cohort. <a href="https://twitter.com/jshieber">Jonathan Shieber</a> will take the baton first, followed by <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm</a>.</p>
<h2>Demo day standouts</h2>
<p><a href="https://stackbrowser.com/"><strong>Stack</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What:</strong> A new way to browse online.</li>
<li><strong>Why we like it:</strong> The browser and tab model hasn&#8217;t changed much since the days of Netscape and organizing online information is increasingly a complicated mess of a hundred tabs (at least on my browser). Stack is pitching a new way to organize information that&#8217;s more interactive, more organized and easier to visualize.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://adapty.io/"><strong>Adapty</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What: </strong>Low-code A/B testing of monetization mechanics and subscriber services for apps.</li>
<li><strong>Why we like it:</strong> Helping to give app developers tools to better understand where, how and why monetization breaks down and offer tools to fix it makes Adapty a standout among this 500 cohort. The app economy is still a multibillion dollar business and getting customers to stick around remains a huge problem. Anything that can help is a boon for company builders.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week&#8217;s biggest tech happenings. The good news is that we managed to fit it all into a single episode this week. The bad news is that that means the show is pretty long. Sorry about that!</p>
<p>So, what took us so much time to get through? All of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robinhood <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">raised $3.4 billion</a> after its trading hiccups, and we also chatted over what we know about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/">the company&#8217;s Q4 2020 numbers</a>. In short, the company is growing nicely.</li>
<li>RPA is big and UiPath is cashing in on the trend, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">raising $750 million at a $35 billion valuation</a>. That&#8217;s a lot of cash for very little dilution.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huawei’s status in the U.S. has been one of many question marks hovering over the newly minted Biden administration. The smartphone maker was one of a number of Chinese companies added to the Department of Commerce’s “entity list” during Trump’s four years in office.</p>
<p>Gina Raimondo, Joe Biden’s nominee for Commerce secretary, has offered what is potentially one of the clearest looks so far at how Huawei’s status might (or might not) evolve under a new administration. Responding to questions from Senate Republicans, former Rhode Island Governor Raimondo indicated that the Biden administration likely would not be in any hurry to remove Huawei from the blacklist.</p>
<p>Republican House members had previously<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/536979-house-republicans-urge-senate-to-block-vote-on-commerce-secretary-over"> raised concerns</a> over Raimondo&#8217;s position on companies like Huawei, a stance she had yet to clarify. “We urge those Senators who have a history of calling for Huawei to remain on the Entity List to stick to their principles and place a hold on Ms. Raimondo’s confirmation until the Biden Administration clarifies their intentions for Huawei and on export control policies for a country that is carrying out genocide and threatening our national security,&#8221; they wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Raimondo has since responded.</p>
<p>“I understand that parties are placed on the Entity List and the Military End User List generally because they pose a risk to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests,” the politician said, in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/biden-commerce-pick-sees-no-reason-to-pull-huawei-from-blacklist">note reported by Bloomberg</a>. “I currently have no reason to believe that entities on those lists should not be there. If confirmed, I look forward to a briefing on these entities and others of concern.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QcTAFkiGNv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/xiaomi-us-blacklist/">Trump administration adds Xiaomi to military blacklist</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trump administration adds Xiaomi to military blacklist&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/xiaomi-us-blacklist/embed/#?secret=QcTAFkiGNv" data-secret="QcTAFkiGNv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The statement isn’t definitive in either direction (as is perhaps to be expected for a Cabinet nominee), but it certainly doesn’t point to a radical change from Trump’s position on the issue. The smartphone marker was added to the list in 2019, following longtime accusations over security and spying concerns. The company has also variously been tied to the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The DoC noted at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Huawei was added to the Entity List after the Department concluded that the company is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests, including alleged violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), conspiracy to violate IEEPA by providing prohibited financial services to Iran, and obstruction of justice in connection with the investigation of those alleged violations of U.S. sanctions, among other illicit activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Trump administration proved especially aggressive in regards to blacklisting Chinese tech companies, a fact that has already had a profound impact on Huawei’s bottom line. Drone giant DJI and AI company SenseTime have been added to the DoC list, while Xiaomi made a separate military blacklist in the waning days of the administration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Democrats settle into control of both chambers of Congress, signs of the party&#8217;s legislative priorities are starting to manifest. So far, lawmakers&#8217; interest in reimagining tech&#8217;s regulatory landscape appears to be alive and well.</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) is out with a new proposal for antitrust reform that would create more barriers for big mergers and beef up federal resources for antitrust enforcement. Klobuchar&#8217;s bill, the <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/1/e171ac94-edaf-42bc-95ba-85c985a89200/375AF2AEA4F2AF97FB96DBC6A2A839F9.sil21191.pdf">Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act</a>, seeks to address consolidation across industries, calling out &#8220;dominant digital platforms&#8221; specifically.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the United States once had some of the most effective antitrust laws in the world, our economy today faces a massive competition problem,&#8221; Klobuchar said. &#8220;We can no longer sweep this issue under the rug and hope our existing laws are adequate.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Klobuchar now leads the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, a corner of Congress already signaling its interest on reform that would impact big tech.</p>
<p>The new bill would bolster the Clayton Antitrust Act, a 1914 bill that created a framework for the rules around competition that are still applied today. Specifically, it would amend that bill to reinterpret its standard for evaluating anti-competitive mergers, changing the language to prevent any deal that &#8220;create[s] an appreciable risk of materially lessening competition&#8221; rather than the current wording.</p>
<p>The aim is to catch potentially anti-competitive behavior earlier in the game — an outcome that would address the government&#8217;s current conundrum, in which federal regulators are now awkwardly reevaluating mergers that evolved into monopolistic behavior years after the fact.</p>
<p>The bill would also put the onus on merging companies to prove that they don&#8217;t pose a risk of reducing competition, taking that burden off of the government in specific cases. Those rules would apply to &#8220;mega-mergers&#8221; worth $5 billion or more and in which a company with 50% market share seeks to buy a current or potential competitor.</p>
<p>Klobuchar&#8217;s proposal also seeks to add a provision to the Clayton Act against conduct that puts competitors at a disadvantage — a rule that would address some of the murkier areas of anti-competitive behavior that stretch beyond outright mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Citing lacking enforcement budgets, the bill also sets out a $300 million infusion for the Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division and the FTC. At the FTC, that money would help create a new division within the agency for research on markets and mergers.</p>
<p>The bill will be co-sponsored by Senators Cory Booker, Richard Blumenthal, Brian Schatz and Ed Markey, all Democrats on the antitrust subcommittee. And while it&#8217;s a single party endeavor for now, the antitrust reform could attract support from Republicans in Congress like Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-calls-ban-big-tech-mergers-and-acquisitions">signaled his interest</a> in antitrust changes that target large tech companies as recently as this week. Hawley also sits on the Senate&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee.</p>
<p>Klobuchar stops short of calling for large tech companies like Facebook and Google to be broken into their component parts, a move that has attracted some support from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/presidential-hopeful-elizabeth-warren-is-calling-for-the-breakup-of-big-tech/">lawmakers like Elizabeth Warren</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/18/bernie-sanders-break-up-google-amazon-apple-1369255">Bernie Sanders</a> in recent years. In the midst of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/">emerging multistate lawsuits targeting big tech companies</a>, the FTC announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">own antitrust case against Facebook</a> late last year, pushing for the company to be broken up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation (RPA) has found a strong foothold in the world of enterprise IT through its effective use of AI and other technology to help automate repetitive tasks to free up people to focus on more complicated work. Today, a startup called <a href="http://infinitus.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infinitus</a> is coming out of stealth to apply this concept to the world of healthcare &#8212; specifically, to speed up the process of voice communication between entities in the fragmented U.S. healthcare industry.</p>
<p>Infinitus uses &#8220;voice RPA&#8221; to become the machine-generated voice that makes calls from, say, healthcare providers or pharmacies to insurance companies to go through a series of questions (directed at humans at the other end) that typically need to be answered before payments are authorized and other procedures can take place. Those conversations are then ingested into Infinitus&#8217;s platform to parse them for relevant information that is input into the right fields to trigger whatever actions need to happen as a result of the calls.</p>
<p>The startup is coming out of &#8220;stealth mode&#8221; today but it has been around for a couple of years already and has signed on a number of large healthcare companies as customers &#8212; for example, the wholesale drug giant <a href="https://www.amerisourcebergen.com/insights/manufacturers/harnessing-the-power-of-a-digital-assistant-to-accelerate-patient-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AmerisourceBergen</a>. And it is contributing pro bono its technology to public health efforts around the current coronavirus pandemic, with one organization currently using it to <a href="https://infinitus.ai/blog-posts/vaccinateca-covid19-automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automate a mass calling system</a> across several states to get a better idea of vaccine availability to help connect the earliest doses with the most vulnerable groups that need them the fastest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It made 75,000 calls on behalf of 12,000 providers in January alone.</p>
<p>Infinitus&#8217; public launch is also coming with a funding kicker: it has picked up $21.4 million in Series A funding from a group of big-name investors to build the business.</p>
<p>The round is being co-led by Kleiner Perkins and Coatue, with Gradient Ventures (Google&#8217;s early-stage AI fund), Quiet Capital, Firebolt Ventures and Tau Ventures also participating, along with individual investments from a selection of executives across the worlds of AI and big tech: Ian Goodfellow, Gokul Rajaram, Aparna Chennapragada and Qasar Younis.</p>
<p>Coatue is shaping up to be a huge investor in the opportunity in RPA. Earlier this week, it emerged that it co-led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the latest investment in UiPath</a>, one of the leaders in the space, having been a part of previous rounds as well.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cweT4gPK30"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">Robotic process automation platform UiPath raises $750M at $35B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Robotic process automation platform UiPath raises $750M at $35B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/embed/#?secret=cweT4gPK30" data-secret="cweT4gPK30" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Coatue is proud to have led the Series A in Infinitus,” says Yanda Erlich, a general partner at Coatue. “We are big believers in the transformative power of RPA and Enterprise Automation. We believe Infinitus’ VoiceRPA solution enables healthcare organizations to automate previously costly and manual calls and faxes and empowers these organizations to see benefits from end-to-end process automation.”</p>
<p>The problem that Infinitus is addressing is the fact that healthcare, in particular in the privatized U.S. market, has a lot of time-consuming and often confusing red tape when it comes to getting things done. And a lot of the most immediate pain points of that process can be found in voice calls, which are the primary basis of critical communications between different entities in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Voice calls are used to initiate most processes, whether it&#8217;s to obtain critical information, follow up on a form or previous communication, or pass on some data, or of course provide clearance for a payment.</p>
<p>There are 900 million calls of these kinds made in the U.S., with the average length of each call 35 minutes, and with the average healthcare professional who works in an administrative role to make those calls dedicating some 4.5 hours each day to being on the phone.</p>
<p>All of this ultimately adds to the exorbitant costs of healthcare services in the U.S. (and likely some of those inscrutable lines of fees that you might see on bills), not to mention delays in giving care. (And those volumes underscore just what a small piece Infinitus touches today.)</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Ankit Jain &#8212; a repeat entrepreneur and ex-Googler who held senior roles in engineering and was a founding partner at Gradient at the search giant &#8212; told TechCrunch in an interview that the idea for Infinitus first occurred to him a couple of years ago, when he was still at Gradient.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were starting to see a lot of improvements in voice communications technology, turning text into speech and speech into text. I realised that it would soon be possible to automate phone calls where a machine could carry out a full conversation with someone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, around that time, Google itself had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/the-google-assistant-will-soon-be-able-to-call-restaurants-and-make-a-reservations-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched Duplex, </a>a service built around the same principle<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/the-google-assistant-will-soon-be-able-to-call-restaurants-and-make-a-reservations-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">, </a>but aimed at consumers, for people to book appointments, restaurant tables and other services.</p>
<p>He determined that just being able to talk like a human and understand natural language wasn&#8217;t the only issue, and not even the main one, in enterprises applications like healthcare environments, which rely on specific jargon and particular scenarios that are probably <em>less</em> rather than more like actual human interactions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought, if someone wanted to build this for healthcare it would change it,&#8221; he said. And so he decided to do just that.</p>
<p class="p1">Jain &#8212; who co-founded the company with Shyam Rajagopalan, the CTO, who was previously at Snap, and also worked with Jain at his previous startup Quettra, as well as at Google &#8212; said that Infinitus is using public cloud speech-to-text systems, but the natural language processing and flows to triage and use the information gained from the conversations are built in-house.</p>
<p class="p1">The specialization of the content and interactions potentially is also one reason why Infinitus might not worry so soon about cannibalization from bigger RPA players, at least for now.</p>
<p class="p1">However, Jain notes that much of the tech is vertical-agnostic: that is both an argument for Infinitus to expand into other areas beyond healthcare, but also a sign that others could potentially build something to compete with it.</p>
<p>The fact that services like these &#8212; the new generation of robocalls, as it were &#8212; can sound &#8220;lifelike&#8221;, like actual humans, has been something that consumer versions have aspired to, although that hasn&#8217;t always worked out for the best. Duplex, for example, in its early days <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/duplex-shows-google-failing-at-ethical-and-creative-ai-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">came under criticism</a> for how its excellent quality might actually be deceptive, because it wasn&#8217;t clear to users they were speaking to a machine logging their responses in a data harnessing exercise. Jain notes that Infinitus is actually intentionally choosing voices that sound like bots to help make that clear to those taking the calls.</p>
<p>He said that this also &#8220;helps reduce the level of chatter&#8221; on the conversation and keeps the person speaking focused on business.</p>
<p>On that front, it seems that while Infinitus works like other voice RPA services, connected up with live, human agents who can take over calls if they get tricky, that hasn&#8217;t really needed to be used.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we don’t need to triage with humans because we see high enough success rates with our system,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>You might wonder, why hasn&#8217;t the healthcare industry just moved past voice altogether? Surely there are ways of exchanging data between entities so that calls could become obsolete? Turns out that at least for now that isn&#8217;t something that will change quickly, Jain said.</p>
<p>Part of it is because the fragmentation in the market means it&#8217;s hard to implement new standards across the board, covering hundreds of insurance payers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical groups, billing and collections organisations and more.</p>
<p>And when it comes down to it, a phone call ends up being the easiest route for many admins who might have to typically deal with 100 different payment companies and other entities, each with a different logging mechanism.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of cognitive load, so it&#8217;s often easier to just pick up the phone,&#8221; Jain said.</p>
<p>Bringing in voiceRPA like Infinitus&#8217;s is part of that long haul to update the bigger system.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;By automating one side we are showing the other side that it can be done,&#8221; Jain said. &#8220;Right now, there are just too many players and getting them to agree on one standard is a gargantuan task, so trying to win one small piece after another is how it’s done. It should not be voice, but by the time standards bodies agree on something else, the world has moved on.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As startups have stayed private longer and liquidity has become harder to secure for early employees and investors, more and more shareholders have looked for ways to unload their shares to others. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/17/secondmarket-115-million-q1/">All the way back in 2011</a>, companies like SecondMarket were seeing nine-figures&#8217; worth of shares being traded on their secondary share platforms.</p>
<p>That wave of liquidity startups ran into two problems: One was regulatory, and the other was a lack of company information about cap tables and that company’s current financial picture. Stock buyers were essentially flying blind while buying into companies, which some investors were more than willing to do, but that blindness limited the market demand for secondary shares significantly.</p>
<p><a href="https://carta.com">Carta</a> is hoping that its base as the cap table management solution of choice for many startups will allow it to parlay that position into a new service it has called <a href="https://cartax.com/">CartaX</a>. We’ve heard rumblings <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/06/carta-was-just-valued-at-1-7-billion-by-andreessen-horowitz-in-a-deal-some-see-as-rich/">about the service for more than a year now</a>, but <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/finally-a-private-stock-exchange-cartax-3c658f30ac97">according to a new blog post by founder Henry Ward</a>, it looks like the product is exiting beta and starting to operate in the real world with real money.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yesterday, Carta sold just shy of $100 million of its shares across 1,484 market orders to 414 participants through its own CartaX product at a price of $6.9 billion. Ward says that is up from the $3.1 billion valuation of the company’s Series F round from last year.</p>
<p>As a comparison, secondary transactions typically involve secondary buyers who negotiate these deals manually one-on-one with individual sellers. What makes CartaX interesting is that it could allow for much faster and more frequent secondary sales at companies based on the same sort of computerized trading models that currently power the stock market.</p>
<p>Liquidity is a huge issue for startups, and while CartaX is just getting going, it fulfills a key need for many participants in the startup ecosystem, and it’s a key financial product to watch as it expands in 2021.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, revenues are looking good at Carta these days. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/revenue-climbs-at-carta-a-vc-favorite-now-valued-at-6-9-billion-after-private-stock-sales">According to an article earlier today by Zoë Bernard and Cory Weinberg at The Information</a>, Carta has an ARR of $150 million. That’s a 46x revenue multiple if all the numbers are correct, which these days is good if not great for SaaS companies approaching the public markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter is upping its data analytics game in the form of an expanded, multiyear partnership with Google Cloud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The social media giant first began working with Google in 2018 to </span><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2018/a-new-collaboration-with-google-cloud.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">move Hadoop cluster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s to the Google Cloud platform as a part of its </span><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2019/the-start-of-a-journey-into-the-cloud.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partly Cloudy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the expanded agreement, Twitter will move its offline analytics, data processing and machine learning workloads to</span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/google-cloud-leads-in-cloud-data-analytics-and-databases"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s Data Cloud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked with Sudhir Hasbe, Google Cloud’s director of product management and data analytics, to better understand just what this means. He said the move will give Twitter the ability to analyze data faster as part of its goal to provide a better user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, behind every tweet, like and retweet, there is a series of data points that helps Twitter understand things like just how people are using the service, and what type of content they might want to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter’s data platform ingests trillions of events, processes hundreds of petabytes of data and runs tens of thousands of jobs on over a dozen clusters daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By expanding its partnership with Google, Twitter is essentially adopting the company’s Data Cloud, including BigQuery, Dataflow, BigTable and machine learning (ML) tools to make more sense of, and improve, how Twitter features are used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal said in a written statement that the company’s initial partnership was successful and led to enhanced productivity on the part of its engineering teams.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Building on this relationship and Google’s technologies will allow us to learn more from our data, move faster and serve more relevant content to the people who use our service every day,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Cloud’s Hasbe believes that organizations like Twitter need a highly scalable analytics platform so they can derive value from all their data collecting. By expanding its partnership with Google, Twitter is able to add significantly more use cases out of its cloud platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our platform is serverless and we can help organizations, like Twitter, automatically scale up and down,” Hasbe told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Twitter can bring massive amounts of data, analyze and get insights without the burden of having to worry about infrastructure or capacity management or how many machines or servers they might need,” he added. “None of that is their problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shift will also make it easier for Twitter’s data scientists and other similar personnel to build machine learning models and do predictive analytics, according to Hasbe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other organizations that have recently turned to Google Cloud to help navigate the pandemic include </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0917/bedbathbeyond"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bed, Bath and Beyond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0110/wayfair-google-cloud"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayfair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0219/etsy-completes-migration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Etsy </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://diginomica.com/home-depot-builds-firm-data-foundation-google-big-query-meet-changing-customer-demands"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Home Depot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On February 2, TC’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/"><b>Frederic Lardinois</b></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/google-cloud-lost-5-6b-in-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Cloud is seeing accelerated revenue growth, its losses are also increasing. This week, Google </span><a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2020Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=9e991fd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disclosed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operating income/loss for its Google Cloud business unit in its quarterly earnings. Google Cloud lost $5.6 billion in Google’s fiscal year 2020, which ended December 31. That’s on $13 billion of revenue.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virtual health and wellness platforms have grown <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/coronavirus-impact-sends-app-downloads-usage-and-consumer-spending-to-record-highs-in-q2/">increasingly popular throughout the pandemic</a>, but a new startup wants to focus that effort exclusively on senior citizens. <a href="https://www.agebold.com">Bold</a>, a digital health and wellness service, plans to prevent chronic health problems in older adults through free and personalized exercise programs. Co-founded by Amanda Rees and her partner Hari Arul, Bold picked up $7 million this week in seed funding led by Julie Yoo of Silicon Valley-based Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>Rees said in an interview that the idea for Bold came from time she spent caring for her grandmother, helping her through health challenges like falls. “I kept thinking about solutions we could build to keep someone healthier longer, rather than waiting for until they have a fall or something else goes off the rails to intervene,” she said. Rees started Bold to use what she’d learned from her own experience in dance and yoga to help her grandmother practice maintaining balance to prevent future falls. “My passion really was around ways to sort of widen the aperture and make these solutions more accessible and built for older people.”</p>
<p>The member experience is pretty straightforward. Users fill out some brief fitness information on the web-based platform, outlining their goals and current baseline. From that information, Bold creates a personalized program that ranges from a short, seated Tai Chi class once a week, to cardio and strength classes meeting multiple times each week. “The idea is to really meet a member where they are, and then through our programming, help them along their journey of doing the types of exercises that are going to have the most immediate benefit for them,” said Rees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Bold’s funding round comes at a time of <a href="https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-ballooning-costs-of-long-term-care/">concern around ballooning healthcare expenses for older populations</a>, and a focus on how to reduce these costs for both current and future generations. While falls alone aren’t necessarily complex medical incidents, they have the potential to lead to fractures and other serious injuries. Bold’s preventative approach to falls is a more active solution than necklace or bracelet monitors that send a signal to emergency services when they detect a fall. And by offering virtual programs, they can help at-risk older populations engage in exercise while avoiding potential COVID-19 exposure at gyms.</p>
<p>Research shows that this works. Even <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/51/24/1750">simple, low-intensity exercise can improve balance and strength enough to reduce the incidence of falls</a>, which is currently the leading cause of injury and injury death among older adults.</p>
<p>Fewer injuries would mean less need for medical care, which would lead to money saved for hospitals and health insurers alike. That’s why in addition to their seed funding, Bold has plans to start rolling out partnerships with Medicare Advantage organizations and risk-bearing providers, which will help make their exercise programs available to users for free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The recent Databricks funding round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">$1 billion investment at a $28 billion valuation</a>, was one of the year&#8217;s most notable private investments so far.</p>
<p>For Databricks signaled its IPO readiness by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/databricks-crossed-350m-run-rate-in-q3-up-from-200m-one-year-ago/">disclosing to TechCrunch last year</a> that it had scaled its revenue run rate from $200 million to $350 million in a year, so the new capital looked like the capstone on its private fundraising before an eventual public debut.</p>

<hr />
<p>But I did have a few questions, starting with the price of the round.</p>
<p>At a $28 billion valuation and ARR of $425 million, Databricks is valued at around 66x top line. That&#8217;s steep, if not the highest number we can dredge up on the public markets. Of course, for Databricks shareholders, seeing the value of their stock rise so quickly is hardly a bad thing. They are hardly going to complain about having more paper wealth.</p>
<p>But what about the investor perspective? Does the price really make sense? The Exchange caught up with <a href="https://www.battery.com/our-team/member/dharmesh-thakker/">Battery Ventures&#8217; Dharmesh Thakker</a> earlier this week to discuss a number of things, one of which was Databricks&#8217; round and pricing. Thakker is <a href="https://databricks.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/databricks-secures-140-million-accelerate-analytics-artificial-intelligence-enterprise">named</a> in the Databricks Series D funding announcement, which brought Battery into the company.</p>

What surprised me was that he thinks its new $28 billion valuation might be a little <em>low</em>.</p>
<p>Intriguing, yeah? So this morning for both of us, I&#8217;ve pulled out quotes from our chat to help explain how Thakker views the market for Databricks, unicorns at scale more broadly through the lens of risk-adjusted investing, and the scale of the market some unicorns are playing in.</p>
<p>At the close, we&#8217;ll remind ourselves what Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi told TechCrunch when we asked him the same question. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>Databricks at $28 billion</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the valuation part of my chat with the Battery Ventures&#8217; investor went down:</p>
<p><strong>The Exchange: I want to talk about Databricks, because I spoke to [CEO] Ali [Ghodsi] yesterday about this round, and hot damn, it&#8217;s a lot of money at a valuation that is roughly 64x ARR, give or take. I don&#8217;t understand the price, and I know it&#8217;s a boring thing to talk about. [It&#8217;s a] great company, I get their market, I&#8217;ve talked to them a bunch, I know their revenue numbers. [But] I don&#8217;t understand the price, and I was hoping you could tell me why I&#8217;m being too conservative.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dharmesh Thakker:</strong>  I, for what it&#8217;s worth, think [the price] fair. If anything, I think it is on the lower end &#8212; he could have done better, frankly. But I think it comes down to three major things, right?</p>
<p>One is the addressable market. Just think about the addressable market of data. If there&#8217;s a trillion dollars spent in software or technology, I think you and I would be both hard pressed to say, almost all of that [isn&#8217;t] influenced by some data-oriented decisioning. Whether it&#8217;s digital transformation, whether it&#8217;s analytics, data is everywhere. So the TAM is massive … I think you and I both agree on that, whether it is $20 billion or $80 billion &#8212; it&#8217;s massive.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Fundraising is challenging, especially for deep tech founders who need to get investors excited about a complex technology, a complex sales cycle and a complex risk profile.</p>
<p>As a former investor and current angel investor, I have met thousands of founders, many in the deep tech space.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, here&#8217;s how to avoid making the most common mistakes deep tech founders make when pitching investors:</p>
<h2>Work on your storytelling</h2>
<h3><strong>Highlight your big vision</strong></h3>
<p>Early-stage investors are in the business of funding dreams. They chose to be early-stage investors because they love hearing about new ideas and enthralling futures. They deliberately are not investment bankers or accountants because they do not want to constantly pour over endless spreadsheets or dive deep into financial models. Similarly, they are not operators because they do not want to spend time figuring out the intricacies of a supply chain or a marketing campaign or the configuration of a product component.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Make your pitch tailored to what excites venture capital investors and avoid what does not.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So make your pitch tailored to what excites venture capital investors and avoid what does not. Keep the financial model details and the warehouse system logistics information to your Appendix. You have it in case anyone wants to dive in deeper, but your core presentation should be focused on your biggest, most bullish hopes for the company seven to 10 years from now. Dedicate multiple slides to painting the picture of what society would look like should you meet all your intended milestones as a company.</p>
<h3><strong>Underscore the impact</strong></h3>
<p>As a deep tech company, your differentiation is in your intellectual property. However, investors care less about the “what” and much more about the “so what.” Investors are less interested in the intricacies of your technology and more interested in what impact it can create.</p>
<p>Formulate your slides to focus on answering questions like, “What can people or companies do as a result of your technology?” and “How will people save time, money and lives with your product?”</p>
<p>Put your presentation to the “grandma” test. Would your grandmother be able to understand and be excited about everything you share? Investor pitch meetings are not dissertation defenses. You are being evaluated on your potential for impact rather than the intricate details of your research. The best way to succeed in this evaluation framework is to ensure that everything you share is relevant and exciting to a diverse audience of even nontechnical folks.</p>
<h3><strong>Try to reach hearts and minds</strong></h3>
<p>Five million people are a statistic, but one person is a story. When people read data on massive populations of people, they conceptually understand the implications but only on a logical level, not an emotional one. When pitching, you want to reach the hearts of investors.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.moka.care">moka.care</a>, a French startup that has built several services that should help you improve your psychological well-being. The company sells its solution to employers directly. They can then offer access to moka.care to their employees.</p>
<p>The startup raised a $3 million (€2.5 million) funding round from <a href="https://singular.vc">Singular</a>, the VC firm founded by former Alven partners Jeremy Uzan and Raffi Kamber. A long list of business angels are also participating in today’s round, such as Nicolas Dessaigne (Algolia), Ning Li (Made.com, Typology), Florian Douetteau (Dataiku), Céline Lazorthes (Leetchi, MangoPay), Pierre Dubuc (OpenClassrooms), Marc-Antoine de Longevialle (LeCab), Adrien Ledoux (JobTeaser), Roxanne Varza (Station F), Thibault Lamarque (CASTALIE) and Côme Fouques (Indy).</p>
<p>Moka.care believes that companies aren’t doing enough when it comes to mental health. Many companies give you a phone number and tell you that you can call that number to get mental support. But few employees actually call those helplines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s why the startup is taking a completely different approach. The most important principle is that people are looking for different things. And you don’t necessarily know what you’re looking for when you’re feeling down. When you first contact moka.care, the company spends roughly half an hour talking with you to understand what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>There are three main options after that. Moka.care could send you some recommendations for a practitioner — it can be a psychologist, a certified coach or a licensed therapist. Moka.care also organizes group sessions around a specific topic. It could be focused on remote work, work-life balance, self-confidence, etc. Finally, moka.care also provides content on some of those topics. You can access that content and learn more about yourself.</p>
<p>With this granular approach, the company hopes it can tackle mental health conditions before it’s too late — you don’t want to recommend a therapist when an employee is already suffering from excessive stress, fatigue or burnout.</p>
<p>Employees don’t pay for the first sessions as it’s part of moka.care’s plans. This way, the barrier to entry should be much lower for employees. Of course, if you want to book further appointments, you’ll have to pay at some point.</p>
<p>For employers, moka.care tries to lower the barrier to entry as well. Clients agree on a per-employee-per-month subscription plan based on some usage rate. If your employees end up using moka.care more than that, you don’t pay more. If your employees don’t use the service at all and you’re overpaying, the startup pays you back.</p>
<p>There are 30 companies currently using moka.care — it represents thousands of employees that could potentially create an account and access the service. The startup currently works with around 50 practitioners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Venmo mobile payments app is going to look very different in 2021 as it inches closer to neobank territory with expansions into budgeting, saving and cryptocurrency, said Venmo parent company PayPal, during its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday. The company also plans to put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">its $4 billion Honey acquisition</a> to work by integrating its suite of shopping tools into the Venmo app, including merchant offers, deals, price tracking and wish lists.</p>
<p>PayPal already signaled its intentions to bring cryptocurrencies to Venmo. The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/"> entered the crypto market last November </a>by adding support for buying, holding and selling cryptocurrencies in the U.S. through a partnership with the regulated crypto services provider, <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2956193-1&amp;h=1362442868&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paxos.com%2F&amp;a=Paxos%C2%A0Trust+Company" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paxos Trust Company.</a> At the time, PayPal noted it would bring a similar feature set to its Venmo app during 2021.</p>
<p>That time frame is still on track, PayPal confirmed during its earnings call with investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said, in the next few months, Venmo users will gain the ability to buy, hold and sell crypto inside the Venmo mobile app, along with other &#8220;investment alternatives.&#8221; (This statement refers to <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/central-bank-digital-currencies-a-matter-of-when-not-if-8211-paypal-ceo-61067468">PayPal&#8217;s work with central banks</a> who are developing their own digital currencies on the blockchain.)</p>
<p>Other changes to Venmo make the app sound as if it&#8217;s becoming more of a neobank competitor.</p>
<p>For example, PayPal said it will work with its financial industry partners this year to introduce features like budgeting and saving tools as well as bill pay options inside PayPal &#8212; additions that are common to modern-day mobile banking apps.</p>
<p>On Venmo, the forthcoming savings feature will look similar to PayPal&#8217;s existing <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/what-can-i-do-with-my-personal-paypal-account,-paypal-cash-account-or-paypal-cash-plus-account-faq3997">PayPal Cash Plus account</a>, where it partners with financial institutions to provide FDIC pass-through insurance. Today, funds held in the Cash Plus account are eligible for this insurance only if customers also have a PayPal Cash Card debit card, have enrolled in Direct Deposit or have established Goals in their Cash Plus account. Venmo now has the pieces in place to offer the same.</p>
<p>Another change includes the Honey integration, which PayPal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/paypal-details-its-digital-wallet-plans-for-2021-including-crypto-honey-integration-and-more/">has been promising for some time</a>. Now, the company is offering more details around what those integrations will look like. It said the plan is to integrate Honey&#8217;s features into both its PayPal and Venmo platforms in the first half of 2021 &#8212; including Honey&#8217;s wish list, price monitoring tools, deals, coupons and rewards.</p>
<p>This integration will allow merchants to target specific demographics of PayPal and Venmo customers with personalized offers and discounts, thanks to PayPal&#8217;s two-sided marketplace. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In other words, the company will attempt to capture the consumer in the earlier stages of the shopping process, when they&#8217;re browsing for deals, looking up prices or searching for specific products. Honey&#8217;s shopping tools could point them to a matching deal, and then the customer could complete the checkout process using the Venmo app. </span></p>
<p>These new tools will arrive at a time when the pandemic has forced more commerce to shift online, as retail stores and other in-person retail opportunities declined due to store closures and government lockdowns. Plus, some people today now just prefer to shop online because they no longer feel safe in physical retail stores where basic safety measures like mask-wearing and social distancing aren&#8217;t enforced.</p>
<p>This broader acceleration of e-commerce and &#8220;contactless&#8221; payments also helped PayPal to add 1.4 million new merchants in the quarter. It now has 29 million merchants across its platform, who interact with nearly 350 million consumers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Venmo&#8217;s total payment volume grew 60% year over year to $47 billion, and its customer base grew 32%, ending just shy of 70 million accounts. The company expects its revenues will approach $900 million in 2021.</p>

<p>Venmo has been rapidly expanding beyond being just a payments app. In recent months, it has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/venmo-launches-its-first-credit-card-offering-up-to-3-cash-back-personalized-rewards/"> launched its first credit card</a>, which will be 100% rolled out by month-end, as well as QR codes for in-store shopping, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/venmo-begins-piloting-business-profiles-for-small-sellers/">business profiles </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/venmo-adds-a-check-cashing-feature-waives-fees-for-stimulus-checks/">cash-checking features</a> that arrived just in time to handle customers&#8217; stimulus checks.</p>
<p>But Venmo doesn&#8217;t aim to be a full neobank &#8212; at least not yet. Instead, it imagines itself as more of a &#8220;digital wallet&#8221; of sorts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s digital reality is rapidly accelerating the need for a digital wallet that encompasses payments, financial services and shopping,&#8221; explained PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, speaking to investors. &#8220;This year, our digital wallet will change more than it has ever changed before, significantly increasing its functionality within a single, integrated and beautifully designed app that should meaningfully increase consumer engagement,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As Venmo&#8217;s new features roll out, PayPal expects the app&#8217;s usage and payment volume to grow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are going to see … a real bend in the historic rate of engagement. And it’s going to be all around that super app functionality in that digital wallet, moving well beyond just payments,&#8221; Schulman said.</p>
<p><em>Correction, 2/4/21, 1 p,m. EST &#8212;  Schulman&#8217;s note about bill pay was referencing a launch inside PayPal&#8217;s app in 2021. It was mentioned alongside other forthcoming Venmo features, which led to some confusion. We&#8217;ve now corrected this. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tryflux.com/">Flux</a>, the London fintech that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/flux-series-a/">built a technology platform for banks and merchants</a> to power itemised digital receipts and more, has seen its lengthy pilot with Barclays bear fruit.</p>
<p>Announced formally today &#8212; but actually quietly rolled out a few months ago &#8212; Flux-powered digital receipts are now available as an opt-in for all U.K. Barclays debit card holders within the bank&#8217;s main mobile banking app. Previously, the functionality was only available within the Barclays Launchpad app, which is available for customers that want to try out experimental or upcoming features.</p>
<p>Early last year, Barclays announced that it has invested in Flux, taking a minority stake, so the strengthening of its partnership isn&#8217;t too much of a surprise. Flux also went through the Techstars-powered Barclays accelerator in its very early days. However, not all corporate accelerators lead to great outcomes as corporates are notoriously risk-adverse. This one certainly wasn&#8217;t rushed but it&#8217;s meaningful regardless, giving Flux a major shot in the arm in reaching mainstream banking customers beyond the existing challenger bank partnerships it has forged.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;Customers who pay using their Barclays debit card for future in store purchases at H&amp;M, shoe retailer schuh and food outlets, which include Just Eat and Papa Johns, will see their receipts sent automatically to their app after making a purchase. They can then easily and securely view their receipts whenever they need by tapping on the transaction,&#8221; says Barclays. Crucially, although opt-in, Barclays customers will receive a prompt to set up digital receipts when they purchase items from retailers currently on-boarded to Flux.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by former early employees at Revolut, Flux bridges the gap between the itemised receipt data captured by a merchant’s point-of-sale (POS) system and what little information typically shows up on your bank statement or mobile banking app. Off the back of this, it can also power loyalty schemes and card-linked offers, as well as give merchants much deeper POS analytics via aggregated and anonymised data on consumer behaviour, such as which products are selling best in unique baskets.</p>
<p>On the banking side, along with Barclays, Flux has partnered with challenger banks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/starling-bank-marketplace/">Starling</a> and Monzo. Once banking customers link their account to the service, Flux delivers digital receipts (and where available rewards and loyalty) for transactions at Flux retailer partners.</p>
<p>Longer term, Flux wants to become a standard for the interchange of item level digital receipt data — and the proprietary platform that powers that standard — but has always faced a chicken-and-egg problem: It needs bank integrations to sign up merchants and it needs merchant integrations to sign up banks. Barclays going live properly is another significant turn in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/flux-partners-with-fast-food-merchant-itsu-for-itemised-paperless-receipts/">the upstart&#8217;s flywheel</a>.</p>
