										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, our scoop machine Mark Harris was at it again. This time, he found some interesting and entertaining documents related to Elon Musk&#8217;s underground Loop system in Las Vegas received via a Freedom of Information Act. Among the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/read-the-script-every-driver-for-elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-must-learn/">treasure is a &#8220;ride script&#8221;</a> that instructs drivers for the Loop system to bypass passengers&#8217; questions about how long they have been driving for the company, declare ignorance about crashes, and shut down conversations about Musk himself.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The takeaway: the script shows just how serious The Boring Company, which built and operates the system, is about controlling the public image of the new system, its technology and especially Musk.</p>
<p>Importantly, the documents confirm that Autopilot, the advanced driver assistance system in the Tesla vehicles used in the Loop system, must be disabled.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>This is a <em>step</em> outside the norm of what I usually think of when I think of micromobility (you&#8217;ll see what I did there in a second), but this week I wrote about a new<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/ashirase-a-honda-incubation-reveals-advanced-walking-assistance-system-for-visually-impaired/"> in-shoe navigation system</a> that helps the visually impaired walk around town.</p>
<p><strong>Ashirase</strong>, as both the system and the name of the company is called, involves attaching a three-dimensional vibration device, including a motion sensor, inside a pair of shoes. This bit of hardware is connected to a smartphone app that someone with low vision can use to enter their destination. Vibrations in the front part of the shoe give the cue to walk straight, and vibrations on the left and right cue the user to make a left or right turn. The aim is to free up the hands while walking to use a cane and allow the walker to put more of their full attention on audio signals in the environment, thus making their commutes a bit more intuitive and their lives more independent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a really interesting bit of tech because it uses a similar stack to what we&#8217;re seeing in autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. Which makes sense because that&#8217;s the founder&#8217;s background. Wataru Chino worked in <strong>Honda&#8217;s</strong> EV motor control and automated driving systems departments since 2009. His startup is a product of Honda&#8217;s incubator, Ignition, that features original technology, ideas, and designs of Honda associates with the goal of solving social issues and going beyond the existing Honda business.</p>
<h3>Accessibility: We love to see it</h3>
<p><strong>Cabify</strong> recently announced a new feature that makes its rideshare service more accessible to the elderly, people with partial visual impairment and people with cognitive disabilities. The feature provides voice notifications to alert the user when a driver is on their way or has just arrived, when the ride starts, when a stop has been reached, when a message has come into the app&#8217;s chat, etc.</p>
<p>The notification makes use of a text-to-speech functionality that Android and iOS phones have.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple and Google operating systems allow us to pronounce sentences with the system&#8217;s voice but we have developed the text and established the situations where we inform and draw the user&#8217;s attention,&#8221; a Cabify spokesperson told me.</p>
<h3>Lime&#8217;s push for world domination</h3>
<p>And we&#8217;re back with the latest on <strong>Lime&#8217;s</strong> plans to take over the world, one electric scooter at a time. The micromobility goliath has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/moovit-integrates-lime-electric-scooters-bikes-mopeds-into-transit-planning-app/">announced an integration</a> with the <strong>Moovit</strong> transit planning app. From Monday onwards, Moovit users in 117 cities across 20 countries will see Lime&#8217;s electric scooters, bikes and mopeds show up as an option for travel, either as the whole journey or as part of a multi-modal journey. This news follows a trend we&#8217;re seeing as cities start to see micromobility companies as less of a public nuisance and more of a public solution, particularly for first- and last-mile travel. Integrating with Moovit, an app that&#8217;s solely focused on public transportation, is a move that helps in the long run creating a broader transportation ecosystem.</p>
<h3>New whips</h3>
<p><strong>Espin</strong> released its limited edition fixie style e-bike <a href="https://www.espinbikes.com/products/aero">called the Aero</a>. It&#8217;s just the thing for Seattle hipsters, particularly ones with a stick-and-poke bike tattoo. The bike frame is just as sleek as you&#8217;d expect from a single gear bike, all clean lines and comes in either a forest green or a smoke gray. The Aero can reach top speeds of 20 mph and can hit 30 miles on a single charge. Best of all, it doesn&#8217;t break the bank at $1,399.</p>
<p><strong>Splach</strong>, which normally makes e-scooters and e-bikes, has come out with something it&#8217;s calling the <a href="https://splach.bike/pages/transformer">Transformer</a>. I truly don&#8217;t know how to categorize it but it looks like a lot of fun to ride. The company is calling the light-duty e-vehicle a &#8220;mini-moto Robust scooter specialized for rugged terrains.&#8221; It looks like a dirt bike has been sized way down and given a long neck so you can stand on it and still steer it. It also looks like it would indeed do well on rugged terrains, based on videos of people shredding down dirt paths. Splach used Indiegogo to fund the thing, and said it reached its goal within an hour.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Get ready to hear a lot more about supply chain constraints around batteries with virtually every automaker shouting out pledges to shift their entire portfolio away from internal combustion engines and towards electric powertrains.</p>
<p>Cell producers need access to the raw materials like nickel that are needed to make batteries. Mining those materials is the most common means, but that isn&#8217;t sustainable (and I&#8217;m not just talking about the environmental toll). <strong>JB Straubel</strong>, who is best known as the former Tesla co-founder and longtime CTO, is tackling the supply chain issue through his startup <strong>Redwood Materials</strong>. The battery recycling company is aiming to create a circular supply chain. This closed-loop system, Straubel says, will be essential if the world&#8217;s battery cell producers hope to have the supply needed for consumer electronics and the coming wave of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>High-profile investors like Amazon, funds managed by T. Rowe and Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Ventures fund recognize the opportunity and have injected<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/"> $700M in fresh capital</a> into Redwood Materials. This is comically large compared to the startup&#8217;s last raise of $40 million. And sources tell me that this pushes Redwood Material&#8217;s valuation to $3.7 billion.</p>
<p>I interviewed Straubel about the raise and what struck me was how aggressively he wants to scale; he is treating this issue as if there is no time to lose — and he&#8217;s not wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clarios</strong>, the maker of low-voltage vehicle batteries, postponed its IPO, citing market volatility, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-29/brookfield-backed-clarios-is-said-to-postpone-1-8-billion-ipo?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>. the Milwaukee area-based company backed by Brookfield Asset Management had filed to raise $1.7 billion by offering 88.1 million shares at a price range of $17 to $21.</p>
<p>Fisker, the electric vehicle startup turned publicly traded company via a SPAC, has turned investor to support EV charging company Allego. Fisker said it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/fisker-invests-in-ev-charging-network-allegos-spac-merger/">investing $10 million</a> in private-investment-in-public equity (PIPE) funding for the merger of Allego and special purpose acquisition company Spartan Acquisition Corp III. The merger puts Allego at a pro forma equity value of $3.14 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Flock, </strong>which went from providing drone insurance to commercial vehicle insurance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/connected-car-insurance-startup-flock-raises-17m-series-a-led-by-chamath-palihapitiya/">raised $17 million</a> in a Series A funding led by Social Capital, the investment vehicle run by Chamath Palihapitiya, best known as a SPAC investor and chairman of Virgin Galactic. Flock&#8217;s existing investors Anthemis and Dig Ventures also participated. This round brings Flock&#8217;s total funding to $22 million. Justin Saslaw (Social Capital&#8217;s fintech partner) joins Flock&#8217;s board of directors, as does Ross Mason (founder of Dig Ventures and MuleSoft).</p>
<p><strong>HappyFresh</strong>, the on-demand grocery app based in Indonesia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/indonesia-based-grocery-app-happyfresh-reaps-65m-led-by-naver-financial-and-gafina/">raised $65 million</a> in a Series D round led by Naver Financial Corporation and Gafina B.V., with participation from STIC, LB and Mirae Asset Indonesia and Singapore. It also included returning investors Mirae-Asset Naver Asia Growth Fund and Z Venture Capital. The company&#8217;s previous round of funding was a $20 million Series C announced in April 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Lordstown Motors</strong> got a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/troubled-ev-company-lordstown-motors-gets-400m-lifeline-in-stock-sale-agreement/">lifeline</a> from a hedge fund managed by investment firm Yorkville Advisors about five weeks after the automaker issued a warning that it might not have enough funds to bring its electric pickup truck to market. The hedge fund agreed to buy $400 million worth of shares over a three-year period, according to a regulatory filing.</p>
<p><strong>Merqueo</strong>, the on-demand delivery service that operates in Latin America, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/colombias-merqueo-bags-50m-to-expand-its-online-grocery-delivery-service-across-latin-america/">raised $50 million</a> in a Series C round of funding co-led by IDC Ventures, Digital Bridge and IDB Invest. MGM Innova Group, Celtic House Venture Partners, Palm Drive Capital and previous shareholders also participated. The financing brings the Bogota, Colombia-based startup&#8217;s total raised to $85 million since its 2017 inception.</p>
<p><strong>Niron Magnetics</strong>, a company developing permanent magnets free of rare earths, <a href="https://nironmagnetics.com/news/niron-magnetics-raises-21-3m-to-commercialize-rare-earth-free-magnets-for-a-more-sustainable-electric-economy/">raised $21.3 million in new financing</a> from the Volvo Cars Tech Fund and Volta Energy Technologies, which joined existing investors Anzu Partners and the University of Minnesota. Niron will use the funding to build its pilot production facility in Minnesota.</p>
<p><strong>Onto</strong>, the EV car subscription company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/onto-raises-175-million-in-series-b-to-expand-ev-subscription-service-in-the-uk/">raised $175 million</a> in a combined equity and debt Series B round. The equity piece was led by Swedish VC Alfvén &amp; Didrikson. British investment company Pollen Street Capital provided the senior-secured asset-backed debt facility. The company, which has raised a total of $245 million, says it plans to double its fleet size every three to six months and that any new vehicles will be used as collateral. Onto did not disclose how much of the round came from equity versus debt.</p>
<p><strong>Zūm</strong>, a student transportation startup, was awarded a five-year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/zum-wins-150m-from-san-francisco-schools-to-modernize-and-electrify-student-transport/">$150 million contract</a> to modernize San Francisco Unified School District transport service throughout the district. Zūm, which already operates its rideshare-meets-bus service in Oakland, much of Southern California, Seattle, Chicago and Dallas, will be responsible for handling day-to-day operations, transporting 3,500 students across 150 school campuses starting this fall semester.</p>

<p>I hear things. But I&#8217;m not selfish. Let me share!</p>
<p>You might have missed my article late Friday about <strong>Argo AI</strong> landing a permit in California that will allow the company to give people free rides in its self-driving vehicles on the state&#8217;s public roads.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: The <strong>California Public Utilities Commission</strong> issued Argo the so-called Drivered AV pilot permit, which is part of the state&#8217;s Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service pilot. This puts Argo in a small and growing group of companies seeking to expand beyond traditional AV testing &#8212; a signal that the industry, or at least some companies, are preparing for commercial operations.</p>
<p>Regulatory hurdles remain and don&#8217;t expect Argo to be offering and charging for &#8220;driverless&#8221; rides anytime soon. But progress is being made and I would expect the company to secure the next permit — in a long line of them — later this year.</p>
<p>Argo has never officially indicated what city it is targeting for a robotaxi service in California. The company has been testing its autonomous vehicle technology in Ford vehicles around Palo Alto since 2019. Today, the company&#8217;s test fleet in California is about one dozen self-driving test vehicles. It also has autonomous test vehicles in Miami, Austin, Washington D.C., Pittsburgh and Detroit. (In July, Argo and Ford announced plans to launch at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles on Lyft’s ride-hailing network in a number of cities over the next five years, starting with Miami and Austin.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hearing from some sources familiar with Argo&#8217;s strategy for California that we should look south of the Bay Area. <em>Way south</em>.</p>
<p>The city that jumps to mind is San Diego. Some AV companies are already playing around the Irvine area and Los Angeles seems too unwieldy. Plus, Ford already has a footprint in San Diego. The automaker partnered way back in 2017 with AT&amp;T, Nokia and Qualcomm Technologies to test Cellular vehicle-to-everything (CV2X) at the San Diego Regional Proving Ground with the support of the San Diego Association of Governments, Caltrans, the city of Chula Vista, and intelligent transportation solutions provider McCain. The upshot of these trials? To improve traffic efficiency, vehicle safety and &#8220;support a path towards autonomous vehicles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hi everyone. Let&#8217;s dive into two key pieces of proposed legislation this week: the infrastructure bill and the tailpipe emissions standards.</p>
<p>After months of negotiations, U.S. senators have finally settled on a $550 billion infrastructure package that includes investments in roads, bridges, broadband and more. The bill would provide $7.5 billion to electrify buses and ferries, including school buses, and $7.5 billion to build out a national network of public EV charging stations. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/fact-sheet-historic-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/">Subsequent statements</a> on the bill from the White House say directly that the EV investments are intended to keep the U.S. competitive on the world stage: &#8220;U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The President believes that must change.&#8221;</p>
<p>The budget is just a fraction of the $2.25 trillion bill <strong>President Joe Biden</strong> originally introduced in March. That version of the bill earmarked billions more for transportation electrification, especially in rebates and incentives to get consumers buying more EVs. The bill is still with the Senate for final approval. Then it will head to the House before finally ending up on Biden&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>The <strong>Environmental Protection Agency</strong> and the <strong>Department of Transportation</strong> have proposed rules that would beef up tailpipe emissions standards, which had been rolled back under President Donald Trump. The rules would be identical to the agreement the state of California reached with Ford, VW, Honda, BMW and Volvo in 2019, the AP reported. If approved, the rules would apply starting with model year 2023 vehicles.</p>
<p>The aim is to cut carbon emissions from transportation and encourage more people to buy hybrid and electric. But many environmental groups like the Sierra Club &#8212; plus some EV automakers &#8212; don&#8217;t think they go far enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;This draft proposal would drive us in the right direction after several years in reverse&#8211;but slowly getting back on track is not enough,&#8221; Chris Nevers, senior director of environmental policy at Rivian, told TechCrunch. EPA and NHTSA must maximize the stringency of the program beyond the voluntary deal and account for current and future developments in vehicle electrification.</p>
<p>One more thing that caught my eye this week&#8230;The Washington Post reported that Biden and a group of automakers are negotiating for the latter group to make a &#8220;formal pledge&#8221; to have at least 40% of all vehicles sold in 2030 to be electric. The article doesn&#8217;t specify which OEMs are part of the talks. However, it&#8217;s hard to imagine automakers signing onto anything &#8212; even a &#8220;voluntary pledge&#8221; &#8212; without some hefty federal spending to go along with it. We&#8217;ll have to see if the provisions in the infrastructure bill are enough.</p>

<p>As per ushe, there was a ton of transportation news this week. Let&#8217;s dig in.</p>
<h3>ADAS</h3>
<p>Yep, ADAS gets its own section now in an effort to make it abundantly clear that advanced driver assistance systems are not self-driving cars. Never. Never ever.</p>
<p><strong>New York Times&#8217;</strong> Greg Bensinger weighs in on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/opinion/self-driving-cars-tesla-elon-musk.html">beta testing and Tesla</a> in this opinion column.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> co-founder and chief product officer Sterling Anderson <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/our-blueprint-for-launching-our-ride-hailing-business">put out a blog</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/sterling_a/status/1421134137100947460">bunch of tweets</a> to layout a blueprint for an autonomous ride-hailing business that will launch in late 2024 with partners Toyota and Uber. Aurora has spent the past year or so pushing its messaging on self-driving trucks, which the company says is its best and most viable first commercial product. Aurora never entirely ditched the robotaxi idea, but it was pretty quiet on the topic. Until now.</p>
<p>The blog comes about a week after competitor Argo AI and Ford announced a partnership with Lyft. While the timing might not be related, it does show that competition is heating up in both areas — robotaxis and self-driving trucks — with every AV company keen to show progress and deep partnerships.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>TuSimple</strong>, the self-driving truck company that went public earlier this year, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/tusimples-self-driving-truck-network-takes-shape-with-ryder-partnership/">partnered with <strong>Ryder</strong></a> as part of its plan to build out a freight network that will support its autonomous trucking operations. Ryder’s fleet maintenance facilities will act as terminals for TuSimple’s so-called AFN, or autonomous freight network.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Ford</strong> released Wednesday its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/ford-expects-semiconductor-rebound-new-vehicle-demand-to-increase-2021-profits/">second quarter earnings</a> for 2021, which besides containing a surprise profit despite the ongoing chip shortage, revealed that its F-150 Lightning electric pickup has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-reservations-surpass-120000/">generated 120,000 preorders</a> since its unveiling in May. Ford reported revenue of $26.8 billion, slightly below expectations, and net income of $561 million in the second quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Lucid Group</strong> (formerly Lucid Motors) will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/lucid-motors-kicks-off-market-debut-with-ev-factory-expansion-plans/">expanding its factory</a> in Casa Grande, Arizona, by 2.7 million square feet, CEO Pete Rawlinson said just hours after the company officially went public with a $4.5 billion injection of capital. The company also said it has 11,000 paid reservations for its flagship luxury electric sedan, the Lucid Air.</p>
<p><strong>Polestar</strong> said it plans to launch in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/polestar-to-double-its-retail-stores-as-it-seeks-to-ramp-up-ev-sales/">nine more markets</a> this year, doubling its global presence as it seeks to sell more of its electric sedans. The company, which is the electric performance vehicle brand under Volvo Car Group, also wants to double the number of retail stores to 100 locations and add more service centers by the end of the year. The Swedish automaker has more than 650 so-called &#8220;service points&#8221; in Polestar markets and wants to exceed 780 by the end of 2021.</p>
<p><strong>REE Automotive</strong> has picked Austin for its U.S. headquarters. The company said the headquarters will help it address the growing U.S. market demand for mission-specific EVs from delivery and logistics companies, Mobility-as-a-Service and new technology players.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> reported its second-quarter earnings and it was packed with news, including that the company generated<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-quarterly-profit-surpasses-1-billion/"> $1.14 billion in net income</a>, marking the first time the company’s quarterly profit (on a GAAP basis) has passed the three-comma threshold. And they hit that profitability metric without completely relying on the sale of zero-emissions credits to other automakers.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk weighed in on the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/what-teslas-bet-on-iron-based-batteries-means-for-manufacturers/">battery strategy</a> and disclosed that the company is pushing the launch of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/tesla-delays-semi-truck-to-2022-cybertruck-back-burnered-for-model-y/">electric Semi truck program</a> to 2022 due to supply chain challenges and the limited availability of battery cells. And everything is pointing to the Cybertruck also being delayed until next year.</p>
<p>And finally, Tesla&#8217;s latest quarterly earnings report showed growth in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-solar-and-energy-storage-business-rakes-in-810m-finally-exceeds-cost-of-revenue/">energy storage and solar business</a>. The company reported $801 million in revenue from its energy generation and storage business &#8212; which includes three main products: solar, its Powerwall storage device for homes and businesses, and its utility storage unit Megapack. More importantly, the cost of revenue for its solar and energy storage business was $781 million, meaning that for the first time the total cost of producing and distributing these energy storage products was lower than the revenue it generated. That&#8217;s good news.</p>
<h3>eVTOLs and other flying things</h3>
<p><strong>Joby Aviation</strong> completed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/joby-aviation-aiming-to-go-to-market-in-2024-completes-154-mile-test-flight/">longest test flight</a> of an eVTOL to date: Its unnamed full-sized prototype aircraft concluded a trip of over 150 miles on a single charge. The test was completed at Joby&#8217;s Electric Flight Base in Big Sur, California, earlier this month. It&#8217;s the latest in a succession of secretive tests the company&#8217;s been conducting, all part of its goal to achieve certification with the Federal Aviation Administration and start commercial operations.</p>
<p><strong>Lilium</strong>, the electric air taxi startup, has tapped German manufacturer Customcells to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/the-lilium-electric-jet-will-use-batteries-manufactured-by-germanys-customcells/">supply batteries</a> for its flagship seven-seater Lilium Jet.</p>
<h3>People stuff</h3>
<p><strong>AEye</strong>, a lidar company, has been adding to its executive team in the past few months. The most recent is the hiring of automotive veteran and former Valeo executive Bernd Reichert as senior vice president of ADAS. the company has also hired Velodyne&#8217;s former COO Rick Tewell, Bob Brown from Cepton and Hod Finkelstein as chief research and design officer from Sense Photonics.</p>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong> is also on a bit of an executive and engineering hiring spree. The company sent me a list of recent folks who have joined including former Southwest Airlines employee Anthony Gregory as VP of market development, Phil Maher, the former Virgin Atlantic COO, as VP of central operations and Bhavini Soneji as VP of product engineering. Soneji was most recently VP of engineering at Headspace, and was at Microsoft and Snapchat before that.</p>
<p>Cruise also hired Vinoj Kumar, who oversaw Google&#8217;s cloud infrastructure and software systems, as VP of Infrastructure and Yuning Chai, former lead perception researcher at Waymo, as head of AI Research. In all, Cruise now employs more than 1,900 people.</p>
<p><strong>Don Burnette</strong>, the co-founder and CEO of self-driving trucks company <strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong>, sat down with TechCrunch as part of our ongoing Q&amp;A series with the founders of transportation startups. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/kodiak-robotics-founder-says-tight-focus-on-autonomous-trucks-is-working/">interview covers a lot of ground</a>, including Burnette&#8217;s views on the company&#8217;s strategy, current funding conditions in the industry and what he learned at Otto. the self-driving trucks startup he co-founded and that was acquired by Uber.</p>

<p>Milton “engaged in a fraudulent scheme to deceive retail investors” for his own personal benefit, according to the federal indictment unsealed by U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan. Milton was charged with two counts of securities fraud and wire fraud by a federal grand jury.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Abu Dhabi-based micromobility company Fenix has acquired Palm, a shared e-scooter company in Turkey, for $5 million – the exact amount the company raised last November and this past February during its seed round.</p>
<p>Despite having not even raised a Series A round yet, Fenix scrounged together the cash and equity needed to fund this buy and stretch into Turkey, calling on additional capital from existing investors Maniv Mobility and Emkan Capital. Fenix would not disclose the terms of the acquisition or how much it recently raised.</p>
<p>This acquisition marks Fenix&#8217;s expansion into its fifth Middle Eastern country and 13th city since its launch last November, making it the largest shared micromobility operator in the region, ahead of regional competitors KIWIride, Careem and Arnab Mobility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Palm has a meaningful presence in Istanbul, and the city will be a major focus for our company in the near term,&#8221; Jaideep Dhanoa, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Beyond Istanbul, we see tremendous opportunity across Turkey. The country is home to 83 million people and there are 24 cities with a million or more people. Mersin, for example, is another coastal city Palm operates in today where we will continue to invest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berhan Goskin and <span style="font-weight: 400;">Alican İstanbullu, Palm&#8217;s founders, will continue to lead the company and Fenix&#8217;s expansion plans across Turkey. Existing Palm shareholders will also migrate over and support Fenix&#8217;s efforts to lead the market in Turkey, according to a statement from the company.</span></p>
<p>The Palm acquisition not only hands off Palm&#8217;s fleet of around 1,500 Ninebot e-scooters to Fenix, bringing the startup&#8217;s total vehicle size up to 10,000, but it also gives Fenix a built-in permit with Istanbul, a city of 15.5 million people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recently the Turkey Ministry of Transport legalized shared e-scooters nationally in a very progressive and pro-competition manner,&#8221; said Dhanoa. &#8220;This regulatory clarity increased the attractiveness of the market for investment and was a significant motivator for the transaction. There are several local market requirements to qualify for a five-year license which is partially why we went in inorganically. With Palm we now have a five-year license for e-scooter sharing in Turkey and expect to receive permits in some of the highest potential  districts in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Istanbul&#8217;s first round of applications for capped e-scooter permits were due earlier this month, so the acquisition means Fenix didn&#8217;t need to apply for a new license. It will, however, have to comply with all local Turkey market requirements.</p>
<p>Fenix says it will begin deploying several thousands of its vehicles, laden with built-in hand sanitizers, in August, adding to Palm&#8217;s existing fleet, which will be rebranded to reflect new ownership. Fenix did not disclose who its manufacturing partner is for its vehicles, but told TechCrunch that it&#8217;s &#8220;not one of the usual suspects&#8221; and that the partnership is exclusive and involves a co-development of custom vehicles for their markets.</p>
<p>As part of its entry into Istanbul, Fenix also has plans to establish an R&amp;D center on the ground for software and hardware in order to &#8220;develop breakthrough technologies for the Turkish market and to export to the Greater Middle East region,&#8221; according to a statement.</p>
<div>&#8220;Turkey has some of the top tech talent in the broader region, and now that we&#8217;ll also be operating there, we&#8217;re excited about leveraging that talent pool to help us craft solutions for the Turkey market, as well as apply them to the rest of our network,&#8221; IQ Sayed, co-founder and CTO, told TechCrunch. &#8220;This holds for all our offerings and all parts of our tech stack, but I&#8217;m especially looking forward to augmenting our payments tech, machine learning and IoT capabilities there.  We will also be looking into local manufacturing opportunities.&#8221;</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nozomi Networks, an industry cybersecurity startup that aims to shield critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, has raised $100 million in pre-IPO funding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Series D funding round was led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/triangle-peak-partners">Triangle Peak Partners</a>, and also includes investment from a number of equipment, security, service provider and go-to-market companies including Honeywell Ventures, Keysight Technologies and Porsche Digital.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This funding comes at a critical time for the company. Cyberattacks on industrial control systems (ICS) — the devices necessary for the continued running of power plants, water supplies, and other critical infrastructure — increased both in frequency and severity during the pandemic. Look no further than May and June, which saw ransomware attacks target the IT networks of Colonial Pipeline and meat manufacturing giant JBS, forcing the companies to shut down their industrial operations.</p>
<p>Nozomi Networks, which competes with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/dragos-series-c-industrial-systems-security/">Dragos</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/industrial-cybersecurity-startup-claroty-raises-140m-in-pre-ipo-funding-round/">Claroty</a>, claims its industrial cybersecurity solution, which works to secure ICS devices by detecting threats before they hit, aims to prevent such attacks from happening. It provides real-time visibility to help organizations manage cyber risk and improve resilience for industrial operations.</p>
<p>The technology currently supports more than a quarter of a million devices in sectors such as critical infrastructure, energy, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and utilities, with Nozomi Networks doubling its customer base in 2020 and seeing a 5,000% increase in the number of devices its solutions monitor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The company will use its latest investment, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/27/cybersecurity-firm-nozomi-networks-raises-30m-in-latest-round-of-funding/">which comes less than two years after it secured $30 million in Series C funding</a>, to scale product development efforts as well as its go-to-market approach globally.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Specifically, Nozomi Networks said it plans to grow its sales, marketing, and partner enablement efforts, and upgrade its products to address new challenges in both the OT and IoT visibility and security markets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Kuda Bank, the London-based, Nigerian-operating startup that is taking on incumbents in the country with a mobile-first, personalised and often cheaper set of banking services built on newer, API-based infrastructure, has been on a growth tear in the last several months, and to fuel its expansion, it has now raised another round of funding. TechCrunch [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.kudabank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kuda Bank</a>, the London-based, Nigerian-operating startup that is taking on incumbents in the country with a mobile-first, personalised and often cheaper set of banking services built on newer, API-based infrastructure, has been on a growth tear in the last several months, and to fuel its expansion, it has now raised another round of funding.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has learned, and confirmed with Kuda, that the startup has closed, via its London entity, a Series B of $55 million &#8212; money that it plans to use to double down not just on new services for Nigeria, but to prepare its launch into more countries on the continent, and in the words of co-founder and CEO Babs Ogundeyi, to build a new take on banking services for &#8220;ever African on the planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding was made at a valuation of $500 million, and it comes on the back of some impressive early growth for the startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We’ve been doing a lot of resource deployment has been in our operational entity, in Nigeria. But now we are doubling down on expansion and the idea is to build a strong team for the expansion plans for Kuda,&#8221; Ogundeyi told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;We still see Nigeria as an important market and don’t want to be distracted so don’t want to disrupt those operations too much. It’s a strong market and competitive. It’s one that we feel we need to have a strong hold on. So this funding is to invest in expansion and have more experience in the company with relation to expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kuda now has 1.4 million registered users, which is more than double the number it had in March when it had 650,000 registered users &#8212; a figure it revealed when announcing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/kuda-raises-25m-more-led-by-valar-to-become-the-neobank-for-every-african-on-the-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A of $25 million</a> led by Valar Ventures.</p>
<p>We understand that this latest Series B was a relatively quick inside round &#8212; that is, it&#8217;s coming from existing investors. Co-led by Valar Ventures and Target Global, it also includes SBI and a number of previous angels also participating. Kuda was not proactively raising money at the time the Series B was initiated and closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We felt that Babs and Musty&#8221; &#8212; Musty Mustapha, the co-founder and CTO &#8212; &#8220;are ambitious on another level. For them, it was always about building a pan-African bank, not just a Nigerian leader,&#8221; said Ricardo Schäfer, the partner at Target who led the round for the firm. &#8220;The prospect of banking over 1 billion people from day one really stood out for me at the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>You might notice that it&#8217;s only been four months since Kuda last announced a round of funding. Equity rounds raised in quick succession, sometimes just months apart, seems to be the order of the day at the moment, fueled in part by a lot of money being pumped into venture at the moment, but also by the state of the market. When the company in question is showing all the right growth metrics and is working in a particularly buzzy area, many will strike when the iron is hot. (GoPuff, which last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/gopuff-confirms-new-1b-cash-injection-at-a-15b-valuation-to-expand-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed a $1 billion raise</a> just months after a previous round, is another example of that happening from a different corner of the world.)</p>
<p>Neobanks &#8212; fintechs building a new generation disruptive of banking services based around more modern interfaces and infrastructure based around the concept of API-driven embedded finance &#8212; have been one of these areas, growing at a rate of nearly 50% annually in terms of revenues and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/neobanking-market-size-worth-722-60-billion-by-2028-cagr-47-7-grand-view-research-inc--808489566.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projected</a> to be collectively a $723 billion market by 2028.</p>
<p>Within that, we&#8217;re seeing a number of strong players emerging across the globe built on this model &#8212; Nubank out of Brazil, Revolut and N26 in Europe, WeBank in China, Varo and Chime in the U.S. among them. In this regard, Africa may be the last great untapped region when it comes to banking, one reason why Kuda is being eyed up and is seeing strong adoption.</p>
<p>The writing has been on the wall for years. A report from <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/african%20retail%20bankings%20next%20growth%20frontier/roaring-to-life-growth-and-innovation-in-african-retail-banking-web-final.ashx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey</a> on banking in Africa in 2018 identified a surge of interest in financial services that were delivered digitally, and that growth would be driven by a rapidly evolving middle class of consumers, while at the same time an ongoing death of accessible financial services for the majority of the population with some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/payments-lending-and-neobanks-rule-fintechs-in-emerging-markets-report-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300 million people still unbanked on the continent</a>. It&#8217;s these three basic factors on which Kuda has built its own service.</p>
<p>Kuda is not the only one building and raising and growing. Others raising money for new fintech plays include payments company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/africa-has-another-unicorn-as-chipper-cash-raises-100m-series-c-led-by-svb-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chipper Cash</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/airtel-africa-gets-an-extra-200m-for-its-mobile-money-business-from-qia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airtel Africa</a>, online lender <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FairMoney</a> and more.</p>
<p>However, Kuda is unique among the neobanks in that it is building its services with its own banking license in hand.</p>
<p>This means that it can be more flexible and fast-moving when it comes to creating new products or tweaking existing ones, and it gives the company another level of credibility in a region where those who were already banking with incumbents might be more wary of new players.</p>
<p>Indeed, Kuda&#8217;s initial business model was built around providing banking services to people who still also held accounts with incumbent banks: people would have their salaries paid into their old accounts, and then transferred out to be spent and used in other ways via their Kuda accounts. Ogundeyi said that this is gradually shifting and more people are now bringing both paying-in and paying-out to their Kuda accounts.</p>
<p>Ogundeyi would not say which countries would be Kuda&#8217;s next targets. But he did note that its most recently-launched product, Kuda&#8217;s first move into credit by way of an overdraft allowance, is a sign of the things to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a unique product, an overdraft that we pre-qualify the most active users for,&#8221; he said. In Q2 it qualified over 200,000 users and pushed out $20 million worth of credit. With a 30-day repayment, he said, so far default has been &#8220;minimal&#8221; because of the company&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;We use all the data we have for a customer and allocate the overdraft proportion based on the customer&#8217;s activities, aiming for it not to be a burden to repay,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Andrew McCormack, a general partner at Valar Ventures who co-founded the firm with Peter Thiel and James Fitzgerald, said that the still-nascent potential of the market, and how Kuda is approaching that, were behind its decision invest in the startup another time.</p>
<p>“Kuda is our first investment in Africa and our initial confidence in the team has been upheld by its rapid growth in the past four months,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With a youthful population eager to adopt digital financial services in the region, we believe that Kuda’s transformative effect on banking will scale across Africa and we’re proud to continue supporting them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/softbank-backed-indian-insurance-platform-policybazaar-raises-75-million/">online insurance aggregator</a> PolicyBazaar has filed for an initial public offering in which it is seeking to raise $809 million, becoming the fourth startup in the past two months from the South Asian market to explore public markets.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.icicisecurities.com/Upload/ArticleAttachments/PB%20Fintech%20Limited%20-%20DRHP.pdf">papers</a> submitted to the market regulator in India, PolicyBazaar said it is looking to raise $504 million by issuing new shares while the rest will be driven by sale of shares by existing investors.</p>
<p>The 12-year-old startup &#8212; backed by SoftBank, Falcon Edge Capital, Tiger Global, and InfoEdge &#8212; said it may consider raising about $100 million in a pre-IPO round. Softbank plans to sell shares worth over $250 million, while PolicyBazaar founders are looking to sell shares worth $52.7 million, they said in the papers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PolicyBazaar serves as an aggregator that allows users to compare and buy policies &#8212; across categories including life, health, travel, auto and property &#8212; from dozens of insurers on its website without having to go through conventional agents. It operates in India as well as the Middle East.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126229" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126229" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2126229 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126229" class="wp-caption-text">PolicyBazaar website</p></div></p>
<p>In India only a fraction of the nation’s 1.3 billion people currently have access to insurance and some analysts say that digital firms could prove crucial in bringing these services to the masses. According to rating agency ICRA, insurance products had reached less than 3% of the population as of 2017.</p>
<p>An average Indian makes about $2,100 in a year, according to World Bank. ICRA estimated that of those Indians who had purchased an insurance product, they were spending less than $50 on it in 2017.</p>
<p>&#8220;India’s life insurance market is expected to grow at 18.8% p.a. to reach ₹ 31.9 trillion (US$ 425 billion) in FY2030, driven by favorable macro indicators, rising awareness towards financial products and services, digitization and simplification of products and processes, online channels for distributions, innovations and customizations in products and favorable government policies and regulatory push,&#8221; the startup said in the papers.</p>
<p>In a report early this year, analysts at Bernstein estimated that PolicyBazaar commands 90% of share in the online insurance distribution market. The platform, which competes with Acko as well as Amazon in India, also sells loans, credit cards and mutual funds. The startup says it sells over a million policies a month.</p>
<p>“India has an under-penetrated insurance market. Within the under-penetrated landscape, digital distribution through web-aggregators like Policybazaar forms &lt;1% of the industry. This offers a large headroom for growth,” Bernstein analysts wrote to clients.</p>
<p>Zomato, which had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">stellar public debut last month</a>, as well as fintech firms Paytm and MobiKwik have filed for their initial public offerings in recent weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian online learning platform Unacademy has raised $440 million in a new financing round as investors double down on the South Asian market and elsewhere following a widening series of regulatory crackdowns in China that wiped hundreds of billions of dollars last month.</p>
<p>Temasek led the Bangalore-based startup’s new financing round &#8212; Series H &#8212; while Mirae Asset and existing investors including SoftBank Vision Fund 2, General Atlantic, Tiger Global as well as Deepinder Goyal of Zomato and Oyo&#8217;s Ritesh Agarwal participated in it, said the startup.</p>
<p>The new round values the six-year-old startup at $3.44 billion, up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/tiger-global-invests-in-india-unacademy-at-2-billion-valuation/">$2 billion in November last year</a>. The investment brings Unacademy’s to-date raise to about $860 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The online learning platform, which began its journey on YouTube and still uses Google&#8217;s video platform to on-board educators, helps students prepare for competitive exams to get into college, as well as those who are pursuing graduate-level courses.</p>
<p>On its app, students watch live classes from educators and later engage in sessions to review topics in more detail. The startup has over 50,000 educators on its platform, many of whom are very popular on YouTube. These educators help Unacademy sell more subscriptions and in return get a commission, according to industry executives familiar with the business arrangement.</p>
<p>Unacademy has amassed over 6 million monthly active users (over 600,000 of whom pay for the service) in over 10,000 cities in India.</p>
<p>Gaurav Munjal, Unacademy co-founder and chief executive, said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to broaden its bets on new categories such as upskilling, jobs and hiring.</p>
<p>Relevel is &#8220;giving people a path to get their dream job irrespective of their educational background, while Graphy is &#8220;empowering creators to build their online businesses to sell digital goods including NFTs,&#8221; he said in a tweet.</p>
<p>In a recent conversation with TechCrunch, Munjal said he wants Unacademy to become a consumer internet tech giant &#8212; perhaps the &#8220;Tencent of India.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2078582" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2078582" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2078582 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gs-online-education-spends.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="516" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gs-online-education-spends.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gs-online-education-spends.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gs-online-education-spends.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gs-online-education-spends.jpg?resize=768,387 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gs-online-education-spends.jpg?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gs-online-education-spends.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2078582" class="wp-caption-text">Spendings on education in India is among the highest globally (Source: A report from analysts at Goldman Sachs to clients last year.)</p></div></p>
<p>The startup competes with scores of firms including Byju&#8217;s, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">India&#8217;s most valuable startup</a> (at $16.5 billion valuation), TAL-backed Vedantu, Tiger Global-backed Classplus, and Lightspeed Venture-backed Teachmint. (TAL&#8217;s American depositary receipts have dropped to some 70% in recent days from $90 early this year as investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/chinas-regulatory-crackdown-is-good-news-for-startups-aligned-with-ccp-goals/">retreat following China&#8217;s crackdowns</a>.)</p>
<p>All these startups have reported growth in the past year as India &#8212; like most other countries &#8212; enforced lockdowns and closed schools to contain the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184424" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184424" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2184424 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="281" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg?resize=150,41 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg?resize=300,82 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg?resize=768,211 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg?resize=680,187 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg?resize=50,14 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184424" class="wp-caption-text">Monthly active users of education learning firms&#8217; Android apps in India, according to mobile insight platform App Annie (sourced by TechCrunch from industry execs.)</p></div></p>
<p>At stake is India&#8217;s online education market, which is estimated to generate $5 billion in revenue by 2025 (up from about $1 billion last year), according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>As of last year, there were about 6 million students in India who were paying for an online learning app, a figure Bernstein analysts expect to reach about 70 million by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Unacademy said last week it was creating a $40 million fund for educators on its platform. &#8220;On Day One (which is today) we already have more than 300 Educators eligible for the Grant which they will get immediately. Over the next few years we will give Grants of over $40M to our Educators,&#8221; said Munjal in a tweet.</p>
<p>The new investment comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record capital and a handful of mature firms are beginning to explore the public markets. Business-to-business commerce and financing startup Ofbusiness said over the weekend it had raised $160 million in a new financing round (led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2) at a valuation of $1.5 billion, becoming the 18th Indian startup to attain the unicorn status, up from 11 last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a blockbuster deal that rocks the fintech world, Square announced today that it is acquiring Australian buy now, pay later giant Afterpay in a $29 billion all-stock deal.</p>
<p>The purchase price is based on the closing price of Square common stock on July 30, which was <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ/history?fr=sycsrp_catchall">$247.26</a>. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, contingent upon certain closing conditions. It values Afterpay at more than 30% premium to its latest closing price of A$96.66.</p>
<p>Square co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey said in a statement that the two fintech behemoths “have a shared purpose.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We built our business to make the financial system more fair, accessible, and inclusive, and Afterpay has built a trusted brand aligned with those principles,” he said in the statement. “Together, we can better connect our Cash App and Seller ecosystems to deliver even more compelling products and services for merchants and consumers, putting the power back in their hands.”</p>
<p>The combination of the two companies would create a payments giant unlike any other. Over the past 18 months, the buy now, pay later space has essentially exploded, appealing especially to younger generations drawn to the idea of not using credit cards or paying interest and instead opting for the installment loans, which have become ubiquitous online and in retail stores.</p>
<p>As of June 30, Afterpay served more than 16 million consumers and nearly 100,000 merchants globally, including major retailers across industries such as fashion, homewares, beauty and sporting goods, among others.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dDVPBRlkvL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/">As BNPL startups raise, a look at Klarna, Affirm and Afterpay earnings</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As BNPL startups raise, a look at Klarna, Affirm and Afterpay earnings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/embed/#?secret=dDVPBRlkvL" data-secret="dDVPBRlkvL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The addition of Afterpay, the companies’ statement said, will “accelerate Square’s strategic priorities” for its Seller and Cash App ecosystems. Square plans to integrate Afterpay into its existing Seller and Cash App business units, so that even “the smallest of merchants” can offer buy now, pay later at checkout. The integration will also give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App. Cash App customers will be able to find merchants and buy now, pay later (BNPL) offers directly within the app.</p>
<p>Afterpay&#8217;s co-founders and co-CEOs Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar will join Square upon closure of the deal and help lead Afterpay’s respective merchant and consumer businesses. Square said it will appoint one Afterpay director to its board.</p>
<p>Shareholders of Afterpay will get 0.375 shares of Square Class A stock for every share they own. This implies a price of about A$126.21 per share based on Square&#8217;s Friday close, according to the companies.</p>
<p>Will there be more consolidation in the space? That remains to be seen, and Twitter is all certainly abuzz about what deals could be next. Here in the U.S., rival Affirm (founded by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/affirm-doubles-after-starting-to-trade-despite-strong-ipo-pricing/">went public earlier this year</a>. On July 30, shares closed at $56.32, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AFRM/?fr=sycsrp_catchall">significantly lower</a> than its opening price and 52-week-high of $146.90. Meanwhile, European competitor Klarna — which is growing rapidly in the U.S. — in June <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/fintech-giant-klarna-raises-639m-at-a-45-6b-valuation/">raised another $639 million</a> at a staggering post-money valuation of $45.6 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The digitization of your haircut may not have been on your 2020 bucket list, but 2021 has an even more surprising line item: Tech-powered barbershops are now a business proposition valued at nearly a billion dollars.</p>
<p>Squire is a back-end barbershop management tool for independent businesses. I first covered it in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/squire-haircuts-coronavirus-crv-34-million-series-b/">The startup raised millions of dollars</a> days before its key clientele — barber shops — were shut down across the country. The company eventually went from defense to offense in its growth strategy, finding itself as a key partner for any barbershop that needed to start offering contactless payments, digital appointment booking and a more seamless customer experience built for a generation used to doing everything online.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/squire-a-barbershop-tech-platform-triples-its-valuation-again-with-tiger-global/">Squire tripled its valuation thanks to a Tiger-Global-led round.</a> The company is now worth $750 million, after being valued at around $75 million when we first spoke to them.</p>
<p>When I spoke to co-founder Dave Salvant, who launched the company with Songe LaRon in 2016, he explained how the company is now in a spot to expand into other barbershop-specific value propositions — either through acquisitions or partnerships. This week, for example, Squire announced that it launched a payment processing arm with Bond, a venture-backed fintech infrastructure company. The company also partnered with Gusto to bring on HR services for its clientele. Salvant noted how the progress of tech, especially financial services, lets them offer up a strong product without needing to build everything in-house.</p>
<p>While these are partnerships for now, I wouldn’t be surprised if we see Squire begin to scoop up companies that can unlock value from its existing datasets of how barbershops function and what kind of capital comes in and out of those doors.</p>
<p><strong>Behind the numbers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/growth-is-not-enough/">Growth is not enough</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/squire-haircuts-coronavirus-crv-34-million-series-b/">Squire balances clean fades with the coronavirus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/heres-why-so-many-fintech-startups-are-loaning-to-small-businesses/">Here’s why so many fintech startups are loaning to small businesses</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a company to watch that fits into the narrative of pandemic rocked, then proven startups looking to expand with fresh capitalization. Less common, though, is that Squire is now en route to becoming a historical and unfortunately still rare Black-led unicorn. More data points, the better.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll discuss Robinhood’s public debut and why a CEO thinks everyone needs to be them for a day. You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_.</a></p>
<h2>Robinhood sells Robinhood</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2105946" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2105946" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2105946" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg" alt="illustration of robinhood feather logo spraypainted on a brick wall" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2105946" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The long-awaited Robinhood IPO is no longer long-awaited. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping/">pricing at the lower end of its range</a>, the consumer investing and trading app’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/robinhoods-stock-drops-8-in-its-first-days-trading/">shares went down sharply</a>, teetering between 8% to 10%.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>IPO expert and fellow Equity co-host Alex Wilhelm gave us two reasons as to why Robinhood’s stock went down. After all, we’re used to pops in the consumer-facing tech company world.</p>
<blockquote><p>Robinhood made a big chunk of its IPO available to its own users. Or, in practice, Robinhood curtailed early retail demand by offering its investors and traders shares at the same price and level of access that big investors were given. It’s a neat idea. But by doing so, Robinhood may have lowered unserved retail interest in its shares, perhaps reshaping its early supply/demand curve.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or maybe the company’s warnings that its trading volumes could decline in Q2 2021 scared off some bulls.</p>
<h2>You get to be a CEO, you get to be a CEO!</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2050300" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2050300" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2050300" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-sb10063936j-001.jpg" alt="Burst balloons and party streamers on wooden floor" width="1000" height="665" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-sb10063936j-001.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-sb10063936j-001.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-sb10063936j-001.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-sb10063936j-001.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-sb10063936j-001.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-sb10063936j-001.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2050300" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=Richard+Drury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Drury <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Now that free beer is no longer a company perk, the next best one may have emerged: Let <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/why-i-make-everyone-in-my-company-be-the-ceo-for-a-day/">anyone in your company become CEO for a day</a>. Vincit CEO Ville Houttu implemented this program at his company in 2018 and said that the initiative has paid off “tenfold.”</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how it works, per the company: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The program gives our employee the reins for 24 hours with an unlimited budget. The only requirement? The CEO must make one lasting decision that will help improve the working experience of Vincit employees. Whatever the CEO of the Day decides, the company sticks with. They can purchase something for the company, change a policy, update a tool we use … Really, anything that they come up with can be done.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can see the resulting policies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/why-i-make-everyone-in-my-company-be-the-ceo-for-a-day/">in our story,</a> but in my humble opinion, the end result is definitely better than free beer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Our work this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">kicked off in China</a>, dug <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">into African startup activity</a>, dealt <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/chinas-regulatory-crackdown-is-good-news-for-startups-aligned-with-ccp-goals/">with China once again</a>, took a very deep dive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/">into the Latin American startup ecosystem</a> and wrapped with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/robinhoods-cfo-says-it-was-ready-to-go-public/">second look at the Robinhood IPO</a>. In other words, not much was really going on at all!</p>
<p>You may have been surprised to see Amazon’s stock fall off a cliff Friday. After all, the company <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-misses-q2-revenue-profit-201456091.html">posted huge revenue gains</a> to just over $113 billion during the quarter. And AWS, its public cloud business, seemed to tick along nicely.</p>
<p>But investors had expected more growth and had priced the Seattle-based e-commerce player accordingly. When Amazon missed revenue expectations and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210729006106/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results">projected Q3 2021 growth</a> of “between 10% and 16% compared with third quarter 2020,” investors let go of its stock.</p>
<p>But as some in the financial press are noting, it’s not just Amazon that’s taking stick from investors. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/30/amazon-plunge-drags-down-ebay-etsy-and-wayfair-.html">Etsy and eBay also fell this week</a>. It appears that investors are anticipating that a period of turbocharged growth in e-commerce thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic is slowing at least, and may in fact be over. That means valuations are going to get reset at a host of companies, startups included.</p>
<p>Not that every company slowing down after the pandemic’s early phases is suffering, Duolingo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/duolingos-ipo-pricing-is-great-news-for-edtech-startups/">managed a strong opening week as a public company</a> despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/duolingo-s-1/">slowing growth</a>. But delta variant or not, the investing classes are changing their market framing. We’d be smart to keep that in mind.</p>
<h2>It’s the products, stupid</h2>
<p>Something that is stuck in my teeth this week is how much Robinhood has changed the game regarding consumer investing. Sure, this week was mostly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping/">about the company’s IPO</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/robinhoods-stock-drops-8-in-its-first-days-trading/">somewhat relaxed early trading performance</a>. But, buried in its final S-1/A filings is new evidence of Robinhood’s cultural impact.</p>
<p>At the top of the U.S. consumer investing unicorn’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021014488/robinhoods-1a2.htm">filings</a> is a pair of statistics. They look like this:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184332" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184332" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2184332" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_7_31.png" alt="" width="512" height="249" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_7_31.png 512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_7_31.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_7_31.png?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_7_31.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184332" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Robinhood</p></div></p>
<p>Dang, you are thinking, that’s a lot of funded accounts and monthly active users. But then again, those are March 31, 2021, numbers. They are out of date. In the same filing, Robinhood indicated that its June 30 quarter saw its funded accounts tally grow to 22.5 million. That’s 25% growth in a single quarter!</p>
<p>Naturally, there were a few things going on in the second quarter of this year that won’t happen again, but it’s still a bonkers result.</p>
<p>Early Robinhood investor <a href="https://twitter.com/janatindex">Jan Hammer of Index</a> sent over a comment in the wake of his investment’s public offering, arguing that the company is part of work being done by tech companies to shake up financial services. Companies like Robinhood, he wrote, are “not just a fresh coat of paint for the same old financial products.”</p>
<p>I think that is correct. And the point is pretty damning of incumbent players still in the market with dated websites and medium-grade mobile experiences. Can you imagine getting a Gen Zer to swap out Robinhood or eToro or M1 Finance for, I don’t know, John Hancock? The toothpaste, as they say, is not going back into the tube.</p>
<p>How might Fidelity and Vanguard convince Robinhood users to move to their services? Will they be able to, or has an entire generation of investors skipped the traditional finance players entirely? Robinhood bulls must think so, and I can’t really find it in me to fight the perspective.</p>
<p>I do not know how Robinhood will perform in the coming quarters, but it does feel &#8212; given the MAU numbers from Robinhood, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/m1-finance-raises-150m-in-softbank-led-series-e-boosts-valuation-to-1-45b/">AUM figures from M1</a> and so forth &#8212; that fintech startups stole several marches on your trusty 401(k) provider. A market that I am sure the fintechs will soon dig more deeply into.</p>
<h2>More about Africa</h2>
<p>Circling back to Africa, how about some July data? Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">exploration of the continent’s strong H1 2021 performance</a> stopped in June, so let’s add some data. Per Africa-watching publication The Big Deal, African startups <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBayen/status/1421037952583483392">raised $308 million across 71 deals</a> in the quarter. That’s a run rate of around $3.7 billion. Or in simpler terms, African startups are still on pace for their best year ever when it comes to raising venture capital.</p>
<p>Hugs, and get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>

<p>For those that want the entire story of Duolingo, from origin to messy monetization to historical IPO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">check out our EC-1</a>. It has dozens of interviews from executives, investors, linguists and competitors.</p>
<p>For today, though, we have fresh additions. We sat down with Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn earlier in the week to discuss not only his company’s IPO, but also what impact the listing may have on startups. Duolingo’s IPO can be looked at as a case study into consumer startups, mission-driven companies that monetize a small base of users, or education companies that recently hit scale. Paraphrasing from von Ahn, Duolingo doesn’t see itself as just an edtech company with fresh branding. Instead, it believes its growth comes from being an engineering-first startup.</p>
<p>Selling motivation, it seems, versus selling the fluency in a language is a proposition that international consumers are willing to pay for, and an idea that investors think can continue to scale to software-like margins.</p>
<h2><strong>1. The IPO event will bring “more sophistication” to Duolingo’s core service</strong></h2>
<p>Duolingo has gone through three distinct phases: Growth, in which it prioritized getting as many users as it could to its app; monetization, in which it introduced a subscription tier for survival; and now, education, in which it is focusing on tacking on more sophisticated, smarter technology to its service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The tech industry in China has had quite a turbulent week. The government is upending its $100 billion private education sector, wiping billions from the market cap of the industry&#8217;s most lucrative players. Meanwhile, the assault on Chinese internet giants continued. Tech stocks tumbled after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/tencents-wechat-suspends-new-user-registration-in-china-to-comply-with-relevant-laws-and-regulations/">Tencent suspended user registration</a>, sparking fears over who will be the next target of Beijing&#8217;s wrath.</p>
<p>Incisive observers point out that the new wave of stringent regulations against China&#8217;s internet and education firms has long been on Beijing&#8217;s agenda and there&#8217;s nothing surprising. Indeed, the central government has been unabashed about its desires to <a href="https://twitter.com/ruima/status/1420109129847214084">boost manufacturing</a> and contain the unchecked powers of its service industry, which can include everything from internet platforms, film studios to after-school centers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A few weeks ago I had an informative conversation with a Chinese venture capitalist who has been investing in industrial robots for over a decade, so I&#8217;m including it in this issue as it provides useful context for what&#8217;s going on in the consumer tech industry this week.</p>
<h2>Automate the factories</h2>
<p>China is putting robots into factories at an aggressive pace. Huang He, a partner at Northern Light Venture Capital, sees three forces spurring the demand for industrial robots &#8212; particularly ones that are made in China.</p>
<p>Over the years, Beijing has advocated for &#8220;localization&#8221; in a broad range of technology sectors, from enterprise software to production line automation. One may start to see Chinese robots that can rival those of Schneider and Panasonic a few years down the road. CRP, an NLVC-backed industrial robot maker, is already selling across Southeast Asia, Russia and East Europe.</p>
<p>On top of tech localization, it&#8217;s also well acknowledged that China is facing a severe demographic crisis. The labor shortage in its manufacturing sector is further compounded by the reluctance of young people to do menial factory work. Factory robots could offer a hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Youngsters these days would rather become food delivery riders than work in a factory. The work that robots replace is the low-skilled type, and those that still can&#8217;t be taken up by robots pay well and come with great benefits,&#8221; Huang observed.</p>
<p>Large corporations in China still lean toward imported robots due to the products&#8217; proven stability. The problem is that imported robots are not only expensive but also selective about their users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies need to have deep technical capabilities to be able to operate these [Western] robots, but such companies are rare in China,&#8221; said Huang, adding that the overwhelming majority of Chinese enterprises are small and medium size.</p>
<p>With the exceptions of the automotive and semiconductor industries, which still largely rely on sophisticated, imported robots, affordable, easy-to-use Chinese robots can already meet most of the local demand for industrial automation, Huang said.</p>
<p>China currently uses nearly one million six-axis robots a year but only manufactures 20% of them itself. The gap, coupled with a national plan for localization, has led to a frenzy of investments in industrial robotics startups.</p>
<p>The rush isn&#8217;t necessarily a good thing, said Huang. &#8220;There&#8217;s this bizarre phenomenon in China, where the most funded and valuable industrial robotic firms are generating less than 30 million yuan in annual revenue and not really heard of by real users in the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t an industry where giants can be created by burning through cash. It&#8217;s not the internet sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>Small-and-medium-size businesses are happily welcoming robots onto factory floors. Take welding for example. An average welder costs about 150,000 yuan ($23,200) a year. A typical welding robot, which is sold for 120,000 yuan, can replace up to three workers a year and &#8220;doesn&#8217;t complain at work,&#8221; said the investor. A quality robot can work continuously for six to eight years, so the financial incentive to automate is obvious.</p>
<p>Advanced manufacturing is not just helping local bosses. It will eventually increase foreign enterprises&#8217; dependence on China for its efficiency, making it hard to cut off Chinese supply chains despite efforts to avoid the geopolitical risks of manufacturing in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;In electronics, for example, most of the supply chains are in China, so factories outside China end up spending more on logistics to move parts around. Much of the 3C manufacturing is already highly automated, which relies heavily on electricity, but in most emerging economies, the power supply is still quite unstable, which disrupts production,&#8221; said Huang.</p>
<h2>War on internet titans</h2>
<p>The shock of antitrust regulations against Alibaba from last year is still reverberating, but another wave of scrutiny has already begun. Shortly after Didi&#8217;s blockbuster IPO in New York, the ride-hailing giant was asked to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown/">cease user registration</a> and work on protecting user information critical to national security.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Tencent stocks <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/international-investor-concerns-mount-over-chinas-tech-rout-2021-07-27/">fell the most in a decade</a> after it halted user signups on its WeChat messenger as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/tencents-wechat-suspends-new-user-registration-in-china-to-comply-with-relevant-laws-and-regulations/">&#8220;upgrades&#8221; its security technology to align with relevant laws and regulations</a>. The gaming and social media giant is just the latest in a growing list of companies hit by Beijing&#8217;s tightening grip on the internet sector, which had been flourishing for two decades under laissez-faire policies.</p>
<p>Underlying the clampdowns is Beijing&#8217;s growing unease with the service industry&#8217;s unscrutinized accumulation of wealth and power. China is unequivocally determined to advance its tech sector, but the types of tech that Beijing wants are not so much the video games that bring myopia to children and algorithms that get adults hooked to their screens. China makes it clear in its <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/April_2021_Trade_Bulletin.pdf">five-year plan</a>, a series of social and economic initiatives, that it will go all-in on &#8220;hard tech&#8221; like semiconductors, renewable energy, agritech, biotech and industrial automation like factory robotics.</p>
<p>China has also vowed to fight inequality in education and wealth. In the authorities&#8217; eyes, expensive, for-profit after-schools dotting big cities are hindering education attainment for children from poorer areas, which eventually exacerbates the wealth gap. The new regulatory measures have restricted the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/"> hours, content, profits and financing of private tutoring institutions</a>, tanking stocks of the industry&#8217;s top companies. Again, there have been clear indications from<a href="https://twitter.com/henrysgao/status/1420013465805094912"> President Xi Jinping&#8217;s writings</a> to bring off-campus tutoring &#8220;back on the educational track.&#8221; All China-focused investors and analysts are now poring over Xi&#8217;s thoughts and directives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year over year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>Google Play updates its policies</h3>
<p><strong>Did you hear the one about Google Play banning sugar daddy dating apps?</strong> Google this week updated its <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9878810">terms to clarify that apps</a> where users offer sex acts in exchange for money, or &#8220;sugar dating,&#8221;<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9934569?hl=en-GB"> as the new terms state,</a> are no longer allowed as of September 1, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>More interesting, perhaps, to the larger group of legitimate Android developers is this week&#8217;s unveiling of </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/google-unveils-its-proposed-safety-section-for-apps-on-google-play"><strong>the UI for the upcoming Google Play safety section</strong></a> and the accompanying app labels. The labels will function as the Android counterpart to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">app &#8220;nutrition labels&#8221;</a> the Apple App Store recently introduced. Google is giving developers plenty of time to get used to the idea of increased transparency and disclosure, by offering a detailed timeline of when it expects developers to have their privacy label submissions ready. By April 2022, all developers will need to declare specific info and have a privacy policy.</p>
<p>Developers will have to disclose to users whether their app uses security practices like data encryption, whether it follows Google Play’s Families policy for apps aimed at kids, whether users have a choice in data sharing, whether the app’s safety section had been verified by a third party, and if the app allowed users to request data deletion at the time of uninstalling, among other things.</p>
<p>Apps that don&#8217;t disclose won&#8217;t be able to list or update until the problems are fixed.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google unveils its proposed &#8216;safety section&#8217; for apps on Google Play&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/google-unveils-its-proposed-safety-section-for-apps-on-google-play/embed/#?secret=STPJLAJRrp" data-secret="STPJLAJRrp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The safety section wasn&#8217;t the only Google Play policy news to be announced this week.</p>
<p><strong>Google also <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/announcing-policy-updates-to-bolster.html">reminded developers</a> that it was making a technical change to how advertising IDs work.</strong> Now, when users opt out of interest-based advertising or ads personalization, their <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2364761">advertising ID</a> is removed and replaced with a string of zeros. The change, however, is a phased rollout, affecting apps running on Android 12 devices starting late 2021 and expanding to all apps running on devices that support Google Play in early 2022.</p>
<p>Google also said it will test a new feature that notifies developers and ad/analytics service providers of user opt-out preferences and is prohibiting linking <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids">persistent device identifiers</a> to personal and sensitive user data or resettable device identifiers. Kids apps will also not be able to transmit an ad ID.</p>
<p><strong>Another <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/announcing-policy-updates-to-bolster.html">policy update includes</a> a plan to close dormant accounts</strong>. Google says if the account is inactive or abandoned after a year, it will be closed. This will include accounts where the developer has never uploaded an app or accessed Google Play Console in a year.</p>
<p>Tools to build accessible experiences will also be locked down, as Google is adding new requirements on how <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/service">AccessibilityService API</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityServiceInfo#isaccessibilitytool">IsAccessibilityTool</a> can be used.</p>
<h3>Apple tries to fix the Safari mess</h3>
<p>In response to feedback and complaints, Apple is clearly trying to fix some of the issues that arose from this change. It re-added a Share button to the tab bar and put additional controls under that menu. There’s also once again a reload button in the tab bar next to the domain name, though it’s a bit smaller, and a Reader Mode button will appear in the tab bar when Reader is available</p>
<p>On iPad, Safari also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/ipados-15-macos-monterey-safari-interface/">reverted</a> back to the traditional separate row of tabs, instead of the new compact experience.</p>

<h3>Elon Musk sides with Epic Games</h3>
<p>Elon Musk sided with Fortnite maker Epic Games in the Apple App Store antitrust lawsuit, as the Tesla CEO tweeted on Friday that Apple&#8217;s App Store fees were &#8220;a de facto global tax on the Internet.&#8221; The lawsuit alleges Apple is abusing its platform power with how it commissions apps and in-app purchases on its App Store platform &#8212; fees that add up to big numbers for a game like Fortnite, which arguably doesn&#8217;t need an App Store for discovery, marketing, payments and distribution. But there&#8217;s no other way to sell to iOS users today. On Android, apps can at least be sideloaded. It&#8217;s not currently clear why Musk has decided to take a stand on the issue, as none of his companies&#8217; apps are dramatically impacted by Apple&#8217;s fees at present.</p>

<h1>Weekly News</h1>
<h3>Other Platform News (Apple &amp; Google)</h3>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/deprecated-sirikit-intent-domains">announced</a> plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/28/ios-15-limiting-siri-for-third-party-apps/">end support for a number</a> of SiriKit intents and commands</strong>, including those that could impact major apps &#8212; like ride-sharing app Uber. In total, there are over 20 SiriKit intent domains that will be deprecated and no longer supported in new and existing OS releases, Apple says.</p>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/apple-tweaks-controversial-ios-15-safari-changes-in-latest-beta/">tweaked</a> the controversial iOS 15 Safari changes in the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/27/apple-releases-ios-15-beta-4-and-ipados-15-beta-4-to-developers">latest betas</a></strong> (iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, beta 4). The new Safari design had moved the tab bar (URL bar) to the bottom of the screen — a fairly radical change for one of the iPhone’s most used apps. It was meant to make the controls easier to reach but critics said that the change made other often used features — like the reload button or Reader Mode — harder to find and use, impacting the overall usability of the browser itself.</p>
<p><strong>Google this week <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/jetpack-compose-announcement.html">launched</a> version 1.0 of Jetpack Compose</strong>, Android&#8217;s new, native UI toolkit aimed at helping developers build better apps faster. The tool had been in beta since March. The new production release is built to integrate with the Jetpack libraries developers already use, and offers an implementation of Material Design components and theming. New <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/jetpack-compose-announcement.html">features include</a> Compose Preview and Deploy Preview, which require Android Studio Arctic Fox, which is also out now in a stable release.</p>

<p><strong>Google also <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/accessing-car-hardware-apis-in-your-app.html">announced</a> the availability of the CarHardwareManager API</strong> via the Android for Cars App Library as part of Jetpack.</p>
<h3>E-commerce</h3>
<p><strong>Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/twitter-launches-u-s-e-commerce-pilot-that-lets-users-shop-from-profiles/">launched a U.S. e-commerce pilot test</a> that will help determine the current appetite for online shopping on its platform.</strong> The test allows brands and businesses to feature a &#8220;Shop Module&#8221; with various products for sale at the top of their Professional Profile, a business-friendly version of a profile page with support for things like an address, hours, phone number and more. Users can click on the Shop Module to go to a retail website and transact. Early testers include Game Stop and Arden Cove. The feature itself is somewhat bare bones for now, as it&#8217;s really just an image that launches an in-app browser. That&#8217;s not enough to really compete with something like Instagram Shop or Shopify&#8217;s Shop and the integrated, native checkout experience those types of app offers.</p>

<h3>Social</h3>
<p><strong>Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">announced</a> a series of significant changes to how it handles the accounts of younger teens</strong>. The company says it will now default users to private accounts at sign-up if they’re under the age of 16  — or under 18 in certain locales, including in the EU. It will also push existing users under 16 to switch their account to private if they have not already done so. In addition, Instagram is rolling out new technology aimed at reducing unwanted contact from adults — like those who have already been blocked or reported by other teens — and it will change how advertisers can reach its teenage audience. The changes give the company a way to argue to regulators that it&#8217;s capable of self-policing as it attempts to roll out a version of Instagram to younger users under the age of 13.</p>

<p>Developer Kosta Eleftheriou may have taken on Apple in legal battles and on Twitter, as he points out the numerous app scams on the App Store, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped him from building new apps.</p>
<p>This week, Eleftheriou introduced <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1574130405">Nanogram</a>, a Telegram client app that works on the Apple Watch without needing an iPhone connection. Eleftheriou said he was inspired to build Nanogram because he wanted a Telegram app for his LTE Apple Watch and didn&#8217;t like the official version that didn&#8217;t provide &#8220;basic and reliable messaging functionality.&#8221; So he built his own app from scratch using the Telegram SDK, which allows you to send, receive and view all your messages and notifications right from your wrist &#8212; even if you don&#8217;t have your phone nearby. The app also supports Eleftheriou&#8217;s FlickType Swipe Keyboard for faster replies while on the go.</p>
<p>Eleftheriou notes the app doesn&#8217;t collect any personal information and requires an Apple Watch Series 3 or later, running watchOS 7 or later.</p>

<p>After seeing a 70% yearly increase for its iOS version, Lightricks brought its <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightricks.videoleap">Videoleap app to the Google Play Store</a>. The app has grown popular with online creators for offering professional quality editing tools on mobile, including those that let you apply artistic effects, mix videos with images, add text and layer transformations and more. The company says Videoleap users are now creating 35 million pieces of content per month, and 47% of users are exporting their creations to TikTok in pursuit of monetizing their content further. The app, like others from Lightricks (which also makes FaceTune and others), monetizes by way of in-app subscriptions.</p>

		Michael Biltz is managing director of <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/technology/technology-trends-2021">Accenture Technology Vision</a>, where he leads the enterprise's annual visioning process to focus on how technology will impact the way we work and live.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The world has just witnessed one of the fastest work transformations in history. COVID-19 saw businesses send people home en masse, leaning on technology to maintain business as usual. Working from home, once the exception rather than the rule, became responsible for <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/research/publications/how-working-home-works-out">two-thirds of economic activity</a> as an estimated <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/year-of-living-remotely-when-365-days-went-poof-into-the-cloud-11615575108">1.1 billion people</a> around the world were forced to perform their daily jobs remotely, up from 350 million in 2019.</p>
<p>As we explain in the <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/technology/technology-trends-2021?c=acn_us_technologyvisiogoogle_11975684&amp;n=psgs_0221&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwrsGCBhD1ARIsALILBYpxKZSC0pq2yWwtULPGZRbBi1Kky9cTy32DJQ8FY5mP_EJso51QRR4aAgXHEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">2021 Accenture Technology Vision</a> report, this transformation is just the beginning. Looking ahead, where and how people work will be much more flexible concepts with the potential to bring benefits to employees and employers alike. In fact, 87% of executives Accenture surveyed believe that the remote workforce opens up the market for difficult-to-find talent.</p>
<p>These benefits will only be fully realized if enterprises adopt a strategic approach to the future of work. Think back to a few years ago, when the bring your own device (BYOD) trend was in vogue. Faced with demand from workers to use their own devices in the enterprise setting, businesses had to think through new policies and controls to support this model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Employers must now do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale. BYOD has become “BYOE”: Employees are bringing their entire <em>environments</em> to work. These environments include a broader range of worker-owned tech (smart speakers, home networks, gaming consoles, security cameras and more) and their work setting. One person may have a home office set up in a shed in their garden, another may be working from the kitchen table, surrounded by their family.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Businesses need to accept that their employees’ environments are a permanent part of their enterprise and adjust them accordingly.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>The workplace reimagined</h2>
<p>Looking ahead, the BYOE-style of work won’t be limited to employees’ homes. People will be free to work from anywhere, and they will want to work in the environment that’s best for them — whether that’s the office, home or a hybrid mix of the two. This is something leaders must accommodate rather than fight.</p>
<p>Indeed, leaders can rethink the purpose of working at the warehouses, depots, factories, offices, labs and other locations that make up their businesses. They should consider carefully when it makes sense for people to be at certain sites and with certain people. They will thereby be able to optimize their operations.</p>
<p>A few years from now, the organizations that succeed will be the ones that resisted the urge to race everyone back to the office and instead rethought how their workforce operates. They will have put in place a robust strategy for change that includes the adoption of technology enablers like the cloud, AI, IoT and XR. But more importantly, this will outline how their reimagined workforce model can support and enable their people and how this can be reflected in the corporate culture.</p>
<h2>Enabling the new</h2>
<p>The first step toward this future requires gaining visibility into the employee experience. With BYOE, the employee experience has never been more important, but it has also never been harder to monitor. Workplace analytics will therefore be critical to understanding how employees’ environments are impacting their work and finding insights that can improve their experience and productivity.</p>
<p>Security is another primary enabler. Businesses need to accept that their employees’ environments are a permanent part of their enterprise and adjust them accordingly. IT security teams will have to do more than ensure that a worker’s laptop is secured with the latest firewall patches, and consider the worker’s network security and the security of all devices linked to that network, such as baby monitors and smart TVs.</p>
<p>Once the technology, analytics and security foundations are in place, businesses will be better positioned to unlock the full value of BYOE: operating model transformation. When companies go virtual-first, they have new opportunities to integrate emerging technologies into the workforce. With a virtual-first BYOE strategy, for example, businesses can have a warehouse full of robots doing the physical work, coupled with offsite employees safely monitoring and overseeing strategy.</p>
<h2>Cultural change is key</h2>
<p>Success in BYOE will also come down to culture. The enterprise must accept that the employee environment is now part of the &#8220;workplace&#8221; and accommodate people’s needs. This will be a large, slow-to-emerge cultural shift, but there will be quick wins, too.</p>
<p>Take the disconnect between in-person and remote workers as an example. So much is currently tied to geography, but the future will be all about balance. Workers in different roles will benefit from the work environment best suited to their needs. However, without careful implementation, the approach could lead to a divided workforce, where in-office and remote workers struggle to collaborate. Quora <a href="https://www.quora.com/q/quora/Remote-First-at-Quora">is already looking</a> to overcome this challenge by requiring all employees who are attending meetings, regardless of whether they’re home or in the office, to appear on their own video screen.</p>
<p>Reimagining the organization for BYOE is a moving target and best practices are still emerging. But one thing is already clear: You can’t afford to wait. To attract the best talent and keep employees engaged, start planning now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TuSimple, the self-driving truck company that went public earlier this year, has partnered with Ryder as part of its plan to build out a freight network that will support its autonomous trucking operations.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Under the deal announced this week, Ryder&#8217;s fleet maintenance facilities will act as terminals for TuSimple&#8217;s freight network. TuSimple&#8217;s so-called AFN, or autonomous freight network, is a collection of </span>shipping routes and terminals designed for autonomous trucking operations that will extend across the United States by 2024. UPS, which took a minority stake in TuSimple before it went public, carrier U.S. Xpress, Penske Truck Leasing and Berkshire Hathaway’s grocery and food service supply chain company McLane Inc. were the inaugural partners in the network.</p>
<p>TuSimple’s AFN involves four pieces that includes its self-driving trucks, digital mapped routes, freight terminals and a system that will let customers monitor autonomous trucking operations and track their shipments in real time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ryder&#8217;s facilities will primarily serve as strategic terminals where TuSimple trucks can receive maintenance and have sensors used in the self-driving system calibrated, if needed. In some cases, the terminals might be used as a transfer hub for a smaller operator that might want to pick up cargo. But this is not meant to be a hub-to-hub system where its customers would come and pick up freight, according to TuSimple President and CEO Cheng Lu.</p>
<p>&#8220;These trucks need to be serviceable and maintainable and they need to have higher uptime, which is what every carrier cares about regardless of whether it is autonomous or not,&#8221; Lu said.</p>
<p>Small shippers and carriers might use these terminals to pick up and drop off freight. However, Lu stressed that in most cases, especially for large-scale operators like UPS, TuSimple will take the freight directly to the customer&#8217;s distribution centers. The Ryder facilities work as nodes, or stops, on its network to allow TuSimple to reach more customers over a larger geographic area, Lu added.</p>
<p>The partnership will start gradually. TuSimple has 50 autonomous trucks in its fleet that — along with a human safety operator behind the wheel — transport freight for customers in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The partnership will initially use Ryder&#8217;s facilities in these areas and eventually expand to the company&#8217;s 500 maintenance facilities in the United States.</p>
<p>TuSimple said it expects to expand operations to the East Coast, carrying freight between Phoenix and Orlando later this year. TuSimple has about 25 new trucks on order, which will be added to the fleet once they become available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly two years ago, contractors for Google’s Pittsburgh operations voted to join the United Steelworkers union in a bid to secure more labor rights representation. It was an early example of a building union movement for tech workers across the spectrum. But as other hard-fought battles have been waged among blue and white collar workers alike, both sides have continued hashing out negotiations. This week, those have finally resulted in something more concrete.</p>
<p>The contract workers held out for what they believed to be similar treatment as others in the tech industry. At the time, it seemed Google was hoping to stay out of the fray with HCL Technologies, the consulting company that staffed the workers.</p>
<p>“We work with lots of partners, many of which have unionized workforces, and many of which don’t,” Google said following the initial union vote. “As with all our partners, whether HCL’s employees unionize or not is between them and their employer. We’ll continue to partner with HCL.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to the USW, the 65 Pittsburgh-based workers have ratified the contract with HCL. It’s a three-year-deal that covers working conditions, job security and wages, per a note from the union.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">USW Tech Workers Ratify Historic First Contract at HCL <a href="https://t.co/VY8XLGThUr">https://t.co/VY8XLGThUr</a></p>
<p>&mdash; United Steelworkers (@steelworkers) <a href="https://twitter.com/steelworkers/status/1421086925881028614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;After close to two years of hard work, patience and solidarity from our members at HCL, we are proud of what we achieved in this agreement,&#8221; USW President Tom Conway said in a release tied to the news. &#8220;More than ever, our struggle with HCL shows that all workers deserve the protections and benefits of a union contract.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, with the deal nearing completion, HCL said in a statement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590357/google-pittsburgh-contractors-hcl-union-steelworkers">provided to The Verge</a>, “Throughout this process, HCL has been actively engaged in meaningful and fair discussions with the USW in good faith. We have been steadfast in our commitment to respect our employees’ right to pursue unionization should they choose to do so.”</p>
<p>In a release issued by USW, however, bargaining committee member Renata Nelson notes some clear tension in the process. “After ignoring our concerns, HCL tried to prevent us from forming a union, and when it failed, the company dragged out the negotiating process while sending our jobs overseas in retaliation,” Parks said in the release. “Now, with a strong union and contract in place, we’re confident that our voices will be heard.”</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/elon-musk-calls-app-store-fees-a-de-facto-global-tax-on-the-internet/"><strong>Elon vs. Tim Apple:</strong></a> Earnings season is usually replete with CEOs and other execs saying very few, usually boring things. That’s because there are rules about what CEOs and other corporate leaders can say when their companies are public. Then there’s Elon Musk, who took a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/elon-musk-apple-sniping-tesla-call">poorly veiled potshot</a> at Apple during Tesla’s earnings call, and followed it up by tweeting that Apple’s App Store cut is a tax on the internet. Game on.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/robinhoods-cfo-says-it-was-ready-to-go-public/"><strong>Why Robinhood went public:</strong></a> TechCrunch spoke with the company’s CFO earlier this week about why this was the right time for the consumer trading service to go public. His answer? The company had done the work on exec talent, product work, safety and was ready. We also dug into why the company’s debut has been a bit staid.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/gopuff-confirms-new-1b-cash-injection-at-a-15b-valuation-to-expand-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/"><strong>Gopuff confirms $100M investment:</strong></a> The on-demand delivery company is now worth $15 billion after the latest investment, meaning that the so-called “instant” delivery space is now better funded than ever. Who put the capital in? A raft of crossover funds and other capital pools. This is a win <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/">for SoftBank’s Vision Fund</a>, mind.</li>

<h2>Startups/VC</h2>

Well, now keep your mind wrapped around <em>Yat</em>, a startup that has sold tens of millions of dollars in emoji strings that can represent your person or personality. I would mock this but I thought Bitmoji were dumb, so what do I know.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/white-label-saas-shipping-startup-outvio-closes-3m-round-led-by-change-ventures/"><strong>Outvio closes $3M round for its white-label fulfillment service:</strong></a> Hailing from known startup hub Estonia, Outvio wants to build a SaaS business around its white-labelable “fulfillment solution for medium-sized and large online retailers in Spain and Estonia,” TechCrunch reports. Frankly given how big the e-commerce game is getting, the idea behind Outvio is not a surprise. Let’s see what it can get done with its new capital.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/varda-space-industries-closes-42m-series-a-for-off-planet-manufacturing/"><strong>Let’s build stuff in space:</strong></a> That’s what we presume Varda Space pitched when it was busy raising a $42 million Series A round. Why build stuff in space, which is hard to get to? Microgravity. Varda wants to have its first space-based manufacturing hub set up by 2023. My inner science fiction nerd is hyped.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/platform-as-a-service-startup-porter-aims-to-become-go-to-platform-for-deploying-managing-cloud-based-apps/"><strong>Porter wants to build a PaaS offering to make Kubernetes management better:</strong></a> The YC graduate just raised $1.5 million for its work to boot. In short, the founding team liked tech like Kubernetes, but didn’t like managing it. So they built a tool to make that work easier. Why Porter raised a 2012-era seed round is beyond us, but the company can surely access more funds if things go well.</li>

<h2>The best way to grow your tech career? Treat it like an app</h2>
<p>Many technical workers aren&#8217;t extremely career focused; on average, they&#8217;re paid more than other startup employees, and the most talented often get to work on projects that interest them personally.</p>
<p>But the increasing demand for talent is offset by an ongoing shortage: Companies can&#8217;t hire developers and engineers fast enough, even though many still don&#8217;t see themselves as in-demand workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;To put it bluntly, many developers and engineers stink at managing their own careers,&#8221; says Raj Yavatkar, CTO of Juniper Networks.</p>
<p>Breaking away from traditional tech culture can be challenging, so Yavatkar recommends that developers and engineers &#8220;treat career advancement as you would a software project.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Argo AI, the autonomous vehicle technology startup backed by Ford and VW, has landed a permit in California that will allow the company to give people free rides in its self-driving vehicles on the state&#8217;s public roads.</p>
<p>The California Public Utilities Commission issued the so-called Drivered AV pilot permit earlier this month, according to the approved application. It was <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/regulatory-services/licensing/transportation-licensing-and-analysis-branch/autonomous-vehicle-carrier-pilot/autonomous-vehicle-pilot-permits-issued">posted on its website</a> Friday, a little more than a week after Argo and Ford announced plans to launch at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles on Lyft&#8217;s ride-hailing network in a number of cities over the next five years, starting with Miami and Austin.</p>
<p>The permit, which is part of the state&#8217;s Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service pilot, puts Argo in small and growing group of companies seeking to expand beyond traditional AV testing — a signal that the industry, or at least some companies, are preparing for commercial operations. Argo has been testing its autonomous vehicle technology in Ford vehicles around Palo Alto since 2019. Today, the company&#8217;s test fleet in California is about one dozen self-driving test vehicles. It also has autonomous test vehicles in Miami, Austin, Washington D.C., Pittsburgh and Detroit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aurora, AutoX, Cruise, Deeproute, Pony.ai, Voyage, Zoox and Waymo have all received permits to participate in the CPUC&#8217;s Drivered Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service Pilot program, which requires a human safety operator to be behind the wheel. Companies with this permit cannot charge for rides.</p>
<p>Cruise is the only company to have secured a driverless permit from the CPUC, which allows it to shuttle passengers in its test vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Snagging the CPUC&#8217;s Drivered permit is just part of the journey to commercialization in California. The state requires companies to navigate a series of regulatory hurdles from the CPUC and the California Department of Motor Vehicles — each agency with its own tiered system of permits — before it can charge for rides in robotaxis without a human safety operator behind the wheel.</p>
<p>The DMV regulates and issues permits for testing autonomous vehicles on public roads. There are three levels of permits issued by the DMW, starting with one that allows companies to test AVs on public roads with a safety operator behind the wheel. More than 60 companies have this basic testing permit.</p>
<p>The next permit allows for driverless testing, followed by a deployment permit for commercial operations. Driverless testing permits, in which a human operator is not behind the wheel, have become the new milestone and a required step for companies that want to launch a commercial robotaxi or delivery service in the state. AutoX, Baidu, Cruise, Nuro, Pony.ai, Waymo, WeRide and Zoox have driverless permits with the DMV.</p>
<p>The final step with the DMV, which only Nuro has achieved, is a deployment permit. This permit allows Nuro to deploy at a commercial scale. Nuro&#8217;s vehicles can&#8217;t hold passengers, just cargo, which allows the company to bypass the CPUC permitting process.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CPUC authorized in May 2018 two pilot programs for transporting passengers in autonomous vehicles. The Drivered Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service Pilot program, which is what Argo just secured, allows companies to operate a ride-hailing service using autonomous vehicles as long as they follow specific rules. Companies are not allowed to charge for rides, a human safety driver must be behind the wheel and certain data must be reported quarterly.</p>
<p>The second CPUC pilot allows for driverless passenger service, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/cruise-can-now-give-passengers-rides-in-driverless-cars-in-california/"> Cruise secured in June 2021</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that to reach the holy grail of commercial robotaxis requires the companies to secure all of these permits from the DMV and CPUC.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Deliveroo said it is considering leaving the Spanish market, citing limited market share and a long road of investment with 'highly uncertain long-term potential returns' on the horizon.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Deliveroo <a href="https://www.investegate.co.uk/deliveroo-plc--roo-/rns/proposal-to-end-operations-in-spain/202107300908580582H/">announced today</a> that it is considering leaving the Spanish market, citing limited market share and a long road of investment with &#8220;highly uncertain long-term potential returns&#8221; on the horizon.</p>
<p>The company, an on-demand outfit based in the U.K., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/deliveroo-prices-its-shares-on-the-lse-at-3-90-at-the-lower-end-of-the-range-with-a-market-cap-of-7-59b/">went public earlier in 2021</a>. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/what-to-make-of-deliveroos-rough-ipo-debut/">shares initially sagged</a>, drawing concern about both the value of on-demand companies and tech concerns listing in London more broadly. However, shares of Deliveroo have since recovered, and the company&#8217;s <a href="https://dpd-12774-s3.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/8316/2574/2996/Deliveroo_PLC_update_Q2_2021.pdf">second-quarter earnings report</a> saw it raise its expected gross order volume growth expectations &#8220;from between 30% to 40% to between 50% to 60%.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given its rising growth expectations and improving public-market valuation, you may be surprised that Deliveroo is willing to leave any of the 12 markets in which it currently operates. In the case of Spain, it appears that Deliveroo is concerned that changes to local labor laws will make its operations more expensive in the country, which, given its modest market share, is not palatable.</p>
<p>Recall that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/spain-adopts-landmark-law-protect-gig-delivery-workers-77620461">Spain adopted a law</a> in May &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/">a law generally agreed to in March</a> &#8212; requiring on-demand companies to hire their couriers. This is the sort of arrangement that on-demand companies in food delivery and ride-hailing have long fought; many on-demand companies are unprofitable <em>without</em> hiring couriers, and doing so could raise their costs. The possibility of worsened economics makes such changes to labor laws in any market a worry for startups and public companies alike that lean on freelance delivery workers.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s parse the Deliveroo statement to better understand the company&#8217;s perspective. Here&#8217;s the introductory paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Deliveroo today announces that it proposes to consult on ending its operations in Spain. Deliveroo currently operates across 12 markets worldwide, with the vast majority of the Company&#8217;s gross transaction value (GTV) coming from markets where Deliveroo holds a #1 or #2 market position.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: We&#8217;re probably leaving Spain. Most of our order volume comes from markets where we are in a leading position (the company competes with Uber Eats, Glovo and Just Eat in different markets). We are not in a leading position in Spain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="ad"><span class="r">Spain represents less than 2% of Deliveroo&#8217;s GTV in H1 2021. The Company has determined that achieving and sustaining a top-tier market position in Spain would require a disproportionate level of investment with highly uncertain long-term potential returns that could impact the economic viability of the market for the Company. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translation: Spain is a very small market for Deliveroo. To gain lots of market share in Spain would be very costly, and the company isn&#8217;t sure about the long-term profitability of the country&#8217;s business. This is where labor issues like this come into play &#8212; investing to gain market share in a country where your business is less profitable is hard to pencil out.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://elpais.com/economia/2021-07-30/deliveroo-se-propone-cerrar-su-division-espanola.html">according to El Pais</a>, the decision by Deliveroo comes as it was up against a deadline regarding worker reclassification. That may have contributed to the timing of the announcement.</p>
<p>From this juncture, Deliveroo spends three paragraphs discussing how it will support workers in case it does leave the Spanish market. It closes with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="ae"><span class="o">This proposal does not impact previously communicated full-year guidance on Group annual GTV growth and gross profit margin.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>On-demand companies have made arguments over the years that changes to labor laws that would push more costs onto their plates in the form of hiring couriers &#8212; or simply paying them more &#8212; would make certain markets uneconomic and drive them away. Here, Deliveroo can follow through with an exit at essentially no cost, given how small its order volume is compared to its other 11 markets.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every week over the past three and a half years, an average of three CEOs have exited tech companies in the U.S. That tally is higher — in good times and bad — than in any of the other 26 for-profit sectors tracked by executive search firm <a href="https://www.challengergray.com/blog/ceo-turnover-cools-in-may-falling-26-from-april/">Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas</a>. You&#8217;d think tech companies should be the paradigm of how to prep for leadership transitions, since they operate in such a constant state of flux.</p>
<p>They’re far from it.</p>
<p>A change of command is one of the most delicate moments in the life cycle of any organization. If mishandled, the transition from one CEO to the next can result in a loss of market valuation, momentum and focus, as well as key personnel, customers and partners. It may even become that turning point when an organization begins to slide toward irrelevance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With so much at stake, 84% of tech execs agree that succession planning is more important than ever because of today’s fast-changing business environment, according to <a href="https://www.historyfactory.com/the-succession-trap/">our new survey</a> of corporate America’s leaders. Seven out of 10 survey respondents agreed that tech companies face more scrutiny than other multinationals during a transition.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			84% of tech execs agree that succession planning is more important than ever because of today’s fast-changing business environment.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Yet we found that tech execs appear just as unprepared for C-suite transitions as their peers in other sectors. Three out of five respondents said their companies don’t have a documented plan to handle a leadership change, even though, by that same ratio, they acknowledge that a documented plan is the biggest determinant in seamless transitions.</p>
<p>The findings may not be troubling if these respondents were millennial startup founders, years from leaving their companies. The executives we polled, however, hail from 160 companies that have been in business for a minimum of 15 years — 35 are tech companies, the largest industry cohort in the survey.</p>
<p>The smallest companies have at least 1,500 employees and $500 million in annual revenue, while the largest have head counts of over 500,000 and revenue upward of $100 billion. They have been around long enough to understand — and put into place — risk management and crisis planning, including what happens should their leaders fall victim to the proverbial milk truck.</p>
<p>Tech execs should be more rigorous about succession planning for one important reason: institutional memory. Tech firms generally are younger than other companies of a similar size, which partly explains why the median age of S&amp;P 500 companies plunged to 33 years in 2018 from 85 years in 2000, according to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Electric%20Power%20and%20Natural%20Gas/Our%20Insights/Traditional%20company%20new%20businesses%20The%20pairing%20that%20can%20ensure%20an%20incumbents%20survival/Traditional-company-new-businesses-VF.ashx">McKinsey &amp; Co</a>.</p>
<p>These enterprises clearly have accomplished a lot in their short lives, but in their haste, most have not captured their history, unlike their longer-lived peers in other sectors. Less than half of these tech firms, in fact, have formally recorded their leader’s story for posterity. That puts them at a disadvantage when, inevitably, they will be required to onboard newcomers to their C-suites.</p>
<p>It’s best to record this history well before the intense swirl of a leadership transition begins. Crucially, it will help the incoming and future generations of leadership understand critical aspects of its track record, the lessons learned, culture and identity. It also explains why the organization has evolved as it has, what binds people together and what may trigger resistance based on previous experience. It’s as much about moving forward as looking back.</p>
<p>Most execs in our poll get it, with 85% saying a company’s history can be a playbook for new executives to learn and prepare for upcoming challenges and opportunities. “History is the mother of innovation for any type of company,” one respondent said. “History,&#8221; writes another, “includes the roadmap to failures as well as successes.”</p>
<p>But this documented history cannot be a hagiography of the departing CEO. Too often, outgoing execs spend their last years in office constructing their own trophy cases. Even as they conceded their own flat-footedness on transition planning, the majority of execs said they have already taken steps to create and reinforce their personal legacies — two-thirds said they have already completed their own formal legacy planning, many with the blessing of their boards.</p>
<p>It’s ironic, then, that three out of five also said that the legacy of a CEO or founder often overshadows the skill set and experience a successor brings. Two-thirds of tech execs believed that the longer a leader has been in office, the more it complicates a transition.</p>
<p>Tech leaders can do this right and have done so. Asked which five big-name CEO transitions was most successful, respondents’ No. 1 was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-09/this-is-how-tim-cook-transformed-apple-aapl-after-steve-jobs?sref=MSHtM8dd">Apple’s handoff</a> from Steve Jobs to Tim Cook (38%), followed by Microsoft’s page-turn from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella (28%). The others, at General Electric, General Motors and Goldman Sachs, each netted no more than 13% of votes.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s apparent predominance in this survey might contradict the advice to play down the aggrandizement of an exiting CEO and highlight the compilation and transfer of an organization’s history to the next chief executive. Jobs, after all, painstakingly managed his legacy until the end. But even as he continued to take center-stage, he also made sure to pass along Apple’s institutional knowledge and ethos to Cook over the 13 years they shared space on Apple’s executive floor.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, everyone in the C-suite today — including startup founders — will depart. For the sake of everyone they’ll leave behind, they should begin prepping for that day now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year, livestream viewers in China are projected to spend more than $60 billion on digital shopping experiences that let them interact with influencers in real time.</p>
<p>Promoting everything from cosmetics to food, social media stars use Taobao, TikTok and other platforms to livestream products and take questions from the audience.</p>
<p>On Taobao&#8217;s Singles Day in 2020, livestreams racked up $6 billion in sales, twice as much revenue as the year prior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sensing a trend, Western startups are getting in on the action, with companies like Whatnot and PopShop.Live raising rounds to build out their infrastructure. Looking forward, Alanna Gregory, senior global director at Afterpay, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/livestream-e-commerce-why-companies-and-brands-need-to-tune-in/">says she foresees four major trends</a>:</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim’s global exploration of Q2 venture capital data wrapped up this week with an in-depth look at Latin America.</p>
<p>One investor told them that today’s LatAm startup market “is a story about talent, not about capital.”</p>
<p>“The union of talent and money is what startup markets need to thrive,” they write. “But there are other reasons why Latin American startups are so frequently in the news today, including structural factors, such as strong digital penetration and quick e-commerce growth.”</p>

<p>In the reality TV series &#8220;Undercover Boss,&#8221; high-powered executives disguise themselves so they can work alongside everyday employees, ostensibly to learn from them.</p>
<p>Flipping that script, software company Vincit USA has a “CEO of the Day” program where staffers move into a metaphorical corner office for 24 hours and receive a very real unlimited budget. There&#8217;s just one requirement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CEO must make one lasting decision that will help improve the working experience of Vincit employees,&#8221; said Ville Houttu, Vincit&#8217;s founder and CEO.</p>
<p>Since instituting the program, Vincit USA has received multiple awards for its workplace culture and sees reduced staff turnover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though it may seem crazy, the initiative has paid off tenfold,&#8221; said Houttu.</p>

<p>Instead of giving founders standard term sheets, Boston-based seed-stage venture capital firm Pillar VC offers to buy common stock.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many terms and conditions in a preferred term sheet that can misalign investors and founders,&#8221; says founding partner Jamie Goldstein.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm takes stock of the wall of news out of China over the past week to see if there’s a silver lining for startups in the country as the Chinese Communist Party cracks down on everything from edtech companies to streaming platforms.</p>
<p>His take?</p>
<p>“The result may be concentrated effort and capital in sectors that Beijing favors and reduced capital and focus from entrepreneurs in sectors that have been deemed fit for strict control,” he writes. “Simply: Central planning is going to tilt business more toward centrally planned goals.”</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh-based language-learning unicorn initially aimed for an $85 to $95 per share IPO price range, then bumped that up to $95 to $100 before it began to trade. It ultimately entered the public markets at $102 per share.</p>
<p>Alex Wilhelm notes that based on Duolingo’s expected Q2 revenues, the company has a run-rate multiple of nearly 16x. Compare that to the median multiple for public SaaS companies of 14x.</p>
<p>“Duolingo, a <em>consumer edtech company,</em> is now more valuable per revenue dollar than the median public enterprise SaaS business,” Alex writes.</p>

<p>“Anomaly detection is one of the more difficult and underserved operational areas in the asset-servicing sector of financial institutions,” EZOPS CEO Bikram Singh writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>But it’s critical to detect these anomalies amid a sea of data. That’s where unsupervised learning can offer a solution.</p>
<p>​​”With all eyes on data, it’s crucial that financial institutions find solutions to detect anomalies upfront, thereby preventing bad data from infecting downstream processes,” Singh writes.</p>
<p>“Machine learning can be applied to detect the data anomalies as well as identify the reasons for them, effectively reducing the time spent researching and rectifying executions.”</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim continued their global tour of Q2 2021 venture capital data, this week focusing on Africa.</p>
<p>“Early data indicates that Africa is set to trounce historical records in terms of venture capital raised in the year and that the first half of 2021 saw roughly twice the funds raised by African startups as was recorded in the first half of 2020,” they write.</p>
<p>“Startups across Africa have never had more access to capital than they do right now.”</p>

<p>The intention of DevSecOps is to wedge security and compliance into DevOps. But that’s easier said than done, says Apiiro founder and CEO Idan Plotnik.</p>
<p>“Shifting left and extending right doesn’t mean that a scanning tool or security architect should detect a security risk earlier in the process — it means that a developer should have all the context to prevent the vulnerability before it even happens,” he writes.</p>

<p>Asana’s head of engineering, Prashant Pandey, rounds up four tips for SaaS startups looking to build up their infrastructure to meet customers&#8217; growing needs.</p>
<p>“Startups and SMBs are usually the first to adopt many SaaS products. But as these customers grow in size and complexity — and as you rope in larger organizations — scaling your infrastructure for the enterprise becomes critical for success,” he writes.</p>
<p>He offers four areas to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address your customers’ security and reliability needs</li>
<li>Give IT admins control over product usage</li>
<li>Build data isolation into your architecture</li>
<li>Support customers by interconnecting their data across applications</li>
</ul>
