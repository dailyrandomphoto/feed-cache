										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Long gone are the days when CES actually stood for “Consumer Electronics Show” &#8212; the CTA has seen to that in its various small print. I recommend you check out our recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/the-best-tech-of-ces-2012/">best of CES 2012</a> story for a look back on the days when things like smartphones took center stage at the event. Mobile World Congress has taken some of the wind out of CES’s sails, along with an increased push for companies to debut flagships at their own events.</p>
<p>This year we got, what, Samsung budget-flagship and a preview of the latest OnePlus device from a parallel event? Certainly things weren’t helped along by the fact that LG and HTC &#8212; which were both involved in the show in some form &#8212; are either mostly or entirely out of the smartphone game. And Huawei, which had a major presence at the show a few years back, won’t be participating in CES any time soon.</p>
<p>Much of that vacuum has been filled by transportation. Over the past decade, CES has transformed into a major automotive show, as carmakers look to prove to the world that they’re on the bleeding edge of tech, from autonomy to in-car systems to sending robots to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/at-ces-2022-metaverses-metaversed-the-metaverse/">Martian metaverse</a>. Certainly the show kept <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/ces-2022-best-weirdest-car-tech/">Kirsten and Rebecca very busy this week</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255297" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces/">CES</a> continues to be a major event on the consumer hardware side of things, as well, even if there aren’t as many phones as there once were. It’s still a major showcase for PCs, connected health, smart home gadgets, accessories and even robotics. It’s also a fascinating look into how the industry is evolving. Take fitness &#8212; the sheer volume of wearables has reduced, though companies are experimenting with newer form factors like rings. Meanwhile, there’s been a surge in companies looking to take on the likes of Peloton and Mirror.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2255312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2255312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Garmin</p></div></p>
<p>At what was a pretty subdued showing for wearables, Garmin managed to grab some headlines with its hybrid Sport smartwatch. Hybrid smartwatches have been an admittedly mixed bag over the years, but Garmin has proven to be a surprisingly strong brand in the wearables category. And the <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/ces/stylish-vivomove-sport-hybrid-smartwatch-by-garmin-is-a-timeless-blend-of-fashion-and-function/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivomove Sport</a> is a pretty great looking watch, with a clean design that will appeal to those put off by flashier smartwatches.</p>
<p>Trackers had a bit of moment, in the wake of the popularity of products like Tile and Apple AirTags. This year the former got another PC partner, in Lenovo, as the <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/thinkpad-x1s-strengthen-uncompromised-premium-laptop-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThinkPad X1</a> got Tile tracking support, allowing users to find their lost laptop for up to 14 days, even when powered down. Targus, meanwhile, built Apple’s Find My support directly into<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/targus-named-as-ces-2022-innovation-awards-honoree-for-new-sustainable-backpack-equipped-with-find-my-technology-301421704.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its latest backpack</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>But Chipolo gets the nod here with the introduction of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/chipolo-takes-on-tile-with-a-new-lost-wallet-tracker-that-works-with-apples-find-my/">CARD</a>. The device, which also supports Find My, is slightly larger than a credit card and designed to live in a wallet, so you get an alert whenever you leave the product behind. I currently own one AirTag, which I use for my keys. As someone who has misplaced his wallet more than once in my adult life, I’d say this is a fairly compelling use case that would make me consider shelling out for another.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254232" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254232" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254232" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/roborouter.gif" alt="Animation of a router automatically moving its antennas." width="640" height="527" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254232" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TP-Link</p></div></p>
<p>Devin dropped the AXE11000 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router at the end of his whole <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/look-upon-my-ces-2022-work-from-home-setup-and-despair/">what my work from home set up would look like if I was independently wealthy roundup</a> (paraphrasing here). This thing is pretty wild &#8212; especially as far as the world of routers go. The system features motorized antenna that adjust to get a stronger signal. No word on price there, but you’re likely going to pay for that luxury on top of TP-Link’s already high base price. But can you really put a price tag on faster Wi-Fi?</p>

<p>Shout-out to what’s likely to be a far more reasonably price remote accessory. If nothing else, Anker knows how to keep costs down; $220 will get you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/anker-debuts-a-2k-webcam-with-built-in-lighting-speakers-and-more-for-220/">the Video Bar,</a> which is a kind of all-in-one webcam solution. You get a 2K camera with AI-based picture framing, coupled with a built-in lightbar and speakers. It’s not going to replace more advanced studio setups (or, for that matter, the Opal), but it’s a solid plug and play solution for those looking to up their home video game on the (relatively) cheap.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, I wrote a lot of words about CES’s evolution as a robotics show. One of the biggest sticking points there is the general lack of viable home robotics, beyond the Roomba and an army of fellow robotic vacuums. I was happy to get a better look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/labrador-set-to-deliver-a-robotic-helping-hand-to-homes-in-2023/">Labrador’s system this week</a>, however, because it addresses a very real need &#8212; specifically those with limited mobility looking to remain independent. The system is effectively a mobile helping hand for the home.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255301" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255301" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2255301 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Showcasing-the-Incredible-Unfolds-at-CES-2022_1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Showcasing-the-Incredible-Unfolds-at-CES-2022_1.jpg 1620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Showcasing-the-Incredible-Unfolds-at-CES-2022_1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Showcasing-the-Incredible-Unfolds-at-CES-2022_1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Showcasing-the-Incredible-Unfolds-at-CES-2022_1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Showcasing-the-Incredible-Unfolds-at-CES-2022_1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Showcasing-the-Incredible-Unfolds-at-CES-2022_1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Showcasing-the-Incredible-Unfolds-at-CES-2022_1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255301" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Asus</p></div></p>
<p>It’s not CES without fun new form factors, and the <a href="https://press.asus.com/PressReleases/p/ASUS-Presents-Incredible-Unfolds-at-CES-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED</a> takes the cake by a mile this year, adopting the foldable phone form factor into a full laptop. What’s most stunning about the thing is that the company actually plans to release the thing. I suspect I’m not alone in assuming this thing was just a concept the first time I saw a render, but Asus is planning to release the system in Q2 of this year. So we’ll see soon enough how close the commercial product looks to these shots.</p>

<p>Samsung skipped its usual sensory bombardment this year. There weren’t any robots, just bespoke washing machines and budget phones, but it did manage to sneak in a fun projector, of all things. Despite their relatively limited appeal, companies keep trying to make projectors happen, and at the very least, <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-launches-the-freestyle-a-portable-screen-for-entertainment-wherever-you-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> is small, well-built and looks good. It’s also $900, which means it&#8217;s likely destined to stay in its niche.</p>

<p>A decade of development later, VR headsets have gotten better and better — but it&#8217;s safe to say, at this point, that VR&#8217;s adoption will be&#8230; gradual. If we&#8217;re all destined to end up with headsets (be they VR, AR, or some mix of the two) strapped to our faces, it&#8217;ll be less about one-big-thing* and more the result of a thousand tiny steps. A Beat Saber here; a Supernatural there. Incrementally better/lighter/faster headsets. Maybe folks get used to using headsets for training purposes at work. Maybe everyone suddenly agrees on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/at-ces-2022-metaverses-metaversed-the-metaverse/">what a metaverse is</a>.</p>
<p>This bit-by-bit advancement held true this year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces/">CES</a>. There was plenty of VR/AR news, none of it earth shattering — but each another step in the progression.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255273" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Lets recap the biggest VR/AR bits from the show.</p>
<h2>Sony PS VR2</h2>

<p>We&#8217;ve known for a while now that Sony has been working on a next-gen headset for the PlayStation 5, following up on the PS VR headset it released in 2016. But beyond a kind of light &#8220;We&#8217;re working on it!&#8221; announcement back in early 2021 and some details about the controllers a few months later, they hadn&#8217;t shared many specifics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They&#8217;re still keeping some cards close, but they shared a few more details on what&#8217;s now officially known <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/sony-psvr2-ps5-first-details-ces/">as the PS VR2</a>. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;ll have a resolution of 2000&#215;2040 per eye</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll have a wider field of view than the first-gen headset, at 110 degrees vs 96.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll have a refresh rate of 90/120 Hz.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll be able to track the motion of your eyes, potentially allowing you to do stuff like highlight interface elements just by looking at them.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll support foveated rendering, which is a fancy way of saying it can use processing power more efficiently by prioritizing the rendering of whatever&#8217;s in the center of your vision.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re building new controllers for it (pictured below) with finger detection and the PS5&#8217;s mind-bending adaptive triggers.</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2255319" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255319" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2255319" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-2.41.02-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-2.41.02-PM.jpg 1025w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-2.41.02-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-2.41.02-PM.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-2.41.02-PM.jpg?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-2.41.02-PM.jpg?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-2.41.02-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255319" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>
<p>What&#8217;ll the headset look like? Unknown! When will it actually ship? TBD! But with the PS VR being one of the few headsets to even kind of rival the Oculus Quest in terms of ease-of-use, it&#8217;s nice to see Sony continuing to build here.</p>
<h2>HTC Vive wrist tracker</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255294" style="width: 681px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255294" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2255294" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg?w=671" alt="" width="671" height="377" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg 671w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255294" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> HTC Vive</p></div></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the best way to handle input in VR? Most of the popular headsets have settled on some sort of controller in each hand. What if you just make your <em>hand</em> the controller, instead?</p>
<p>Hand tracking isn&#8217;t a brand new idea, of course. Companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/once-poised-to-kill-the-mouse-and-keyboard-leap-motion-plays-its-final-hand/">have come and gone</a> with hand tracking as their primary focus.</p>
<p>But HTC&#8217;s approach here is a bit different. Instead of relying entirely on cameras, they&#8217;re hoping you&#8217;ll strap sensor-packed bands to each wrist to help the system track what the cameras can&#8217;t see — like when one hand is obscuring the other, or you&#8217;ve got your arm back behind you for a golf swing. The company also demonstrated the sensors working while attached to other objects, like ping pong paddles and a NERF gun.</p>
<p>The company says the sensors should start shipping later this year for $129. One catch? For now, at least, it&#8217;ll only work with HTC&#8217;s Vive Focus 3 headset.</p>
<h2>Shiftall MeganeX</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255293" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255293" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2255293" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="413" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg 1042w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=768,467 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=680,413 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255293" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shiftall</p></div></p>
<p>VR headsets have gotten a whole lot sleeker over the years, but they&#8217;re still pretty beefy. How much smaller can they really get, though?</p>
<p>Panasonic subsidiary Shiftall has been working on an &#8220;ultra-lightweight, ultra-high-resolution&#8221; headset called the Meganex. With speakers built into the frames and a 1.3&#8243; (2560&#215;2560) display for each eye, they end up looking more like a massive pair of steampunk sunglasses than a headset. While designed to be lightweight and foldable, don&#8217;t expect to move around <em>too</em> much in these ones — you&#8217;ll need to attach them to computer via USB-C to do the heavy graphical lifting.</p>
<p>Shiftall says these should ship this year for &#8220;less than $900.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Microsoft partners with Qualcomm for AR chips</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255291" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255291" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2255291" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="281" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg 1209w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=300,124 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=768,318 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=680,281 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255291" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p>
<p>Microsoft already uses Qualcomm chips for their HoloLens headsets, but the companies made things a bit more official this week. At Qualcomm&#8217;s keynote it was announced that the two will work together to develop chips built specifically for use in AR headsets, with said chips supporting each of their augmented reality development platforms (Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces.)</p>
<h2>Nvidia Omniverse</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2253077" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253077" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2253077" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg 1829w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253077" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nvida</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not flashy hardware, but it&#8217;s potentially important on the software side of things: Nvidia this week opened up Omniverse, its collection of tools for helping 3D content creators work together in real-time.</p>
<p>Writes Frederic Lardinois in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/nvidia-expands-its-omniverse/">his post on the news</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omniverse</a> is Nvidia’s platform for allowing creators, designers and engineers to collaboratively build virtual worlds. It’s the company’s platform that brings together design tools and assets from first- and third-party applications into a single hardware and software ecosystem. Until now, Omniverse and the various Nvidia tools that support it were in beta, but at CES today, the company took off the beta label and made Omniverse generally available to creators.</p></blockquote>
<h2>TCL&#8217;s AR Glasses</h2>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5m-1PfFA9c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>This one seems mostly like a concept for now, so&#8230; well, don&#8217;t fall in love just yet. But TV/phone/air conditioner maker TCL is dabbling in the AR glasses space, pitching something akin to Google Glass in a package that looks much more like a standard pair of specs. &#8220;Holographic optical waveguide technology&#8221; pushes visuals onto the lens and into your field of view, and their concept video above promises touch-based controls built into the frames.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Baseball is like a laboratory for advanced statistical analysis, and businesses could learn a lot from watching how the sport deals with expanding datasets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In December 2014 I wrote a post titled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/28/finding-the-elusive-big-wisdom-in-big-data/">Finding the elusive big wisdom in big data</a>. We have made big advances since then in storing, processing and generally handling large volumes of data in a digital context, but humans still have trouble when it comes to reliably finding relevant nuggets that can improve business outcomes. I&#8217;m revisiting the idea to see how far we&#8217;ve come and how far we still have to go.</p>
<p>Baseball is one of the best examples of how data can impact a business. The book and movie <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393324815" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Moneyball&#8221;</a> showed how Oakland Athletics&#8217; GM Billy Beane changed the sport by introducing advanced statistical analysis instead of simply relying on reports from human scouts. Today, baseball is ruled by analysts as much as experienced baseball professionals — but could there be too much data?</p>
<p>Alex Spier writing in the Boston Globe&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/12/25/sports/examining-how-teams-treated-luxury-tax-threshold-baseballs-recently-expired-collective-bargaining-agreement/">Sunday Baseball Notes column</a> recently pointed out that Boston Red Sox Manager Alex Cora will have 11 coaches on staff this year for 26 players. Compare that with Terry Francona in 2011, who had six for 25, and you can see the number has nearly doubled.</p>
<p>Spier attributes this in part to the growing amount of data that teams are collecting, which requires more people to observe, interpret, and implement a plan to leverage. As Spier wrote, &#8220;The result? Several teams now feature three hitting coaches, and staffs keep growing in an effort to distill the mountains of information into a digestible form for the 26 players on a roster.&#8221;</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;Startups that analyze and extract insights from fast data have garnered extremely high public and private market investor interest.&#8221;							<cite>Deepak Jeevankumer</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Baseball is like a laboratory for advanced statistical analysis, and businesses could learn a lot from watching how the sport deals with expanding datasets.</p>
<p>Companies shovel data into data lakes, tinker with machine learning models, and use this information to make decisions, but they still face fundamental decisions every day that involve their ever-growing mountain of information. Sure, machines and software can help sort it out — indeed, they are getting better at it — but anyone who has dealt with poorly targeted advertising or email marketing knows there&#8217;s much work to be done.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Deepak Jeevankumer, managing director at Dell Technologies Capital, says the difference in play now compared to 2014 is that companies now are focused on getting insights to the people who need it faster. &#8220;Big Data has become less relevant than &#8216;fast data.&#8217; E-commerce shoppers, streaming media consumers, gamers, stock/crypto traders and enterprise marketeers are demanding fast insights and fast knowledge,&#8221; Jeevankumer told me.</p>
<p>He believes data needs to be analyzed at its source while streaming, and in real-time after a query is created, and that startups that create solutions that allow companies (and baseball teams) to do this will be more successful in the long run.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IBM could be looking to sell the Watson Health division for a mere $1 billion, according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/ibm-tries-to-sell-watson-health-again-82f691a4-ab81-4b2b-a5bb-13a7556c8ef1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Axios report</a>. The question is why is IBM running away from the healthcare vertical just as it seems to be heating up, and for such a low price?</p>
<p>Just last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-snags-cerner-in-28b-mega-deal-to-make-a-big-move-into-healthcare/">Oracle spent $28 billion</a> to buy digital health records company Cerner. Last spring, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">Microsoft spent close to $20 billion</a> to buy Nuance, which is used heavily in the medical industry, boasting 10,000 healthcare customers. That&#8217;s huge money, suggesting that enterprise companies are looking to embrace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-joins-microsoft-in-spending-big-to-dominate-healthcare-vertical/">the healthcare vertical</a> and willing to spend big bucks to do it.</p>
<p>IBM <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2909534/ibm-launches-watson-health-global-analytics-cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched Watson Health in April 2015</a> to much fanfare. It was supposed to take Watson, IBM&#8217;s artificial intelligence platform, and put it to work on healthcare problems. The argument went something like this. Even the best doctor can&#8217;t read all of the literature out there, but a computer can do it quickly, and could come up with suggested courses of action to augment the doctor&#8217;s expertise and produce better outcomes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255245" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It then did what IBM does when it focuses on something. It opened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/10/ibm-watson-health-unit-begins-to-take-shape/">up a fancy headquarters</a> in Cambridge in September that year. It also began announcing partnerships. It checked all the boxes, partnering with the likes of CVS, Apple and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>
<p>Then it started buying companies. The first acquisitions were medical data companies, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/04/13/ibm-acquires-health-tech-startups-explorys-and-phytel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phytel and Explorys</a>. That was part of a pattern. Next came <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/06/ibm-buying-merge-healthcare-for-1b-to-bring-medical-image-analysis-to-watson-health/">$1 billion for Merge Healthcare</a>, a company that would provide medical imaging data. Later it would make its most expensive purchase, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/18/ibm-acquiring-truven-health-analytics-for-2-6-billion-and-adding-it-to-watson-health/">Truven Health Analytics for $2.6 billion</a>. In total it spent $4 billion, according to reports, which seems kind of modest now compared to what Oracle and Microsoft just spent, but it was a lot of money in 2015 and 2016 when it was gearing up.</p>
<p>All of this was about taking a data-centric approach to feed Watson Health&#8217;s machine learning models. For whatever reason, it didn&#8217;t really work as planned, but it was a big part of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/ginni-rometty-leaves-complex-legacy-as-she-steps-away-as-ibm-ceo/"> former CEO Ginni Rometty&#8217;s</a> plan to modernize the company by focusing on areas like cloud and AI.</p>
<p>Rometti was optimistic when she spoke to the <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/dont-try-to-protect-the-past" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard Business Review in 2017</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our moon shot is bringing world-class health care to every corner of the world. Some of that is already happening. Watson is being trained by the best cancer centers in the world and then being rolled out across hundreds of hospitals in China and India. Some of those areas have just one oncologist for maybe 1,600 patients. People in those regions have had no chance of getting world-class health care. Now they can, with Watson as an oncology adviser assisting doctors with decision making. And this is just the start.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Rometti <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/arvind-krishna-will-replace-ginni-rometty-as-ibm-ceo-in-april/">left in 2019</a>, and her replacement, Arvind Krishna, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">has different priorities</a>. He <a href="https://www.axios.com/ibm-tries-to-sell-watson-health-again-82f691a4-ab81-4b2b-a5bb-13a7556c8ef1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Axios</a> that broad healthcare vision might have been too optimistic. That could explain why IBM is looking to get out, Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research tells me.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM is really focussing on its hybrid cloud strategy. In the process it is trying to get rid of all assets that divert attention and capital, as well as carrying the risk of reputational damage. Watson Health certainly qualifies for all three, so it comes as no surprise that IBM may divest the unit,&#8221; Mueller said.</p>
<p>While IBM will likely continue to pursue healthcare business in other ways across the company, even if it ends up dumping Watson Health, it would have to be considered a failed strategy after pouring so much money into it and getting so little back. Of course, it still qualifies as a rumor, even if it wouldn&#8217;t be a huge surprise to see it come to pass.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The US International Trade Commission has <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/system/files/secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_1191_notice01062022sgl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">agreed</a> with Sonos&#8217; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-sonos-sues-google.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">claims</a> that Google had infringed on its speaker and cast patents. It issued its initial decision back in August, and this finalizes its ruling, which prohibits Google from importing products found to have violated Sonos&#8217; intellectual properties. Since Google manufactures its products in China, that means it won&#8217;t be able to gets them shipped to the US when the import ban takes effect in 60 days.</p>
<p>Sonos sued Google in 2020 over five patents, which include one that details a technology allowing wireless speakers to sync with one another. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/technology/google-sonos-patents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Times</em></a> notes, the products affected include Google&#8217;s Home smart speakers, Pixel phones and computers, as well as Chromecast devices. While Google is facing an import ban, a spokesperson said that the tech giant doesn&#8217;t expect the ruling to interrupt its ability to import and sell devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we disagree with today&#8217;s decision, we appreciate that the International Trade Commission has approved our modified designs,&#8221; the spokesperson told <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/google-violated-sonos-patents" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>Protocol</em></a>. &#8220;We will seek further review and continue to defend ourselves against Sonos&#8217; frivolous claims about our partnership and intellectual property.&#8221; The commission didn&#8217;t challenge those alternative designs in its final decision, which means Google can implement them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255254" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In fact, the Nest team has recently <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Upcoming-Speaker-Group-changes/ba-p/77811" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">announced</a> some changes to speaker groups, which it says is &#8220;due to a recent legal ruling.&#8221; The most notable change is that, going forward, users will no longer be able to adjust the volume of all speakers in a group all at once. They&#8217;d have to adjust each speaker individually instead.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sonos Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus admitted that there&#8217;s a possibility that &#8220;Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed.&#8221; However, he said the tech giant&#8217;s products will still &#8220;infringe many dozens of Sonos patents&#8221; — that is, unless Google pays Sonos royalties for its technologies.</p>
<p>His whole statement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We appreciate that the ITC has definitively validated the five Sonos patents at issue in this case and ruled unequivocally that Google infringes all five. That is an across the board win that is surpassingly rare in patent cases and underscores the strength of Sonos’s extensive patent portfolio and the hollowness of Google’s denials of copying. These Sonos patents cover Sonos&#8217; groundbreaking invention of extremely popular home audio features, including the set up for controlling home audio systems, the synchronization of multiple speakers, the independent volume control of different speakers, and the stereo pairing of speakers.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>There is a possibility that Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed. But while Google may sacrifice consumer experience in an attempt to circumvent this importation ban, its products will still infringe many dozens of Sonos patents, its wrongdoing will persist, and the damages owed Sonos will continue to accrue. Alternatively, Google can —as other companies have already done — pay a fair royalty for the technologies it has misappropriated.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">formerly Facebook</a>, is tinkering around with how it tells users about their privacy options. The company has switched up where this information lives and how it&#8217;s explained a number of times over the years and now appears to be centralizing some privacy FAQs and controls in one place across its family of apps.</p>
<p>The new privacy center, called <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/01/introducing-privacy-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Center</a>, is a test available to some U.S.-based Facebook desktop users for now but will roll out to &#8220;more people and apps in the coming months.&#8221; If you&#8217;re in the limited test, you can find the new privacy information center in the Privacy section of the Settings menu. As it stands, privacy settings are divided among Facebook&#8217;s Privacy Shortcuts and Privacy Checkup menus, which are far from ideal but still an improvement over how the platform used to handle these controls.</p>
<p>The new privacy center will break things down into five categories: Security, Sharing, Collection, Use and Ads. Meta is still pushing the idea of &#8220;privacy education&#8221; with the changes, a kind of shorthand way of saying that if you don&#8217;t go to the trouble of sorting through all of this stuff then it&#8217;s on you when the company puts your personal data to good use.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255244" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Facebook has historically offered users byzantine, difficult to navigate privacy controls, often with the most important settings buried in menus. That&#8217;s improved some, but regardless of what it says these days, Meta still has a vested interest in keeping its users sharing as much data as possible. That position is made abundantly clear by the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/apple-privacy-changes-anti-competitive-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conspicuous objections to Apple&#8217;s iOS ad tracking changes</a>, which limited the ability of apps to follow user behavior — a clear win for consumer privacy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not realistic to assume that most people would systemically trudge through this information, but it&#8217;s probably worth knowing where it all lives, just in case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another virtual year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">CES 2022</a> is in the bag for TechCrunch, and even though we attended the event remotely, one thing in the vehicle space was made abundantly clear: Your car is about so much more than mobility. In fact, if you think a vehicle is about getting you from Point A to Point B, think again, peasant! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your car — at least in the eyes of automakers and tech companies — is a third space, a place where you can work or lounge or watch TV. It’s a device, connecting you with the other devices that run your life. It’s an assistant, anticipating your needs by creepily watching you and collecting data on your every movement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big themes this year focused on services and experiences that drivers and passengers can have inside vehicles, the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving features that handle some of the drudgery of driving so you can have those experiences, and the compute power needed to deliver it all. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254886" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there was other vehicle tech that popped up: Who can forget BMW’s color-changing car? NFTs even made an appearance. Here’s the in-vehicle tech that stood out to us. </span></p>
<h2><b>Compute power for the win</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We heard a lot about digital cockpits that transform the front cab into a world of digital content, entertainment and services. Many companies threw around the term “co-pilot” and depending on how that company defined it, the co-pilot could include voice assistants or even actual driver assistance systems that can control certain functions of the vehicles. And there were deep insinuations that one should never, if one can help it, stop watching TV or streaming video – especially not when in a moving vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of that requires processing power and at 2022 CES the automotive chip game was on. </span></p>
<h3><b>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Digital Chassis</b></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2252834" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252834" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2252834" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png" alt="Qualcomm's Snapdragon Digital Chassis render showing advanced connected infotainment system in vehicle" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252834" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm Technologies</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualcomm doubled down on its commitment to powering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/qualcomm-ces-auto-snapdragon-digital-chassis/">automotive in-vehicle tech</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at CES 2022 by bringing on new OEM clients. The tech giant’s Snapdragon Digital Chassis offers automakers a platter of cloud-connected “platforms” consisting of systems-on-a-chip (SoC) and software that can be adopted in full or à la carte. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chassis includes: the Snapdragon Ride Platform for ADAS and automated driving, the Auto Connectivity Platform for LTE, 5G connected services, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precise positioning, and the next generation of the Snapdragon Cockpit, a digital cockpit and infotainment system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo and Honda announced plans to integrate the digital cockpit into upcoming electric vehicles, and Renault, which has already committed to bringing the cockpit into future cars, expanded the partnership to include everything the chassis has to offer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Motors will also be relying on Snapdragon to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/gm-taps-qualcomm-to-power-new-hands-free-driver-assistance-starting-with-cadillac/">power its next-gen ADAS</a>.  </span></p>
<h3><b>Nvidia’s Drive Orin SoC</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Volvo’s infotainment is being powered by Qualcomm’s SoC, its new automated driving (AD) features will be powered by Nvidia’s. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/tusimple-integrates-nvidias-newest-auto-grade-chip-to-scale-autonomous-trucking/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autonomous trucking startup TuSimple also said at CES 2022 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that it would use Drive Orin to power and scale its self-driving tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia’s chip is a central computer for intelligent vehicles that’s made specifically for autonomous applications. It delivers 254 trillion operations per seconds and provides the sort of auto-grade compute power needed to handle self-driving functions. </span></p>
<p>JiDU Auto, Baidu&#8217;s electric vehicle company, also announced it will use the Nvidia Drive Orin SoC (system-on-chip). This next-generation vehicle with Level 4 autonomous driving capability will make its debut at the Beijing Auto Show in April, followed by mass production and delivery by 2023.</p>
<p>Other companies using Drive Orin include Polestar, IM Motors, Li Auto, NIO, R Auto and Xpeng.</p>
<h3>Intel-Mobileye</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary">Intel subsidiary Mobileye announced plans to bring a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/intels-mobileye-autonomous-driving-chip-for-consumer-vehicles/">new supercomputer</a> to market designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers.</p>
<p>The company introduced at the 2022 CES tech trade show a new system-on-chip called EyeQ Ultra that is purpose-built for autonomous driving. The company said the first silicon for the EyeQ Ultra SoC, which is capable of 176 trillion operations per second (TOPS), is expected at the end of 2023 with full automotive grade production in 2025.</p>
<p>The company also introduced at CES its next-generation EyeQ system-on-chip for advanced driver-assistance systems called EyeQ6L and EyeQ6H.</p>
<h2><b>Connected car- connected home &#8211; assistants</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you get when you combine the internet with insane processing power in a vehicle? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sci-fi world of incredible, and some might say unnecessary, tech that lets car owners sync their digital and physical worlds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to program your car to order you a pizza as you leave the office so it’s hot and ready when you get home? It can be done. Feel like hearing the stats on your battery’s power and vehicle range? Speak and it shall be delivered. Want to put your feet up and watch the latest episode of “The Wheel of Time”? There’s a tech for that, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The in-vehicle tech displayed at CES drilled home the idea of the car as a connected device that is meant to make your life easier, smoother and more entertaining. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many cars today run their infotainment systems off of Android’s auto operating system, making it easier to access your phone and compatible apps on your phone from your car. This year, Google took it a few steps further. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/google-home-youtube-integrate-with-volvo-cars/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo and Google announced an integration with the Google Home ecosystem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would allow Volvo car owners to issue voice commands to Google Assistant-enabled devices. They can tell the assistant to do things like turn the car on and off, heat it up or cool it down and provide car info like battery life. Volvo also shared plans to enable YouTube app downloads, thanks to both Google integrations with Volvo vehicles and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon cockpit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google also added features to its digital car key with BMW, which enables users to lock, unlock and start certain BMW cars with select Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones. Now, the car will automatically unlock itself when the device gets close enough, and users can share their digital car key with friends or family. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In previous years at CES, Amazon showed up in a number of vehicles via its virtual assistant Alexa. This year, the power of Alexa is combining with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/amazon-fire-tv-is-coming-to-more-cars-in-2022/">Amazon’s Fire TV streaming platform</a>, which is working its way into more cars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, global automaker Stellantis integrated the Fire TV into its vehicles, and at CES 2022, we’re seeing the in-car entertainment systems of certain Jeep, Chrysler, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/bmw-wants-to-turn-your-car-into-a-rolling-cinema/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Ford vehicles get an upgrade, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire TV for cars will do more than offer a TV streaming platform. It’ll sync with Alexa so drivers and passengers can simply speak a command and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">poof!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Olaf Presents” is playing in the backseat and your children are blessedly quiet. Users can also ask Alexa to show their Ring doorbell video on the Fire TV using voice commands. </span></p>
<p>Stellantis is getting even cozier with Amazon. At CES 2022, Stellantis <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/stellantis-draft/">announced a wide-ranging collaboration</a> that will touch nearly every aspect of its business. Amazon&#8217;s technology will be used to help Stellantis develop vehicles, build connected in-vehicle experiences and train the next generation of automotive software engineers.</p>
<p>As part of this multi-year deal, Stellantis has selected Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms. Stellantis, which recently launched a software academy for existing and new employees, is also working with AWS to create a curriculum that will cover software, data and cloud technology.</p>
<h3><b>Cerence</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software company Cerence unveiled its Cerence Co-Pilot, an in-car assistant that uses continuous learning to anticipate the needs of drivers and proactively initiate actions. The co-pilot is integrated with the car’s sensors and data to understand the environment inside the vehicle and around it, analyzing things like voice, gaze, gesture and touch to understand user preferences and perform actions on the driver’s behalf.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cerence’s co-pilot can do things like control smart home and IoT devices, authorize payments for in-car purchases and remind drivers about car maintenance needs, even scheduling a trip to the shop for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company didn’t share which automakers are signed onto integrate the co-pilot, a video demonstrating the tech showed such brands as Volvo, BMW, Audi and Mercedes, some of which have worked with Cerence in the past. </span></p>
<h3><b>Blackberry </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blackberry announced a partnership with Pateo, an internet-of-vehicles service and product provider in China, that will see Blackberry Ivy, the company’s intelligent vehicle data platform co-developed with Amazon Web Services, integrated into Pateo’s digital cockpit solution. The two companies are to work with an unnamed Chinese automaker to pilot the cockpit on its electric model lineup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software company most renowned for its mobile phones didn’t share much about what that cockpit would look like, but it should encompass such features as intelligent voice, entertainment, vehicle health monitoring, secure payment and cloud technology. Blackberry and Pateo will also incorporate Electra Vehicles’s EVE-Ai 360 Adaptive Controls that provides prediction of battery state of charge, state of health and project vehicle range. </span></p>
<h2><b>ADAS/AD</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In past years, autonomous driving took center stage. This year, the focus was more on advanced driver assistance systems and promises to bring restricted automated driving features to passenger vehicles. Due to the advancements in vehicle sensors, compute power and software, automakers are working to automate certain aspects of the car, like parking or highway driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn’t mean some companies pursuing so-called Level 4 autonomous driving didn’t show up at CES; they just weren’t the ones yelling the loudest this year. </span></p>
<h3><b>GM’s Ultra Cruise </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, GM’s new Ultra Cruise hands-free ADAS system will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon SoC. GM introduced the Ultra Cruise system in 2021, but this was the first time we heard more details about the compute and some of the capabilities.<br />
The system is an upgrade from the automaker’s Super Cruise ADAS first introduced in 2017, and it’s expected to be able to handle 95% of all driving scenarios. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultra Cruise, which is coming to the new electric Cadillac Celestiq in 2023, will rely on sensors like cameras, radar and lidar (not just lidar map data) to feed data to GM’s software that will then output decisions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Volvo’s Ride Pilot</b></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2253530" style="width: 953px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253530" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2253530" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png" alt="Volvo Cars Concept Recharge showing autonomous vehicle using lidar" width="943" height="363" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png 943w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png?resize=150,58 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png?resize=300,115 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png?resize=768,296 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png?resize=680,262 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253530" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Volvo Cars</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo shared plans to work with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/volvo-partners-with-luminar-and-zenseact-to-bring-autonomous-driving-feature-to-new-e-suv/">lidar company Luminar</a> and AD software company Zenseact to introduce Ride Pilot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an add-on subscription to an electric SUV that will be revealed later this year. Ride Pilot is an “unsupervised” AD feature, meaning it can drive itself fully while drivers are on certain highways, giving them the ability to go completely hands and eyes free so they can enjoy other activities, like the YouTube watching we mentioned earlier. </span></p>
<h3><b>JiDU</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese internet giant Baidu’s EV startup JiDU </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">came to CES 2022 with news that it would power its first production EV model, which is expected to begin deliveries in 2023, on Nvidia’s Drive Orin SoC (as mentioned above). The company said it would have Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, all of which would be revealed in April at the Beijing Auto Show.</span></p>
<p>JiDu is just a year old and recently demonstrated intelligent assisted driving in both urban and high-speed areas in its SIMUCar.</p>
<h3><b>Cadillac</b></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2254175" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254175" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2254175" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg" alt="Cadillac autonomous lounge concept innerspace" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254175" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cadillac</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not entirely focused on autonomous driving capabilities or ADAS features, it’s worth noting how </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/cadillacs-new-self-driving-concept-is-a-luxury-loveseat-on-wheels/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cadillac envisions the inside of its future autonomous vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its InnerSpace concept shows your standard spaceship-looking two-seater car from the outside, while inside it still looks like a spaceship. But like a sexy spaceship.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than separate driver and passenger seats, there’s a plush and sleek loveseat that appears to constantly be in recline mode, which checks out given the built-in ottoman and compartment for slippers and a blanket. A mere couple of feet in front of the passengers’ heads is a wide, curved screen. No steering wheels or pedals are featured.</span></p>
<h3>Indy Autonomous Challenge</h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/racer1.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone wp-image-2255223 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/racer1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="422" /></a></p>
<p>Last October, teams from around world converged on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to demonstrate autonomous racing.</p>
<p>The teams gathered again, this time at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Jan. 7 with the Autonomous Challenge @ CES. IAC university teams developed the software that runs the autonomous racecar, the Dallara AV-21.</p>
<p>Leading up to the event, the organization published a few videos, including this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVF_JVhOrU4">one that was filmed at night</a>.</p>
<h3>Gentex</h3>
<p>Gentex, which supplies automotive and aerospace sectors, showed off the results of two acquisitions in 2021: Israel-based Guardian Optical Technologies and Vaposens.</p>
<p>The company showed a lot, but its ultra sensitive driver monitoring system that is designed to be used to support driver assistance systems got our attention. Guardian Optical Technologies developed an infrared-sensitive, high-resolution camera combining machine vision, depth perception and micro-vibration detection. What this means is its proprietary sensor<br />
configuration can monitor the entire vehicle cabin and all its objects and occupants, assessing their behavior, gestures, and activities.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_2255174" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255174" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2255174 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg" alt="Vinfast CES 2022 electric vehicles" width="1600" height="1066" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2255174" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vinfast</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to revealing three new EVs at CES this year, Vietnamese EV company </span><b>Vinfast</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced the formation of its Early Bird reservation site. The first to pre-order will receive a “VinFirst” certificate on the blockchain platform in NFT form, which the company says is a completely transparent way to prove ownership of an order number. </span></p>
<p>The term &#8220;digital twin&#8221; popped up a few times in the automotive sector at CES 2022, including an announcement from Cerence and Vinfast. The gist is this: Cerence has cloud-based software that allows Vinfast (or any other company intrigued by the product) to create a virtual representation of its entire car, including software, mechanics, electrics, and physical behavior, along with driver data and environmental data.</p>
<h3>Indi EV</h3>
<p><b>Indi EV</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a California-based EV startup, came out with a prototype of its Indi One at CES, which the company says is “the world’s first social media-oriented car.” What that seems to mean is a car that has an integrated computer for gaming, a complete Windows workstation that can handle Zoom calls and even record events that can later be shared on social media and software that lets riders capture trip content and video to be uploaded to the cloud. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all that wasn’t enough, the Indi One is meant to enable a type of mobile blockchain, wherein each vehicle can act as a node for a blockchain. Exactly why that’s significant is unclear, but You Do You, Indi EV. Customers can start pre-ordering by the end of Q1, and the car is expected to go for around $45,000. </span></p>
<h3>BMW</h3>
<p>BMW <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/bmw-shows-off-a-color-changing-car/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unwrapped its color-changing car at CES, the BMW iX Flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Right now, the e-paper wrapping the vehicle can only change between black and white, but more colors are expected in the future which will enable users to give their car a more personalized look to match their mood. </span></p>

<h3>Nextbase</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dash cam tech company </span>Nextbase<span style="font-weight: 400;"> unveiled its smart and connected dash cam, the Nextbase iQ. It gives drivers a lot of the same safety and security features they would get in their home-monitoring systems, like real-time alerts and access to incident video even while they’re away from their car. Users can also get real-time access to the dash cam from anywhere at anytime through the iQ app. </span></p>
<h3>Mercedes-Benz</h3>
<p>Finally, Mercedes revealed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/mercedes-benzs-vision-for-the-future-is-an-ultra-efficient-luxury-620-mile-range-ev/">Vision EQXX</a>, a concept vehicle that is meant to showcase what the automaker&#8217;s electric future will look like. This eye-popping sport EV wasn&#8217;t just about aerodynamics and a sleek design. The company squeezed in power, efficiency and range into the compact and sporty package.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252520" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252520" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2252520 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg" alt="Mercedes-Benz VISION EQXX CES" width="2000" height="1250" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2252520" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-Benz reveals the VISION EQXX interior.</p></div></p>
<p>Some of the neat tech in the EQXX worth noting is the one-piece 47.5-inch LED display with 8K resolution. The infotainment screen has responsive real-time graphics that will span the width of the vehicle, according to Mercedes.</p>
<p>The automaker worked with NAVIS Automotive Systems to develop a 3D navigation system that users can zoom into and scroll around for this massive screen. And like the company&#8217;s newer models, the EQXX also featured an advanced voice assistant and software that learns your behavior over time.</p>
<h2>Lidar companies try to make a concrete value prop</h2>
<p>In the lidar world, Luminar&#8217;s eyebrow-raising stunt comparing Tesla&#8217;s ADAS system to its own (to the peril of several child-size dummies) was affecting, and its inclusion in Volvo vehicles and Mobileye systems is a coup. But it&#8217;s still an expensive and complex system, a major investment with uncertain (if potentially significant) benefits.</p>

<p>Manufacturers are struggling to produce something that creates a useful outcome for a vehicle at a reasonable price. Costs haven&#8217;t come down as much as they&#8217;d like, and there&#8217;s still confusion over who does what in a perception stack.</p>
<p>Blickfeld is attempting to take over as much as possible, for instance, with on-device movement detection, object classification and so on, which could make their devices easier to drop in — or possibly make them partially redundant with an already intelligent in-car computer vision system.</p>
<p>Arbe is focusing more narrowly on what it calls &#8220;free space mapping,&#8221; where it doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s a bush or a raccoon or what — the question is, is it safe to drive on? A quick, dedicated sensor for identifying driveable surfaces in the vicinity could be a useful feature and one that contributes to the autonomous vehicle collective intelligence.</p>
<p>Innoviz is improving on the traditional spinning puck lidar type, which has proven to be useful in many circumstances. A cheaper, better version may find success where trailblazer Velodyne has over the years.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/voyant-raises-15m-to-scale-production-of-its-tiny-inexpensive-lidar-tech/">Voyant Photonics</a> is leaving the whole automotive market to deeper pockets, focusing on producing its tiny, inexpensive lidar unit for robotics and industrial applications, where certifications and liabilities aren&#8217;t quite so intense.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no doubt lidar has a future in autonomous vehicles and other equipment, but what form it will take and how much people will pay for it — that&#8217;s still very much up in the air, something that no doubt makes everyone in the sector a little nervous.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Launching a business is hard enough, but scaling it to a successful and lucrative exit is even more difficult. Securing early-stage venture financing is usually the best way to accelerate and sustain growth, but with various funding options available, how do you figure out the best course of action? What is the best alternative to VC, and at what point in your company’s growth do other funding sources make sense?</p>
<p>Choosing the right financing partner can be tedious, as they need to align with your mission, values and objectives. Otherwise, you get stuck in a relationship that doesn’t align with your goals and may lead you ending up with lower ownership than expected.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a rundown of how alternative financing came to be, how it can benefit high-growth SaaS startups and how to know if it’s right for you.</p>
<h2>The evolution of alternative financing</h2>
<p>There is a dearth of non-dilutive financing options for growth-stage, recurring-revenue businesses. We’ve found that traditional sources of debt capital (such as banks) simply prefer to provide debt to asset-heavy businesses where collateral can be secured.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Every dollar sitting dormant in a savings account or any traditional short-term/liquid debt instrument is vulnerable to a real loss in value as inflation skyrockets.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When it comes to SaaS or asset-light business models, there simply isn’t an asset base to collateralize, which makes traditional debt providers uncomfortable. Moreover, while subscription or recurring revenue business models aren’t technically new, they have been undersupported. SaaS companies can often only look to traditional banks for financing after achieving profitability and/or receiving institutional venture capital backing.</p>
<p>This rules-based approach is pragmatic, but results in a massive gap in the market for early-stage companies that have achieved product-market fit and serious revenue traction. If they don’t fit the &#8220;checklist,&#8221; they simply get thrown into the backlog until all the boxes can be checked off, regardless of the underlying traction.</p>
<h2>Revenue financing</h2>
<p>Revenue financing allows founders to have more control over their decisions without compromising board seats. SaaS companies can especially benefit from this model, as it advances future revenue from customers who are already signed up.</p>
<p>Revenue financing enables companies on a healthy growth trajectory to instantly access future cash flows from their customers’ monthly payments. Another benefit is that the borrowers’ credit limits can adjust according to their monthly expected growth, and they can draw funds when they need them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The conservative social media platform Parler has raised $20 million in funding, according to an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001902750/000190275022000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC filing</a> that was signed and submitted on January 6, the anniversary of last year&#8217;s domestic attack on the Capitol. The app, which <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/parler-expands-business-into-decentralized-technology-301448129.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims to have</a> 16 million-plus registered users, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/parler-expands-business-into-decentralized-technology-301448129.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describes</a> its mission as one focusing on protecting &#8220;against the authoritarian powers of Big Tech, Big Government, and cancel culture.&#8221; The app also claims to be <a href="https://parler.com/documents/guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nonpartisan</a>, but anti-hate organizations and researchers including the <a href="https://www.adl.org/blog/parler-where-the-mainstream-mingles-with-the-extreme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anti-Defamation League</a> and the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2021/01/08/far-right-insurrectionists-organized-capitol-siege-parler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> have observed Parler’s influence in the far-right information ecosystem, from its role in the Capitol insurrection to propagating <a href="https://news.ku.edu/2021/06/01/study-parler-provided-echo-chamber-vaccine-misinformation-conspiracy-theories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-vaccine misinformation</a>.</p>
<p>Parler hasn&#8217;t responded to a request for comment about who its new investors are, but the filing states there are 10 non-accredited investors in the offering. Its previous angel round &#8212; an undisclosed amount &#8212; came from major Republican political <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/media/rebekah-mercer-parler/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donor Rebekah Mercer</a>. Mercer is listed as both an executive officer and director on the filing. Seth Dillon, CEO of conservative satire site the Babylon Bee, is also listed as a director.</p>
<p>The filing was first spotted by <a href="https://www.axios.com/social-media-app-parler-raises-20-million-7c8ca6e6-63ba-4149-a08d-5fbf59be87b0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a>, which also has not yet received a comment from Parler.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255061" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Parler came to prominence last year around the time of the January 6 insurrection, after social media companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">Facebook</a> banned former President Donald Trump from their platforms. These bans &#8212; enforced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/23/twitter-hides-trump-tweet-behind-notice-for-potentially-dissuading-people-from-voting/">after</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/coronavirus-protests-trump-liberate-minnesota-tweets-facebook-twitter/">repeated</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/trump-flu-covid-misinformation-facebook-and-twitter/">warnings</a> &#8212; were over concerns that Trump was using his following to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/why-twitter-banned-president-trump/">disrupt</a> the peaceful transition of presidential power.</p>
<p>Inspired by Trump&#8217;s de-platforming from mainstream social platforms, many of his supporters flocked to Parler, which had <a href="https://parler.com/documents/guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less stringent</a> community guidelines. Parler <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-jumps-to-no-1-on-app-store-after-facebook-and-twitter-bans/">rose to No. 1</a> on the App Store days after the attack on the U.S. Capitol but had found itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">removed</a> from Google Play on January 8, 2021. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">Apple</a> soon removed Parler from their platforms as well, over terms of service violations. The companies said the app had been used by Trump supporters and other far-right users<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/01/06/trump-riot-twitter-parler-proud-boys-boogaloos-antifa-qanon/6570794002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> to call for violence </a>and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/trump-rioters-planned-online?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organize their plans</a> to storm the Capitol.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety. We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues,&#8221; Apple told TechCrunch at the time of the ban.</p>
<p>Parler&#8217;s then-CEO John Matze posted on his Parler account that it wouldn&#8217;t cooperate with the App Store&#8217;s demands for the company to submit a content moderation improvement plan. But on January 29, he was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-parler-ceo/parler-ceo-john-matze-says-he-was-fired-by-board-idUSKBN2A33B0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fired</a> by Parler&#8217;s board, controlled by Mercer. By April, the app was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-parler-ceo/parler-ceo-john-matze-says-he-was-fired-by-board-idUSKBN2A33B0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in the App Store</a> under new leadership from CEO George Farmer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Farmer explained in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-george-farmer.html?showTranscript=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent interview with The New York Times</a> that when Parler was removed from the App Store before his tenure, the app didn&#8217;t have any AI moderation, and its mechanism for human moderation &#8212; a jury system &#8212; was in its early stages, too.</p>
<p>Farmer said that under his leadership, Parler has implemented AI content moderation, which it didn&#8217;t have at the time of its removal from the app store. This additional infusion of $20 million could help the app continue building out this filtering technology, which Parler uses in tandem with human moderation. Parler&#8217;s community guidelines also now state that the app will &#8220;not knowingly allow itself to be used as a tool for crime, civil torts, or other unlawful acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parler&#8217;s mobile app has been downloaded about 11.3 million times globally since its debut, according to data from Sensor Tower. From Parler&#8217;s May 2021 return to the App Store until now, the app has been downloaded just 141,000 times, the firm noted. If Parler&#8217;s stated figure of 16 million+ registered users is accurate, that would mean the majority access Parler via its native mobile app.</p>
<p>Parler may soon have new competition in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/trump-launches-his-own-social-media-platform-truth-social/"> TRUTH Social</a>, Trump&#8217;s own social network that&#8217;s expected to launch on February 21, President&#8217;s Day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data privacy is top of mind for online sellers, and for good reason: Regulators in China, Europe and North America are taking an interest, and iOS 14.5 allowed many consumers to disable data tracking, with negative consequences for companies that relied on Facebook&#8217;s granular ad targeting.</p>
<p>Bearing those factors and others in mind, Ben Parr, president and co-founder of e-commerce marketing platform Octane.ai, shared <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/4-trends-that-will-define-e-commerce-in-2022/">his e-commerce predictions for 2022</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personalization and zero-party data become critical.</li>
<li>E-commerce embraces web3 and NFTs, but what will that look like?</li>
<li>Live shopping goes mainstream.</li>
<li>Slow but gradual improvement to the supply chain.</li>

<p>If you manage an e-commerce startup&#8217;s brand, this is a helpful overview; Parr even weighs in on whether startups need to begin putting NFTs on their virtual shelves this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m also eager to see brands utilize tokens for loyalty and rewards, a topic I’ve heard people discuss but not yet embrace.&#8221;</p>
<p>My prediction: We&#8217;ll be running many articles in 2022 with tactics for zero-party data collection. Google temporarily postponed its plan to deprecate third-party cookies until the latter half of 2023, which means the ad tech landscape is going to undergo tectonic shifts.</p>
<p>We have more expert-written posts with 2022 predictions in the pipeline, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading,</p>

<p>NFT marketplace OpenSea’s valuation has skyrocketed, but at $13.3 billion, its revenue multiple isn&#8217;t very high when compared with other software companies, writes Alex Wilhelm in The Exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears that the new OpenSea valuation is cheap compared to recent fundamentals, but a little expensive when we consider how much its market booms and busts.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is a fantastic time to launch a startup, but if you&#8217;re trying to grow one — well, winter is coming.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already noted the impacts of new data regulations and consumers&#8217; growing desire for more privacy, but here&#8217;s another log to toss on the bad news fire: As a percentage of company revenue, marketing budgets plummeted from 11% in 2020 to 6.4% last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the lowest proportion allocated to marketing in the history of Gartner’s Annual CMO Spend Survey,&#8221; the research company reported.</p>
<p>Rebecca Lynn, co-founder and general partner at Canvas Ventures, has had dozens of conversations with early-stage founders in recent months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a TechCrunch+ guest post, she covers the &#8220;downward pressure on the efficiency of marketing dollars&#8221; and shares several strategies that are producing results — as well as some &#8220;crazy&#8221; ideas &#8220;that seemed ridiculous at the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a startup with relatively good financial performance, consumer financial service startup Dave could have bided its time for an initial public offering. Instead, it chose the SPAC route.</p>
<p>While the decision brought benefits, the fact that a cohort of less-than-stellar SPAC listings debuted at the same time brought some troubles as well, said CEO and co-founder Jason Wilk.</p>
<p>“If I could have done it all over again, I guess it would have been the same price discovery and guaranteed capital without the name SPAC associated with it, just because it’s been unfair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our latest guest column with predictions for the coming year doesn’t just prognosticate: Growth expert Jonathan Martinez shares several tactics early-stage companies can use to capitalize on these trends.</p>
<p>Among other topics, Martinez shared methods for incrementally testing ads, his ideas about video ads and influencer marketing, and a few thoughts about Facebook and iOS 14 privacy changes.</p>
<p>“I believe we’ll start seeing heavy investments by Facebook and other social media platforms to keep users on their platforms, where they will still have access to first-party data,” writes Martinez.</p>

<p>Digital advertising has changed a lot in the past year, and it’s bound to change further when Google blocks third-party cookies from Chrome next year.</p>
<p>For publishers, it means advertising dollars should be spent wisely on strategies that maximize ad monetization without relying on old methods, writes James Avery, founder and CEO of Kevel.</p>
<p>In a deep dive of the changing ad world, Avery explains how publishers will have to prioritize first-party data to gather user insights, the importance of walled garden ad solutions, and why unified IDs are unsustainable in the long term.</p>

<p>Public software stocks have lost a fair bit of value so far this year, but startup valuations continue to climb higher, seemingly unaffected by the markets’ declining opinion, writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>“Startups had best hope that private investors are right to index heavily on nascent growth rates over other traditional private-market metrics.</p>
<p>If not, everyone is going to be left holding some part of the bag when later rounds don’t consummate at higher prices.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Much of Chinese society has come to depend on so-called super apps like WeChat to do multiple tasks, from making a medical appointment to hailing a taxi to getting a loan, all on one platform.</p>
<p>But such one-stop shops have not taken off in the United States. Now, the time may finally be ripe &#8212; and the best contenders for super apps come from the fintech world, especially those platforms dedicated to cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is quickly growing in popularity amid sky-high equity prices, record-low interest rates and fear of inflation on the horizon, and they could, perhaps, gain more legitimacy if the U.S. government decides to fully regulate them, a topic<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/business/house-financial-services-crypto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Congress is currently exploring</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254631" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Dedicated crypto platforms like Coinbase or even Paypal, Venmo and Stripe, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/payments-giant-stripe-says-its-re-entering-the-crypto-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which recently</a> added abilities to use crypto for payments, could evolve into the U.S. versions of super apps, assuming crypto issuers can work with regulators to find a middle ground between protecting the consumer and creating new financial and investment opportunities. If consumers see crypto as secure and legitimate — and easy to use — it could become the base of super apps.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The bottom line is that people are thinking about finance not just when they go to the bank — if they even have access to a bank — but when they shop, vacation or pay for a medical visit.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Expanding these crypto and payment apps to integrate with other apps and services would make many diverse tasks more convenient. The bottom line is that people are thinking about finance not just when they go to the bank — if they even have access to a bank — but when they shop, vacation or pay for a medical visit, and such apps would help deliver the financial services they need in a personalized manner.</p>
<p>Integrating crypto payments into other tasks would also go a long way in democratizing the world of finance and money, giving underserved communities and those with no credit histories who struggle to open credit cards or get loans more access to financial services.</p>
<h2>The rise of the super app</h2>
<p>WeChat started out as a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55929418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messaging app in China</a> in 2011, but by 2013 it also functioned as a <a href="https://www.cgap.org/research/publication/china-digital-payments-revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">payment platform</a> and soon offered many other services, like shopping, food delivery and taxi-hailing.</p>
<p>Now it offers more than a million different services, mainly through mini apps that businesses develop to work within WeChat. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55929418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AliPay</a>, which also has more than a billion users, is similar. These two apps have been credited over the last decade with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/technology/alipay-china.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">converting China from a cash-only economy</a> to one heavily reliant on digital payments, skipping over the intermediary phase of debit and credit cards.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The concept has also become popular in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/southeast-asias-battle-of-the-40-billion-superapps-11621332418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indonesia</a> and elsewhere in the region. The fact that they involve financial services, including payment options, is key, and the common thread that runs through many of the super apps’ services.</p>
<p>But while app use has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">exploded</a> in the United States and Europe; Big Tech players like Apple, Facebook and Google have added payment services; and several payment apps like Venmo and Square have become more popular, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/07/16/what-is-a-super-app-and-why-havent-they-gone-global.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super apps have not yet emerged</a>.</p>
<p>This is partly because of data privacy regulations; privacy laws in the United States, and especially in Europe, limit data shared between apps, making it harder to create an ecosystem where mini apps can automatically integrate into super apps like Alipay.</p>
<p>It also stems from the U.S. having had a well-developed internet ecosystem, with popular social media sites, like Facebook, and payment sites, like PayPal, existing before the rise of smartphones, which resulted in each of these platforms launching separate apps, rather than one app offering multiple services. Compare that with China, where <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/why-chinas-super-apps-will-never-succeed-in-the-us-64c686c8c5d6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much of the internet was mobile-first,</a> arising only after the advent of smartphones. The U.S. market has long been used to separate platforms for separate tasks.</p>
<p>But many analysts point to apps and tech companies adding more services — like TikTok adding shopping, Snapchat integrating mini apps for games or Apple entering the payment space — and say that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22738395/social-media-super-app-facebook-wechat-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super apps will eventually emerge</a> in the U.S., or at least bigger apps that can do more things. Adding more services to any one app, and finding a way to keep users on it, is also a way around privacy regulations that prevent one app from knowing what its users do on another app.</p>
<p>Apps are clearly on track to get bigger and more comprehensive, even though it is unlikely the U.S. would end up with only one or two dominant ones, as seen in Asian markets.</p>
<h2>The rise of DeFi</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, cryptocurrency developed alongside payment apps and super apps over the last decade. What started out as one product, Bitcoin, has developed into an <a href="https://qz.com/2065446/everything-you-need-to-know-about-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entire peer-to-peer financial system, known as DeFi,</a> with several currencies, including Ethereum and Dogecoin, allowing users to invest, trade, spend and lend out money.</p>
<p>But despite its surge in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/13percent-of-americans-traded-crypto-in-the-past-year-survey-finds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popularity</a>, especially during the economic uncertainty posed by the COVID pandemic, and more<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/08/visa-launches-crypto-consulting-services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> traditional financial institutions starting to offer some crypto-related services</a>, it remains <a href="https://www.ft.com/crypto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside the mainstream financial system and sector,</a> with many experts saying it poses high risks. Crypto issuers have also long resisted regulation, as that would go against their goal of having a decentralized financial product.</p>
<p>But now things are starting to change, with some crypto platforms expressing interest in following regulation.</p>
<p>For example, Coinbase <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/20/coinbase-drops-plans-to-launch-interest-product-as-regulatory-tension-around-stablecoins-runs-high.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped a plan to offer an interest-earning product, which would have allowed users to earn interest on coins loaned out to others,</a> after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission failed to offer guidance on it and threatened to sue Coinbase if it released it. In fact, <a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/crypto-regulation-talks-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto issuers are realizing that some regulation would give their product more legitimacy</a> and allow more people to use it for more purposes. This comes as new crypto products hit the market recently, including stable coins, which track the value of traditional currencies.</p>
<p>Regulation of crypto, an idea that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-chief-gary-gensler-braces-for-clash-with-crypto-traders-11628164980" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC Chairman Gary Gensler</a> has said he supports, along with some in Congress and some in the crypto industry, could indeed be on the horizon.</p>
<h2>Using cryptocurrency to fuel the first U.S. super app</h2>
<p>If crypto issuers work with government officials to set up regulation that protects consumers without limiting innovation, crypto is a good bet for what finally spurs American super apps.</p>
<p>Think about what could happen if Coinbase were to work with the SEC and align on smart regulation that would validate Coinbase as a viable and certified financial intermediary that users could rely on for crypto, embracing both its new financial products with potentially attractive yields in addition to its ability to use for everyday spending. Regulation would likely stabilize the currencies, turning them into something practical to shop with, rather than just hold for potential value. Such regulations would also eliminate some of the steps that add friction to current user experiences when it comes to using crypto in everyday life, like <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-brutal-truth-about-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long transaction times, high transaction fees</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/bitcoin-btc-flaws-set-stage-for-alternative-professor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large fluctuations in its value.</a></p>
<p>A regulatory framework would unlock massive demand for crypto, and there would suddenly be many businesses — from restaurants to retail – that would want a way to process crypto payments, spurring them to integrate into existing crypto payment apps and causing those to evolve into super apps. More people would also make deposits in crypto on these apps, rather than using traditional currencies in their banks. This would disrupt the entire economy and financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>Banks have always produced products they think the public <em>wants</em> while the world of crypto and DeFi are clearly providing products and services that people <em>need, </em>and millions are already using them, despite their uncertain regulatory and legal status.</p>
<p>Just as ubiquitous and integrated digital payments quickly emerged in China to fill a need — a cash alternative in a market underserved by credit cards — crypto-based super apps would fulfill the needs of consumers and businesses looking for a secure and efficient way to use crypto instead of, or in addition to, traditional payment methods.</p>
<p>If crypto remains an unregulated gray zone, and its platforms remain isolated from the rest of economic and daily life, rather than evolve into super apps, the United States will miss the opportunity to build a new and innovative mobile- and digital-first financial ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s antitrust watchdog has ordered an investigation into Google following complaints from news publishers who allege that the search giant is “abusing” its dominance in news aggregation to impose unfair conditions on the outlets.</p>
<p>The Competition Commission of India said Friday that Google dominates certain online services and its initial view is that Google has broken the local antitrust laws and pointed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/google-france-antitrust-news-litigation-settlement-offer/">new rules</a> in France and Australia, where the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">has been asked</a> to enter into “fair/good faith negotiation” with news publishers for paid licensing of content to address the “bargaining power imbalance between the two and the resultant imposition of unfair conditions by Google.”</p>
<p>“The allegations of the informant, when seen in this vertically integrated ecosystem operated by Google, makes it prima facie appear that news publishers have no choice but to accept the terms and conditions imposed by Google. Google appears to operate as a gateway between various news publishers on the one hand and news readers on the other. Another alternative for the news publisher is to forgo the traffic generated by Google for them, which would be unfavourable to their revenue generation,” the CCI said in its 21-page order.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255191" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The probe follows a complaint from Digital News Publishers Association, which consists of the digital arms of some of India’s biggest media firms. The association said their members get more than half of their traffic from online search engines, a category Google clearly commands, and the market-leading position has allowed Google to force the publishers into several unfavorable terms.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging complaint, the association said Google displaying snippets of news items limits the number of visitors to news outlets and impacts the ad revenue “while Google continue[s] to earn ad revenue on its result page&#8221; as well as enriches &#8220;its search algorithm resulting from the volume of search queries.”</p>
<p>“It has also been averred that the terms of the agreements entered between the members of the Informant [news publishers] and the OPs [Google and its subsidiaries] for sharing the advertisement revenues are unilaterally and arbitrarily dictated by the OPs, and the members of the Informant have no other option but to accept the terms, as they are, with no bargaining power whatsoever,” the watchdog said.</p>
<p>“The only alternate to the AMP system is for publishers to subscribe with Google, which benefits Google, to the detriment of the publishers,” the watchdog said. The association accused that Google is forcing them to use its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/google-am-baidu-sogou/">AMP format</a>, which has implications on their revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Google spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a well-functioning democracy, the critical role played by news media cannot be undermined, and it needs to be ensured that digital gatekeeper firms do not abuse their dominant position to harm the competitive process of determining a fair distribution of revenue amongst all stakeholders,&#8221; the watchdog added.</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s investigation is the latest of a series of probes the Indian competition watchdog has ordered in recent weeks. Late last year, the CCI ordered an investigation into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/31/india-antitrust-watchdog-orders-investigation-into-apples-business-practices/">how Apple runs its App Store</a>, becoming the most recent country to take aim at the American technology giant.</p>

<p>In 1992, Ward Cunningham coined the metaphor &#8220;technical debt&#8221; to highlight how businesses weigh their short-term gains against the long-term viability of a software product. Business dynamics have evolved a lot since then, but the metaphor still works.</p>
<p>Favoring a short-term plan to get a faster go-to-market option is not always bad, provided the business has a backup plan to deliver well-designed code that would simplify future iterations and innovations.</p>
<p>But for startups, reworking is difficult as deadlines and resource crunch prevent developers from producing clean and perfect code. Startups prioritize short-term plans and focus more on adding functionalities to achieve milestones, sign up marquee customers or raise funding. This roadmap shuffling and disregard for the long-term view trigger tech debt.</p>
<p>I have worked closely with more than 25 startups and learned a lot from their journey from early-stage to growth stage. I have realized that avoiding tech debts becomes easier with some ground rules.</p>
<p>Here are four rules that startups should follow to avoid tech debt:</p>
<h2>Don’t let specific implementations continue for over three months</h2>
<p>Startups often try to customize their product to meet their marquee customers’ demands. Sometimes this leads to two products — a generalized version and a customer-specific one, and converging them becomes difficult over time.</p>
<p>To stay on track, companies start cutting corners, which destabilizes the product. I have seen engineering teams work on customization for a whole year and then lose 20 months in merging and stabilizing the core product.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The foundation of any software product is directly responsible for better scaling and maintainability.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	Startups generally work with an 18-24 month runway before they raise the next level of funding. If they rework to generalize features, they could lose a costly quarter to stabilization.</p>
<h3>What to do:</h3>
<p>When teams work on custom features for more than the specified timeline, merging them back with the core product becomes complex. It is better to acknowledge that products cannot be customer-specific at the very beginning. Startups should consider the platform and think about future maintainability upfront.</p>

		Arthur Woods is the co-founder of <a href="https://www.mathison.io/">Mathison</a>, a venture-backed technology platform equipping employers with everything they need to manage their diversity hiring efforts. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">We find ourselves amid the largest talent shortage in history after a year in which countless organizations voiced their commitments to diversity. Yet few have made much progress &#8212; and 76% of <a href="https://joshbersin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/202102-DEI-Report_Final_V2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organizations</a> have still not set diversity goals for 2022.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, we’ve been <a href="http://hiringfordiversity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studying the hiring practices</a> of hundreds of employers and written about the <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/09/the-great-resignation-doesnt-have-to-threaten-your-dei-efforts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impact of the Great Resignation on DEI</a>. We’ve found a consistent pattern across the board: Employers are anchoring the focus to lagging indicators around diversity that won’t influence any change.</p>
<h2>What are the missing metrics for DEI?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, organizations have focused their DEI efforts — including goals and measurements — on increasing diversity and a sense of belonging on their teams.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250811" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The challenge? These two metrics are centered completely around end outcomes without accounting for the actual activities necessary to achieve them. Most organizations are missing a theory of change for their diversity efforts to account for what actions need to happen to move the needle in a meaningful way. This depends on answering two new questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are our systems equitable?</strong> This is the extent to which our processes are fair, consistent and accessible for everyone, directly impacting whether people advance.</li>
<li><strong>Are our people aware, engaged and accountable for DEI? </strong>This is the collective awareness, engagement and accountability for DEI across our teams.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Putting these new metrics into practice</h2>
<p>It is clear that the challenges are daunting and creating roadblocks to change, but for those who want to be part of the 24% setting diversity goals this year, here are three key areas that can help transform the landscape for DEI in 2022:</p>
<h3>Measure the current state of diversity to learn where to focus your goals</h3>
<p>Organizations often set unrealistic DEI goals — either too ambitious or not challenging enough. Before you create your DEI goals, you’ll have to figure out where you have gaps and what you should prioritize.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assess your existing organizational policies and practices to determine where you have gaps or potential for bias by walking through the candidate and employee journey. Solutions like our <a href="https://www.mathison.io/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equal Hiring Index</a> can help you gain a complete picture in these areas.</li>
<li>Examine the current diversity representation of your existing team and the extent to which your team is included and engaged in DEI efforts through an anonymous survey.</li>
<li>Use the combined insights above to determine up to five areas where you have the most opportunity to improve.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ensure your DEI goals holistically account for diversity, equity and inclusion</h3>
<p>Since employers typically only center their DEI goals around increasing representation, ensure your goals are holistic to also account for your people, processes and representation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>Identify your greatest gaps and opportunities in improving the equity and accessibility in your hiring and talent process.</li>
<li>Identify the critical path in your team’s involvement in this effort, starting with awareness and followed by being equipped, engaged and accountable.</li>
<li>Identify where you have the greatest opportunity to increase representation: You may choose to address this goal with a framework or process-based goal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bring your team on board from the beginning</h3>
<p>In the spirit of the true inclusion of your team in these goals, you will want to ensure they are part of building them from the start. This is how you’ll create excitement and accountability around reaching these goals. Here are some ways to bring your team on board in the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create shared ownership by including your team in goal-setting meetings and conversations, whether through direct involvement or through working groups.</li>
<li>Listen to your team’s vision for DEI and be sure to engage your existing employee resource groups or diversity councils, if you have them, and learn where their passions lie.</li>
<li>Create a system to track and report DEI progress.</li>
<li>Make reports and goals available to employees and stakeholders.</li>
<li>Make goals and data available to everyone internally and, if possible, share externally.</li>
<li>Distribute DEI accountability across the whole organization.</li>
<li>Reward your team for hitting DEI milestones.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A call to action for 2022</h2>
<p>As the saying goes, we can’t manage what we can’t measure. As we step back to consider our diversity efforts, it’s clear that measuring outcomes alone doesn’t ensure we make progress on them. Instead, we need to focus on the actual activities necessary to drive the change we want to see &#8212; the equity of our systems and inclusion of our people.</p>
<p>With the new year beginning, this is the perfect time to have a conversation with our teams on the new goals we can set. Let’s make 2022 not only a year when we measure diversity outcomes — let’s actually advance them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though we didn’t make it to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">CES 2022</a> in person this year, we certainly heard about the “eMobility Experience,” a test track for demo rides of all the e-scooters, e-bikes and whatever other micromobility vehicles came to play in Las Vegas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of products were shown, many of which weren’t actually new, like Bird’s new consumer suite of vehicles (the Bird Bike, Bird Flex and Birdie), Zoomo’s utility electric-assist bikes, Euphree’s City Robin step-through e-bike and Arevo and Superstrata’s 3D-printed carbon fiber e-bikes. There were a handful of interesting companies showing off new versions of their electric scooters, bikes, motorcycles and connected tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main theme throughout this year is smart, connected vehicles. These little EVs are being built with more powerful onboard computers that are synced up to apps that can help riders do things like find their vehicle, track fitness goals and control bike functions like locks and lights. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254889" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s a roundup of new bikes, scooters and some connected tech that came to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">CES 2022</a>.</p>
<h2>Segway</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2254894" style="width: 1638px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254894" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2254894 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-5.58.35-pm.png" alt="Segway E110 electric scooters, bikes at CES 2022" width="1628" height="1106" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-5.58.35-pm.png 1628w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-5.58.35-pm.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-5.58.35-pm.png?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-5.58.35-pm.png?resize=768,522 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-5.58.35-pm.png?resize=680,462 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-5.58.35-pm.png?resize=1536,1043 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-07-at-5.58.35-pm.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1628px) 100vw, 1628px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254894" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Segway-Ninebot</p></div></p>
<p><b>Segway</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the electric micromobility manufacturer that not only sells personal vehicles but also supplies a number of the world’s shared operators with vehicles, came to CES with a new kick scooter line, the P-Series, and a new moped-type e-scooter, the E11a. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The P60 and P100S scooters have wider footboards and handles, automobile-grade all-season tires, and front- and rear-spring suspension. They’ve also got turn signaling, a tail light and multiple ways to lock and unlock the vehicle. The E110a has room for two, plenty of storage space and lots of smart features, according to the company. Segway didn’t share more info on what exactly those smart features were, but if it’s anything like its last generation, it’ll have a battery management system and the ability to connect to smartphones and thus the Segway-Ninebot app.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Cake</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255051" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CESBOOTH-12.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255051" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255051 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CESBOOTH-12.jpg" alt="Cake work series ebike electric scooters, bikes at CES 2022" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CESBOOTH-12.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CESBOOTH-12.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CESBOOTH-12.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CESBOOTH-12.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CESBOOTH-12.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CESBOOTH-12.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CESBOOTH-12.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2255051" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cake</p></div></p>
<p>The Swedish maker of lightweight electric motorbikes brought its &#8220;CAKE :work series&#8221; to the U.S. for the first time. This series of professional motorbikes have been shown before, just not in the states. The bigger <strong>Cake</strong> news during CES involved updates to its Ridecake connectivity app, including features to allow professional fleet managers to monitor and manage their vehicles.</p>
<p>The new connectivity features are available to all riders with a data service-enabled Cake Connect module on their vehicles; this includes all current and upcoming models, as well as a majority of the existing Cake bikes. The update to the app will add customized ride modes, real-time riding information, ride history and anti-theft security.</p>
<p>Professionals using Cake&#8217;s cloud-based management system will get real-time data, including live location of their fleet with position of all bikes, mileage, range and battery status for all bikes, and access to diagnostic data. Over the air, the system will also allow for firmware updates, access to anti-theft functionality and setting custom ride modes.</p>
<h2>Delfast</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2254893" style="width: 1544px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254893" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2254893 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg" alt="Delfast electric scooters, bikes at CES 2022" width="1534" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg 1534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1534px) 100vw, 1534px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254893" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Delfast</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American-Ukrainian startup </span><b>Delfast</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rolled out an upgraded model of its electric Top 3.0 bike, which the company claims can go up to 200 miles on a single charge. The smart bike has an onboard computer that can be set to receive software updates and immobilize the vehicle for theft-protection. It also can sync with Delfast’s new mobile app to provide on-demand analytics, lock and unlock the bike, arm and disarm the bike alarm, track total mileage, odometer and speedometer metrics, monitor the bike power and estimate range, locate the bike, control lighting and other smart features.</span></p>
<h2>Niu</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255027" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255027" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255027 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg" alt="niu bqi-c1 electric scooters, bikes at CES 2022" width="2000" height="1148" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg?resize=768,441 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg?resize=680,390 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg?resize=1536,882 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2255027" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot/Niu</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese e-scooter company </span><b>Niu</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed up this year with its new <a href="https://www.niu.com/en/ces2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BQi-C1 e-bike</a>, a vehicle the company has already teased but finally shared pricing and tech specs at CES. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The step-through bike is powered by a 500W continuous and 750W Bafang hub motor in the rear and can reach top speeds of 28 miles per hour in the U.S. Stricter e-bike regulations in Europe mean that those versions will have just a 250W motor and a top speed of 15.5 miles per hour. The U.S. version will have both a throttle and a pedal assist, while the European version just has pedal assist. The BQi will also be app-connected and feature many smart security features. It’ll be priced at $1,499 in the U.S., which is a pretty good deal for such a powerful e-bike. </span></p>
<h2>Okai</h2>
<p>[gallery ids="2254901,2254896,2254899,2254897,2254898,2254900"]</p>
<p><b>Okai</b>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">another Chinese manufacturer that supplies vehicles to many big-name shared operators, came to CES with five products, but only one of three can be ridden. Let’s start there. The EB20 e-bike is made from professional-grade mountain bike components with a lightweight carbon fiber frame. It’s a 12-speed bike with a 750W motor, swappable Samsung batteries and a large 2.8-inch LED touchscreen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okai also launched its ES600 sharing e-scooter to address the needs of the growing scooter-share industry. It features a swappable battery system with built-in handles on each battery, optimized weight distribution, a low center of gravity and a hydraulic suspension system. It also has side and front light indicators, LED headlights and taillights and side-mounted reflectors. The ES800 is an off-road performance scooter with a serious 1800W motor, 12-inch off-road tires, a 35% incline climb rate and dual shock absorbers. The weight of this heavy-duty vehicle is 30% heavier than most e-scooters to provide more stability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, onto the products you can’t ride. Okai unveiled its SH10 smart helmet, made with antibacterial materials, to make for a safer and more hygienic commute. These are likely also geared toward the shared audience that are increasingly being required by cities to include helmets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The helmet is integrated with Bluetooth to connect to the Okai app, from which riders can customize and configure front and rear LED displays to improve visibility. A smart integrated speaker also allows riders to listen to music without affecting aural awareness on the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Okai came to Vegas with its SP10 Smart Backpack that features an ultraviolet light disinfection chamber, a fingerprint sensor for secure access, integrated device charging and a customizable RGB strip that can be synced with the vehicle status. </span></p>
<h2>Bosch</h2>
<p><b>Bosch </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed up with its connected smart e-bike system, which isn’t exactly new, but it was awarded honoree status at the CES Innovation Awards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system consists of the eBike Flow app that acts as a key, a control unit, display, rechargeable battery and drive unit. Like others at CES, the connected bike can be updated over-the-air, record personal ride info and fitness data, customize riding modes and display information like battery charge status and next service appointment on the home screen. </span></p>
<h2>Moonbikes</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255031" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255031" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255031" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg" alt="moonbikes electric scooters, bikes at CES 2022" width="700" height="468" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2255031" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Moonbikes</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, just to keep things interesting, there was <strong>Moonbikes</strong>. Now, again,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/the-station-a-tesla-nhtsa-fight-brews-catching-up-with-kodiak-and-how-la-is-prepping-for-air-taxis/"> the company’s electric snow vehicle is not exactly new</a>, but CES was really the first time people really got to check it out in person. It’s a single-track snowmobile that has a 3 kW (4hp) electric motor and reaches a 26 mile-per-hour top speed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At only 182 pounds, it’s much lighter than your traditional snowmobile, which might make it easier to maneuver and play around on. It’s designed with a snow track on the rear and a single ski in front, and its battery can go about 12 miles in sport mode or 22 miles in eco mode. A full charge would take about five hours. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Fitness+ is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-fitness-plus-introduces-collections-and-time-to-run-starting-january-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introducing</a> a new &#8220;Collections&#8221; feature along with a new &#8220;Time to Run&#8221; series starting on January 10th. Collections are a curated series of workouts and meditations from the Fitness+ library organized to help users reach a goal. The feature draws on nearly 2,000 workouts to give users a new way to get motivated as they begin their next workout. Apple says Collections will give users a suggested plan to help them make specific training choices.</p>
<p>The six Collections that will be available at launch include &#8220;30-Day Core Challenge,&#8221; &#8220;Improve Your Posture with Pilates,&#8221; &#8220;Perfect Your Yoga Balance Poses,&#8221; &#8220;Run Your First 5K,&#8221; &#8220;Strengthen Your Back, Strech Your Hips&#8221; and &#8220;Wind Down for a Better Bedtime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s new &#8220;Time to Run&#8221; series is an extension of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/apples-new-fitness-feature-brings-celebrity-guided-walks-to-your-wrist/">&#8220;Time to Walk&#8221; feature</a> that launched last year. The company describes the new series as an audio running experience designed to help users train to become more consistent and better runners. Each episode in the series is focused on a popular running route and includes coaching tips led by a Fitness+ trainer. The episodes feature playlists designed to match each run&#8217;s intensity, location and coaching. Each episode also includes photos taken by the Fitness+ trainer depicting the route.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255025" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Time to Run is launching with three episodes: London, coached by Cory Wharton-Malcolm; Brooklyn, coached by Emily Fayette; and Miami Beach, coached by Sam Sanchez. A new episode of the series will be released each week on Mondays. Apple notes that for Apple Watch customers who use a wheelchair, Time to Run becomes Time to Run or Push and gives users the option to begin an &#8220;Outdoor Push Running Pace&#8221; workout.</p>

<p>“At the beginning of a new year, we know many people are looking for new ways to go after their goals,&#8221; said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s vice president of fitness technologies, in a statement. &#8220;With these new additions, Fitness+ makes it easy to get motivated and stay active anywhere, with the most complete library of high-quality and diverse content to train your mind and body, no matter where you are on your fitness journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Collections and Time to Run launching on January 10th, Apple is introducing the third season of Time to Walk, its series that aims to encourage users to get active by walking more often. New guests will be added each week in the third season. The guests include Hasan Minhaj, Chelsea Handler, Bernice A. King and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fitness+ is also adding additional content to its Artist Spotlight series, which dedicates an entire workout playlist to one artist, with new workouts featuring music from Ed Sheeran, Pharrell Williams, Shakira and the Beatles. The workout types include cycling, dance, HIIT, strength, treadmill and yoga.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-fitness-launches-on-december-14/">launched</a> Fitness+ on December 14, 2020, and has since worked to compete with other subscription fitness offerings, including Peloton. Fitness+ is available as a <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-fitness-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standalone subscription</a> for $9.99 per month, or as a part of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple One Premier</a> plan for $29.95 per month, which gives users access to Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and iCloud+ with 2TB of storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning private-market powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://a16z.com/2022/01/07/9b-to-build-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it has closed $9 billion in new capital for its venture capital, growth-stage and biotech-focused vehicles.</p>
<p>The firm, better known by the moniker a16z, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/a16zs-new-2-2b-fund-wont-just-bet-on-the-crypto-future-it-will-defend-it/">raised a $2.2 billion crypto-focused fund last year</a>.</p>
<p>These fundraises by the firm highlight the rising size of private-market investing vehicles that we tend to group under the venture capital banner, and the burgeoning capital base of a16z itself.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255024" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Looking back in time, the group&#8217;s <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/11/20/fund-vii-and-growth-fund-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last generation of funds</a> &#8212; including its seventh venture fund worth $1.3 billion, its second growth fund worth $3.2 billion and its third <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/andreessen-horowitz-just-rolled-out-a-400-million-fund-thats-expressly-for-seed-deals/">bio-focused fund</a> worth $750 million &#8212; were worth just a touch over half of its latest aggregate fundraise. So, it appears that a16z is not only reloading, it&#8217;s raising more capital than ever for its usual crop of focuses.</p>
<p>That the group is raising larger investment capital pools should not surprise. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/andreessen-horowitz-has-a-new-crypto-fund-and-its-first-female-general-partner-is-running-it-with-chris-dixon/">first crypto fund</a> was worth $300 million, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/andreessen-horowitz-just-closed-its-second-crypto-fund/">second $515 million</a> and its most recent around four times that much. As an investing collective, a16z, like many private-market investors, is putting more capital to work per new crop of new funds.</p>
<p>The trend of larger funds is generally thought to be a contributing factor to larger startup funding rounds, and some of the pressure regarding deal access (harder) and startup valuations (higher).</p>
<p>To underscore just how big venture and venture-ish funds are today, recall that Norwest Venture Partners closed a $3 billion fund last month. That pushed the group&#8217;s total capital it has raised &#8220;across the decades&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/norwest-unveils-a-3-billion-fund-which-is-a-whopping-one-fourth-the-capital-it-has-ever-raised/">as our own Connie Loizos put it</a>, to $12.5 billion. So, a huge fraction of the firm&#8217;s historical capital was raised just last quarter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a capital arms race in the private markets, as enthusiasm for technology companies both traditional (software, etc.) and frontier (crypto, quantum computing, metaverse, etc.) remains red-hot. That the public markets are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/the-era-of-ultra-rich-software-valuations-could-be-behind-us/">taking a slightly different tack in recent weeks</a> doesn&#8217;t appear to have slowed the venture capital firm side of the fundraising coin. Not yet, at least.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As 2021 wound down, The Exchange wanted to dig into what might happen if the startup music stopped playing. So we got veteran venture capitalist <a href="https://twitter.com/mmurph?lang=en">Matt Murphy</a> on the phone to talk it over.</p>
<p>Murphy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-murphy-0415543/">started his career</a> at Sun Microsystems back in the mid-90s, joining venture shop <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/">Kleiner Perkins</a> in 1999, where he stayed until 2015. From there, the investor changed teams <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/11/menlo-ventures-brings-on-matt-murphy/">to Menlo Ventures</a>, where he&#8217;s worked since. For a little bit of context, Murphy has invested in DocuSign, Egnyte, AppDynamics and Carta, among others.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most relevant today is his experience investing during downturns, including both the 2000-era startup contraction and the 2008 financial crisis. So, armed with a grip of questions and a recorder, we talked through a host of topics, from current startup benchmarks to the durability of today’s startups and changes to the overall startup hit rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220369 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Our chat with Murphy was wide-ranging. To manage its length, we’ve sectioned his answers by theme, adding subheadlines in places where the topic changed slightly. We’ve also edited our questions down sharply and made modest edits to the transcript for clarity and length, including expanding certain acronyms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy your </span><a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1479438730402443266"><span style="font-weight: 400;">snow-day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> read!</span></p>
<h3>On whether the current period is overheated or backed by fundamentals</h3>
<p><strong>Matt Murphy:</strong> Well, I&#8217;m very OK with the investments I&#8217;ve already made being marked up, because that makes you feel like a hero, and very traumatized by trying to get into new stuff, because that makes you feel like a chump. [Laughter]</p>
<p>[But yes,] the way that valuations have changed and continue to change in a relatively short period of time has been astonishing. Definitely more so than in 1999. It just feels like this has been more of a durable period. It&#8217;s more distributed, and every time you think it&#8217;s a new max, something else happens.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder Alán Jaime Misrahi grew up devoted to soccer, eventually playing in Mexico&#8217;s third division. While he didn’t necessarily make it to the “big leagues” playing the sport, his new company Draftea aims to win over the 350 million sports fans in Latin America, Jaime Misrahi told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draftea, which calls itself the first daily fantasy sports company in Spanish-speaking Latin America, emerged from stealth mode today on the heels of a $13.2 million fundraise led by Kaszek with participation from Sequoia, Bullpen, and Nigel Eccles, founder and former CEO of sports-betting giant FanDuel. Eccles serves as chairman of the board at Draftea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment marks Sequoia’s first in a company headquartered in Mexico, half a year after the venture capital firm </span><a href="https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/the-latin-american-startup-opportunity-46ace259777f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to double down on opportunities in Latin America. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254797" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draftea’s app charges sports fans a fee to draft a lineup of players and compete to win daily cash prizes. The platform, currently in private beta mode, will launch sometime in the first quarter of this year. It will first host Mexican fantasy soccer matches, though Jaime Misrahi said the company aims to eventually add offerings until it hosts fantasy games for “every single sport in the world.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you think of a region where soccer is almost a religion, where people get together for activities that are related to sports, where stadiums are full, where people enjoy [sports] as a family tradition, where people are in several WhatsApp groups talking about sports and fantasy – we want to bring all that together,” Jaime Misrahi said of Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While sports betting platforms </span><a href="https://www.sporttechie.com/nfl-adds-its-first-latin-american-sports-betting-partner" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like Costa Rica’s Betcris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are already popular in the region, Jaime Misrahi said Draftea is comparatively a “much more social platform.” It also differentiates itself by offering daily games and interactions, in contrast to the less-frequent games hosted by seasonal fantasy platforms that tend to mirror real-world sports schedules.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Jaime Misrahi, the core founding team includes Alejandra Lascurain, former product head at Mexico’s largest neobank; Miguel Gutiérrez-Barquín, who previously led growth at Rappi; Joe Cohen, Vercel’s former head of engineering; and Andreas Assad, who worked at EA Sports. Draftea has 34 employees in total today and plans to double in size over the next couple months across all key areas, Jaime Misrahi said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is looking ahead to the FIFA World Cup in Qatar this November, expected to be this year’s biggest live sports event worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to, by then, have an amazing product, have launched in many countries in Latin America, and to have hundreds, if not thousands or millions, of users engaged with our platform,” Jaime Misrahi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia’s Konstantine Buhler met Jaime Misrahi through a mutual connection at Stanford, where Jaime Misrahi completed his MBA last year. Buhler led Sequoia’s investment in Draftea, in part because he felt Jaime Misrahi exemplified “founder-market fit” due to his passion for sports and experience as a professional soccer player, Buhler told TechCrunch in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It all comes down to customer love,” Buhler wrote. “Draftea is a first-of-its-kind community for sports fans in LatAm where they can become the protagonist in their favorite games. We believe Alán and team will quickly capture the hearts of fans in Mexico then expand to other countries in time for the World Cup.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/twitter-now-lets-all-ios-android-and-web-users-listen-to-recorded-spaces/">has been working</a> on Spaces Recordings, a feature that will let hosts share tweets with audio recordings of past Spaces. Now, when hosts share the recordings, they&#8217;re able to see how many listeners joined live, as well as how many people replayed the recording after the fact.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">we’ve been working on Spaces Recordings and if you’re a Host with access, you’ll now see how many listeners joined live AND how many people replayed the recording</p>
<p>let us know what you think! <a href="https://t.co/RM70qK2vSL">pic.twitter.com/RM70qK2vSL</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255001" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1479173213032792065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson said that the long-teased feature will remain in closed testing for a bit longer, but that they have expanded the testing group a few times since launch. Twitter does intend on rolling out this feature more widely in the future.</p>
<p>When a Space is being recorded, users in the live space will see a &#8220;Rec&#8221; button with a red dot next to it. If a host shares the recording later, they can edit the start time so that future listeners don&#8217;t have to hear minutes of dead air if the Space didn&#8217;t start right away. When listening to a recorded Space, users can see who&#8217;s talking and who was in the room, similar to in a live Space.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some updates on recorded Spaces:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/25aa.png" alt="▪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The option to record a Space is available for some hosts on both iOS and Android.<br /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/25aa.png" alt="▪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The option to listen to a recording of a Space is available for everyone on iOS, Android, and now web!</p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1467986249852063748?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>These features are useful for listeners, since they&#8217;re able to asynchronously engage with content that they may miss from their favorite hosts. But for the hosts themselves, this replay feature makes it easier to build an audience. Clubhouse added a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/clubhouse-record-room-replay/">similar feature</a> in November called Replay, which also lets users download audio so they can edit it and share it as a podcast if they so choose. Since June, Twitter has let users <a href="https://twitter.com/twittermedia/status/1405262233299345413?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a> their Spaces audio files from the last 30 days.</p>
<p>Spaces has become a staple of Twitter, even occupying the center tab on its mobile app. But the growth of the live audio feature hasn&#8217;t come without setbacks. Recently, Twitter Spaces users have reported being served <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/10/twitter-turmoil-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blatantly harmful content</a> — including Spaces with racist titles that remained on their feeds even after being reported. Other live audio apps like Clubhouse have also <a href="https://www.thelily.com/women-in-tech-are-networking-through-clubhouse-an-invite-only-app-but-these-black-women-say-its-not-a-place-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with moderating</a> hateful content. Twitter hasn’t yet detailed if or how its moderation of Spaces will expand beyond its existing reporting features.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re exploring more proactive detection and working on evaluating and developing new moderation options,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch. </span>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Spaces is an iterative product and as more people use it, we’ll continue to learn, thoughtfully listen and make improvements based on feedback.&#8221;</span></p>
