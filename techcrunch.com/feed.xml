</div><p id="speakable-summary">It seems safe to say that our honeymoon with big tech is officially over.</p>
<p>After years of questionable data-handling procedures, arbitrary content management policies and outright anti-competitive practices, it is only fair that we take a moment to rethink our relationship with the industry.</p>
<p>Sadly, most of the ideas that have gathered mainstream attention — such as the calls to break up big tech — have been knee-jerk responses that smack more of retributionist fantasies than sound economic thinking.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead of chasing sensationalist <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/dont-break-up-big-tech-regulate-data-access-says-eu-antitrust-chief/">non-starters</a> and zero-sum solutions, we should be focused on ensuring that big tech grows better as it grows bigger by establishing a level playing field for startups’ and competitors’ proprietary digital markets.</p>
<p>We can find inspiration on how to do just that by taking a look at how 20<sup>th</sup>-century lawmakers reined in the railroad monopolies, which similarly turned from darlings of industry to destructive forces of stagnation.</p>
<h2>We’ve been here before</h2>
<p>More than a century ago, a familiar story of a nation coming to terms with the unanticipated effects of technological disruption was unfolding across a rapidly industrializing United States.</p>
<p>While the first full-scale steam locomotive debuted in 1804, it took until 1868 for more powerful and cargo-friendly American-style locomotives to be introduced.</p>
<p>The more efficient and cargo-friendly locomotives caught on like wildfire, and soon steel and iron pierced through mountains and leaped over gushing rivers to connect Americans from coast to coast.</p>
<p>Soon, railroad mileage <a href="https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/rise-of-industrial-america-1876-1900/railroads-in-late-19th-century/">tripled</a> and a whopping<a href="https://www.lib.uiowa.edu/exhibits/previous/railroad/"> 77% of all intercity traffic and 98% of passenger business</a> would be running on rails, ushering in an era of cost-efficient transcontinental travel that would recast the economic fortunes of the entire country.</p>
<p>As is often the case with disruptive technologies, early success would come with a heavy human cost.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, abuse and exploitation ran rampant in the railroad industry, with up to 3% of the labor force suffering<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4q2wAAAAIAAJ"> injuries or dying during the course of an average year.</a></p>
<p>Railroad trust owners soon became key constituents of the widely maligned group of businessmen colloquially known as robber barons, whose corporations <a href="https://archive.org/details/railroadedtransc0000whit">devoured everything in their path</a> and made life difficult for competitors and new entrants in particular.</p>
<p>The railroad proprietors achieved this by maintaining carefully constructed walled gardens, allowing them to run competitors into the ground by means of extortion, exclusion and everything in between.</p>
<p>While these methods proved wildly successful for railroad owners, the rest of society languished under stifled competition and an utter lack of concern for consumers’ interests.</p>
<h2>Everything old is new again</h2>
<p>Learning from past experiences certainly doesn’t seem to be humankind’s strong suit.</p>
<p>In fact, most of our concerns with the tech industry are mirror images of the objections 20<sup>th</sup>-century Americans had against the railroad trusts.</p>
<p>Similar to the robber barons, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, et al., have come to dominate the major thoroughfares of trade in a fashion that leaves little space for competitors and startups.</p>
<p>By instating double-digit platform fees, establishing strict limitations on payment processing protocols, and jealously hoarding proprietary data and APIs, big tech has erected artificial barriers to entry that make replicating their success all but impossible.</p>
<p>Over the past years, tech giants have also taken to cannibalizing third-party solutions by providing private-label versions — à la AmazonBasics — to the point where big tech’s clients are finding themselves undercut and outplayed by the platform-holders themselves.</p>
<p>Given the above, it is not surprising that the pace at which tech startups are created in the US <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201505/leigh-buchanan/the-vanishing-startups-in-decline.html">has been declining for years</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, VC veterans such as Albert Wenger have called attention to the “<a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2018/06/02/american-tech-giants-are-making-life-tough-for-startups">kill zone</a>” around big tech for years, and if we are to reinvigorate the competitive fringe around our large tech conglomerates, something has to be done fast.</p>
<h2>Why we need to stop talking about breaking up big tech</h2>
<p>The 20<sup>th</sup>-century playbook for taming monopolistic railroad trusts offers several helpful lessons for dealing with big tech.</p>
<p>For first steps, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1887 and tasked it with administering reasonable and just rates for access to proprietary railroad networks.</p>
<p>Due to partisan politicking, the ICC proved relatively toothless, however. It wasn’t until Congress passed the 1906 Hepburn Act, which separated the function of transportation from the ownership of the goods being shipped, that we started seeing true progress.</p>
<p>By disallowing self-dealing and double-dipping in proprietary platforms, Congress succeeded in opening up access on equal terms both to existing competitors and startups alike, making a once-unnavigable thicket of exploitative practices into the metallic backbone of American prosperity that we know today.</p>
<p>This could never have been achieved by simply breaking the railroad trusts into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>In fact, when it comes to platforms and networks, bigger often is better for everyone involved thanks to <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/01/why-some-platforms-thrive-and-others-dont">network effects</a> and several other factors that conspire against smaller platforms.</p>
<p>Most importantly, when access and interoperability rules are done right, bigger platforms can sustain wider and wider constellations of startups and third parties, helping us grow our economic pie instead of shrinking it.</p>
<h2>Making digital markets work for startups</h2>
<p>In our post-pandemic economy, our attention should be in helping tech platforms <em>grow better</em> as they grow bigger instead of cutting them down to size.</p>
<p>Ensuring that startups and competitors can access these platforms on equitable terms and at fair prices is a necessary first step.</p>
<p>There are numerous other tangible actions policymakers can take today. For example, rewriting the rules on data portability, pushing for wider standardization and interoperability across platforms, and reintroducing net neutrality would go a long way in addressing what ails the industry today.</p>
<p>With President Joe Biden’s recent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/22/president-biden-announces-his-intent-to-nominate-lina-khan-for-commissioner-of-the-federal-trade-commission/">nod</a> toward “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html">Amazon’s Antitrust Antagonist</a>” Lina Khan as the next commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, these changes suddenly seem more likely than ever.</p>
<p>In the end, all of us would stand to benefit from a robust fringe of startups and competitors that thrive on the shoulders of giants and the platforms they have made.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Deliver<em>oops</em>.</p>
<p>After a lackluster IPO pricing run, shares of Deliveroo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/deliveroo-prices-its-shares-on-the-lse-at-3-90-at-the-lower-end-of-the-range-with-a-market-cap-of-7-59b/">are lower today</a>, marking a disappointing debut for the hot delivery company.</p>
<p>A good question to ask at this juncture is why Deliveroo struggled with its IPO during a historically strong moment for tech flotations. The European unicorn listed on the London Stock Exchange, however, possibly placing its public offering in a different climate than recent IPO successes listed in the United States.</p>

<hr />
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/equity-monday-deliveroo-servicetitan-and-robinhood-for-everywhere/">noted on Monday</a> that there were local concerns regarding Deliveroo&#8217;s governance and treatment of workers. At the time, however, those worries merely led to a decrease in the company&#8217;s IPO valuation.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1995214 size-medium alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Why did Deliveroo struggle when it began to trade? Is it suffering from cultural dissonance between its high-growth model and more conservative European investors? Let&#8217;s peek at the numbers and find out.</p>
<h2>Deliveroo versus DoorDash</h2>
<p>To ground us, let&#8217;s explore how differently the public markets value Deliveroo and DoorDash. If they are valued somewhat closely, we&#8217;ll be able to dismiss the question of whether the British delivery giant is really being treated with more skepticism than its American comp.</p>
<p>Not that we care, really, one way or the other about any single company&#8217;s value. But we do care if listing on a European exchange &#8212; I refuse to acknowledge Brexit this morning &#8212; means that companies valuing growth over profits are going to generate more stick than praise when they list.</p>
<p>So, briefly, here&#8217;s the data we need to make our comparison. We&#8217;ll start <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/280253921/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/2020_Q4_GAAP-and-Non-GAAP-tables_CLEAN.pdf">with DoorDash</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>DoorDash 2020 revenue: $2.886 billion</li>
<li>DoorDash 2020 revenue growth (YoY): 226%</li>
<li>DoorDash market cap: $41.98 billion</li>
<li>Implied 2020 revenue multiple: 14.54x</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, <a href="https://corporate.deliveroo.co.uk/protected_file/175/">Deliveroo</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliveroo 2020 revenue: £1.191 billion</li>
<li>Deliveroo 2020 revenue growth (YoY): 54.3%</li>
<li>Deliveroo market cap: £5.55 billion</li>
<li>Implied 2020 revenue multiple: 4.66x<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies embrace the use of data, hiring more data scientists, a roadblock persists around sharing that data. It requires too much copying and pasting and manual work. <a href="http://hex.tech">Hex</a>, a new startup, wants to change that by providing a way to dispense data across the company in a streamlined and elegant way.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $5.5 million seed investment, and also announced that it&#8217;s opening up the product from a limited beta to be more widely available. The round was led by Amplify Partners with help from Box Group, XYZ, Data Community Fund, Operator Collective and a variety of individual investors. The company closed the round last July, but is announcing it for the first time today.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Barry McCardel says that it&#8217;s clear that companies are becoming more data-driven and hiring data scientists and analysts at a rapid pace, but there is an issue around data sharing, one that he and his co-founders experienced first-hand when they were working at Palantir.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They decided to develop a purpose-built tool for sharing data with other parts of the organization that are less analytically technical than the data science team working with these data sets. &#8220;What we do is we make it very easy for data scientists to connect to their data, analyze and explore it in notebooks. [&#8230;] And then they can share their work as interactive data apps that anyone else can use,&#8221; McCardel explained.</p>
<p>Most data scientists work with their data in online notebooks like Jupyter where they can build SQL queries and enter Python code to organize it, chart it, and so forth. What Hex is doing is creating this super-charged notebook that lets you pull a data set from Snowflake or Amazon Redshift, work with and format the data in an easy way, then drag and drop components from the notebook page &#8212; maybe a chart or a data set &#8212; and very quickly build a kind of app that you can share with others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132551" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132551" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132551" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="Hex app example with data elements at the top and live graph below it." width="680" height="566" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg 978w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=768,639 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=680,566 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132551" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hex</p></div></p>
<p>The startup has 9 employees including co-founders McCardel, CTO Caitlin Colgrove and VP of architecture Glen Takahashi. &#8220;We&#8217;ve really focused on the team front from an early stage, making sure that we&#8217;re building a diverse team. And actually today our engineering team is majority female, which is definitely the first time that that&#8217;s ever happened to me,&#8221; Colgrove said.</p>
<p>She is also part of a small percentage of female founders. A report last year <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-than-half-of-us-startups-lack-women-in-leadership-according-to-silicon-valley-banks-2020-women-in-us-technology-leadership-report-301016878.html#:~:text=The%20percentage%20of%20US%20startups,a%20least%20one%20female%20founder.">from Silicon Valley Bank</a>, found that while the number was heading in the right direction, only 28% of US startups have at least one female founder. That was up from 22% in 2017.</p>
<p>The company was founded in late 2019 and the founders spent a good part of last year building the product and working with design partners. They have a small set of paying customers, and are looking to expand that starting today. While customers still need to work with the Hex team for now to get going, the plan is to make the product self-serve some time later this year.</p>
<p>Hex&#8217;s early customers include Glossier, imgur and Pave.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coursera, an edtech unicorn, will begin its life today as a public company after <a href="https://investor.coursera.com/news/news-details/2021/Coursera-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering/default.aspx">pricing</a> its IPO at $33 per share yesterday evening. Using a simple share count, the company&#8217;s valuation comes to $4.30 billion, or $4.38 billion if its underwriters exercise their option to purchase shares at its offering price.</p>
<p>A more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/coursera-set-to-roughly-double-its-private-valuation-in-impending-ipo">diluted share count</a> pushes the valuation of Coursera over the $5 billion mark.</p>
<p>Coursera was last valued at $2.57 billion after <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2020/07/17/online-learning-platform-coursera-raises-130-million-at-reported-25-billion-valuation/?sh=397231d8688f">raising $130 million</a> in mid-2020, per <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>. The company&#8217;s simple valuation is around a 67% gain on that final private figure; that gain rises to just over 70% if its underwriters purchase their available shares.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Using a diluted valuation, Coursera has roughly doubled its final private price. In under a year. For edtech investors looking to Coursera to help determine public market sentiment regarding the exit-value of their investments, TechCrunch reckons it&#8217;s a pretty good day.</p>
<p>The amount of private capital at play in edtech startups is staggering; billions and billions of potential returns could get a further shot in the arm if Coursera trades well this morning. And the very same billions of invested capital could lose the smile that Coursera&#8217;s seemingly-strong IPO pricing brought them.</p>
<p>There are other edtech debuts in the wings. TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/?tpcc=ECTW2020">covered Nerdy&#8217;s plans to go public</a>, via a SPAC, for example.</p>
<p>Private investors, who put well north of $10 billion into edtech companies globally in 2020, are modestly bullish on edtech exit volume this year. In a prior <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/">TechCrunch venture capitalist survey</a>, GSV managing partner Deborah Quazzo said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Exit volume is rising already with a wide range of strategic and financial buyers of edtech companies — something that didn’t exist before. You will see numerous high-value exits in the first half of 2021. It’s the public market “exits” that have really lagged and that I hope turns around in 2021 and 2022. There are numerous global companies that could go public and the addition of SPAC IPOs creates another positive dynamic.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Coursera IPO <em>pricing</em> at least, meets the mark for a high-value exit. Which could lead where? Extending Quazzo&#8217;s thinking a single step, perhaps a strong Coursera first-day trading session will bolster SPAC interest in taking more edtech startups and unicorns public.</p>
<p>Such a move could lock-in valuations for a number of currently illiquid edtech startups, and perhaps begin to return chunks of invested capital in the historically out-of-fashion technology sector.</p>

<p>Adding to that sentiment is Owl Ventures&#8217; managing director Ian Chiu, who told TechCrunch in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/">the same survey</a> that &#8220;the pipeline for potential IPO candidates coming from the edtech sector continues to grow larger.&#8221; Let&#8217;s hope &#8212; parsing the Coursera S-1 filing was good fun and we&#8217;d like another at-bat with an edtech IPO document.</p>
<p>More when Coursera trades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify this morning <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-31/introducing-new-spotify-mixes-personalized-playlists-featuring-your-favorite-artists-genres-and-decades/">announced</a> it&#8217;s significantly expanding its selection of personalized playlists with the addition of three new categories of playlists under the heading of &#8220;Spotify Mixes.&#8221; This collection will include artist mixes, genre mixes, and decade mixes &#8212; meaning you&#8217;ll gain access to a sizable number of new mixes with easy-to-understand titles, like 2010s Mix, R&amp;B Mix, Pop Mix, Drake Mix, Selena Gomez Mix, and so on &#8212; or whatever reflects your own tastes and interests.</p>
<p>The company says the idea for the Spotify Mixes was inspired by its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/27/spotify-daily-mix/">Daily Mixes, launched in fall 2016.</a></p>
<p>The Daily Mixes had been one of the company&#8217;s first big expansions in personalization beyond its flagship playlist, Discover Weekly, as they introduced a large set of playlists that reflected users&#8217; listening history. Today, Daily Mixes bring together your recent listens with other tracks to keep you engaged &#8212; and the new Spotify Mixes essentially do the same, as they&#8217;re populated with music you like plus &#8220;fresh tracks.&#8221; The difference is that the new mixes have clearer names and a more specific focus, in some cases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Spotify Mixes will be available to all users globally, including both Free users and Premium subscribers. At launch, you can find them within Search in the &#8220;Made for You&#8221; hub.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll easily spot them, too, as Spotify has already populated its app with a selection of mixes in the top three rows of the &#8220;Made for You&#8221; hub. Here, you&#8217;ll find &#8220;Your Genre Mixes,&#8221; &#8220;Your Artist Mixes,&#8221; and &#8220;Your Decade Mixes&#8221; &#8212;  each with a horizontally scrollable selection of mixes to get you started. Spotify says each mix category will be updated frequently and will always have several playlists available.</p>
<p>The new feature somewhat competes with a similar offering on Pandora, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/pandora-takes-on-spotify-with-dozens-of-personalized-playlists-built-using-its-music-genome/">launched</a> three years ago. The SiriusXM-owned music app had used its Music Genome technology to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/pandora-takes-on-spotify-with-dozens-of-personalized-playlists-built-using-its-music-genome/">create personalized playlists across a number of attributes</a>, including also genre and mood. While not an apples-to-apples comparison, necessarily, Pandora&#8217;s launch had instantly expanded its users&#8217; access to personalized playlists by the dozens. It&#8217;s actually a bit surprising that it took Spotify as long as it did to offer a competitive response.</p>
<p>The launch comes shortly after the addition of <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-29/run-to-spotifys-workout-hub-for-all-new-celebrity-inspired-playlists/">new celebrity-inspired playlists</a> to Spotify&#8217;s &#8220;Workout Hub&#8221; earlier this week.</p>
<p>Spotify says the new playlists are rolling out today to global users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The team behind <a href="https://cortado.ventures/">Cortado Ventures</a> thinks there&#8217;s plenty of untapped investment opportunity in the Midwest. To change that, it&#8217;s raised $20 million in what appears to be Okalhoma&#8217;s largest venture fund to date.</p>
<p>The firm is led by partners Nathaniel Harding, David Woods and Mike Moradi. In <a href="https://nathanielharding.medium.com/how-we-started-a-venture-capital-fund-in-oklahoma-ab192df2b809">a Medium post</a>, Harding (an angel investor and former oil and gas entrepreneur) recalled how he an Moradi had been discussing the need for an Oklahoma-based venture capital fund back in 2017.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d planned to launch the firm — which makes seed and Series A investments — just about a year ago, and the pandemic only gave them a greater sense of urgency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With the pandemic threatening Oklahoma’s economy, more attention than ever was placed on the need to diversify our economy and create future-ready tech jobs,&#8221; Harding said. &#8220;There was also a sense that innovation and startups would multiply, and that technology disruption and adoption would accelerate. In fact, we contend that there has never been a better time to start a new company. Our investors sensed this too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although the firm&#8217;s first fund only recent hit its cap of $20 million, it has already invested in nine startups including text marketing company <a href="https://www.respondflow.com">RespondFlow</a> in Tulsa, Dallas-based <a href="https://www.socialwyze.com">Socialwyze</a> (which helps underemployed people find flexible work) and hybrid materials startup <a href="https://www.mitomaterials.com">Mito Material Solutions</a> in Stillwater.</p>
<p>Cortado was created with the thesis that the region was &#8220;underfunded,&#8221; but Harding told me it doesn&#8217;t have any geographic restrictions on investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look at companies from anywhere,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We care more about what the companies does and less about where they’re located.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harding suggested that Oklahoma is particularly rich in entrepreneurs with a background in traditional industries like energy, aerospace, agriculture and manufacturing. And being based in Oklahoma City hasn&#8217;t stopped Cortado from backing founders from diverse backgrounds — he said the majority of the portfolio is led by women, people of color and first-generation immigrants.</p>
<p>Asked whether the regional ecosystem will also need more later-stage firms to fund the growth of  successful startups, Harding said, &#8220;Funding at the early stage is often very local, but funding at later stages, once you get to nine figure valuations — you’re a known commodity. Once you’re getting to a Series C and D [&#8230;] you have a global market for investments.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, the Equity team got ahold of three founders from the recent Y Combinator batch (more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">here</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-2/">here</a>) to chat through their experiences with a remote accelerator. TechCrunch was curious if the program lived up to founder expectations, how extreme timezone differentials were handled, and how easy it was to build camaraderie during a digital program. Oh, and how their demo day went.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s who is on the show:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-croc-93669426/">Benjamin Croc</a>, a founder at <a href="https://briohr.com/">BrioHR</a> (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/briohr-raises-1-3m-ahead-of-y-combinators-demo-day/">here</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/trisherrr">Trisha Bantigue</a>, a founder at Queenly (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/yc-backed-queenly-launches-a-marketplace-for-formalwear/">here</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/the_pangean?lang=en">Adam Alpert</a>, a founder at <a href="https://www.about.pangea.app/">Pangea</a> (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/yc-backed-pangea-discusses-growth-fundraising-ahead-of-demo-day/">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The short version is that the founders were generally happy with Y Combinator being remote, and that the setup allowing them to stay in their normal location was plus. We also asked the founders for learnings regarding how to best handle remote accelerators in the future.</p>
<p>More from Equity on Friday, at which point we&#8217;ll put Y Combinator aside for a good while.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following years of backlash over its algorithms and their ability to push people to more extreme content, which Facebook <a href="https://nickclegg.medium.com/you-and-the-algorithm-it-takes-two-to-tango-7722b19aa1c2">continues to deny,</a> the company today announced it would give its users new tools to more easily switch over to non-algorithmic views of their News Feed. This includes the recently launched &#8220;Favorites,&#8221; which shows you posts from up to 30 of your favorite friends and Pages, as well as the &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; view, which shows posts in chronological order. It also introduced new controls for adjusting who can comment on your posts, and other changes.</p>
<p>The features themselves aren&#8217;t entirely new, in some cases, but they&#8217;ve been made easier to get to with the addition of a Feed Filter Bar on mobile for changing the view of the News Feed, and an option menu on your posts to control who can comment.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; view of the News Feed has long existed but has been buried in the extended &#8220;more&#8221; menu (the three-bar hamburger icon) on the Facebook mobile app. It&#8217;s not as useful as it sounds because it shows you all the posts from both friends and Pages in a single chronological view. If you&#8217;ve been on Facebook for many years, then you&#8217;ve probably &#8220;Liked&#8221; a number of Facebook Pages for brands, businesses and public figures. These Pages tend to post with more frequency than your friends, so the feed has become largely a long scroll through Page updates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2132519" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>However, if you still prefer the &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; view, the Feed Filter Bar will give you a tool to easier switch back and forth between this and other views. The feature will launch on Android first, then roll out to iOS.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Facebook has offered a way to prioritize who you see in your News Feed through a &#8220;See First&#8221; setting, but the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1634545223376778">newer &#8220;Favorites&#8221; feature</a> rebrands this effort and gives you a single destination under <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1634545223376778">Settings</a> to select and deselect your Favorites, including favorite Pages.</p>
<p>The updated commenting controls are a new take on a habit many Facebook users have already adopted &#8212; when they share a post only to a given audience, like family or friends, while excluding other groups like work colleagues or even specific people. Now, users will have the option to instead share their posts but control who can engage in conversations. Public figures, for example, may choose to adopt the feature to restrict their audience to only those brands and profiles they&#8217;ve tagged.</p>

<p>Facebook says it will also show more context around suggestions it displays in the News Feed with its &#8220;<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/why-am-i-seeing-this/">Why am I seeing this?&#8221; feature</a> that will explain how its algorithmic suggestions work. It says several factors may be at work here, in terms of what&#8217;s shown and why &#8212; including your location, whether you or people like you have engaged with related topics, groups or Pages, and more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2132518" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The changes arrive at a time when Facebook, along with other tech giants, has come under fire for its role in spreading misinformation leading to deadly events,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tech-hearing-capitol-attack-facebook-twitter-google/"> like the storming of the U.S. Capitol</a>, and serious public health crises, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/social-media-ceos-hedge-on-whether-theyd-boot-the-12-anti-vax-super-spreaders-cited-by-states-attorneys-general/">like vaccine hesitancy during a pandemic</a>. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week testified before the House’s Subcommittee on Communications and Technology about its failures to remove dangerous misinformation and its allowing of extremists to become more radicalized and to organize online.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s official position, however, is that it doesn&#8217;t play a role in directing people towards problematic content &#8212; they seek it out. And people&#8217;s News Feeds are only a reflection of their own choices, in that way.</p>
<p>These thoughts and more were <a href="https://nickclegg.medium.com/you-and-the-algorithm-it-takes-two-to-tango-7722b19aa1c2">detailed today by Nick Clegg</a>, VP of Global Affairs for Facebook, where he insists personalization algorithms are common across tech companies &#8212; Amazon and Netflix use them, too, for instance. And ranking simply makes what&#8217;s most relevant to the user appear first &#8212; effectively blaming users for the problems here. He also throws back the decisions to be made around Facebook&#8217;s role in misinformation peddling to the lawmakers, adding: &#8220;It would clearly be better if these [content] decisions were made according to frameworks agreed by democratically accountable lawmakers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the age of 14, Jacklyn Rome<span style="font-weight: 400;"> saw firsthand how divorce can impact families, and how arguing about finances both during and after the process can impact children.</span></p>
<p>The experience stuck with her. As an adult, after leading new product launches at Uber and Blue Apron,  Rome came up with the concept behind her startup, <a href="https://myensemble.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensemble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The expense tracking app quietly launched in the App Store in 2020 with the mission of reducing tension among co-parents and making sure kids&#8217; needs aren&#8217;t negatively impacted by a divorce.</span></p>
<p>Today, Ensemble is coming out of stealth with $3 million in seed funding from TTV Capital, Lerer Hippeau and Citi Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Put simply, Ensemble’s mission is to improve the lives of co-parents and their children by giving parents a streamlined way to track shared expenses.</p>
<p>“Most co-parents either figure out finances on their own ad hoc or rely on child support payments &#8212; however, child support only covers food, shelter and clothing, which is only half of the cost of raising a child,” Rome points out. The other half of expenses, including medical bills, extracurricular activities, transportation, etc., often end up being discussed by co-parents via text messages and spreadsheets.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132081" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132081" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2132081 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132081" class="wp-caption-text">Ensemble founder and CEO Jacklyn Rome. Image courtesy of Ensemble</p></div></p>
<p>Ensemble kicked off a six-month pilot in January 2020, when the credit-first version of the app went live. In April 2020, the dual functionality version &#8212; where two parents could connect their accounts &#8212; went live.</p>
<p>Since its App store launch last spring, Ensemble has seen “strong organic growth and referrals” from its users, according to Rome. Ensemble’s users, on average, are tracking over $1,000 per month in shared expenses for their children.</p>
<p>Roughly 30% of Ensemble’s downloads were organic in people discovering the app in the App Store, she said.</p>
<p>“Even in the most amicable divorces, money is the number one thing that divorced parents end up arguing about. In more contentious divorces, it often gets used as a power lever among two emotionally charged individuals with no other tools at their disposal,” Rome said. “We set out to build a product that eases tense communication about shared finances and serves the nuanced needs of separated parents.”</p>
<p>For now, the app is free. Ensemble plans to begin monetizing with the use of funds from its seed round.</p>
<p>Eventually, the company is planning to build out a paid subscription model. Over the long term, it’s also planning to expand beyond being an expense tracking app to offering a suite of financial products and primarily banking products, for things like shared credit cards with tight spending controls, Rome told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, we want to help make sure that the children of divorced parents are not at a financial disadvantage when it comes to building for their financial future,” she said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Are subscription services the future of fintech?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/are-subscription-services-the-future-of-fintech/embed/#?secret=wPMauT5GH4" data-secret="wPMauT5GH4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Rome founded Ensemble while she was an Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR) at<a href="https://co-created.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-Created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a venture studio based in New York, with support and funding from </span><a href="https://www.citi.com/ventures/d10x.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citi Ventures’ D10X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program.</span></p>
<p>“A key insight that Citi had given us was that for them as a bank, it&#8217;s incredibly hard to acquire new customers because people don&#8217;t often change banks,” Rome said. “One of the few times in life that people regularly change banks is when they get divorced. And that sparked the thought process around the pain points that people feel through their divorce, specifically as it relates to finances.”</p>
<p>Luis Valdich, managing director of venture investing at Citi Ventures, says the bank has been &#8220;tracking for some time&#8221; how the financial needs of individuals have been evolving given societal trends, while at the same time identifying potential investment opportunities in startups that address underserved needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;One growing gap is for divorced or separate parents to track and manage shared expenses,&#8221; Valdich said. &#8220;Ensemble solves this problem by striking the optimal balance of delivering ease of use, visibility and empathy for modern co-parents, minimizing the need for back-and-forth communications. While it is early, we found its user experience to be substantially superior to the alternatives in the market, and Jacklyn brings a unique perspective on the challenge Ensemble is trying to solve.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while he could not<span style="color: #000000;"> speak to specific plans between Citi and Ensemble, Valdich said that Citi Ventures&#8217; approach has always been to invest in companies with an eye toward future collaborations.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud that the majority of our portfolio has been commercialized within Citi and/or with Citi clients and we will certainly explore opportunities for collaboration when mutually convenient for both parties, as we always do,&#8221; Valdich added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TTV Capital Partner Mark Johnson said his firm has been investing in fintech for over 20 years and that it’s clear “people are craving digital tools to simplify communication and finances.”</p>
<p>He called Ensemble’s app “a sleek and simple platform” that addresses those needs for co-parents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://harlem.capital">Harlem Capital</a> is announcing that it has raised $134 million for its second fund — well above its target of $100 million and its initial cap of $125 million.</p>
<p>The firm was founded in 2015 by managing partners Henri Pierre-Jacques and Jarrid Tingle. It started out as an angel syndicate with the goal of investing in founders from diverse backgrounds, then announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/02/diversity-focused-vc-fund-harlem-capital-debuts-with-40m/">its first VC fund of $40 million</a> at the end of 2019. The firm&#8217;s investments include e-commerce companies <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pangaea, CashDrop, Malomo and Repeat, as well as wellness startups, Wellory, Expectful, Wagmo and Shine. </span></p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t invested all of that initial $40 million yet — the firm says it&#8217;s aiming to make five more investments from Fund I. Apparently 61% of Harlem Capital&#8217;s Fund I portfolio companies are led by Black or Latinx executives, while 43% are led exclusively by women. While the firm was founded in New York City&#8217;s Harlem neighborhood — where I live and am typing these words — it invests in startups across the United States.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, with Fund II, it&#8217;s shifting its focus to seed stage investments in companies that are post-product, aiming to invest between $750,000 and $1.5 million and take a 10% stake or more. The firm says it&#8217;s industry agnostic, but will be focusing on both consumer and enterprise tech with the new fund. It will also introduce the idea of &#8220;culture carry,&#8221; where the founders backed by the fund will split 1% of the carry — basically, they&#8217;re getting a stake in the fund&#8217;s profits and in each other&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>The focus on diversity extends to the limited partners who invested in Fund II, with 42% of LPs being women or people of color.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are focused on building an institution and platform to support diverse founders for many generations,&#8221; said Managing Partner Henri Pierre-Jacques in a statement. &#8220;Fund II is one step closer to our mission, but we know the work and journey continues. We are excited to provide more capital and resources to even more diverse founders tackling unique problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, Harlem Capital also announced that it had promoted Brandon Bryant to partner and Gabby Cazeau and Kelly Goldstein to principal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When investors gave Moveworks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/moveworks-snags-75m-series-b-to-resolve-help-desk-tickets-with-ai/">a hefty $75 million Series B</a> at the end of 2019, they were investing in a chatbot startup that to that point had been tuned to answer IT help question in an automated way. Today, the company announced it had used that money to expand the platform to encompass employee questions across all lines of business.</p>
<p>At the time of that funding, nobody could have anticipated a pandemic either, but throughout last year as companies moved to work from home, having an automated systems in place like Moveworks became even more crucial, says CEO and company co-founder Bhavin Shah.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a tragic year on a variety of fronts, but what it did was it coalesced a lot of energy around people&#8217;s need for support, people&#8217;s need for speed and help,&#8221; Shah said. It helps that employees typically access the Moveworks chatbot inside collaboration tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, and people have been spending more time in these tools while working at home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We definitely saw a lot more interest in the market, and part of that was fueled by the large scale adoption of collaboration tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams by enterprises around the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is working with 100 large enterprise customers today, and those customers were looking for a more automated way for employees to ask questions about a variety of tooling from HR to finance and facilities management. While Shah says expanding the platform to move beyond IT into other parts of an organization had been on the roadmap, the pandemic definitely underscored the need to expand even more.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chatbots spotlight machine learning&#8217;s trillion-dollar potential&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/chatbots-spotlight-machine-learnings-trillion-dollar-potential/embed/#?secret=9z8PVgF78B" data-secret="9z8PVgF78B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the company spent its first several years tuning the underlying artificial intelligence technology for IT language, they had built it with expansion in mind. &#8220;We learned how to build a conversational system so that it can be dynamic and not be predicated on some person&#8217;s forethought around [what the question and answer will be] &#8212; that approach doesn&#8217;t scale. So there were a lot of things around dealing with all these enterprise resources and so forth that really prepared us to be an enterprise-wide partner,&#8221; Shah said.</p>
<p>The company also announced a new communications tool that enables companies to use the Moveworks bot to communicate directly with employees to get them to take some action. Shah says companies usually send out an email that for example, employees have to update their password. The bot tells you it&#8217;s time to do that and provides a link to walk you through the process. He says that beta testers have seen a 70% increase in responses using the bot to communicate about an action instead of email.</p>
<p>Shah recognizes that a technology that understands language is going to have a lot of cultural variances and nuances and that requires a diverse team to build a tool like this. He says that his HR team has a set of mandates to make sure they are interviewing people in under-represented roles to build a team that reflects the needs of the customer base and the world at large.</p>
<p>The company has been working with about a dozen customers over the last 9 months on the platform expansion, iterating with these customers to improve the quality of the responses, regardless of the type of question or which department it involves. Today, these tools are generally available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>, one of a number of startups currently battling it out in London and beyond by promising to let you order everyday items on-demand from its own delivery-only stores, has quietly raised a new round of funding from leading VCs, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>According to multiple sources, Silicon Valley&#8217;s Lightspeed and Europe&#8217;s Atomico (the VC firm started by Skype founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/28/zennstroms-revolution/">Niklas Zennström</a>) have invested in Zapp&#8217;s unannounced Series A. Those same sources have also confirmed that Zapp has raised around $100 million in total, including via an earlier seed round.</p>
<p>In addition to Lightspeed and Atomico, other investors in Zapp include 468 Capital, and Burda, alongside notable angels such as Mato Peric, Christopher North (former Amazon UK CEO), and Stefan Smalla (Westwing CEO). One source tells me that the startup’s Series A is the first deal that consumer-focused partner, Sasha Astafyeva, has led on Atomico&#8217;s behalf <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/atomico-recruits-sasha-astafyeva-as-consumer-focused-partner-and-ex-googler-terese-hougaard-as-principal/">since joining</a> the London-headquartered VC firm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’re relentlessly focused on delighting our customers and generally do not comment on our capital structure. We are excited to bring Zapp to millions of customers in London and beyond this year,” said Zapp, in a statement issued to TechCrunch when asked about the Series A and list of investors.</p>

<p>Started last summer, Zapp’s founders are Joe Falter, who was part of the founding team at Jumia where he led the on-demand services business through to the group’s IPO, and Navid Hadzaad, who most recently was a product leader at Amazon&#8217;s Seattle HQ after founding GoButler and scaling several ventures at Rocket Internet. The leadership team also spans ex-employees of Deliveroo, Just Eat, Dominoes and Tesco, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Zapp operates a vertical or “dark store” model, seeing it set up its own micro fulfillment centers. They include several locations in London already: Kensington, Chelsea, Fulham, Notting Hill, Hammersmith, Shepherd&#8217;s Bush, Shoreditch, Islington and Angel.</p>
<p>Shunning the gig economy model used by companies like Deliveroo, Zapp employs its riders directly. It also emphasises sustainability and utilises an all-electric fleet.</p>
<p>From what we can glean online and through conversations with sources, Zapp also looks to be focusing less on fresh food/groceries and more on convenience a la goPuff in the U.S., thus targeting impulse purchases rather than trying to usurp the traditional grocery shop. This is in contrast to many of the other dark store competitors, although there is clearly cross-over in all of the offerings from a multitude of players.</p>
<p>Alongside Zapp, dark store operators in London alone include <a href="https://www.uktech.news/news/getir-10-minute-grocery-delivery-service-enters-london-20210202">Getir</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/">Gorillas</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/jiffy-grocery/">Jiffy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/dija-launch/">Dija</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a> &#8212; with some also raising and deploying significant amounts of capital, including, in some instances, employing heavy discounting as <a href="https://twitter.com/amyrlewin/status/1376476794635833347">the land grab</a> accelerates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the pandemic unfolded last year, demand for at-home fitness equipment skyrocketed, and Tonal was no exception. The maker of a smart home fitness trainer experienced an explosive increase in sales, and now the six-year-old San Francisco-based startup is gearing up for its next stage of growth. Tonal is adding $250 million of new funding in a Series E round valuing the startup at $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>Participants in the round include Dragoneer, Cobalt Capital, L Catterton, Sapphire Ventures, and athlete investors Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Maria Sharapova, Mike Tyson and Sue Bird. According to Tonal, the new funds will allow it to spend more on marketing its strength-training product to shoppers to increase brand visibility, grow its catalog of streamed fitness classes, and invest further in operations and scaling its business to meet increased demand. To date, the at-home fitness tech startup has raised $450 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really getting ready to scale the business: we&#8217;re pouring a lot more capital into marketing and brand awareness, and we&#8217;re pouring a lot more capital into scaling our supply chain to get ready for the next phase, which I really think is the next two holiday seasons,” says Orady.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of its efforts to increase staffing across the organization, Tonal also added three new executives to its bench: COO Shannon Crespin, a former Johnson &amp; Johnson executive; Chief Strategy Officer Gregory de Gunzburg, who previously served as Head of Corporate Strategy and Development at NBCUniversal; and CTO Bryan James, whose previous employers include Google, Nest, and Apple. Ostensibly, Crespin, de Gunzburg, and James will be crucial to Tonal’s next chapter, as the startup continues to scale on all fronts, including hardware and content production.</p>
<p>This latest round of funding and set of new hires are all steps the startup is taking as part of a slow march towards an IPO, says Orady, although Tonal’s chief executive declined to give a timeline regarding when the startup may go public.</p>
<p>“We’re going to IPO at a time when it’s best for the business, because being a public company can be incredibly distracting,” adds Orady. “I get SPAC offers, or inquiries almost daily, and our answer is consistently ‘no.’ While an IPO Is a great milestone for the business and gives us access to a certain class of capital and liquidity, we also know that you’ve got to do it at the right time.”</p>
<p>Founded in March 2015 by Orady, who was motivated to start Tonal by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-origin/">his own personal quest to shed weight and strength train</a>, Tonal has since carved out a reputation among fitness enthusiasts for an all-in-one design and digital weights system that enables the device to replicate different gym weight stations. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/">Extra Crunch’s EC-1 on Tonal</a>, published earlier this week, offers a unique deep dive into this rapidly growing fitness startup, exploring Tonal’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-origin/">origin story</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-launch/">product launch</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-community/">customer engagement strategy</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-future/">future outlook</a>.</p>

<p>Tonal’s Series E follows an extremely eventful year-and-a-half for the startup, which saw sales increase 800% from December 2019 to December 2020, causing delivery delays of between 10 to 12 weeks — an issue the company previously told TechCrunch it’s working to address by ramping up production of devices, increasing employee headcount, and air-shipping equipment from Taiwan to the U.S. to meet demand. This March, Tonal also announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/tonal-triples-its-physical-stores-with-nordstrom-partnership/">a new partnership with Nordstrom</a>, placing 50-square-foot stations in the women’s activewear departments of at least 40 Nordstrom locations across the U.S., bringing the total number of Tonal physical locations to 60 by the end of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech space and the Latin American venture scene are both booming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s no surprise that an increasing number of global investors are investing in fintech startups based in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clocktower-technology-ventures/investor_financials">Clocktower Technology Ventures (CTV)</a>, the investing affiliate of Santa Monica, California-based macro investment firm </span><a href="https://www.clocktowergroup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clocktower Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching in 2015, Clocktower Technology Ventures has invested in a total of 96 fintech companies in North America, Europe and Latin America &#8212; eight of which are in LatAm specifically. Those investments include</span><a href="https://miflink.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Flink</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a neobank, commission-free trading platform that recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/accel-backs-mexican-startup-flinks-effort-to-bring-investing-to-latin-america/">a $12 million Series A</a>;</span><a href="https://habi.co/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Habi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an iBuyer and listing service;</span><a href="https://kushkipagos.com/en/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kushki</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a digital payments processor; and</span><a href="https://www.ontop.ai/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ontop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an automated taxes, payroll and onboarding service for employers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now CTV is launching its first fund focused on investing exclusively in Latin American fintechs at the seed and Series A stages. The strategy has a target of $25 million. </span>Most of the capacity of the vehicle has already been taken by existing investors and a few strategics.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm is targeting about 40 investments out of the new fund “in the coming years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTV Partner Ben Savage said the affiliate’s strategy for Latin America is consistent with its approach to its flagship funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Across our investments, we’ve led zero deals, and we’ve taken zero board seats,” Savage said. “We expect to replicate this approach for our strategy in Latin America. We recognize it’s an unusual approach, but we believe we can add more incremental value by doing other things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By other “things,&#8221; the firm believes its ability to connect founders and startups to other players in the financial services space such as CIOs of “globally significant investors, hedge fund managers thought leaders and academics” can be even more beneficial than if it led a round or took a board seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTV will be looking at consumer and enterprise companies in Latin America, across the “entire spectrum” of financial services, including insurance, payments, personal finance, lending and credit, asset management, real estate finance and banking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some fintech VCs narrow the scope, we go the opposite direction,” Savage said. “We attempt to see as much as possible in the early-stage fintech landscape.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTV made its first investment in the region about one year ago (in Kushki). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had spent time before then getting to know the landscape and exploring it,” Savage told TechCrunch. “About six months ago, we realized just how good we believed the opportunity in Latin America to be, and we thought it made sense to pursue a purpose built financial innovation strategy in the region.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTV believes financial innovation in Latin America is “on the cusp of exponential growth” considering that a significant portion of the population is underbanked or unbanked. The COVID pandemic is expected to only accelerate the shift away from brick-and-mortar financial services there and everywhere, really.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Latin America&#8217;s digital transformation is making up for lost time&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/latin-americas-digital-transformation-is-making-up-for-lost-time/embed/#?secret=Id6Ilb0YFD" data-secret="Id6Ilb0YFD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm is also operating under the premise that “the oligopoly of financial services institutions has not been able to provide quality and robust services to its customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe this is partially attributed to regulation and market forces,” Savage said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the same way the modern tech stack unlocked a wave of tech startups at a high velocity, new fintech entrants, we think, will change the competitive dynamics for the financial services industry, especially in a region like Latin America,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the quality of entrepreneurial talent in the region has continued to grow, largely a byproduct of a number of well-established tech companies in the region (such as Rappi, Nubank and Loft) “having seeded the next generation of talent,&#8221; according to Savage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some really exciting tech companies, all of which have a financial services angle to them, are spitting out teams of very talented engineers and operators &#8212; this trend we’ve seen occur in the same fashion in Silicon Valley, New York, Los Angeles, etc., has generated an ecosystem of fintech alumni that go on and do great things,” he said. “In fact, in some cases we see entrepreneurs who have been successful in the U.S. return home to Latin America to build a new company. We think over time a large cohort of the next wave of technology companies will be folks who spun out of great businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LPs in the new fund include institutions such as Hirtle Callaghan, an outsourced investment office for families and institutions that manages about $18 billion, along with hedge fund CIOs such as Alan Howard, Philippe Jabre, Glen Kacher and John Burbank’s Passport Foundation.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huawei&#8217;s struggles amid U.S.-China trade tensions are driving it to seek opportunities in other smart devices, setting itself up against a raft of hardware makers at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The Chinese tech giant recorded sluggish <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/annual-report/2020">revenue growth in 2020</a>, climbing just <span class="s1">3.8% to 891.4 billion yuan ($136 billion), as its net profit grew 3.2% to 64.6 billion yuan. The results were in line with Huawei&#8217;s forecasts, the company said Wednesday at its annual report day in Shenzhen, a rare occasion to get a glimpse into the private entity&#8217;s financials.</span></p>
<p>To put the numbers in comparison, Huawei&#8217;s revenues were up <a href="https://www.huawei.com/uk/annual-report/2019">19%</a> and <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/annual-report/2018">19.5%</a> in 2019 and 2018, respectively.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The slowdown in 2020 was primarily due to a slump in Huawei&#8217;s overseas smartphone sales after U.S. export controls cut the firm off core chipsets and Google services critical to consumers. But the challenge has also sped up the firm&#8217;s pace to diversify and offset losses from its phone business.</p>
<p>For the past two years, Huawei&#8217;s has been ratcheting up efforts in a multitude of smart devices, including AR/VR headsets, tablets, laptops, TVs, smartwatches, speakers, headphones and in-car systems.</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s foray into the automotive industry has in particular attracted much limelight as the global smart vehicle industry booms. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-electric-exclusive-idUSKBN2AQ0KD">reported</a> recently that Huawei would be producing its own branded cars, which the company denied. At today&#8217;s event, the firm&#8217;s rotating chairman Ken Hu reiterated that Huawei would play to its own strengths and only be supplying certain car components and services, such as the in-car operating system and smart cockpit.</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s matrix of connected products is reminiscent of Xiaomi&#8217;s IoT strategy built around its smartphones and operating system, with the difference being that Huawei is also a telecom infrastructure supplier.</p>
<p>Despite moves by a few countries, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/uk-shrinks-timetable-for-telcos-to-stop-installing-5g-kit-from-huawei/">such as the United Kingdom</a>, to exclude Huawei from their 5G rollout plans, Huawei&#8217;s carrier segment in 2020 generated revenues on par with the year prior. The COVID-19 pandemic was a boon to the bsuiness, Hu said, which saw global demand in network solutions rise as people worked and learned from home.</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s IoT push has shown some early traction but competition is fierce. Smartwatches, it said, was one of its major revenue drivers from last year.</p>
<p>Globally, Apple held onto its leading position in wearables with 34.1% of the market in 2020, according to<a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47534521"> research firm IDC</a>. Huawei ranked third at 9.8%, trailing its domestic rival Xiaomi which accounted for 11.4% of total shipments last year.</p>
<p>Overall, Huawei was leaning heavily on its home market to sustain growth in 2020. China accounted for 65.5% of its total revenues, growing by 15.4% year-over-year. Meanwhile, revenues fell 12.2% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was down 8.7% in the rest of Asia and down 24.5% in the Americas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Independent music distribution platform and tool factory UnitedMasters has raised a $50M series B round led by Apple. A16z and Alphabet are participating again in this raise. United Masters is also entering a strategic partnership with Apple alongside this investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re unfamiliar with UnitedMasters, it’s a distribution </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/15/united-masters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company launched in 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Steve Stoute, a former Interscope and Sony Music executive. The focus of UnitedMasters is to provide artists with a direct pipeline to data around the way that fans are interacting with their content and community, allowing them to connect more directly to offer tickets, merchandise and other commercial efforts. UnitedMasters also generally allows artists to retain control of their own masters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither of these conditions are at all typical in the music industry. In a typical artist deal, recording companies retain all audience and targeting data as well as masters. This limits an artist’s ability to be agile, taking advantage of new technologies to foster a community. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Apple does invest in various companies, it typically does so out of its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to promote US manufacturing or strategically in partners that make critical components of its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/apple-to-invest-1-2-billion-in-silicon-design-center-in-germany/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hardware like silicon foundries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-awards-an-additional-250-million-from-advanced-manufacturing-fund-to-corning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">glass manufacturing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Apple does a lot more purchasing than investing, typically, buying a company every few weeks or so to supplement one product effort or another. UnitedMasters, then, would be a relatively unique partnership, especially in the music space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke to UnitedMasters CEO Steve Stoute about the deal and what it means for the businesses 1M current artists and new ones. Stoute credits Apple executive Eddy Cue having a philosophy aligned with the UnitedMasters vision with getting this deal done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want all artists to have the same opportunity,” says Stoute. “Currently, independent artists have less opportunity for success and we’re trying to remove that stigma.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This infusion, Stoute says, will be used to hire talent that are mission oriented to take UnitedMasters global. They’re seeking local technical talent and artists talent to build out the platform worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every artist needs access to a CTO,” Stoute says. “Some of the value of what a manager is today for an artist needs to be transferred to that role.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UnitedMasters wants to provide that technical edge at scale, allowing artists to build out their fanbase at a community level.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-1744264 alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?w=200" alt="" width="235" height="353" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg 3470w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=768,1151 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=454,680 454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=1025,1536 1025w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=1367,2048 1367w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, UnitedMasters has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/new-unitedmasters-deal-will-enable-its-artists-get-play-across-nba-properties/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deals with the NBA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ESPN, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/tiktoks-big-unitedmasters-deal-is-the-way-forward-for-creators-looking-to-secure-their-bag/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Twitch and others that allow artists to tap big brand deals that would normally be brokered by a label and manager. It also has a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/04/unitedmasters-releases-iphone-app-for-diy-cross-service-music-distribution/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">direct distribution app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows publishing to all of the major streaming services. Most importantly, they can check stream, fan and earnings data at a glance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Steve Stoute and UnitedMasters provide creators with more opportunities to advance their careers and bring their music to the world,” said Apple’s Eddy Cue in a release statement. “The contributions of independent artists play a significant role in driving the continued growth and success of the music industry, and UnitedMasters, like Apple, is committed to empowering creators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“UnitedMasters has completely transformed the way artists create, retain ownership in their work, and connect with their fans,” said Ben Horowitz, Co-Founder and General Partner of Andreessen Horowitz in a release. “We are excited to work with Steve and team to build a better, bigger, and far more profitable world for musical artists.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are currently at an inflection point in the way that artists and fans connect with one another. Though there have been seemingly endless ways for artists to get their messages out or speak to fans using social media and other platforms, the actual business of distributing work to a community and making money from that work has been out of their hands completely since the beginning of the recording industry. Recent developments like NFTs, DAOs and social tokens, as well as an explosion of DTC frameworks have begun to re-write that deal. But the major players have yet to make the truly aggressive strides they need to in order to embrace this ‘artist centric’ new world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mechanics of distribution have been based on a framework defined by DRM and the DMCA for decades. This framework was always </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way to protect value for the artist but was in fact </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">architected</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to protect value for the distributor. We need a rethinking of the entire distribution layer.</span></p>
<p>As I mentioned when reporting the UnitedMasters + TikTok deal, it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/tiktoks-big-unitedmasters-deal-is-the-way-forward-for-creators-looking-to-secure-their-bag/">going to be instrumental</a> in a more equitable future for artists:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s beyond time for the creators of The Culture to benefit from that culture. That’s why I find this UnitedMasters deal so interesting. Offering a direct pipeline to audiences without the attendant vulture-ism of the recording industry apparatus is really well-aligned with a platform like TikTok, which encourages and enables “viral sounds” with collaborative performances. Traditional deal structures are not well-suited to capturing viral hype, which can rise and fall within weeks without additional fuel.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In music, Apple is at the center of this maelstrom along with a few other major players like Spotify. One of the big misses in recent years for Apple Music, in my opinion, was Apple’s failure to turn Apple Music Connect into an industry-standard portal that allowed artists to connect broadly with fans, distribute directly, sell tickets and merchandise but &#8212; most importantly &#8212; to foster and own their community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A UnitedMasters tie up isn’t a straight line to that goal, but it’s definitely got the ingredients. I’m looking forward to seeing what this produces. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/mobile-financial-services-in-africa-winning-the-battle-for-the-customer">McKinsey report</a>, the total number of mobile money services worldwide was 282 in 2017, with more than half of those operating in sub-Saharan Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, these numbers increased </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly, but the ratio remained similar. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In 96 countries, there are 310 live mobile money services, according to a <a href="https://www.gsma.com/sotir/">GSMA report</a>. Out of that number, 171 are from Africa, while 157 are in sub-Saharan Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tanzania, mobile money services can be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> difficult to use due to unstable internet and high service fees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminf7">Benjamin Fernandes</a> noticed this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a national television host while building a mobile money service to enable people to pay for TV subscriptions in East Africa back in 2011</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six years later, he would start his own mobile money and wallet aggregator, <a href="https://www.iwantnala.com/">NALA</a>, to solve these issues. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its first mobile application allowed users to make mobile money payments and utilize mobile banking without an internet connection</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The business grew to 250,000 users in over a year after its official launch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the</span><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1844973/world-bank-remittances-to-africa-to-plunge-by-a-quarter/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">WorldBank predicted a sharp decline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of international remittances to Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even though Africa is still the most expensive region to send money to with averages of 10.6% in transaction fees, the opposite happened. There was an increase in remittance activity on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya, for instance, had its highest-ever inbound remittance at</span><a href="https://www.centralbank.go.ke/uploads/press_releases/1351561291_Press%20Release--Announcement%20of%20Diaspora%20Remittances%20Survey.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$3 billion</span></a>, while <span style="font-weight: 400;">WorldRemit acquired Sendwave in August 2020 for $500 million and Mama Money claimed to have grown 500% within the year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NALA also noticed an uptick in remittance requests where 1 in 7 users wanted to receive money internationally. This happened despite not being in that business at the time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not hard to see why: Presently, over 70% of money sent to Sub-Saharan Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is transacted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through physical stores. When many over-the-counter services were suspended or limited due to coronavirus restrictions, people were left with expensive, unreliable or hard-to-access alternatives</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined with the increasing trend for digital-first financial services and listening to some users&#8217; requests, NALA began testing international money transfers in August 2020 to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payments from the U.K. to Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By building a multi-currency ledger where people can send money from the U.K. to Tanzania and back to the U.K., Fernandes says NALA can build a <a href="https://wise.com/us">Wise</a> for Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> international payments are only 1% built today. Until you can send money both ways </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our work isn’t done,&#8221; Fernandes told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> African markets should be ‘sender’ markets, too; there is a lot of trade happening with other countries, and most of the money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is sent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via costly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bank wires or at physical stores</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It doesn’t need to be this way; it’s time for something better.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various platforms are trying to achieve this, but none specifically targets the East African region. That is NALA&#8217;s play, according to the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is where we see a big advantage for us. We are local, we understand mobile money, we built bill payments on our previous product, and this is an extension of that,&#8221; he added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since graduating as the first East African company from Y Combinator in 2019, <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/12236">NALA</a> has brought other interesting investors on board to support its mission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The most notable is Accel, which has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been kept</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under wraps for some time.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NALA also enlisted the services of</span><a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/nesteves"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicolas Esteves</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> who was the VP of engineering at Osper and had a stint at Monzo to become the company&#8217;s CTO which, according to Fernandes, will considerably improve the company&#8217;s chances of achieving its goal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we brought someone of his calibre on our team, it just opened up the doors of what we could accomplish because he has built multi-currency ledgers across different large companies.&#8221;   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.kaya.vc/">Kaya VC’s</a> new €72 million ($80m) fund will focus on startups in Prague, Warsaw and the wider CEE region.  Previously called Enern, the Central and Eastern European VC — which, historically, started out investing in wind-farms and ended up invested in software — has changed its name to better reflect its modern focus. The firm will also back startups “at any stage” of funding. LPs in the fund include the EIF and a number of successful entrepreneurs from the region.</p>
<p>This is the team’s fourth fund, and together with the previous funds, the AUM is around €250m. The fund has invested in 27 companies with the latest investments into B2B marketplaces, healthtech and blockchain. </p>
<p>The decade-old Prague-based VC (“KAYA” will be the official naming format) has previously invested in Booksy (raised $70 million in January 2021), Twisto (€16 million this year), DocPlanner (€80m in 2019), and Rohlik ($230m this year).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kaya says it will be sector agnostic, with partners following some personal passions: Tomas Obrtac on agri-tech; Pavel Mucha on next-generation consumer experiences; Tomas Pacinda on fintech, and Martin Rajcan focuses on energy transition. All other areas of tech will be looked at. Similar to funds such as Point Nine in Berlin, Kaya says it is an ‘equal partnership’ meaning each partner can make decisions on what to back.</p>
<p>The firm plans to be able to write the first cheque and is also backing super-early ‘studio projects’ which have gone on to raise subsequent funding rounds.</p>
<p>Pavel Mucha, partner at Kaya VC, commented in a statement: “When I initially started investing in local startups in Prague and Warsaw, it was because there was a need to work with people to build something valuable that didn’t exist already. Over the past 10 years, we’ve seen this sector grow and mature, and with that our strategy of backing intrepid founders who are making a difference from Booksy’s Stefan Batory to Rohlik&#8217;s Tomáš Čupr.”</p>
<p>Kaya is also part of the Included VC, network, a mentor network for underrepresented groups such as women and people of color. Mucha told me: “We’ve hired through their program, been closely involved and big supporters. We think it&#8217;s a great addition to the ecosystem within Europe, and hope to do more. It’s definitely a very meaningful initiative we stand fully behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin Rajcan, partner at Kaya VC, added: “Founders coming out of Central and Eastern Europe are globally-orientated, have strong technical skills, and an unmatched hunger for success. It’s these strong fundamentals paired with a next-level intensity that makes them so exciting to work with and we want to support such talent in any way we can. With partners, venture partners, advisors, and scouts across Europe, we’re in a unique position to support founders in the diaspora outside of core cities such as Prague and Warsaw.” </p>
<p>In Turkish the word Kaya means ‘rock’, in Japanese, it’s ‘sanctuary’. Whatever the case, Kaya is in a good position to take advantage of the burgeoning startups in the CEE region. According to Dealroom there has been 5x more foreign investment in the CEE region than in 2015. It&#8217;s also been the source of companies such as Skype, Wise (formerly TransferWise), Bolt and UiPath, which recently raised $750 million at a $35 billion valuation ahead of an IPO.</p>

<p>In a press statement, Qiming Venture Partners founding managing partner Duane Kuang said, “In the next ten to twenty years, blockchain will revolutionize the financial industry on a global scale. We believe that imToken is riding this trend, and has strongly positioned itself in the market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global logistics company Geodis has tapped startup Phantom Auto to help it deploy forklifts that can be controlled remotely by human operators located hundreds, and even thousands, of miles away.</p>
<p>The aim is to use the technology to reduce operator fatigue &#8212; and the injuries that can occur as a result &#8212; as well as reduce the number of people physically inside warehouses, according to the Geodis. The use of remotely operated forklifts won&#8217;t replace employees — just where they work. It&#8217;s that detail that Geodis, which often has operations outside of city centers, finds appealing.</p>
<p>Stéphanie Hervé, chief operating officer for Geodis&#8217; Western Europe, Middle East and Africa operations, told TechCrunch that use of the remotely operated forklifts will help the company attract a new group of workers, including those with physical disabilities. The intent isn&#8217;t to outsource workers to other countries, but to find more workers within a region, according to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Under the partnership, Phantom Auto&#8217;s remote operation software is integrated into KION Group forklifts. The forklifts are equipped with 2-way audio so that remote operators, which Geodis also describes as &#8216;digital drivers&#8217;, can communicate with their co-workers inside the warehouses.</p>

<p>Phantom Auto and Geodis have been working together for more than two years via pilot program conducted in Levallois and Le Mans, France. This announcement signals a deeper relationship and one that could be a boon for Phantom Auto.</p>
<p>The initial deployment is focused on France, Hervé said. For now, Phantom Auto&#8217;s software will be used to remotely operate forklifts in the initial pilot sites of Levallois and Le Mans and will then expand throughout the country over the next year. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Geodis employees at the two initial sites have already been trained to remotely operate the forklifts, Phantom Auto co-founder Elliot Katz said.  </span></p>
<p>Geodis&#8217; footprint extends far beyond the boundaries of France. The company has some 165,000 clients in 120 countries. They own 300 warehouses, which are located throughout the world, and also provide third-party logistics services to thousands of other customers, including Amazon and Shopify.</p>
<p>Phantom Auto&#8217;s tie-up with Geodis is another example of the company seeking business outside of the fledging autonomous vehicle industry, which was its initial focus. The company, founded in 2017, developed vehicle-agnostic software to remotely monitor, assist operate fleets of unmanned vehicles such as forklifts, robots, trucks and passenger vehicles.</p>
<p>The company is adjacent to the AV industry. While AV operators rarely talk publicly about the need for teleoperations, it is viewed as a necessary support system to commercially deploy robotaxis and for other AV applications. But as autonomous vehicle developers pushed back timelines to commercialize the technology, Phantom Auto expanded into new areas.</p>
<p>Phantom Auto, which has raised $25 million to date, expanded a logistics business targeting sidewalks, warehouses and cargo yards, all the places where autonomy and teleoperation are being deployed today.</p>
