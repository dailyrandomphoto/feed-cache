										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hundreds of thousands of used cars are sold in India each month. But buying one through the offline and traditional channel could prove to be a painstakingly long and high-risk process.</p>
<p>A Gurgaon-based startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/indias-spinny-raises-43-7m-to-expand-its-online-platform-for-selling-used-cars/">attempting to improve this experience</a> said on Thursday it has raised a new financing round.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spinny.com/">Spinny</a> has raised $65 million in its Series C financing round, the five-year-old Indian startup said. The new round was led by Silicon Valley-headquartered venture firm General Catalyst, while Feroz Dewan’s Arena Holdings, Think Investments, and existing investors Fundamentum Partnership &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/india-the-fundamentum-partnership/">backed by tech veterans Nandan Nilekani and Sanjeev Aggarwal</a> &#8212; and Elevation Partners participated in it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round, which brings Spinny’s to-date raise to over $120 million, valued the startup at about $350 million, up from about $150 million a year ago, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The startup declined to comment on the valuation.</p>
<p>Spinny operates a platform to facilitate sale and purchase of used cars. One of the biggest challenges people face in buying a used car is the trust factor, and Niraj Singh, co-founder and chief executive of Spinny, says the startup’s thorough and transparent inspection of the car, buying it from the owner, and then selling it to customers is addressing those concerns.</p>
<p>The startup says it is removing the traditional middlemen from the equation, thereby making it more affordable and reliable for customers to buy a used car. If a customer is not satisfied with the car that they have purchased from Spinny, they get their full-refund, he said.</p>
<p>Spinny began its journey as a marketplace for used cars, but Singh said the startup has expanded its offerings to become a full-stack platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135671" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135671" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2135671 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="468" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg 1496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=768,351 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=680,311 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135671" class="wp-caption-text">Used car marketed is estimated to grow at 22% CAGR to 7.2mn cars sold per year. (BoFA research)</p></div></p>
<p>Days after one of my previous conversations with Singh, New Delhi announced a months-long lockdown in the nation as it moved to contain the spread of the pandemic. Singh said the pandemic did hurt Spinny&#8217;s business for a few months, but the startup has long recovered its pre-pandemic growth figures.</p>
<p>The pandemic made many cautious about taking an Uber or Ola ride, and explore buying their own cars, which accelerated the growth, said Singh. It also significantly reduced the CAC (customer acquisition cost) for Spinny, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe Spinny is uniquely positioned to tap this opportunity&#8211;given their compelling leadership and their real market momentum. As long time investors, we&#8217;ve been impressed by how Spinny is reinventing every part of the buying process &#8211; injecting trust and safety into every aspect of the customer experience,” said Adam Valkin, General Partner at General Catalyst, in a statement.</p>
<p>Spinny, which was operational in five Indian cities last year, plans to expand to 15 cities by the end of 2021, and also deploy part of the fresh fund to broaden its full-stack platform, said Singh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spinny has become India&#8217;s most trusted used car brand and is on its way to becoming India&#8217;s largest as well. It&#8217;s heartening to hear customers describe the experience of buying a used car from Spinny being better than that of buying a new car. This has been made possible because of Niraj and the entire Spinny team&#8217;s customer obsession and relentless execution. We are privileged to be their early partners and super excited to double down in this round,&#8221; said Mukul Arora, Partner at Elevation Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow later&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food delivery startups, and specifically those focused on grocery delivery, continue to reap super-sized rounds of funding in Europe, buoyed by a year of pandemic living that has led many consumers to shift to shopping online. Today, the latest of these is coming out of Norway.</p>
<p><a href="https://kolonial.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kolonial</a>, a startup based out of Oslo that offers same-day or next-day delivery of food, meal kits and home essentials &#8212; its aim is to provide &#8220;a weekly shop&#8221; for prices that compete against those of traditional supermarkets &#8212; has raised €223 million ($265 million) in an equity round of funding. Along with that, the company &#8212; profitable as of last year &#8212; is rebranding to <a href="https://oda.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oda</a> and plans to use the money (and new name) to expand to more markets, starting first with Finland and then Germany in 2022.</p>
<p>The market for online grocery ordering and delivery is gearing up to be a very crowded one, with hundreds of millions of dollars being poured by investors into the fuel tanks of a range of startups &#8212; each originating out of different geographies, each with a slightly different approach. Oda believes it has the right mix to end up at the front of the pack.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have found ourselves in a unique position,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Karl Munthe-Kaas said in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;We have built a service targeting the mass market with instant deliveries and low prices, because if you want to capture the full basket for the family, you can’t be a premium service. We&#8217;ve done that, and we&#8217;re profitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now, it will have the backing of two e-commerce heavyweights for its next steps. SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2 and Prosus (the tech holdings of South Africa&#8217;s Naspers), are co-leading the round, with past backers Kinnevik and a strategic investor, Norwegian &#8220;<a href="https://www.ieseinsight.com/doc.aspx?id=1125" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soft discount</a>&#8221; chain REMA, also participating.</p>
<p>Munthe-Kaas confirmed to TechCrunch in an interview that Oda is valued at €750 million ($900 million) post-money.</p>
<p>The funding is a big leap for Oda (the name is not officially going to come into effect until the end of this month, although the company is already describing itself with the new brand, so we&#8217;ll follow that lead). <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/154887-22/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a> notes that before this round, Oda had only raised about $96 million, and its last valuation was estimated to be just $178 million in 2017.</p>
<p>The company has certainly come a long way. Founded in 2013 by ten friends, Kolonial originally seemed to have a more modest vision when it first started out: Kolonial in Norwegian doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;colonial&#8221; (a connotation Munthe-Kaas nevertheless said the startup wanted to avoid, one big reason for the change), but &#8220;cornershop.&#8221; These days, Oda is focused more on competing against large supermarkets &#8212; its average order size is $120 &#8212; yet with a significantly more efficient cost base behind the scenes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also been helped by the current climate. Online grocery shopping has been growing and maturing for a while now, but the last year been a veritable hothouse in that process: Covid-19, shelter in place orders and a general desire for people to keep their distance all compelled many more consumers to try out online grocery shopping for the first time, and many have stuck with it.</p>
<p>“We have seen a significant inflection point with grocery over the last year with the market transitioning online, accelerated by Covid,&#8221; said Larry Illg, CEO of Prosus Food, in a statement. &#8220;Oda’s leadership and impressive growth in Norway paired with its ground-breaking technology and ambition to scale across Europe and beyond makes them an ideal partner to tackle the grocery opportunity over the coming years.”</p>
<p>Oda has over the years grown to become the sector leader in a category it arguably helped define in its home country. It was profitable last year on revenues of €200 million, and it currently controls some 70% of Norway&#8217;s online grocery ordering and delivery market based on its own particular approach to the model.</p>
<p>That model involves Oda building and controlling its own supply chains from producers to consumers (no partnerships with third y partphysical retailers), producing several of the products itself (such as baked goods) to order, and using centralized fulfillment centers to manage orders for large geographies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Centralized warehouses means 50 supermarkets in one location,&#8221; Munthe-Kaas said, adding that this also makes the business significantly greener, too.</p>
<p>Those fulfillment centers, meanwhile, are operated at &#8220;extreme efficiency&#8221;, in his words. Oda&#8217;s grocery item picking averages out at 212 units per hour &#8212; that is, the amount of items &#8220;picked&#8221; for orders in a week divided by the number of hours in a week. The next closest UPH number in the industry, Munthe-Kaas said, was Ocado in the UK at 170 UPH, and the norm, he added, was more like 100 UPH, with physical store picking (where customers select items from shelves themselves) averaging out at 70 UPH.</p>
<p>All of this translates to much more cost-effective operations, including more efficient ordering and stock rotation, which helps Oda make better margins on its sales overall. Munthe-Kaas declined to go into the details of how Oda manages to get such high UPH numbers &#8212; that&#8217;s competitive knowledge, he said &#8212; noting only that a lot of automation and data analytics goes into the process.</p>
<p>That will be music to the ears of SoftBank, which has had a complicated run in e-commerce in the last several years, backing a number of interesting juggernauts that have nonetheless found themselves unable to improve on challenging unit economics.</p>
<p>“Oda’s leading position in Norway is testament to the merits of its bespoke and data-driven approach in offering a personalised, holistic and reliable online grocery experience,” said Munish Varma, managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “We believe that Oda’s customer-centric focus, market-leading automation technology and fulfillment efficiency are a winning combination, and position Oda for success in scaling internationally for the benefit of customers and suppliers alike.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>The big challenge for Oda going forward will be whether it can transplant its business model as it has been developed for Norway into further markets.</p>
<p>Oda will not only be looking for customer traction for its own business, but it will be doing so potentially against heavy competition from others also looking to expand outside their borders.</p>
<p>There are other online supermarket plays like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/czech-on-demand-grocery-delivery-startup-rohlik-bags-230m-to-expand-across-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rohlik</a> out of the Czech Republic (which in March bagged $230 million in funding); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/everli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everli</a> out of Italy (formerly called Supermercato24, it also raised $100 million); <a href="https://ecommercenews.eu/picnic-doubles-revenue-eyes-expansion-to-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Picnic</a> out of the Netherlands (which has yet to announce any recent funding but it feels like it&#8217;s only a matter of time given it too has <a href="https://ecommercenews.eu/picnic-doubles-revenue-eyes-expansion-to-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly laid out international ambitions</a>); and Ocado in the UK (which also has <a href="http://techmeme.com/200612/p23#a200612p23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised huge amounts of money</a> to pursue its own international ambitions).</p>
<p>And there is also the wave of companies that are building more fleet-of-foot approaches around smaller inventories and much faster turnaround times, the idea being that this can cater both to individuals and a different way of shopping &#8212; smaller and more often &#8212; even if you are a family.</p>
<p>Among these so-called &#8220;q-commerce&#8221; (quick commerce) players, covering just some of the most recent funding rounds, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a> just last week raised $528 million; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorillas</a> in Berlin raised $290 million; Turkey’s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/getir-becomes-a-unicorn-with-2-6bn-valuation-301256950.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getir</a> — also rapidly expanding across Europe — picked up $300 million on a $2.6 billion valuation as Sequoia took its first bite into the European food market; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/zapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly Zapp</a> in London has also closed $100 million in funding.</p>
<p>Deliveroo, which went public last week, is also now delivering groceries (in partnership with Sainsbury&#8217;s) alongside its restaurant delivery service.</p>
<p>These, ironically, are more cornershop replacements than Oda itself (formerly called Kolonia, or &#8220;cornershop&#8221; in Norwegian), and Munthe-Kaas said he sees them as &#8220;complementary&#8221; to what Oda does.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">Indeed, Munthe-Kaas remains very committed to the basic rulebook that Oda has lived by for years.</div>
<div>
<p class="p5">&#8220;You need to beat the physical stores on quality, selection and price and get it home delivered,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a margin business and the only way to optimize is to be completely relentless.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he also understands that this might ultimately need to be modified depending on the market. For example, while the company has not worked with other retailers in Norway &#8212; even the investment by REMA is not for distribution but for better economies of scale in procuring products that REMA and Oda will sell independently from each other &#8212; this might be a route that Oda chooses to take in other markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re in discussions with several other retailers, wholesalers and producers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s important to get sourcing terms and have upstream logistics, but there are many ways of achieving that. We are super open to making partnerships on that front, but we still think the way to win is to run the value chain.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ShareChat said on Thursday it has raised a new financing round that values it at over $2 billion, joining <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">four other local startups</a> in attaining the unicorn status this week.</p>
<p>The Indian social network said it has raised $502 million in a new financing round &#8212; Series E &#8212; led by Tiger Global that valued ShareChat at $2.1 billion, up from about $650 million last year. Snap and existing investors Twitter and Lightspeed Venture Partners also participated in the round, said ShareChat, which has raised about $765 million to date.</p>
<p>The six-year-old startup began engaging with investors for new funds about 10 months ago, and explored a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/twitter-explored-buying-indian-startup-sharechat-and-positioning-moj-as-a-global-tiktok-rival/">full buy out deal with Twitter</a>, which didn&#8217;t materialize, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ShareChat, which claims to have over 160 million users, offers its social network app in 15 Indian languages and has a large following in small Indian cities and towns, or what venture capitalist Sajith Pai of Blume Ventures refer as “India 2.” Very few players in the Indian startup ecosystem have a reach to this segment of this population, which thanks to users from even smaller towns and villages — called “India 3” — getting online has expanded in recent years.</p>
<p>Last year, the Bangalore-based startup launched Moj &#8212; a short-form video app that it says has already amassed over 80 million monthly active users &#8212; to fill the void left after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">New Delhi banned TikTok</a>, which counted India as its biggest international market prior to being blocked. Snap <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-and-snap-in-talks-to-invest-in-india-social-network-sharechat/">inked a deal with ShareChat</a> to integrate its Camera Kit into the Indian short-video app earlier this year. (Thursday&#8217;s deal is Snap&#8217;s first investment in an Indian startup.)</p>
<p>Moj competes with a handful of players including Times Internet&#8217;s MX TakaTak, which currently leads the market with over 100 million monthly active users, and Glance&#8217;s Roposo and DailyHunt&#8217;s Josh &#8212; both of which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">received funding from Google late last year</a>. The search giant was also in talks to invest in ShareChat late last year, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we saw a large vacuum emerge on June 29 with a lot of short-video apps exiting the market — we knew this opportunity was for us. There were millions of short-video creators already trained for creating that content supply. The real game was therefore going to be on building the most relevant feed for the user and we were the only Indian company that had built a world-class feed recommendation system for short-form content,&#8221; wrote Ankush Sachdeva, co-founder and chief executive of ShareChat in a blog post. &#8220;We built the app in 30 hours. Scaled it to 120mn MAUs in 9 months.&#8221;</p>
<p>ShareChat, which began its life on Facebook and WhatsApp groups, has started to experiment with monetization in recent years. On its app, for instance, ShareChat allows commerce platforms to interact with customers via its audio chat rooms. It also quietly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/twitter-backed-sharechat-eyes-fantasy-sports-in-india/">launched a fantasy sports app called Jeet</a> early last year, as reported first by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are at a significant inflection point in our company’s journey — as the internet penetration further deepens in India we are well-positioned to expand our ecosystem of products to 1 Billion+ MAUs cumulatively. We have seen how large the short-video market is in China — with around 80% of the entire Internet population using one of the short-video products(Douyin, Kuaishou etc) daily,&#8221; wrote Sachdeva.</p>
<p>ShareChat is the ninth Indian startup to become a unicorn this year &#8212; and fifth this week. Social commerce Meesho <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/">turned a unicorn on Monday</a>, fintech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">CRED on Tuesday</a> and e-pharmacy firm PharmEasy and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">Groww on Thursday</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">About a year after Beyond Meat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/beyond-meat-china-alibaba/">debuted in China</a> on Starbucks&#8217;s menu, the Californian plant-based protein company opened a production facility near Shanghai to tap the country&#8217;s supply chain resources and potentially reduce the carbon footprint of its products.</p>
<p>Situated in Jiaxing, a city 85 km from Shanghai, the plant is Beyond Meat&#8217;s first end-to-end manufacturing facility outside the U.S., the Nasdaq-listed company said in an announcement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Over the past year, competition became steep in China&#8217;s alternative protein space with the foray of foreign players like Beyond Meat and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/eat-just-china-dicos/">Eat Just</a>, as well as a slew of capital injections for domestic startups including Hey Maet and Starfield.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Beyond Meat doesn&#8217;t flinch at the rivalry. When asked by TechCrunch to comment on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/beyond-meat-china-alibaba/">story</a> about China&#8217;s alternative protein scene, a representative of the company said &#8220;there are none that Beyond Meat considers their competitors.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zCXuw19QKL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/plant-based-meat-startups-china/">Chinese startups rush to bring alternative protein to people&#8217;s plates</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chinese startups rush to bring alternative protein to people&#8217;s plates&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/plant-based-meat-startups-china/embed/#?secret=zCXuw19QKL" data-secret="zCXuw19QKL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>China not only has an enormous, unsaturated market for meat replacements; it&#8217;s also a major supplier of plant-based protein. Chinese meat substitute startups enjoy a cost advantage from the outset and don&#8217;t lack interest from investors who race to back consumer products that are more reflective of the tastes of the rising middle class.</p>
<p>Having some kind of manufacturing capacity in China is thus almost a prerequisite for any serious foreign player. Tesla has done it before to build Gigafactory in Shanghai to deliver cheaper electric vehicles. Localized production also helps companies advance their sustainability goals as it shortens the supply chain.</p>
<p>In Beyond Meat&#8217;s own words, the Jiaxing facility is &#8220;expected to significantly increase the speed and scale in which the company can produce and distribute its products within the region while also improving Beyond Meat’s cost structure and sustainability of operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The American food-tech giant works hard on localization, selling in China both its flagship burger patties and an imitation minced pork product made specifically for the world&#8217;s largest consumer of pork. The soy- and rice-based minced pork could be used in a wide range of Chinese cuisines and is the result of a collaboration between the firm&#8217;s Shanghai and Los Angeles teams.</p>
<p>Besides production, the Jiaxing plant will also take on R&amp;D responsibilities to invent new products for the region. Beyond Meat will also be unveiling its first owned manufacturing facility in Europe this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are committed to investing in China as a region for long-term growth,&#8221; said Ethan Brown, CEO and founder of Beyond Meat. &#8220;We believe this new manufacturing facility will be instrumental in advancing our pricing and sustainability metrics as we seek to provide Chinese consumers with delicious plant-based proteins that are good for both people and planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond Meat products can now be found in Starbucks, KFC, Alibaba&#8217;s Hema supermarket and other retail channels across major Chinese cities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/17/spotify-is-test-driving-a-car-hardware-thing-called-car-thing/">began testing</a> a hardware device for automobile owners it lovingly dubbed &#8220;<a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-05-17/5-things-to-know-about-spotifys-latest-test/">Car Thing</a>,&#8221; which allowed Spotify Premium users to play music and podcasts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-17-spotify-car-thing-voice-assistant-device.html">using voice commands</a> that began with &#8220;Hey, Spotify.&#8221; Last year, Spotify <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1235350117802283011">began developing</a> a similar voice integration into its mobile app. Now, access to the &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; voice feature is rolling out more broadly.</p>
<p>Spotify chose not to officially announce the new addition, despite numerous reports indicating the voice option was showing up for many people in their Spotify app, leading to some user confusion about availability.</p>
<p>One early report by <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/handsfree_hey_spotify_wake_word_rolls_out-news-48521.php">GSM Arena,</a> for example, indicated Android users had been sent a push notification that alerted them to the feature. The notification advised users to <em>&#8220;Just enable your mic and say &#8216;Hey Spotify, Play my Favorite Songs.&#8221;</em> When tapped, the notification launched Spotify&#8217;s new voice interface where users are pushed to first give the app permission to use the microphone in order to be able to verbally request the music they want to hear.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2135493" style="width: 307px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135493" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2135493" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?w=297" alt="" width="297" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg 652w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?resize=66,150 66w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?resize=131,300 131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?resize=297,680 297w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?resize=22,50 22w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135493" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/handsfree_hey_spotify_wake_word_rolls_out-news-48521.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSM Arena <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Several outlets soon reported the feature had launched to Android users, which is only partially true.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the feature is making <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/07/hey-spotify-starts-roll-out-iphone/">its way to iOS devices</a>, as well. When we launched the Spotify app here on an iPhone running iOS 14.5, for instance, we found the same feature had indeed gone live. You just tap on the microphone button by the search box to get to the voice experience. We asked around and found that other iPhone users on various versions of the iOS operating system also had the feature, including free users, Premium subscribers and Premium Family Plan subscribers.</p>
<p>The screen that appears suggests in big, bold text that you could be saying <em>&#8220;Hey Spotify, play&#8230;&#8221;</em> followed by a random artist&#8217;s name. It also presents a big green button at the bottom to turn on &#8220;Hey Spotify.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once enabled, you can ask for artists, albums, songs and playlists by name, as well as control playback with commands like stop, pause, skip this song, go back and others. Spotify confirms the command with a robotic-sounding male voice by default. (You can swap to a female voice in Settings, if you prefer.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135491" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135491" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2135491" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135491" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify screenshot iOS</p></div></p>
<p>This screen also alerts users that when the app hears the &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; voice command, it sends the user&#8217;s voice data and other information to Spotify. There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/voice-controls/plain/">a link to Spotify policy regarding its use of voice data</a>, which further explains that Spotify will collect recordings and transcripts of what you say along with information about the content it returned to you. The company says it may continue to use this data to improve the feature, develop new voice features and target users with relevant advertising. It may also share your information with service providers, like cloud storage providers.</p>
<p>The policy looks to be the same as the one that was used along with Spotify&#8217;s voice-enabled ads,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/spotify-launches-voice-enabled-ads-on-mobile-devices-in-a-limited-u-s-test/"> launched last year</a>, so it doesn&#8217;t seem to have been updated to fully reflect the changes enabled with the launch of &#8220;Hey Spotify.&#8221; However, it does indicate that, like other voice assistants, Spotify doesn&#8217;t just continuously record &#8212; it waits until users say the wake words.</p>
<p>Given the &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; voice command&#8217;s origins with &#8220;Car Thing,&#8221; there&#8217;s been speculation that the mobile rollout is a signal that the company is poised to launch its own hardware to the wider public in the near future. There&#8217;s already some indication that may be true &#8212; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/02/spotify-ios-app-car-thing-images/">MacRumors recently reported</a> finding references and photos to Car Thing and its various mounts inside the Spotify app&#8217;s code. This follows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231876/spotify-car-thing-fcc-design-screen-pictures-photos">Car Thing&#8217;s reveal in FCC filings</a> back in January of this year, which had also stoked rumors that the device was soon to launch.</p>
<p>Spotify was reached for comment this morning, but has yet been unable to provide any answers about the feature&#8217;s launch despite a day&#8217;s wait. Instead, we were told that they &#8220;unfortunately do not have any additional news to share at this time.&#8221; That further suggests some larger projects could be tied to this otherwise more minor feature&#8217;s launch.</p>

<p>Though today&#8217;s consumers are wary of tech companies&#8217; data collection methods &#8212; and particularly their use of voice data after all <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/amazon-adds-alexa-delete-what-i-said-today-command/">three</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-ordered-to-halt-human-review-of-voice-ai-recordings-over-privacy-risks/">tech</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/siri-recordings-regularly-sent-to-apple-contractors-for-analysis-claims-whistleblower/">giants</a> confessed to poor practices on this front &#8212; there&#8217;s still a use case for voice commands, particularly from an accessibility standpoint and, for drivers, from a safety standpoint.</p>
<p>And although you can direct your voice assistant on your phone (or via CarPlay or Android Auto, if available) to play content from Spotify, some may find it useful to be able to speak to Spotify directly &#8212; especially since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apple-clarifies-you-cant-actually-set-a-default-music-service-in-ios-14-5/">Apple doesn&#8217;t allow Spotify to be set as a default music service.</a> You can only<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apple-clarifies-you-cant-actually-set-a-default-music-service-in-ios-14-5/"> train Siri to launch Spotify as your preferred service.</a></p>
<p>If, however, you have second thoughts about using the &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; feature after enabling it, you can turn it off under &#8220;Voice Interactions&#8221; in the app&#8217;s settings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter held talks with Clubhouse around a potential acquisition of the live drop-in audio networking platform, with a deal value somewhere around $4 billion, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/twitter-is-said-to-have-discussed-4-billion-clubhouse-takeover?sref=gni836kR">report from Bloomberg</a>. TechCrunch has also confirmed the discussions took place from a source familiar with the conversations.</p>
<p>While the talks occurred over the past several months, they&#8217;re no longer taking place, though the reason they ended isn&#8217;t known according to the report. It&#8217;s also worth noting that just a few days ago, Bloomberg reported that Clubhouse was seeking to raise a new round of funding at a valuation of around $4 billion, but the report detailing the potential acquisition talks indicate that the discussions with Twitter collapsed first, leading to a change in strategy to pursue securing additional capital in exchange for equity investment.</p>
<p>Twitter has its own product very similar to Clubhouse — Spaces, a drop-in audio chatroom feature that it has been rolling out gradually to its user base over the past few months. Clubhouse, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clubhouse-payments/">just launched the first of its monetization efforts, Clubhouse Payments,</a> which lets users send direct payments to other creators on the platform, provided that person has enabled receipt of said payments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Interestingly, the monetization effort from Clubhouse actually doesn&#8217;t provide them with any money; instead, it&#8217;s monetization for recipient users who get 100% of the funds directed their way, minus a small cut for processing that goes directly to Stripe, the payment provider Clubhouse is using to enable the virtual tips.</p>
<p>While we aren&#8217;t privy to the specifics of these talks between Twitter and Clubhouse, it does seem like an awfully high price tag for the social network to pay for the audio app, especially given its own progress with Spaces. Clubhouse&#8217;s early traction has been undeniable, but there are a lot of questions still remaining about its longevity, and it&#8217;s also being cloned left and right by other platforms, begging the age-old startup question of whether it&#8217;s a feature or a product on its own.</p>
<p>Whatever went down, the timing of this revelation seems likely to prime the pump for Clubhouse&#8217;s conversation with potential investors at its target valuation for the round it&#8217;s looking to raise. Regardless, it&#8217;s exciting to have this kind of activity, buzz and attention paid to a consumer software play after many years of what one could argue has been a relatively lackluster period for the category.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the classification of ride-hail drivers as &#8220;essential workers&#8221; during the early days of the pandemic, last April </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-05-07/uber-reports-first-ever-decline-in-rides-booked-business-drops-by-80-video"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber’s business dropped by 80%.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Drivers decided they’d rather not risk contracting or spreading COVID-19 for the measly revenue provided by the few rides per day they were getting, so when the federal CARES Act extended the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance to gig workers, many Uber drivers decided to hang up their keys. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/?sref=a2d7LMhq"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more than a quarter of the U.S. population already vaccinated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Uber is now in a sticky situation wherein there are more riders requesting trips than there are drivers available. The ride-hailing giant not only wants drivers to know that there’s business to be had once again, but they also want to sweeten the deal with incentives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the company <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/getting-drivers-back-on-the-road/">announced the launch of a $250 million driver stimulus</a> to welcome drivers back into the fold and recruit new ones as the pandemic begins to ease in the U.S. Both returning drivers and new drivers will be receiving bonuses over the coming months, according to an Uber spokesperson.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2020, many drivers stopped driving because they couldn’t count on getting enough trips to make it worth their time,” reads the blog post announcing the stimulus. “In 2021, there are more riders requesting trips than there are drivers available to give them — making it a great time to be a driver.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to high rider demand and low supply of drivers, the current median hourly rate for cities like Philadelphia, Austin, Chicago, Miami and Phoenix is $26.66, which is 25% to 75% higher than they were in March of last year. Uber wants drivers to take advantage of the higher earnings now because “this is likely a temporary situation.” Meaning as the country recovers and more gig workers get back behind the wheel, earnings will likely decrease from their current levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stimulus money will go on top of those hourly rates, a spokesperson told TechCrunch. The incentive structure will be based on individual activity, as well as location. For example, in Austin, current drivers are guaranteed $1,100 if they complete 115 trips. In Phoenix, they can earn an extra $1,775 for 200 trips. </span></p>
<div>&#8220;We will have more guarantees coming in both those cities as well as all the other markets we are targeting in the U.S. &#8211; the dollar and trip amounts may just change slightly depending on local factors,&#8221; said the spokesperson.</div>
<p>The money will also go toward guaranteed minimum pay and on-boarding for new Uber drivers, and t<span style="font-weight: 400;">he full $250 million pool is coming directly from Uber’s pockets. The company’s shares declined as much as 3.6% during trading on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is also aiming to help streamline the process of getting drivers vaccinated </span><a href="https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/uber-walgreens-partner-get-covid-19-vaccines-new-jersey-drivers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with an in-app booking portal as part of its partnership with Walgreens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to clarify that the example incentives for Austin and Phoenix refer to financial guarantees offered to current drivers in the past few weeks.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest today hosted an event focused on its creator community, where the company announced a series of updates including the launch of a $500,000 Creator Fund, a new content policy called the Creator Code, as well as new moderation tools, among other things. With the changes, the company says its goal is to ensure the platform continues to be an &#8220;inclusive, positive and inspiring place.&#8221; The new content guidelines put that into more specific terms as it requires Pinterest creators to fact-check content, practice inclusion, be kind and ensure any call to action they make via the site doesn&#8217;t cause harm.</p>
<p>Creators will be required to agree and sign the code during the publishing process for Story Pins, where they tap a button that says &#8220;I agree&#8221; to statements that include &#8220;Be kind,&#8221; &#8220;Check my facts,&#8221; &#8220;Be aware of triggers,&#8221; &#8220;Practice inclusion&#8221; and &#8220;Do no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135375" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135375" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135375" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135375" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The code will be enforced the same way Pinterest today applies its rules for its other content policies: a combination of machine learning and human review, Pinterest tells us. However, the site&#8217;s algorithm will be designed to reward positive content and block harmful content, <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/bringing-authoritative-vaccine-results-to-pinterest-search">like anti-vaccination sentiments,</a> for example. This could have a larger impact on what sort of content is shared on Pinterest, rather than a pop-up agreement with simple statements.</p>
<p>The Creator Code itself is not yet live, but will roll out to creators to sign and adopt in the weeks ahead, Pinterest says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135371" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135371" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png 4293w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>Pinterest today also introduced several new creator tools focused on the similar goal of making Pinterest a more positive, safe experience for all.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s launching comment moderation tools that will allow creators to remove and filter comments on their content, as well as tools that will allow them to feature up to three comments in the comment feed to highlight positive feedback. New spam prevention tools will help to clear out some of the unwanted comments, too, by leveraging machine learning technology to detect and remove bad comments.</p>
<p>Also new are &#8220;positivity reminders,&#8221; which will pop up asking Pinterest users to reconsider before posting potentially offensive comments. The notification will push users to go back and edit their comment, but doesn&#8217;t prevent them from posting.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135373" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135373" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135373" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png 4293w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135373" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>Related to these efforts, Pinterest announced the launch of its first-ever Creator Fund at today&#8217;s event. The fund is specifically focused on elevating creators from underrepresented communities in the United States and will offer a combination of creative strategy consulting and compensating them with budget for content creation and ad credits. At least 50% of the fund&#8217;s recipients will be from underrepresented groups, Pinterest says.</p>
<p>The company tells us it&#8217;s initially committed to giving creators $500,000 in cash and media throughout 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first participants of the program, we worked with eight emerging creators across fashion, photography, food and travel, and will be identifying 10 more creators in the next few months for the next cohort,&#8221; noted Creator Inclusion Lead Alexandra Nikolajev.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re on a journey to build a globally inclusive platform where Pinners and Creators around the world can discover ideas that feel personalized, relevant and reflective of who they are,&#8221; Nikolajev said.</p>
<p>Pinterest has been working to rebuild its image in the wake of last year&#8217;s allegations of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/pinterest-employees-are-walking-out-today-in-light-of-discrimination-allegations/">a host of internal issues,</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/former-pinterest-employees-allege-unfair-pay-racism-and-retaliation.html">including unfair pay, racism, retaliation</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/">and sexism</a>, which conflicted with its outside image of being one of the &#8220;nicer&#8221; places to work in tech. Despite this fallout &#8212; which included a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination/">lawsuit</a>, employee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/pinterest-employees-are-walking-out-today-in-light-of-discrimination-allegations/">walkout</a>, <a href="https://www.coworker.org/petitions/put-an-end-to-all-forms-of-discrimination-and-retaliation-at-pinterest-1">petitions</a> and more &#8212; the issues that had been raised weren&#8217;t always reflected in Pinterest&#8217;s product.</p>

<p>The company had previously launched inclusive features like &#8220;skin tone ranges&#8221; to help those shopping for beauty products find matches for their skin tone. It also allowed retailers and brands to identify themselves as members of an underrepresented group, which gave their content the ability to appear in more places across Pinterest&#8217;s platform, like the Today tab, Shopping Spotlights and The Pinterest Shop, for instance.</p>
<p>Evan Sharp, Pinterest&#8217;s co-founder and Chief Design and Creative Officer, referenced the company&#8217;s image as &#8220;a positive place&#8221; at today&#8217;s event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been building Pinterest for 11 years, and ever since our users routinely tell us that Pinterest is the &#8216;last positive corner of the internet.&#8217; In that time, we’ve also learned that you need to design positivity into online platforms as deliberately as much as you design negativity out,&#8221; Sharp said. &#8220;The Creator Code is a human-centric way for Creators to understand how to be successful on Pinterest while using their voice to keep Pinterest positive and inclusive,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Today, Pinterest serves over 450 million users worldwide, but is challenged by large platforms serving creators like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and others, including newcomers like TikTok and those that are inching into the creator community with funds of their own, like Snapchat, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">which is paying creators for Spotlight content,</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">Clubhouse, which is now funding creators&#8217; shows</a>. The increased competition for creator interest has left Pinterest needing an incentive program of its own.</p>
<p>To kick of its announcement, Pinterest’s Head of Content and Creator Partnerships, Aya Kanai, interviewed television personality <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/jvnpins/_saved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/jvnpins/_saved/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617889288544000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRK_HxBH9eOgI5VHqfnrhuIrVdGw">Jonathan Van Ness</a> (Queer Eye) at today&#8217;s virtual event, where they talked about the need for positivity and inclusivity on social media.

					<description><![CDATA[Cybersecurity veteran Katie Moussouris explains what startups should (and shouldn't) do, what to prioritize, and the difference between vulnerability disclosure, penetration testing and bug bounties.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the rush to launch, cybersecurity doesn&#8217;t always get the attention it deserves, and yet it&#8217;s one of the first things that startups learn can — and will — go wrong.</p>
<p>Hacker and security researchers can be some of your biggest assets in helping your startup stay secure. Vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs are part of working with the hacker community to build a stronger, more resilient company. But these are not a replacement for security investments, which as a growing company you should not overlook.</p>
<p>Katie Moussouris has been in cybersecurity circles since some of the world&#8217;s biggest tech companies were startups, and helped to set up the first vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs. Moussouris, who runs consultancy firm Luta Security, now advises companies and governments on how to talk to hackers and what they need to do to build and improve their vulnerability disclosure programs.</p>
<p>At TC Early Stage, Moussouris explained what startups should (and shouldn&#8217;t) do, and what priorities should come first.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Knowing the basics</strong></h2>
<p>A bug bounty alone is not enough, and outsourcing the process to a platform isn&#8217;t going to save you time. Moussouris explained the basics and what differs between vulnerability disclosure, penetration testing and bug bounties.</p>
<blockquote><p>Vulnerability disclosure is the process by which you hear about vulnerability from the outside. You digest that vulnerability somehow internally in your organization and figure out what to do with it — whether to create a patch, how to prioritize that patch, and then what to release to the public [ … ] What it comes down to is that organizations need guidelines on how to handle these issues appropriately.</p>
<p>Next we&#8217;ve got penetration testing: hiring professional hackers under contract [who have] a specific set of skills that match your problem set, and you pay them. They&#8217;re under a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) to keep your vulnerabilities secret for as long as you need them — perhaps forever — and you are at your leisure as to whether or not you fix those vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Finally, bug bounties are simply adding a cash reward to the process of vulnerability disclosure programs. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 3:20)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Healthcare insurance, if you’re lucky to have it, only covers a subset of conditions in the United States. As a result, patients can often get burdened with horror story charges, like huge deductibles, out-of-network costs and expensive co-pays. So for the uninsured and insured alike, innovative ways of managing big bills are in high demand &#8212; especially as uncertainty remains around<a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyfarr/status/1379566792830377985"> how COVID-19 and long-haul symptoms will be handled by patients and payers. </a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.hellowalnut.com/">Walnut</a>, founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roshan--patel/">Roshan Patel</a>, is a point-of-sale lending company with a healthcare twist. Walnut uses a “buy now, pay later” model, popularized by Affirm and Klarna, to help patients pay for healthcare over a period of time, instead of in one $3,000 chunk. Walnut works with healthcare providers so that a patient’s bill can be paid back through $100-a-month increments for 30 months, instead of one aggressive credit card swipe.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135319" style="width: 578px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135319" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2135319" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg" alt="" width="568" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg 4128w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135319" class="wp-caption-text">A patient using Walnut to pay healthcare bills. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walnut</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s a sweet deal, but Patel added one more detail that he thinks makes Walnut stand out: The startup doesn’t charge any interest or fees to consumers.</p>
<p>“Almost every ‘buy now, pay later’ company in e-commerce charges interest or fees, and every personal loan provider charges interest or fees, but we do not,” he said. “And that&#8217;s really important to me, not making healthcare any more expensive than it already is. It’s a very patient-friendly product.”</p>
<p>Companies that use the buy now, pay later model with zero interest or fees need to make revenue somehow, and in Walnut’s case it is by charging healthcare providers a percentage of each sale or transaction.</p>
<p>If a provider’s collection rate for an out-of-pocket is 50%, Walnut would go to them and say “give us a 40% discount, and we’ll guarantee the cash for you upfront.” The startup will take the risk, and then the provider is able to make 60% of the collection rate.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="r88OWk8juw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/healthcare-entrepreneurs-should-prepare-for-an-upcoming-vc-pe-bubble/">Healthcare entrepreneurs should prepare for an upcoming VC/PE bubble</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Healthcare entrepreneurs should prepare for an upcoming VC/PE bubble&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/healthcare-entrepreneurs-should-prepare-for-an-upcoming-vc-pe-bubble/embed/#?secret=r88OWk8juw" data-secret="r88OWk8juw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, ideally, a provider would want to get 100% of payments they are owed, but that is wishful thinking. Patel explained that a large number of bills go unpaid due to bankruptcies or a default on payments (the average collections rate for hospitals out of pocket is less than 20%). Because of this, a company like Walnut has room to offer at least some stable upfront cash to hospitals, even if it ends up being 60% of overall bills versus 100%.</p>
<p>The company uses “extensive underwriting models” to figure out if a patient should qualify for a loan. Patel says that the startup goes beyond using credit score, which he describes as an “outdated metric”, and instead looks at thousands of data points from different providers, from side hustle income to spending habits on things like groceries and bills.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1308296" style="width: 734px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1308296" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1308296" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg" alt="" width="724" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg 3817w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=300,221 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=768,566 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=680,501 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=1536,1132 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=2048,1509 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1308296" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-540784p1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightspring <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Walnut’s biggest challenge, says Patel, is to underwrite the population and pay the healthcare provider upfront in cash. It then collects from the patient on the back end, which comes with its own amount of risk.</p>
<p>“To be able to take on that risk for patients that are less credit-worthy is a very challenging problem, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really solved yet in healthcare,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup is starting by working with small private practices of one to five physicians that focus on specialties like dentistry, dermatology and fertility.</p>
<p>A big part of Walnut’s success will be determined by if it can attract people that truly need flexible financing options. For example, the company doesn&#8217;t have any hospitals as a partner yet, which would tap a larger group of patients that likely need flexible financing options the most. Right now, “the people who get elective-care surgery are the ones that can afford it.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Making sense of Klarna&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/embed/#?secret=gIAGD8QkZM" data-secret="gIAGD8QkZM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Patel doesn’t see this as a disconnect; instead, he sees it as an opportunity to widen access to elective medical care to more people.</p>
<p>“I talked to a person last week who has no teeth and wants dentures but it costs $6,000,” he said. “That person should be able to afford it, and we enabled them to pay $100 a month for it.”</p>
<p>Walnut’s two biggest customer groups are the uninsured (people who have lost their jobs from COVID-19), and consumers who have high deductible plans.</p>
<p>Walnut isn’t the first. PrimaHealth Credit, Walnut’s closest competitor, offers<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/primahealth-credit-offers-a-buy-now-pay-later-lending-service-for-elective-procedures/"> point-of-sale lending procedures </a>for elective medical procedures. Think surgeries like cataract work or dental work. The company said the service is currently available in Arizona, California, Florida, Oklahoma and Texas, and will be expanded to all 50 states this year. Walnut, comparatively, is mostly focused on the East Coast and plans to expand nationwide by the end of this year.</p>
<p>PrimaHealth’s average loan size is $1,800, and Walnut’s average loan size is $5,000.</p>
<p>The company is currently piloting with a handful of healthcare providers in dermatology, dentistry and fertility. It has had more than 500 patient loan applications, totaling over $4.6 million in application volume year-to-date. Patel says that Walnut only accepted a fraction of these applications, but declined to share what percent of money it has lent so far. As Walnut refines its model, it might be able to cover other categories.</p>
<p>Up until this point, Walnut has been lending off of its own balance sheet. In order to truly scale, it will need to get a new source of capital &#8212; either a credit line, debt financing round or venture capital &#8212; to offer more loans. Patel says that the startup is in talks with banks, and turned down a debt offer due to size and rate.</p>
<p>Venture capital seems to be the solution for now: The startup announced that it has raised a $3.6 million seed round from investors including Gradient Ventures, Afore Capital, 2048 Ventures, Supernode Ventures, TA Ventures, Polymath Capital, Tack Ventures, Awesome People Ventures, Newark Ventures and NKM Capital. Angels include the CEOs of Giphy and PillPack, and the CTO of Rampm Financial as well as an NFL coach. The company is also a part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/plaid-accelerator-announces-inaugural-cohort-of-fintech-startups/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Plaid&#8217;s inaugural accelerator.</a></p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t want to be yet another startup trying to offer you an undifferentiated insurance plan,” Patel said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitch will start holding its streamers to a higher standard. The company just expanded its hate and harassment policy, specifying more kinds of bad behavior that break its rules and could result in a ban from the streaming service.</p>
<p>The news comes as Twitch continues to grapple with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303185/twitch-sexual-harassment-assault-permanent-bans-streamers">reports of abusive behavior and sexual harassment,</a> both on the platform and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-10-08-twitch-staff-call-the-company-out-on-sexual-assault-racism-more">within the company itself</a>. In December, Twitch<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses/"> released an updated set of rules</a> designed to take harassment and abuse more seriously, admitting that women, people of color and the LGBTQ+ community were impacted by a &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; amount of that toxic behavior on the platform.</p>
<p>Twitch&#8217;s policies now include serious offenses that could pose a safety threat, even when they happen entirely away from the streaming service. Those threats include violent extremism, terrorism, threats of mass violence, sexual assault and ties to known hate groups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will also continue to evaluate off-platform behavior in cases that happen on Twitch, like an on-stream situation that leads to harassment on Twitter or Facebook.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitch updates its hateful content and harassment policy after company called out for its own abuses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses/embed/#?secret=UAdcAuoydV" data-secret="UAdcAuoydV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;While this policy is new, we have taken action historically against serious, clear misconduct that took place off service, but until now, we didn’t have an approach that scaled,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post, adding that investigating off-platform behavior requires additional resources to address the complexity inherent in those cases.</p>
<p>To handle reports for its broadened rules, Twitch created a dedicated email address (OSIT@twitch.tv) to handle reports about off-service behavior. The company says it has partnered with a third-party investigative law firm to vet the reports it receives.</p>
<p>Twitch cites its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/"> actions against former President Donald Trump</a> as the most high-profile instance of off-platform behavior resulting in enforcement. The company disabled Trump&#8217;s account following the attack on the U.S. Capitol and later suspended him indefinitely, citing fears that he could use the service to incite violence.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to have a higher profile than the president, but Trump isn&#8217;t the only big time banned Twitch user. Last June, Twitch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">kicked one of its biggest streamers off of the platform</a> without providing an explanation for the decision.</p>
<p>Going on a year later, no one seems to know why Dr. Disrespect got the boot from Twitch, though the company&#8217;s insistence that it only acts in cases with a &#8220;preponderance of evidence&#8221; suggests his violations were serious and well corroborated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> today announced it was expanding its platform into a couple of new areas. Up to this point, the company has been known for its identity access management product, giving companies the ability to sign onto multiple cloud products with a single sign on. Today, the company is moving into two new areas: privileged access and identity governance</p>
<p>Privileged access gives companies the ability to provide access on an as-needed basis to a limited number of people to key administrative services inside a company. This could be your database or your servers or any part of your technology stack that is highly sensitive and where you want to tightly control who can access these systems.</p>
<p>Okta CEO Todd McKinnon says that Okta has always been good at locking down the general user population access to cloud services like Salesforce, Office 365 and Gmail. What these cloud services have in common is you access them via a web interface.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Administrators access the speciality accounts using different protocols. &#8220;It&#8217;s something like secure shell, or you&#8217;re using a terminal on your computer to connect to a server in the cloud, or it&#8217;s a database connection where you&#8217;re actually logging in with a SQL connection, or you&#8217;re connecting to a container, which is the Kubernetes protocol to actually manage the container,&#8221; McKinnon explained.</p>
<p>Privileged access offers a couple of key features including the ability to limit access to a given time window and to record a video of the session so there is an audit trail of exactly what happened while someone was accessing the system. McKinnon says that these features provide additional layers of protection for these sensitive accounts.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LMl67AHZcj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/okta-covid-19-app-usage-report-finds-its-not-just-collaboration-seeing-a-huge-uptick/">Okta COVID-19 app usage report finds it&#8217;s not just collaboration seeing a huge uptick</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Okta COVID-19 app usage report finds it&#8217;s not just collaboration seeing a huge uptick&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/okta-covid-19-app-usage-report-finds-its-not-just-collaboration-seeing-a-huge-uptick/embed/#?secret=LMl67AHZcj" data-secret="LMl67AHZcj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He says that it will be fairly trivial to carve out these accounts because Okta already has divided users into groups and can give these special privileges to only those people in the administrative access group. The challenge was figuring out how to get access to these other kinds of protocols.</p>
<p>The governance piece provides a way for security operations teams to run detailed reports and look for issues related to identity. &#8220;Governance provides exception reporting so you can give that to your auditors, and more importantly you can give that to your security team to make sure that you figure out what&#8217;s going on and why there is this deviation from your stated policy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>All of this when combined with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/">the $6.5 billion acquisition of Auth0 last month</a> is part of a larger plan by the company to be what McKinnon calls the identity cloud. He sees a market with several strategic clouds and he believes identity is going to be one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because identity is so strategic for everything, it&#8217;s unlocking your customer, access, it&#8217;s unlocking your employee access, it&#8217;s keeping everything secure. And so this expansion, whether it&#8217;s customer identity with zero trust or whether it&#8217;s doing more on the workforce identity with not just access, but privileged access and identity governance. It&#8217;s about identity evolving in this primary cloud,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While both of these new products were announced today at the company&#8217;s virtual Oktane customer conference, they won&#8217;t be generally available until the first quarter of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">Early Stage</a>, TechCrunch spoke with Zoom Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanazus/">Ryan Azus</a> about building an early-stage sales team. Azus is perhaps best known for leading the video-calling giant&#8217;s income arm during COVID-19, but his experience building RingCentral&#8217;s North American sales organization from the ground up made him the perfect guest to chat with about building an early-stage sales team.</p>
<p>We asked him about when founders should step aside from leading their startup&#8217;s sales org, how to build a working sales culture, hiring diversely, how to pick customer segments and how to build a playbook.</p>
<p>Below, TechCrunch has compiled a number of key comments from Azus, and afterward we&#8217;ve included the full video from the interview as well as a transcript. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<hr />
<h2>When should founders let others run sales?</h2>
<p>Nearly every startup leans on its CEO as its first salesperson. After all, who else knows the product and can talk it up like the startup&#8217;s leader? But having the CEO as point-person for sales scales poorly. So, when is the right time to have someone else step in?</p>
<blockquote><p>Fairly early on. First off, CEOs need to solve customer needs. And so it&#8217;s important to be very hands-on for a while to really understand while you&#8217;re trying to figure out product-market fit. And then bringing in some of those sales people as you start seeing something [good].</p>
<p>Part of it is also knowing what type of salesperson you need. [ … ] Who is your core audience? What persona are you going after? And trying to find people that know and understand selling something that&#8217;s primarily very transactional to small businesses, [or] e-commerce lead, or selling something that&#8217;s more enterprise &#8212; those are different animals, different segments that you&#8217;re going after. One mistake [startups make] is hiring the wrong type of salesperson.<em><strong> (Time stamp: 5:29)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h2>How much product-market fit is enough?</h2>

<p>At the top of the list are a pair of e-bikes, produced by VanMoof. The S3 and X3 will sport tracking functionality, along with a “Locate with Apple Find My” logo located on the bottom side of the crossbar. Belkin’s Soundform Freedom earbuds, meanwhile, will join Apple’s iPods in sporting the feature, while the Chipolo ONE Spot will beat the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">long-rumored AirTags</a> to the punch.</p>
<p>According to Apple, the new products are set to hit the market next week. There are a bunch of different privacy concerns laid out by Apple in the white papers, along with other specifications companies will have to adhere to. Interestingly, among the prerequisites is that a device needs to be able to emit sound in order to use the functionality. That&#8217;s pretty straightforward for things like earbuds, but the also means that things like the e-bikes need to make a sounds specifically for this purpose.</p>
<p>Draft specs for chip makers will also be released in the spring, so companies can utilize the Ultra Wideband tech on Apple devices sporting a U1 chip. That should improve directional tracking, among other potential benefits. Approved products will be able to display the aforementioned “Works with Apple Find My” badge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building and maintaining a successful startup requires founders to see the entire playing field. Without that clear view, founders risk missteps when it comes to hiring, raising funds, launching a product or making an acquisition.</p>
<p>Essentially, any big decision can end in disaster if a founder loses perspective or lacks situational and self-awareness.</p>
<p>Eghosa Omoigui, the founder and managing general partner of <a href="http://www.echovc.com/">EchoVC Partners</a>, a seed and early-stage venture capital firm that serves underrepresented founders and underserved markets, has helped entrepreneurs navigate the first steps of starting a company and laying the right foundation early on.</p>
<p>Omoigui, who was previously director of consumer internet and semantic technologies at Intel Capital, advocates for founders to develop their own All-22 tape — a tool used by professional football coaches that allows the viewer to see all 22 players on the field at the same time. It improves a coach’s line of sight and, most importantly, helps avoid missing a critical motion or player.</p>
<p>The concept of this tool can — and should — be applied in the startup world as well, Omoigui said during the virtual TC Early Stage event.</p>
<p>Omoigui explained what it means to have an All-22 tape and the steps founders should take to develop a skillset that will allow them to see and understand the playbook from all sides.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The big picture</h2>
<p>Before getting into the steps, it&#8217;s important to understand what the aim is. The upshot? For founders to have the best and most complete view of their company, team, investors, product and competitors.</p>
<p>For founders, that means being able to zoom out and see each of their employees’ points of view and being inclusive. Without an All-22 tape, founders can mistakenly spend too much on engineering while ignoring the product rollout strategy or forget to communicate with employees outside of their bubble of interest. A company can become fragmented as more blind spots emerge, which can ultimately lead to oversights that damage its reputation, operations or even its ability to raise money from investors.</p>
<blockquote><p>For operators and investors, what we see is usually very driven by where we stand, or where we sit. And what you have to discover really is: How can I get much better views? And the best view is always the plan view, you&#8217;re looking from the top down, you&#8217;re watching the movement, and you have line of sight, you know, that&#8217;s essentially 360 degrees. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 3:40)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h2>Situational and self-awareness</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s internal R&amp;D group, NPE Team, has today launched its latest experiment, <a href="https://hotline.co/">Hotline</a>, into public beta testing. The web-based application could be described as a mashup of Instagram Live and Clubhouse, as it allows creators to speak to an audience who can then ask questions through either text or audio. However, unlike Clubhouse, creators can opt to turn their cameras on for the event, instead of being audio-only.</p>
<p>Real estate investor <a href="https://twitter.com/sweatystartup">Nick Huber</a> is the first to <a href="https://hotline.co/nick-huber-ama">publicly try out the product</a> with a livestream today that began at 10 AM PT (1 PM ET). Huber represents the sort of creator Facebook wants to work with for Hotline, Facebook told us, which is someone who helps people expand their professional skills or their finances. In Huber&#8217;s case, he&#8217;s talking about investing in industrial real estate as a second income stream.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&mdash; Nick Huber (@sweatystartup) <a href="https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1379841706112253959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At Facebook, Hotline is being led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-hazzard-4013038/">Eric Hazzard</a>, who joined Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/16/facebook-acquires-anonymous-teen-compliment-app-tbh-will-let-it-run/">when it acquired his app tbh</a>, a positivity-focused Q&amp;A app that grew to 2.5 million daily active users in nine weeks and saw over 1 billion poll answers before exiting. With Hotline, Hazzard is once again developing a product in the Q&amp;A space.</p>
<p>But this time, the new app is taking inspiration from an up-and-coming social network, Clubhouse. In fact, Hotline&#8217;s user interface will look familiar to anyone who&#8217;s already used Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces or any of the other audio-only social networks, when it&#8217;s viewed on mobile. At the top on mobile (or to the left side on desktop), there&#8217;s a speaker section where the event host is featured in a round profile icon or live video stream. Below (or to the side on desktop) are the event&#8217;s listeners.</p>
<p>But there are also several differences between Hotline and existing apps, like Clubhouse.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135237" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135237" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135237" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hotline-GIF.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="375" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135237" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>For starters, the app today has users sign in with Twitter then verify their identity via SMS.</p>
<p>The listeners&#8217; section, for example, is divided up between those who are just watching the event, as represented by their profile icons, and those who are asking questions. At the top of this section, you&#8217;re presented with the lists of questions that users have asked, which others can upvote or downvote accordingly. The creator can then look to this section to find out which questions to answer next and can pull listeners onto the stage area with them for a conversation.</p>
<p>At present, users can type in their questions, then join the host &#8220;on stage,&#8221; when it&#8217;s their turn. Currently, guests are represented by their profile icon and are audio only when on stage. But in the settings, there&#8217;s an option for the listener to toggle on video that&#8217;s not yet functional for today&#8217;s test.</p>
<p>As the questions are asked, users can react with emoji including clapping hands, fire, heart, laughter, surprise and thumbs up.</p>

<p>Hosts have full control over the experience, and can remove inappropriate questions from the queue or remove people from their Hotline session. For the initial tests, Facebook employees will moderate events and remove anyone that violates Facebook’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617887929140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGJ30EgMPODDC-Aups2x0mJy8U5dg">Community Standards</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/terms.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617887929140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsHqb8hN2BzLuSbS6bA7tB-ox1vA">Terms of Service</a>, <a href="https://m.facebook.com/policy.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://m.facebook.com/policy.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617887929140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHccirPpdR5TwwMLBGTxi7WDlHh4A">Data Policy</a> or the <a href="https://npe.facebook.com/supplement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://npe.facebook.com/supplement/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617887929140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNETZ0N-JaxiACdVeb5ehVcPtC4FCg">NPE Team&#8217;s Supplemental Terms.</a></p>
<p>Another notable difference between Hotline and Clubhouse is that Hotline events are recorded.</p>
<p>Today, Clubhouse favors more casual chats where people understand there&#8217;s no transcript or recording taking place (unless indicated by the host in the room&#8217;s title). This, Clubhouse believes, allows participants to speak more freely and with less fear. But Hotline automatically produces recordings. After the event, the host will receive two recordings of the session &#8212; one as an mp3 and another as an mp4. The creator can then upload these to other networks, like YouTube or Facebook, edit them into short-form content for apps like TikTok or turn the audio recording into a podcast, or anything else.</p>
<p>At launch, anyone can join a Hotline for free and there&#8217;s no limit on audience size, though this could change as the experiment progresses.</p>
<p>Despite the similarities with Clubhouse, Hotline has a different vibe because of its use of video, text-based questions, upvoting and because it&#8217;s recorded. This makes it feel less like a casual hangout and more like a professional event where an expert is leading a session and inviting an audience to ask questions.</p>

<p>Hotline <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is now one of several apps that Facebook&#8217;s NPE team has launched in the creator space to experiment with different ideas around audio and video. The group is continuing to test </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/facebook-building-tool-to-let-fans-pay-celebrities-for-face-time">a creator app called Super</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, similar to Cameo, which is web-based and entirely video. It also previously tested </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-launches-catchup-an-audio-only-group-calling-app-that-shows-whos-ready-to-chat-now/">an audio-only calling app, CatchUp</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which shut down last year, as well as </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/facebook-takes-on-twitter-with-venue-a-second-screen-companion-for-live-events/">another Q&amp;A product known as Venue</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which is more of a Twitter-like companion for live events. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">More recently, it has launched TikTok-esque video apps </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/facebook-launches-collab-a-mix-and-match-app-for-making-collaborative-music-videos/">Collab</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/facebook-launches-bars-a-tiktok-like-app-for-creating-and-sharing-raps/">BARS</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which focused on collaborative music and raps, respectively.  </span></p>
<p>Over time, the goal of NPE projects isn&#8217;t necessarily to stand them up on their own as individual apps &#8212; though that could happen, if they gained enough traction. More broadly, the learnings from the tests and experiments can help inform future Facebook product development, as it builds out new features for existing products, like Messenger Rooms or Facebook Live, among other things.</p>
<p>Facebook didn&#8217;t make an official announcement about Hotline&#8217;s launch, but offered a statement about today&#8217;s test.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Hotline, we’re hoping to understand how interactive, live multimedia Q&amp;As can help people learn from experts in areas like professional skills, just as it helps those experts build their businesses,&#8221; a spokesperson said. &#8220;New Product Experimentation has been testing multimedia products like CatchUp, Venue, Collab, and BARS, and we’re encouraged to see the formats continue to help people connect and build community,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>Hotline isn&#8217;t Facebook&#8217;s only attempt to challenge Clubhouse. The company is also in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/facebooks-clubhouse-rival-looks-a-lot-like-clubhouse-right-now/">developing a Clubhouse rival</a> within the Messenger Rooms product experience, Facebook recently confirmed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.kavak.com/">Kavak</a>, the Mexican startup that’s disrupted the used car market in Mexico and Argentina, today announced its Series D of $485 million, which now values the company at $4 billion. This round more than triples their previous valuation of $1.15 billion, which established them as a unicorn just a couple of months ago in October of 2020. Kavak is now one of the top five highest-valued startups in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by D1 Capital Partners, Founders Fund, Ribbit and BOND, and brings Kavak’s total capital raised to date to more than $900 million. Kavak recently soft-launched in Brazil, and this new round of funding will be used to build out the Brazilian market and beyond, said Carlos García Ottati, Kavak’s CEO and co-founder. The company plans to do a full launch in Brazil in the next 60 days, García said, and we can expect to see Kavak in markets outside Latin America in the next 24 months, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were built to solve emerging market problems,” García said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kavak, which was founded in 2016, is an online marketplace that aims to bring transparency, security and access to financing to the used car market. The company also offers its own financing through its fintech arm, Kavak Capital, and counts more than 2,500 employees and 20 logistics and reconditioning hubs in Mexico and Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Latin America, 90% of the [used car] transactions are informal, which leads to a 40% fraud rate,” said García, who experienced these challenges firsthand when he moved to Mexico from Colombia a couple of years ago and bought a used car. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My budget allowed me to buy a used car, but there was no infrastructure around it. It took me six months to buy the car, and then the car had legal and mechanical issues and I lost most of my money,” he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kavak buys cars from individuals, refurbishes them and offers warranties to buyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Instead of buying a new car, they can buy a better car that still has all the warranties. It’s a really aspirational process,” said García. The company, which really amounts to four companies in one given its areas of focus, was built to be comprehensive by design in order to meet the various gaps in the market, García said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re building a business here [Latin America], you need to build several businesses because so many things are broken,” he said. That&#8217;s why the financing option, for example, has been a key to their success, according to García.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financing has traditionally been hard to come by in Brazil, and as García said, the used car market lacks infrastructure there, too. That being said, Brazil is Latin America’s fintech hub, and the space has made leaps and bounds over the last 7-10 years with companies such as Nubank, PagSeguro, Creditas, PicPay, and others leading the way. As a result, credit cards and loans are more widely available today in the region, offering </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">competition for Kavak Capital. While Kavak has localized some of its product for the Brazilian market — namely building out a Portuguese language version of the app and website — García said the markets are very similar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Brazil, you still have the same problems that you have in Mexico, but Brazil is a little more developed, especially in fintech, which is light years ahead of Mexico,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Brazilian product heading to the races, García said they already have plans for other regions, though he declined to name them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“80% of people in emerging markets don’t have access to a car,” García said of the global market size. “We want to go into big markets where customers are facing similar problems and where Kavak can really change their lives,” he added.</span></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>My startup registered two H-1B candidates in this year’s lottery. Sadly, neither was selected. </strong></p>
<p><strong>One is my co-founder, the other is on OPT. Help! We can’t afford for them to have to leave the U.S. What are our options?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Lost in Los Angeles</strong></p>
<p>Dear Lost:</p>
<p>Take a deep breath; I’ve got your back. There are many creative immigration pathways for you, your co-founder and your <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/opt-optional-practical-training/">F-1 OPT</a> employee to explore. We’ll take a look at several options, and you can also check out my recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/065-selected-or-not-selected-in-the-h-1b-lottery-now-what/">podcast</a> in which my colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-zaidi-b3a40414/">Nadia Zaidi</a> and I explain them in greater depth.</p>
<p>I hope the below ideas inspire you and fill you with a sense of hope and possibility. As always, I suggest consulting with an experienced immigration attorney who can help you identify the strongest path forward, as well as backup options for your co-founder and employee. The particular immigration strategy that’s best for you is always an individual determination. It’s best identified through a personal consultation with an attorney such as myself based on a variety of factors, including each person’s immigration history and your particular startup’s goals.</p>
<h2>Co-founder immigration options</h2>
<p>For a funded startup, there’s a great H-1B Plan B: the Cap-Exempt H-1B. Especially if your co-founder has a STEM background (and possibly even for some founders who don’t have this), there’s a wonderful new triple-win option that supports startups, international candidates and even diverse U.S. STEM college students seeking better project-based learning opportunities.</p>
<p>What is this magical rainbow-striped unicorn option, you ask? Well, here’s the legal background: Some employers qualify to petition for an H-1B visa at any time without going through the lottery. These employers — called cap-exempt employers because they are not subject to the annual H-1B cap of 85,000 visas available to for-profit employers — include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutions of higher education.</li>
<li>Nonprofits tied to institutions of higher education.</li>
<li>Nonprofit research organizations.</li>
<li>Government research organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your co-founder can get a part-time H-1B visa through one of these cap-exempt employers, your startup can concurrently sponsor your co-founder for an H-1B regardless of the recent lottery results.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>To take advantage of this special law, I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="https://www.openavenuesfoundation.org/">Open Avenues Foundation</a>, which offers a <a href="https://www.openavenuesfoundation.org/global-talent">Global Talent Fellowship</a>. In this program, international talent can receive cap-exempt H-1B visas by leading university students for about five hours a week in real-world, project-based work within their field of expertise for the startup that nominated them for the fellowship. The candidate gets to stay in (or come to) the U.S., your startup gets a team of students working on a group project that benefits your company and increases diversity in your hiring pipeline, and U.S. students get the benefit of hands-on high quality STEM learning.</p>
<p>Once your candidate’s first cap-exempt H-1B is in place, your startup can petition for a second, concurrent Cap-Exempt H-1B for direct startup employment.</p>
<p>Interested in variations? If you’re not in STEM but have a university that would host you (free to the university), you can potentially partner with OAF. In addition, many universities in the U.S have <a href="https://www.globaleir.org/">global entrepreneur-in-residence programs</a> that can help international co-founders qualify for concurrent Cap-Exempt H-1Bs. Your startup should also consider sponsoring your co-founder for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">O-1A visa</a> or change of status.</p>
<p>Another option to consider is for your co-founder to apply for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/entrepreneur-parole/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP), a new 30-month immigration status in the U.S. The International Entrepreneur Rule (IER) was created by President Barack Obama and is the closest thing the U.S. has right now to a startup visa. The Trump administration tried to eliminate it, but the <a href="https://nvca.org/immigration/">National Venture Capital Association</a>, led by Jeff Farrah, successfully challenged the administration’s effort in federal court, so IEP remains on the books.</p>
<p>A lot of folks don’t believe it’s an option yet, so I’m currently looking for international startup founders with a strong case to file for IEP to test out this new program and demonstrate its existence to the world. We’re currently seeking global startup founders holding at least 15% equity in a U.S. startup that’s less than five years old and has raised at least $250,000 from U.S. investors. If you want to be on our free interest list, you can fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmpTCXBjdaZkGF_fMlEnDVdmD114lm8pH9R24iOKaE1znwEQ/viewform">form</a>. If we think you have a strong application, we’ll reach out.</p>
<p>If your co-founder wants to remain permanently in the U.S., consider starting a green card now such as the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">EB-1A</a> green card for individuals of extraordinary ability or an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">EB-2 NIW</a> (National Interest Waiver) green card for individuals of exceptional ability. Of these, the EB-1A is the quickest option, but its qualification requirements are tougher than for the EB-2 NIW.</p>
<h2>F-1 OPT employee immigration options</h2>
<p>If your F-1 OPT employee graduated with a qualified STEM degree, that employee can apply for a 24-month work extension, known as <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/stem-opt-extension/">STEM OPT</a>. That will allow the employee to remain in the U.S. to continue working for you. In the meantime, you can register them again next year for the H-1B lottery. If there’s no possibility for STEM, please check out the Cap-Exempt H-1B option explained above.</p>
<p>If your F-1 OPT employee only has a bachelor’s degree, they might want to consider pursuing an advanced degree. Individuals with a master’s or higher degree from a U.S. university have better odds of being selected in the annual H-1B lottery. That’s because 20,000 of the 85,000 H-1B visas available each year are earmarked for individuals with a master’s or higher degree from a U.S. university.</p>
<p>You should be aware, however, that next year’s H-1B lottery will likely shift from the current random selection process to one based on the highest wages. Unless the Biden administration changes the policy, which was devised by the previous administration, employers who pay their H-1B candidates a Level III wage or higher have the best chance of getting selected to file for an H-1B visa.</p>
<p>As you know, sponsoring employers must agree to pay an H-1B candidate the higher of either the actual wage paid for the job or the prevailing wage, which is broken down into four levels based on experience required for the position and location of the position. Level I wage is basically for an entry-level position, while a Level IV wage is for a position requiring the most experience. While this will add greater predictability to the annual H-1B “lottery,” early-stage startups and small businesses may have a difficult time competing against more established companies on salary, particularly because stock options and equity are not included in the salary calculation.</p>
<p>If you need to find alternative visa solutions, you can always consult with an attorney. I hope all of these options help you realize the control and agency you have in this situation. You have choices!</p>
<p>All my best,</p>
<p>Sophie</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the pandemic arrived in the U.S. early last year, companies scrambled to figure out what to do with their long-standing, in-person developer events. For Apple and Microsoft, that meant going virtual — something companies have done with mixed results.</p>
<p>For Google, it meant calling off I/O all together. The company canceled the developer conference traditionally held each May at Mountain View, California’s Shoreline Amphitheater.</p>
<p>“Out of concern for the health and safety of our developers, employees and local communities — and in line with recent ‘shelter in place’ orders by the local Bay Area counties — we sadly will not be holding I/O in any capacity this year,” the company wrote at the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After a year off, the show is set to return in virtual form. Google sent out its customary puzzle invites today, noting that the event will be held May 18-20. (Props <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/07/google-i-o-2021-announced/">to 9 to 5 Google for solving.</a>) Like other online-only events of a recent vintage, this version of the developer&#8217;s conference will be free to attend and open to all. (Live, we assume, and not &#8220;Olive,&#8221; but it&#8217;s hard to say for sure, based on the graphic below.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135252" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135252" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2135252" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="627" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png 1682w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=768,470 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=680,416 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=1536,941 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135252" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google joins a number of companies continuing to hold virtual events in 2021. While an aggressive vaccine rollout has begun here in the States, there&#8217;s still plenty of questions and concerns surround the virus&#8217; spread at large gatherings &#8212; even ones like I/O, which are traditionally held outdoors. Apple recently announced a second virtual version of WWDC, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/apples-wwdc-stays-online-only-kicking-off-june-7/">set for June</a>, while Microsoft&#8217;s<a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/"> Build runs May 25-27</a>.</p>
