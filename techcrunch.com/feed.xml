										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reliance Retail has led a $240 million funding round in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/google-backs-indias-dunzo-in-40-million-funding-round/">Google-backed hyperlocal delivery startup Dunzo</a> as the largest Indian retail chain expands to the instant commerce space, a category that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/zepto-a-10-minute-grocery-delivery-app-in-india-raises-100-million/">made inroads</a> in the South Asian market in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Reliance Retail is investing $200 million in the round for a 25.8% stake in the six-year-old startup, which operates an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/04/dunzo-hyperlocal-ecommerce-delivery/">eponymous hyper-local delivery service</a> in seven cities in India. The new round, a name for which was not disclosed, values the Bangalore-based startup at $775 million. Existing investors Lightbox, Lightrock, 3L Capital and Alteria Capital also participated in the round.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a shift in consumption patterns online and have been highly impressed with how Dunzo has disrupted the space. Dunzo is the pioneer of Quick commerce in India and we want to support them in furthering their ambitions of becoming a prominent local commerce enabler in the country,” said Isha Ambani, Director of Reliance Retail Ventures Limited, in a statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254366" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Our merchants will get access to the hyperlocal delivery network of Dunzo to support their growth as they move their business online through Jio Mart,” she added.</p>
<p>Dunzo allows its customers to buy a wide range of items across several categories, from grocery, perishables, pet supplies and medicines to dinner from their neighborhood stores and restaurants. They can also use Dunzo to move their own items &#8212; such laptops, chargers, medicines, and lunch &#8212; around the city.</p>
<p>Last year, it entered the instant delivery space in Bangalore, offering customers delivery within 15 to 20 minutes. The startup said it is seeing over 20% week-on-week growth without disclosing any figures.</p>
<p>Dunzo said Thursday that it plans to expand to more geographies &#8212; an additional eight cities &#8212; and broaden its quick commerce play with the fresh funds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>E-commerce accounts for less than 3% of all retail sales in India, according to industry estimates. Mom and pop stores and other neighborhood outlets that dot tens of thousands of cities, towns, villages and slums across the country drive most of the sales in the nation.</p>
<p>Dunzo, which counts Blume Ventures among its investors, is attempting to reimagine how e-commerce and delivery is done in India, thereby posing a challenge to Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, as well as local food and grocery delivery startups such as Swiggy, Zomato, and new comer Zepto.</p>
<p>Kabeer Biswas, cofounder and chief executive of Dunzo, said in Reliance Retail &#8212; which is run by India&#8217;s richest man, Mukesh Ambani &#8212; the startup has found a &#8220;long-term partner with whom we can accelerate growth and redefine how Indians shop for their daily and weekly essentials.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re excited by the traction and velocity that Dunzo Daily has achieved and over the next 3 years, we aim to establish ourselves as one of the most reliable quick commerce providers in the country.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chalk another one up for decentralized enforcement: France&#8217;s data protection watchdog has slapped headline-grabbing fines on Facebook and Google for failing to respect local (and pan-EU) cookie consent rules.</p>
<p>Today, the CNIL <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-cnil-fines-google-total-150-million-euros-and-facebook-60-million-euros-non-compliance">said</a> it&#8217;s fined Google €150M (~$170M) and Facebook €60M (~$68M) for breaching French law, following investigations of how they present tracking choices to users of google.fr, youtube.com and facebook.com.</p>
<p>The regulator said it was acting after receiving a number of complaints.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254341" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a clear breach of EU and French law, it found the pair do not offer an option for users to reject non-essential cookies as easily as the option they offer for them to accept all tracking.</p>
<p>So, in short, the tech giants were using manipulative dark patterns to try to force consent.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an illustrative snippet from the CNIL&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-facebook-ireland-limited-fined-60-million-euros">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; &#8230; the information given by the company is not clear since, in order to refuse the deposit of cookies, Internet users must click on a button entitled &#8220;Accept cookies&#8221;, displayed in the second window. It considered that such a title necessarily generates confusion and that the user may have the feeling that it is not possible to refuse the deposit of cookies and that they have no way to manage it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The restricted committee judged that the methods of collecting consent proposed to users, as well as the lack of clarity of information provided to them, constitute violations of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Under EU law, if consent is the legal basis being claimed for processing people&#8217;s data there are strict standards that must be adhered to &#8212; consent must be informed, specific and freely given in order for it to be obtained legally.</p>
<p>Long running complaints against Facebook and Google over similarly problematic consent issues continue to languish on the desk of the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), meanwhile &#8212; which under the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&#8217;s one-stop-shop (OSS) mechanism is a quasi centralized enforcer for most of big tech.</p>
<p>The DPC has been accused of dragging its feet on GDPR oversight of tech giants and creating a bottleneck for effective enforcement of the regulation, as the OSS encourages forum shopping &#8212; and Ireland&#8217;s low corporate tax economy appears only too happy to oblige client corporates with low resolution regulatory oversight too.</p>
<p>Notably, the CNIL is taking action against Facebook and Google under an earlier piece of EU legislation &#8212; the ePrivacy Directive &#8212; which gives competence to national agencies in their own territories. So the French continue to find creative ways to apply GDPR data protection standards nationally, despite the OSS and Irish GDPR blockage.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a particular irony here, in that Google and Facebook involved themselves in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy/">regional lobbying efforts to delay a planned update to the ePrivacy Directive</a> &#8212; which would have replaced it with a regulation, as we&#8217;ve reported before.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Digging into Google&#8217;s push to freeze ePrivacy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy/embed/#?secret=eIRrojVabg" data-secret="eIRrojVabg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/07/eprivacy-an-overview-of-europes-other-big-privacy-rule-change/">ePrivacy Regulation</a> still hasn&#8217;t been adopted &#8212; despite being proposed back in 2017! Which creates inconsistencies between EU law. But does also leaves Member State-level regulators such as CNIL free to enforce ePrivacy rules within their own jurisdictions, retaining decentralized power to sanction big tech on its home turf under the ePrivacy Directive. So, er, oopsy! That&#8217;s turned into a fairly expensive mistake for Facebook and Google in France at least.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s regulator has been especially busy on this front &#8212; fining Google €100M back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">December 2020</a> for dropping tracking cookies without consent. At the same time it also stung Amazon €35M over the same issue.</p>
<p>Earlier, the CNIL even managed to get an early GDPR fine in against Google &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/">all the way back in 2019</a> &#8212; before the company realized its legal exposure and switched the legal entity handling EU users&#8217; data from the US to Ireland so that its regional business would fall under the DPC&#8217;s &#8216;less muscular&#8217; oversight.</p>
<p>To date, Google has not faced a single sanction under GDPR out of Ireland &#8212; despite a number of very substantial and very long running complaints filed against it, including over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">forced consent</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/googles-location-tracking-finally-under-formal-probe-in-europe/">its handling of location data</a>; and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">adtech</a>.</p>
<p>Complaints are not only continuing to stack up against tech giants over systemic breaches of EU data protection law and against the DPC for its embarrassingly thin record on enforcement &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint/">even for alleged corruption, in a more recent charge against Ireland</a> &#8212; but also against the European Commission itself which <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyryan/status/1478683243193024512">stands accused</a> of failing in its duty to monitor GDPR enforcement at a Member State level.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My reply to Didier Reynders, European Justice Commissioner, on 14 December is now public. The Commission must act to uphold data protection law. <br />His recent letter to MEPs, covered by <a href="https://twitter.com/vmanancourt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vmanancourt</a>, is perplexing. <a href="https://t.co/kt2nkfV8Se">https://t.co/kt2nkfV8Se</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Johnny Ryan (@johnnyryan) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyryan/status/1478683243193024512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The Commission did intervene verbally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/gdpr-centralized-enforcement/">late last year</a> &#8212; with a direct warning to data protection agencies that GPDR enforcement must become &#8220;effective&#8221; fast or else it suggested DPAs would face having such power taken out of their hands &#8212; in favor of centralized enforcement by the EU executive.</p>
<p>At the same time, Google and Facebook were also blasted by the Commission which accused adtech giants of choosing legal tricks over genuine compliance with the bloc&#8217;s privacy standards, with commissioner Vera Jourová warning: &#8220;I<span lang="EN-GB">t is high time for those companies to take protection of personal data seriously. I want to see full compliance, not legal tricks. It’s time not to hide behind small print, but tackle the challenges head on.”</span></p>
<p>But despite firing a few pot-shots, the Commission appears reluctant to actually step in and sanction Ireland, though. So it&#8217;s been left to Member States like France to make the point in another way &#8212; i.e. by having its agencies illustrate that enforcement is not only possible but happening.</p>

<p>In addition to today&#8217;s headline-grabbing fines, the CNIL has ordered Facebook and Google to change how they present cookie choices to users in France &#8212; giving the pair three months to provide local users with a means of refusing cookies that&#8217;s as simple as the existing means of accepting them &#8212; &#8220;in order to guarantee their freedom of consent&#8221;.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with the order will mean the companies face further penalties &#8212; of €100,000 per day of delay.</p>
<p>The CNIL has been focusing its oversight on cookie consents for some time.</p>
<p>The regulator set a deadline of March 31, 2021 for websites to comply with <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cookies-et-autres-traceurs-la-cnil-publie-des-lignes-directrices-modificatives-et-sa-recommandation">updated cookie guidance</a> which it published back in October 2020. And, since the end of March, says it has adopted nearly 100 &#8220;corrective measures&#8221; (aka, orders and sanctions) related to non-compliance with the legislation on cookies.</p>
<p>Ireland also published <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/sites/default/files/uploads/2020-04/Guidance%20note%20on%20cookies%20and%20other%20tracking%20technologies.pdf">updated cookie guidance</a>, back in April 2020 &#8212; when it said it would give websites and data controllers six months to come into compliance before taking any enforcement action.</p>
<p>However the DPC has once again shown itself to be all mouth and no trousers: Failing to issue any public sanctions in relation to cookie consent violations against commercial entities (and certainly nothing against Facebook or Google on this front).</p>
<p>A DPC decision against Facebook-owned WhatsApp that was issued late <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">last year</a> focused on transparency breaches.</p>
<p>The size of that eventual penalty for WhatsApp &#8212; $267M &#8212; was also substantially inflated after interventions by other EU DPAs and the European Data Protection Board; Ireland&#8217;s draft decision had only suggested a fine of up to €50M. Facebook, meanwhile, is seeking to evade the sanction by appealing against it.)</p>
<p>Reached for comment on the CNIL&#8217;s spank for disingenuous cookie consents, a Meta/Facebook spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;​​We are reviewing the authority&#8217;s decision and remain committed to working with relevant authorities. Our cookie consent controls provide people with greater control over their data, including a new settings menu on Facebook and Instagram where people can revisit and manage their decisions at any time, and we continue to develop and improve these controls.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The tech giant also pointed to an <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/updating-our-cookie-controls-in-europe/">announcement </a>it made in September last year about an update to its local &#8220;cookie controls&#8221; &#8212; when it said it would be giving people in Europe &#8220;a more granular level of control over their cookie choices and more information on what we use different kinds of cookies for, including what information we receive from other apps and websites&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This work is part of our ongoing efforts to give people greater control over their privacy and align with evolving privacy requirements, such as the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive (ePD),&#8221; it added at the time.</p>
<p>Whatever the specific fiddles Facebook made back then the changes don&#8217;t seem to have impressed the French.</p>
<p>At the time of writing Google had not responded to a request for comment on CNIL&#8217;s sanction but we&#8217;ll update this report if we get one.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>A Google spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People trust us to respect their right to privacy and keep them safe. We understand our responsibility to protect that trust and are committing to further changes and active work with the <span class="il">CNIL</span> in light of this decision under the ePrivacy Directive.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Namibian business-to-business e-commerce startup <a href="https://www.gojabu.com/">JABU</a> confirmed to TechCrunch that it has raised a $3.2 million financing round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed round, which was closed last year, welcomed investors such as Afore Capital, Y Combinator, FJ Labs, Quiet Capital, Kli Capital, Pareto Capital and unnamed angels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a last-mile distribution e-commerce company, JABU joins a list of startups across the continent that help small retailers order and stock their products and, at the same time, provide data-driven services to suppliers and manufacturers.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253794" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO <a href="https://na.linkedin.com/in/davidakinin">David Akinin</a> founded JABU in mid-2020 to fix Namibia’s inefficient and almost nonexistent supply chain and distribution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its platform connects over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers — such as Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, Namibmills — and digitizes orders, payments and logistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Namibian startup has its fleet of vehicles along with eight distribution centers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Suppliers using the platform have dashboards to see where their products are being delivered, check key performance indicators and book merchandising. They can also make advertising and marketing campaigns at shops, perform product giveaways and tap</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into merchandising revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JABU operated in stealth mode for much of last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It got into Y Combinator during the accelerator’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">summer batch</a> in 2021, the first time for a Namibian startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup doesn’t appear in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/this-yc-summer-batch-features-the-largest-group-of-african-startups-yet/">curated list</a> because it deferred its Demo Day until this year’s winter batch, where up to 15 African startups </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been selected by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Y Combinator, according to some sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year saw venture capital firms and institutional investors scramble to back newly formed and existing business-to-business e-commerce retail startups. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the earliest in the space, Nigerian B2B e-commerce platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/tradedepot-raises-110m-from-ifc-novastar-to-extend-bnpl-service-to-merchants-across-africa/">TradeDepot</a>, raised a combined $110 million in debt and equity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Startups from other parts of Africa that raised investments include Morocco’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/chari-a-moroccan-startup-digitizing-mom-and-pop-stores-raises-5m-at-70m-valuation/">Chari,</a> Egypt’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/egyptian-startup-capiter-raises-33m-to-expand-b2b-e-commerce-platform-across-mena/">Capiter</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/maxab-the-egyptian-b2b-food-and-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-40m-for-expansion/">MaxAB</a>, and Kenya’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/kenyas-twiga-raises-50m-to-scale-affordable-food-solutions-across-africa/">Twiga</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/kenyas-marketforce-raises-2m-plans-to-focus-on-its-b2b-retail-marketplace-rejareja/">MarketForce</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JABU shines a light on the Southern Africa region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company operates in three cities in Namibia and recently expanded into two Zambian cities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its monthly GMV has grown 25x and the average growth of delivered SKUs stands at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 53% monthly since March. The company said that revenue has also seen a 35x growth within the same time frame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with most African countries, Namibia is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">heavily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reliant on cash. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And JABU — profiting from owning its supply chain — is making efforts to digitize its physical cash collection processes via wallets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the money from retailers arrives at JABU distribution centers, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> takes 48 hours to settle into the banks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead of going through this mundane process, JABU’s wallets will allow merchants to deposit and withdraw money immediately in sync with these centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our volumes growth grew so much and we’ve picked up so much money in physical currency, the banks and others have sat down and said, ‘How can we fix this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?’ I mean, we went from having a couple R100,000 (rands) a week to having millions of Namibian dollars. And we realized there’s something better and bigger than we originally tapped into,” Akinin said about why the company is creating wallets for its merchants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akinin said the next stage of JABU’s wallet system would see merchants offering other services to consumers on top of their digitized cash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only way to do that is by partnering with the merchants, and they go through a [know your customer] process, we make sure the merchants have the right space and the right account </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back their float. And then they transact with their customers. So we’re entering the B2B2C space through the merchants that we work with,” he said.</span></p>
<p>JABU’s revenue largely comes from distribution it carries out itself or via third-party fleets<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Merchandising and targeted marketing and advertising also bring in bucks for the company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will take commissions from transactions performed on merchants’ wallets in the future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akinin, who had a stint at Google as a sales and goods analyst, also spent parts of his professional career as an investment banker at Credit Suisse</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He would later make a series of visits to top African cities like Johannesburg, Lagos and Addis Ababa, but it was in Windhoek that he found the spark to try something new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Namibia had huge housing demand at the time. Akinin launched a startup to offer digital mortgages but pivoted to a construction company with a presence in Namibia, Zambia and Cameroon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the pandemic, Akinin’s construction company embarked on a COVID relief program to donate food supplies in Namibia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then, he stumbled on the country’s B2B e-commerce retail opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went into the informal sector and realized that the city had shut down every single informal retailer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And when they did that, we had this software we had developed to like digitize housing demand,” he said, describing how JABU started. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hired 40 people from the community and in about one or two weeks, we registered 1,000 shops that had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been affected by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this shutdown. We realized that there’s a huge opportunity here to not only help them reopen but understand something very key here that they have no supply chain and also no way of sourcing their products at an affordable rate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Informal retail is still king in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A<a href="https://www.pwc.co.za/en/press-room/retail-in-africa.html"> study by PwC</a> reported that informal channels such as kiosks and mom-and-pop stores account for 90% of sales in Africa’s major economies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The opportunity is so large that some startups, such as Nigerian B2B retail platform Sabi (a Rensource spinoff), said it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/rensource-spinoff-sabi-closes-6m-bridge-round-expands-b2b-retail-platform-outside-nigeria/">processing almost $12 million monthly GMV,</a> TechCrunch learned in an interview with its founders in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JABU, with more than 200 employees, is gearing for a Series A fundraising this quarter, Akinin told TechCrunch. The startup will use the seed round and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to expand into Botswana and South Africa, grow its tech and operations team, and train its field agents.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://payfit.com/en/">PayFit</a> just announced that it closed a new $289 million Series E round (€254 million) before the holidays. Following this round, the startup has reached a post-money valuation of $2.1 billion (€1.82 billion).</p>
<p>The company has been building a payroll and HR software-as-a-service platform for small and medium companies. It is operating in a handful of European countries — around 150,000 people currently get paid through PayFit.</p>
<p>General Atlantic is leading the round, while some of PayFit’s existing investors are participating once again, such as Eurazeo, Bpifrance&#8217;s Large Venture fund and Accel.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253954" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup has been on a roll as it raised a Series D round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/payfit-raises-107-million-for-its-payroll-and-hr-platform/">in March 2021</a>. I asked about PayFit’s valuation and how it has changed since the Series D.</p>
<p>“It’s true that we had never communicated about our valuation before. We only shared the size of our funding rounds,” co-founder and CEO Firmin Zocchetto told me. “I can only tell you that our valuation has greatly increased.”</p>
<p>He listed two reasons why PayFit has had little issues raising at a higher valuation. First, the company is doing well when it comes to revenue. The startup’s annual recurring revenue has increased by 70% in 2021.</p>
<p>Second, there’s a lot of money floating around for the best performing tech companies. He said that the current climate is “extremely favorable.” And I bet a lot of people would recommend taking advantage of the situation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The market opportunity</h2>
<p>But let’s try to dissect PayFit’s business a bit more to find out how the company ended up here. PayFit lets you manage your payroll from a web browser and automate as many steps as possible.</p>
<p>PayFit has a product advantage compared to other solutions as you don’t need to be an expert and work for an accounting firm to generate payroll. The startup makes sure you remain compliant and hides the complexity. For instance, if there are regulatory changes, PayFit will update the logic of its application.</p>
<p>The company also has a big market opportunity. Every company needs a payroll solution <em>and</em> it’s incredibly hard to switch from one solution to another — it’s the perfect Venn diagram for a software-as-a-service product.</p>
<p>There are currently 6,000 companies using PayFit. Around 80% of them are based in France. Other customers are located in Spain, Germany or the U.K. Most importantly, when someone creates a company from scratch, many of them choose PayFit and stick with it.</p>
<p>When you think about it, 150,000 employees getting paid through PayFit is not that much. There are tens of millions of employees in France, the U.K., Spain and Germany. Before opening a branch in new countries, PayFit wants to capture more market share in these four markets.</p>
<p>Labor laws vary from one country to another, which means that there could be different geographical leaders as there’s a natural barrier to entry. For instance, <a href="https://gusto.com">Gusto</a> and <a href="https://justworks.com">Justworks</a> are doing well in the U.S. but they don’t operate in other markets. It&#8217;s going to be important to see if PayFit has what it takes to become the clear market leader in France, the U.K., Germany and Spain.</p>
<p>Finally, once PayFit owns the relationship with the HR or admin specialist in the client company, it can provide additional services. “We started with payroll, but what we really care about is the employer-employee relationship,” Zocchetto said.</p>
<p>PayFit offers different tools to manage vacation, facilitate onboarding, manage time sheets and track employee expenses. Soon, the company will also offer a way to handle annual performance reviews in PayFit.</p>
<p>Essentially, PayFit is part of a cohort of startups that are reinventing the admin stack. PayFit’s founder names Qonto and Alan as two companies that are also working on overhauling back-end tools. <a href="https://qonto.com/en">Qonto</a> offers bank accounts for SMBs while <a href="https://alan.com">Alan</a> offers health insurance products for companies.</p>
<p>With 700 employees in Paris, Berlin, Barcelona and London, PayFit now wants to diversify its product offering, integrate with more third-party products and improve its customer service. The company wants to “offer small companies the same perks that you would get by working for big companies,” Zocchetto said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When young (or youngish) people think of age-tech, they may picture mostly clinical solutions—telemedicine platforms, for instance. Growing older, however, doesn’t just have a physical component. Isolation, for example, is a serious issue for elderly people, especially during the pandemic. And older people still have to manage their day-to-day routines and finances, not just plan estates and wills.</p>
<p>AARP Innovation Labs, the incubator program, highlights the many facets of aging <a href="https://aarpinnovationlabs.org/ces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in its CES’ virtual presentation</a> with a roster of startups that were divided into five groups: community, clinic, wellness, financial services and housing.</p>
<p>The program included fintech startups because of the pandemic’s economic impact, focusing on three companies that “are helping aging populations better manage finances and budgets, and effectively plan for the future.” Originally created to teach kids and teenagers financial literacy, <a href="https://www.goalsetter.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goalsetter</a> is expanding its reach to more people with savings and investment management tools. <a href="https://www.genivity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genivity</a> creates customized financial projections based on users’ health and lifestyle habits, medical conditions and retirement goals, showing them how many years they might need to work before retiring and and what point they may need extended care. <a href="https://trustandwill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trust &amp; Will</a>, meanwhile, makes it easy for families to create guardianship plans, wills and trusts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254309" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Goalsetter raises $15 million to go B2B with children&#8217;s financial literacy app&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/goalsetter-raises-15-million-to-go-b2b-with-childrens-financial-literacy-app/embed/#?secret=8NsxlPqLls" data-secret="8NsxlPqLls" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Isolation was a serious problem for older adults even before COVID-19 and the pandemic has made loneliness worse. AARP Innovation addresses that problem with its selection of &#8220;community&#8221; startups. While many people already rely on other video chat apps, <a href="https://kinoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinoo</a> wants to tailor the experience for families with elderly relatives living away from them. It IoT toys for kids that let them play games and do projects with their grandparents and other family members through Kinoo’s app.</p>
<p>A tabletop console gaming system, <a href="https://lastgameboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gameboard</a>, also lets family members enjoy fun time, instead of just chat time, with one another. It hosts hundreds of games, including role-playing games. <a href="https://beeyonder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beeyonder</a> is a marketplace for live virtual expert-led tours around the world, and can help alleviate the boredom of staying at home while the pandemic drags on.</p>
<p>Many of the startups in AARP’s incubator focus on aging in place, or helping older people stay in their homes instead of moving into a care facility. Its “Housing” section included three companies focused on personal mobility. <a href="https://www.meetcamino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camino Robotics</a> is creating “e-rollators,” or smart walkers with features that help people walk over slopes and uneven surfaces, brake automatically when going downhill and folds into “compact mode” for navigating tight spaces. <a href="https://brazemobility.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Braze Mobility </a>says it can turn any wheelchair into a smart wheelchair with patent-pending blind spot sensors that warn about obstacles through lights, sounds and vibrations. Meanwhile, De Oro Devices’ <a href="https://www.getnexstride.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NexStride</a>, created for people with Parkinson’s, is a small device that can be attached to canes and walkers and uses audio and visual cues to help users overcome freezing episodes and go on longer walks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://tellusyoucare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tellus</a> is a startup that helps people live on their own with small wall-mounted sensors that can track biometric data, including heart rate, breathing, sleep and falls, from up to five meters away, and sends alerts to caregivers and family members through an app.</p>
<p>In its wellness category, AARP Innovation presented three startups focused on overall health and well-being. These included Zibrio, which was also part of AARP’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/startups-at-ces-showed-how-tech-can-help-elderly-people-and-their-caregivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CES line-up last year</a>. <a href="https://www.zibrio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zibrio</a> is a scale that not only measures weight, but also gauges a person’s balance and fall risk. The company says Zibrio’s balance scale can predict if you are at risk of falling within the next 12 months, and its app then gives personalized care recommendations. While many people track their nutrition and exercise with apps like MyFitnessPal or Noom, <a href="https://mightyhealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mighty Health</a> was developed specifically for people over 50 years old. It connects users with a health coach and features nutrition and workout plans created for older adults.</p>

<p>Mental wellbeing is also incredibly important. <a href="https://www.ompractice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ompractice</a> was started to help people who “experience geographic, economic and inclusivity barriers” get access to health, wellness and mindfulness features by partnering with fitness studios and working with large organizations, including health systems, to make their services accessible to users.</p>
<p>Of course, improving healthcare and the delivery of health services for older adults is extremely important, especially in the United States with its fragmented healthcare system. Included under AARP Innovation’s “clinic” section, <a href="https://www.foliahealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Folia Health</a> is a health “individual operating system” that lets patients answer multiple choice questions each day, when are then reviewed by their providers to help with diagnostic and care plans. It can be used to manage several conditions and communicate with multiple care providers. Telemedicine startup <a href="https://tembo.health/ Tembo Health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tembo</a>, on the other hand, partners with senior care communities, enabling them to provide remote medical services to their residents or clients. <a href="https://www.embleema.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Embleema</a> was created to make pharmaceutical studies easier by making the evidence generation and regulatory review processes faster.</p>
<p>For individuals, the clinic section included two startups. <a href="https://www.mindmics.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MindMics</a> are smart earbuds that analyze biometrics, including heartrate, and send them to an app. <a href="https://joylux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JoyLux</a> specifically addresses menopause with a roster of products, including devices for pelvic floor exercises, lubricants, supplements and cooling pads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.socar.kr/">SOCAR</a>, a south Korean car-sharing startup, has filed for an initial public offering, <a href="https://kind.krx.co.kr/listinvstg/listinvstgcom.do?method=searchListInvstgCorpDetail&amp;bizProcNo=20211130000101">announced</a> on Wednesday by <a href="http://open.krx.co.kr/contents/OPN/05/05000000/OPN05000000.jsp#fe3647848b826aa1ddee224c4b5526f4=1&amp;view=25522">Korea Exchange</a>. The details &#8211; the number of shares to be offered in the IPO and the price range &#8211; have not yet been determined, said a spokesperson at SOCAR. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SOCAR has reached approximately $834 billion (1 trillion won) valuation after raising $50.7 million (60 billion won) in October 2020. The company has raised a total of about $275 million since its inception in 2011, the company spokesperson confirmed.  According to media reports, SOCAR’s estimated valuation is to be $2.5 billion (3 trillion won) after the listing in the first half of this year. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its previous investors include <a href="https://www.sk-inc.com/en/">SK Holdings</a>, Bain Capital, Premier Partners, SoftBank Ventures Asia, Altos Ventures, KB Investment, Stonebridge Ventures, LB Private Equity, SG Private Equity, and more.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254273" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company plans to launch a transportation super app this year that will provide all-in-one mobility services like car-sharing, electric bike-sharing, parking lot search, car-hailing, train reservation and more, Jaewook Park, CEO of SOCAR, said in early December at the company&#8217;s press conference. Park also said SOCAR would replace a fleet of its vehicles with zero-emission, including electric or hydrogen-powered cars, by 2030 and strengthen its autonomous cars business. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SOCAR will accelerate to make additional acquisitions and advance its technology with the IPO proceeds, Park said. The company already completed two acquisitions last month &#8211; South Korean online parking platform </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.moduparking.com/?NaPm=ct%3Dkxgw9k21%7Cci%3Dcheckout%7Ctr%3Dds%7Ctrx%3D%7Chk%3D8d59cd5d1e333d91b3a1bf5d49794f02cf9bbdd9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Modu Company</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and electric bike rental platform </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://elecle.bike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Elecle</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. SOCAR also invested in autonomous driving startup <a href="https://www.rideflux.com/">RideFlux</a> in 2018. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 11-year-old firm started the car-sharing service with 100 rental cars in Jeju in 2011 and launched its mobile app in 2012. SOCAR acquired VCNC, a Korean mobile messaging app platform, in 2018 to operate a van-hailing service Tada. (The startup, however, had to cease its van-hailing service in 2020 because of South Korea’s revised law that restricts ride-hailing to only licensed taxis and limits rental car services from offering drivers, with the exception of vans with 11 to 15 seats.) Last October, SOCAR has <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20211008005100320">sold</a> a 60% stake in the ride-hailing arm to Viva Republica, the Seoul-based fintech company behind Toss. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In 2018, SOCAR set up a Malaysia-based subsidiary SOCAR Malaysia, which has raised a total of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/socar-malaysia/company_financials">$73.2 million</a> so far. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The competition of the mobility platform industry in South Korea has intensified as local car-hailing companies such as <a href="https://www.kakaomobility.com/">Kakao Mobility</a> and <a href="https://www.tmapmobility.com/">TMAP Mobility</a> actively expand their business in the country with ambitions to become the mobility super app. In October, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-revives-push-south-korea-210000315.html">Uber Technologies</a> also joined the race by forming a joint venture company with TMAP Mobility, owned by Korean telco giant SK Telecom, to offer ride-hailing service in South Korea. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Mobility reportedly plans to go public in two years while TMAP Mobility aims to list by 2025. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company spokesperson noted that its car-sharing peers also include Zipcar, Turo, and getaround. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some of my favorite childhood memories include being read to, and learning to read myself to get lost in a book. If you&#8217;ll forgive me the <em>oldmanyellsatcloud.gif</em> moment: It&#8217;s a grievous loss that many children are so comprehensively surrounded by screens that it&#8217;s hard to experience this. I was delighted, then, to see <a href="https://www.onanoff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oranoff</a> launch its StoryPhones product at CES this year. The headphones can, independently of any other devices you connect to them for audio playback store a bunch of audio content within the headphones themselves. Perfect for getting lost in the magic of fairy tales and magic.</p>
<p>The company announced it even snagged a content collaboration with Disney for its launch, with a collection of stories for children, bringing to their ears characters kids are likely to know from the big and small screen. The headphones will ship with stories including some of the best-known characters and stories in the Disney line-up, including Mickey and Minnie Mouse, The Little Mermaid, Frozen, The Lion King, Toy Story, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc. and more. The company claims it has a library of carefully curated content suitable for kiddos aged 3 and up.</p>
<p>In addition to pre-recorded content, the headphones support something the company calls &#8220;PlayShield,&#8221; where parents can record their own stories on a mobile app, and load them onto the headphones for playback later. The company suggests that it is a way to connect with grandparents and far-flung families, bringing them all closer through storytelling.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251003" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Finally, the product has a feature called ZenShield, which &#8220;contains relaxing audio profiles to help overstimulated kids calm down, relax and even sleep.&#8221; You can think of it as a pause button for the rowdy tykes, I suppose. The sounds include piano music, ocean waves, raindrops and more.</p>
<p>The headphones have a SafeAudio feature built in to keep the volume down to prevent hearing damage to sensitive little children&#8217;s ears, and as a result, it picked up a couple of CES 2022 innovation awards, in the &#8220;Headphones &amp; Personal Audio&#8221; and &#8220;Health &amp; Wellness&#8221; categories.</p>
<p>The headphones can store around 90 minutes of content on its pitiful 64MB of storage &#8211; in a world where a 4GB SD card can be procured for $4, I&#8217;m baffled why the company would only include so little user-accessible storage; perhaps they&#8217;ll re-think that choice in a future version of the headphones.</p>
<p>At first, the headphones are launching across Europe, in Italy, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, the U.K., and France, in five languages &#8212; Italian, Spanish, German, French and English. The recommended retail price in Europe is £84.99 (around US$115). for the US, The StoryPhones bundle which includes a headphone and either a Mickey or Minnie StoryShield costs $99.90. The StoryShields can be bought individually too and range from $7.99 to $14.99.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CES hasn’t traditionally been the healthiest week for me. Aside from some unintentional intermittent fasting, TechCrunch really has the habit of doing it up with our team dinners at the show, to say nothing of Matt’s near religious devotion to a Mexican place named Tacos &amp; Beer.</p>
<p>In my defense, I will say that there’s never been a year that I haven’t blown through my step count several times over every day of the show. Wandering the hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center will do that to a tech journalist. This year, of course, my steps have been suffering, as TechCrunch opted to attend the show virtually, amid omicron-related concerns.</p>
<p>If I’m being honest, those same concerns left me wondering whether I should be back at the gym, too. I’m sure I’m not alone in that, either. While it’s true that companies like Peloton saw regression as gyms and the like saw re-openings late last year, this pandemic is far from over. And the idea of being in a confined room with a bunch of other heavy breathers seems less than ideal, even as it’s currently too cold to do much working out outside in many parts of the country.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254247" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="h1Qm30CbpQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/companies-rush-to-replace-the-gym-at-ces/">Companies rush to replace the gym at CES</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Companies rush to replace the gym at CES&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/companies-rush-to-replace-the-gym-at-ces/embed/#?secret=h1Qm30CbpQ" data-secret="h1Qm30CbpQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It’s always hard to project the longevity of these sorts of trends, but it’s pretty safe to say that the last few years will have proven a sea change for the world of home fitness. I’ve personally spoken with many people who don’t plan to go back to the gym after all of this is over (well, assuming all of this is ever actually over, I guess). That’s not entirely a symptom of the pandemic, of course &#8212; companies like Peloton and Mirror were gaining plenty of traction before many of us knew what a novel coronavirus was.</p>
<p>Of course, when it rains its pours with this stuff. My inbox has been bombarded with home fitness services for the past couple of years. It’s clear that as many companies as possible are looking to capitalize on this moment, and between Peloton’s earnings and transactions like Lululemon’s acquisition of Mirror, how can blame them? We certainly saw an uptick at last year’s all-virtual CES, but in 2022, they’re impossible to avoid.</p>
<p>Like any ultra-hot tech category, only a few will survive. Peloton was set to loom large over the event in more ways than one, including a keynote by CEO John Foley &#8212; though earlier this week, the fitness brand joined a long list of companies opting out of attendance. In spite of such concerns, however, there were plenty of products more than willing to fill that void.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2254252" style="width: 685px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254252" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254252" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dims.jpeg" alt="" width="675" height="506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dims.jpeg 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dims.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dims.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dims.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254252" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LG</p></div></p>
<p>LG’s offering in the category was far more conceptual than practical. If anything, the company’s stationary bike was designed to show off how its curved monitor technology could be incorporated into home fitness. Given the size of the product, it seemed like a pretty solid indictment of itself, given that space and price are at a premium for many looking to outfit their homes with exercise equipment.</p>
<p>I’m frankly surprised we didn’t get more attempts to jam the term “metaverse” into this year’s home fitness pitches. VR fitness app Liteboxer wins the prize there. &#8220;The dawn of the metaverse points to a demand for a deeper sense of connectivity,” co-founder and CEO Jeff Morin said in a release. “Virtual reality workouts connect people in a way that&#8217;s more meaningful than a 2D screen on a tablet, phone or computer. With just a VR headset and your will to win, anyone can now workout anywhere in the world with the best trainers, tracks and fitness technology.&#8221;</p>

<p>The “meta” word is mentioned four times in the aforementioned release. In this case it seems to be used fairly interchangeably with the term “VR,” as this is a title for the Quest 2 headset. Liteboxer VR arrives in the Quest Store on March 3, and will run $19 a month for a subscription.</p>
<p>Echelon showcased its EX-8s Connect Bike, designed to take on Peloton’s high-end Bike+, undercutting the product only slightly at $2,399. That’s a high price tag for a company that also makes uber-affordable products for Walmart. That price gets you, among other things, a curved 24-inch 1080p display and a customizable lightshow for the wheels. It’s set to arrive later this month.<img loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2254253" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/home_02_pc-1.png" alt="" width="768" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/home_02_pc-1.png 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/home_02_pc-1.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/home_02_pc-1.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/home_02_pc-1.png?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/home_02_pc-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WonderciseWondercise, meanwhile, is a software-first solution. The company aims to offer a platform that’s designed to connect remote exercise buffs and break through some of the isolation that comes from switching from the gym to the home. Per the company’s press material:</p>
<blockquote><p>The live leaderboard displays scores based on an individual’s technique, creating a fun atmosphere in sessions. Colorful on-screen power bars and profiles were intentionally designed to make the experience feel like a game, adding a competitive dimension to workouts. Wondercise is focused on bringing the Internet of Things to the fitness industry so everyone can get the performance analytics and data they need, wherever they work out.</p></blockquote>
<p>As crowded as the home equipment category is getting, however, it’s nothing compared to software-first solutions, and Wondercise will be competiting directly with big names, including Apple and Samsung.</p>
<p>Hydrow, meanwhile, was one of the key companies representing home rowers. It’s a category beyond the saturated world of treadmills and bikes that’s prime for some real growth. Rowers offer a fuller body workout than bikes, though generally burn fewer calories. Peloton is rumored to be getting into the rowing machine game, but for now Hydrow looms as the big name in the space.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>We’re an early-stage startup that — like many other companies — is facing a significant challenge when it comes to recruiting talent. We have not posted job openings internationally, but we’ve received some applications from international talent. </strong></p>
<p><strong>This is all new territory for us. What’s your advice for hiring internationally? Also, I know the H-1B lottery is fast approaching. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can you explain a bit more about this process?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>— Eager Early-Stage Startup</strong></p>
<p>Dear Eager,</p>
<p>Yes, the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/099-h-1b-planning-for-fy2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H-1B lottery</a> is fast approaching! The period for registering H-1B candidates opens in March; there are a few steps companies need to take before then if they have never before participated in the H-1B lottery process. First, be sure to create an account with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which conducts the lottery. Given this timeline, your company should determine as soon as possible whether the positions you are looking to fill and the prospective international talent you are looking to hire would qualify for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H-1B specialty occupation visa</a>.</p>
<p>Check out my column in TechCrunch+ last week for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/dear-sophie-will-the-h-1b-lottery-be-based-on-the-highest-wages/">more specifics on the lottery process</a>. To bypass the H-1B lottery — or if a candidate is not selected in the lottery — your company could consider getting a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/066-cap-exempt-h-1bs-with-danielle-goldman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cap-exempt H-1B</a> for the candidate. Transferring an individual’s H-1B to your startup is also an option. To find out more about that process, take a look at this <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-should-we-sponsor-international-hires-for-h-1b-transfers-and-green-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dear Sophie column</a>.</p>
<h2>A futurist lens on international hires</h2>
<p>I recently had a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/103-a-futurists-lens-on-immigration-future-of-work-climate-change-and-more-with-jamais-cascio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fascinating conversation</a> with Jamais Cascio, a futurist and distinguished fellow at the <a href="https://www.iftf.org/jamaiscascio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Institute for the Future in Palo Alto</a>. Cascio has some wonderful insight relevant to your question.</p>
<p>The population in the U.S. is getting older and the birth rate is declining; as such, we will increasingly need to look to immigration to keep our economy going. Cascio discusses three mindsets for dealing with radical changes in this chaotic world to remain strong as a company and succeed into the future. This advice is highly applicable to companies such as yours as you embark on an effort to hire from abroad.</p>
<p>The three mindsets that Cashio said would benefit companies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resilience: Being able to withstand a shock to the system without breaking. For example, he said companies that have just-in-time delivery models are very brittle and prone to break down compared to those that have built-in slack into their system. Building in slack often requires additional resources and reduced efficiency and profit but offers built-in resilience.</li>
<li>Improvisation: Remain creative and nimble and be ready to embrace change.</li>
<li>Empathy: Probably the most critical of the three, this involves recognizing the humanity in others and what we do matters to others now and in the future. (I loved hearing that the role of the heart is and will be critical for business success!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Embracing these mindsets while developing an immigration strategy that offers stability for international talent will be key to attracting and retaining talent and creating a company culture that fosters innovation and endurance. Listen to my podcast, “<a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/057-11-tips-for-companies-to-support-valued-humans/\" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tips for Companies to Support Valued Humans</a>,” in which I discuss this in more detail.</p>

<h2>Specific visas to consider</h2>
<p>Before we dive into visa specifics, please be aware that I recommend you consult an experienced immigration attorney, who can help you devise an immigration strategy for prospective international hires, as well as provide guidance on what visas would be appropriate given the job opening and prospective candidate. Take a look at a previous <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-any-advice-on-visa-issues-for-new-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dear Sophie column</a> in which I offer an overview on immigration-related matters you should focus on if your startup does not yet have someone handling HR.</p>
<h2>O-1A visa</h2>
<p>If your prospective hires don’t make it through the H-1B lottery process I mentioned above, or you need to get them here more quickly than October and you can’t take the risk that they might not be selected in the H-1B lottery this year, a great option is the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/o-visas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O-1A extraordinary ability visa</a>. More and more of our startup clients are opting to pursue it for key executives and individual contributors with niche expertise. While the bar for qualifying for the O-1A is much higher than for the H-1B, the process for getting an O-1A is much quicker. And the O-1A does not have an annual cap or lottery process to contend with.</p>
<h2>Visas for talent from specific countries</h2>
<p>Specific visas exist for talent from Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico and Singapore.</p>
<p>If the job candidate is an Australian national, an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/e-3-visa-australian-professionals/">E-3 visa</a> will allow that individual to work in the U.S. in a specialty occupation, just like an H-1B. E-3 visas also require the sponsoring employer to file a Labor Condition Application with the U.S. Department of Labor, as is required with H-1B petitions. A maximum of 10,500 E-3 visas is available each year.</p>
<p>Is the job candidate a Chilean or Singaporean national? If so, the candidate may qualify for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h1-b1-visas-chileans-singaporeans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H-1B1</a> specialty occupation visa, which is an H-1B visa earmarked for citizens of Chile and Singapore. Thanks to special treaties the U.S. has with those two countries, professionals may qualify to receive H-1B1 visas on a fast-track basis. Each year, 1,400 H-1B1 visas are reserved for Chileans and 5,400 are reserved for Singaporeans — and rarely are those visas completely exhausted.</p>
<p>Professionals from <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/tn-treaty-national-nafta-canadians/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada</a> and <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/tn-treaty-national-nafta-mexicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mexico</a> can come to the U.S. to work under a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/tn-visas-and-status-for-canadian-and-mexican-citizens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TN visa</a>, which was born out of trade treaties between Canada, Mexico and the U.S. TN visas are limited to professions listed in treaty agreements, but most of these jobs overlap with H-1B specialty occupations.</p>
<p>Some good news: Through the end of 2022, consular officers can now waive the in-person interview requirement for some individuals seeking some nonimmigrant (temporary) visas, including H-1Bs and O-1s. Individuals who are applying for a visa in their country or nationality of residence may have the interview waived if any of the following apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously issued any type of visa.</li>
<li>Never been refused a visa unless it was overcome or waived.</li>
<li>No ineligibility.</li>
<li>Citizens or nationals of a country that participates in the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/visa-waiver-program-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visa Waiver Program.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Wishing you every success!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 5, 2021! Today we have a great mix of news for you. Mega-rounds? Heck yes. Electric trucks from U.S. companies? Yep! Android cozying up to Windows? But of course. And some great essays on lock-up periods, LP transparency and more.</p>
<p>But before we do that, every once in a while I’m going to highlight a TechCruncher behind the scenes who deserves some love. Today it’s Henry Pickavet, one of our editors and guiding lights, someone I have known and worked with since my early 20s. He’s perfect, apart from the sports teams he follows and the fact that he likes cricket. Follow him <a href="https://twitter.com/pickavet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitter here</a> if you are so inclined! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254110" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/making-sense-of-opensea-at-a-13b-valuation/#:~:text=OpenSea%2C%20the%20well%2Dknown%20NFT,how%20overheated%20things%20have%20become.">Making sense of OpenSea at $13B:</a></strong> From rumor to report to confirmation, the OpenSea funding round worth $300 million came to its conclusion quickly. Now the NFT marketplace is worth some $13 billion. So, TechCrunch did the obvious thing and asked if that number makes any darn sense. As it turns out, yes, but how much depends on your level of crypto-bullishness,</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/google-brings-android-and-some-windows-pcs-closer-together/">Android <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f91d.png" alt="🤝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Windows:</a> </strong>While Apple has been busy defending its walls surrounding the garden that is iOS, Google and Microsoft have been busy paving roads between their Android and Windows operating systems. First, Microsoft announced that some Android apps would eventually run on Windows. And now, news that “Google is working with the likes of Intel, Acer and HP to [connect] your phone to your Windows PC.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/visual-collaboration-company-miro-valued-at-17-5b-following-400m-in-new-funding/"><strong>And here’s the *other* company now worth more than $10B:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It’s Miro! Yep, the online workspace company, as we put it, is now worth some $17.5 billion after raising a $400 million round. The company claims it has 30 million users. Competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/mural-raises-50m-series-c-after-tripling-its-arr-in-the-last-year/">Mural is also doing well</a>, indicating that their market is fairly deep in the remote-work era.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Startups/VC</h3>
<p>A few essays to start our startup download today, I think. The first comes from our own <a href="https://twitter.com/cookie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connie Loizos</a> diving into the “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/the-year-of-the-disappearing-lock-up/">year of the disappearing lock-up</a>.” In short, Loizos notes that the traditional forced holding period post-IPO is being dismantled in hot public offerings. Not that this is a guarantee of future results — the opposite, it seems — but it’s worth tracking the change to what was once a key IPO rule, and, frankly, mark of confidence.</p>
<p>Speaking of IPOs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/a-quick-check-in-on-the-neoinsurance-unicorn-public-meltdown/">the insurtech IPO wave of 2020 and 2021 is looking pretty darn threadbare today</a>. TechCrunch took a look back at the struggles of names we’ve written about for ages, the Roots and Metromiles of the world, but also Oscar Health. It hasn’t done well either, it turns out.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna Heim</a> wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/more-lp-transparency-is-overdue/">fascinating piece on LP transparency</a>. The idea that founders should care about where <em>their</em> investors get their money is not new. But what is fresh is the leverage that founders have over investors — the founder-investor power dynamic has flipped, leading more VCs to think that it might be time to open up their own books a little.</p>
<p>Now, more news!</p>

I dig it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/ai-startup-fractal-becomes-unicorn-with-360-million-investment-from-tpg/">Fractal goes unicorn with new $360M round:</a></strong> It turns out that this company is 21 years old, so it’s not a startup, per se.

<p>Data privacy has been top of mind for online sellers and for good reason: Regulators are taking an interest, and iOS 14.5 lets users turn off data tracking, with negative consequences for &#8220;Facebook&#8217;s ad targeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bearing those factors and others in mind, Ben Parr, president and co-founder of e-commerce marketing platform Octane.ai, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/4-trends-that-will-define-e-commerce-in-2022/">shared his predictions for 2022</a> with TechCrunch+:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personalization and zero-party data become critical.</li>
<li>E-commerce embraces web3 and NFTs, but what will that look like?</li>
<li>Live shopping goes mainstream.</li>
<li>Slow but gradual improvement to the supply chain.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>We have a number of automotive-themed news items below, but let’s start on your phone with Instagram. The social subsidiary of the larger Meta empire is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/instagram-chronological-feed/">bringing back its chronological feed</a>. Praise be. Forcing users to endure algorithmic timelines is lame, in my view, and something that moves power away from users toward the adtech gods that run social platforms. I might even re-sign up for Instagram now that this is fixed.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/ftc-settle-mortgage-files-exposed/"><strong>Mortgage data analytics company settles with FTC over data breach:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Back in 2019, TechCrunch reported that “OpticsML, a New York-based vendor working for Ascension, left a database of highly sensitive financial data exposed to the internet without a password.” Now two years after that reporting, results!</li>
<li><strong>GM promises a plethora of electric vehicles:</strong> If <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/electric-chevrolet-equinox-chevrolet-blazer-suvs-are-coming-in-2023/">you want an electric Equinox or Blazer</a>, GM is going to hook you up in 2023. It claims. And the company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/the-chevy-silverado-finally-goes-electric/">building an electric Silverado pickup</a>, coming a bit late to the table given how many announcements Ford has already made. But the die really is cast here regarding the future of rolling vehicles, no matter who is currently leading. They are going electric. And fast.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/gm-personal-autonomous-vehicles/">And GM wants to get self-driving cars on the road:</a> </strong>By the middle of the decade, the company said. I am a wee bit skeptical of any provided timeline for autonomous vehicles, but at some point they will work — right? — and that day will be good. Let’s hope these latest projections bear out in time.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Doosan Robotics this week announced $33.7 million in funding, led Praxis Capital Partners and Korea Investment Partners. The fundraising news arrives as the Seoul-based company shows off its wares at CES in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The company says the funding will be used to increase research and development and attract new partners as it looks to expand its global footprint. Doosan also notes in a release that its robotics systems have hit 1,000 units annually, while sales outside of Korea (primarily North America and Western Europe) now account for roughly 70% of that total figure. The company is also in the process of eyeing an IPO.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to expediting the growth of our business with the recent funds raised,” CEO Junghoon Ryu said in a release. “We will further enhance the competitiveness of new products and software that are mounted with our proprietary technology and strive to attain the position as number one market share holder in the global cobot market.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254204" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Doosan is primarily known for its collaborative robots (cobots), whose use run the gamut from manufacturing and research to the coffee-making barista robot, Dr. Presso, which debuted late last year.</p>
<p>Aside from the funding news, the company also announced the NINA (&#8220;New Inspiration. New Angle”) camera system. We’d mentioned it a few weeks ago, after it collected a CES Innovation award, but this week we’re getting more information on the robotic system, which is due out in March.</p>
<p>The company refers to NINA as a “prosumer” system, which likely applies to what’s supposed to be a relatively push-button approach to grabbing potentially complicated shots. That arrives in part, due to things like object tracking, coupled with an open platform that allows users to program different shots.</p>
<p>&#8220;NINA brings in a whole new era for Doosan as we expand our offerings into the entertainment and content genre,” the company’s CEO said in a separate statement. “Our goal has been to deliver something accessible yet innovative for professional content creators across entertainment, advertising, social media, and other relevant industries, and we’re confident NINA will deliver in big ways across the board.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Perhaps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/kickstarters-most-successful-fundraiser-shares-lessons-from-a-failed-campaign/">PodCase</a> was ahead of its time. It certainly made sense for devoted Apple fans: a one-stop portable charging solution for one’s iPhone and AirPods. The product also had the pedigree to match, including Pebble co-founder (and future YC partner) Eric Migicovsky. Ultimately the project failed to reach its lofty $300,000 Kickstarter goal.</p>
<p>For its part, Brooklyn-based Power1 kept its funding goals more grounded. The firm made $48,342 of a $20,000 Kickstarter target and has already begun production on the production, which is currently available for preorder for $99.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253265" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253265" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253265" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0775.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0775.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0775.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0775.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0775.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0775.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0775.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0775.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0775.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253265" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252274" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I’ve been playing around with a unit for a couple of weeks now, before its debut on the floor at CES. This model isn’t quite production-ready, mind. As the company’s founder put it to me: don’t drop it. That is to say, we’re not dealing with the final materials here. But it still gives you a pretty good picture of what you’re in for.</p>
<p>It’s split into two pieces: a rubberized case/bumper, and a charging addition that snaps on via MagSafe. The modularity is a nice touch &#8212; I’ve been primarily using it detached from the battery because, well, I don’t leave my apartment as much as I did in the before times.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253264" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253264" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253264" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0776.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0776.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0776.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0776.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0776.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0776.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0776.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0776.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CMC_0776.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253264" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The battery comes in white or black, with a contoured design similar to battery cases from companies like Mophie. It monopolizes most of the device’s rear, but for a cutout for the camera module. To its right is the AirPods case, with a flip-up transparent lid. The battery charges via USB-C and sports a little on-off switch on the bottom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>For size reasons, it’s impossible to make a universal case, so at launch it will be limited to the iPhone 12, 12 Pro or 13, while the AirPods are only compatible with the latest models and not the Pros. One assumes that if the Power1 is a hit, AXS will expand availability. We&#8217;ll know soon enough if it&#8217;s truly an idea whose time has come.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a crazy year in growth marketing, what with the meteoric rise of TikTok, radical iOS privacy shifts and <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q3-2021-pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=vc_market_update&amp;utm_medium=nl-na&amp;utm_source=daily_pitch&amp;utm_content=q3_2021_pitchbook-nvca_venture_monitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a staggering $240 billion poured into U.S. startups</a> as of September 30.</p>
<p>All of this new money has meant heavier investments in growth marketing throughout 2021. The heavier investments have occurred during uncertain times, with startups scrambling to find ways to measure iOS conversions and unlock TikTok as a new channel.</p>
<p>Last year, I wrote a <a href="https://jmstrategy.substack.com/p/2021-growth-marketing-predictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">column</a> on my predictions for 2021, which emphasized creativity being key, the inherent increase in attribution issues due to privacy changes and the power of leveraging influencers. While much has changed in this past year, there is a clear overlap from last year’s predictions with my growth marketing predictions for 2022. I’ll dive deeper on certain concepts like incrementality testing and continued growth in video engagement, while introducing a new prediction on the direction of ad platforms.</p>
<h2>Incrementality 2.0</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Uncertain months of endless scrambling would likely be the best way to summarizing the past year for paid channels like Facebook.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As we face industrywide degradation of data, marketers must become more comfortable with practicing incrementality testing — using controlled tests to understand the effectiveness of growth marketing efforts. As an example, if we wanted to test the impact of our Facebook efforts, we could pause the campaigns and measure the conversion deltas before and after making the change.</p>
<p>That’s incrementality testing at a macro level. But advertisers will need to be more sophisticated now. I like to call this the 2.0 age of incrementality testing. This new age will increase the precision and understanding of growth performance.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The InnerSpace concept looks like a futuristic car from the outside—but inside, there's a two-seat loveseat surrounded by one of the widest screens we've ever seen, and no steering wheel or pedals.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After introducing a six-person self-driving box and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-cadillac-ev-drone-vtol-concept-lyriq-celestiq-144643388.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="12" data-v9y="1">a frickin&#8217; ridable drone concept last year</a>, GM&#8217;s latest luxury self-driving EV idea is much more grounded. The <a href="https://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/ces/0105-cadillac-halo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="13" data-v9y="1">InnerSpace concept </a>looks like a futuristic car from the outside—but inside, there&#8217;s a two-seat loveseat surrounded by one of the widest screens we&#8217;ve ever seen. There&#8217;s no steering wheel or pedals, of course. Instead, there&#8217;s a built-in ottoman and a compartment for slippers and a blanket. Where GM&#8217;s going, you won&#8217;t need any sort of manual control.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBDJBKZg9iA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Even stepping into the car seems like something from science fiction: the doors pop out, while the large windshield/sunroof rises up. As usual, concepts like the InnerSpace are a way for car designers to flex their muscles and imagine what future vehicles could actually be like. While it certainly seems out of reach for most people, perhaps Cadillac&#8217;s more affluent clientele would be intrigued by owning a personal spaceship. At least it&#8217;s better for the environment than full-sized luxury SUVs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254171" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Electrification and autonomous driving will fundamentally change the role of vehicles and the experiences customers have with them,” Bryan Nesbitt, GM&#8217;s executive director of Global Advanced Design, said in a statement. “We’re exploring where that will go with these innovative concepts, envisioning mobility as an ally of wellness, giving customers the ultimate luxury, more personal time rather than taking it.”</p>
<p>As someone who hates the act of driving, but lives in a place where I can&#8217;t avoid it, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how car makers turn these self-driving concept vehicles into a reality. And maybe after getting these wild designs through their systems, they&#8217;ll show us more concepts for self-driving family EVs.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anandsrao">Anand Rao</a> is global head of AI at <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en">PwC</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The rocket ship trajectory of a startup is well known: Get an idea, build a team and slap together a minimum viable product (MVP) that you can get in front of users.</p>
<p>However, today’s startups need to reconsider the MVP model <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/ai-predictions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) become ubiquitous in tech products</a> and the market grows increasingly conscious of the ethical implications of AI augmenting or replacing humans in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>An MVP allows you to collect critical feedback from your target market that then informs the minimum development required to launch a product — creating a powerful feedback loop that drives today’s customer-led business. This lean, agile model has been extremely successful over the past two decades — launching thousands of successful startups, some of which have grown into billion-dollar companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>However, building high-performing products and solutions that work for the majority isn’t enough anymore. From facial recognition technology that has a bias against people of color to credit-lending algorithms that discriminate against women, the past several years have seen multiple AI- or ML-powered products killed off because of ethical dilemmas that crop up downstream after millions of dollars have been funneled into their development and marketing. In a world where you have one chance to bring an idea to market, this risk can be fatal, even for well-established companies.</p>
<p>Startups do not have to scrap the lean business model in favor of a more risk-averse alternative. There is a middle ground that can introduce ethics into the startup mentality without sacrificing the agility of the lean model, and it starts with the initial goal of a startup — getting an early-stage proof of concept in front of potential customers.</p>
<p>However, instead of developing an MVP, companies should develop and roll out an ethically viable product (EVP) based on responsible artificial intelligence (RAI), an approach that considers the ethical, moral, legal, cultural, sustainable and social-economic considerations during the development, deployment and use of AI/ML systems.</p>
<p>And while this is a good practice for startups, it’s also a good standard practice for big technology companies building AI/ML products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here are three steps that startups — especially the ones that incorporate significant AI/ML techniques in their products — can use to develop an EVP.</p>
<h2>Find an ethics officer to lead the charge</h2>
<p>Startups have chief strategy officers, chief investment officers — even chief fun officers. A chief ethics officer is just as important, if not more so. This person can work across different stakeholders to make sure the startup is developing a product that fits within the moral standards set by the company, the market and the public.</p>
<p>They should act as a liaison between the founders, the C-suite, investors and the board of directors with the development team — making sure everyone is asking the right ethical questions in a thoughtful, risk-averse manner.</p>
<p>Machines are trained based on historical data. If systemic bias exists in a current business process (such as unequal racial or gender lending practices), AI will pick up on that and think that’s how it should continue to behave. If your product is later found to not meet the ethical standards of the market, you can’t simply delete the data and find new data.</p>
<p>These algorithms have already been trained. You can’t erase that influence any more than a 40-year-old man can undo the influence his parents or older siblings had on his upbringing. For better or for worse, you are stuck with the results. Chief ethics officers need to sniff out that inherent bias throughout the organization before it gets ingrained in AI-powered products.</p>
<h2>Integrate ethics into the entire development process</h2>
<p>Responsible AI is not just a point in time. It is an end-to-end governance framework focused on the risks and controls of an organization’s AI journey. This means that ethics should be integrated throughout the development process — starting with strategy and planning through development, deployment and operations.</p>
<p>During scoping, the development team should work with the chief ethics officer to be aware of general ethical AI principles that represent behavioral principles that are valid in many cultural and geographic applications. These principles prescribe, suggest or inspire how AI solutions should behave when faced with moral decisions or dilemmas in a specific field of usage.</p>
<p>Above all, a risk and harm assessment should be conducted, identifying any risk to anyone’s physical, emotional or financial well-being. The assessment should look at sustainability as well and evaluate what harm the AI solution might do to the environment.</p>
<p>During the development phase, the team should be constantly asking how their use of AI is in alignment with the company’s values, whether models are treating different people fairly and whether they are respecting people’s right to privacy. They should also consider if their AI technology is safe, secure and robust and how effective the operating model is at ensuring accountability and quality.</p>
<p>A critical component of any machine learning model is the data that is used to train the model. Startups should be concerned not only about the MVP and how the model is proved initially, but also the eventual context and geographic reach of the model. This will allow the team to select the right representative dataset to avoid any future data bias issues.</p>
<h2>Don’t forget about ongoing AI governance and regulatory compliance</h2>
<p>Given the implications on society, it’s just a matter of time before the European Union, the United States or some other legislative body passes consumer protection laws governing the use of AI/ML. Once a law is passed, those protections are likely to spread to other regions and markets around the world.</p>
<p>It’s happened before: The passage of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU led to a wave of other consumer protections around the world that require companies to prove consent for collecting personal information. Now, people across the political and business spectrum are calling for ethical guidelines around AI. Again, the EU is leading the way after releasing a 2021 proposal for an AI legal framework.</p>
<p>Startups deploying products or services powered by AI/ML should be prepared to demonstrate ongoing governance and regulatory compliance — being careful to build these processes now before the regulations are imposed on them later. Performing a quick scan of the proposed legislation, guidance documents and other relevant guidelines before building the product is a necessary step of EVP.</p>
<p>In addition, revisiting the regulatory/policy landscape prior to launch is advisable. Having someone who is embedded within the active deliberations currently happening globally on your board of directors or advisory board would also help understand what is likely to happen. Regulations are coming, and it’s good to be prepared.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that AI/ML will present an enormous benefit to humankind. The ability to automate manual tasks, streamline business processes and improve customer experiences are too great to dismiss. But startups need to be aware of the impacts AI/ML will have on their customers, the market and society at large.</p>
<p>Startups typically have one shot at success, and it would be a shame if an otherwise high-performing product is killed because some ethical concerns weren’t uncovered until after it hits the market. Startups need to integrate ethics into the development process from the very beginning, develop an EVP based on RAI and continue to ensure AI governance post-launch.</p>
<p>AI is the future of business, but we can’t lose sight of the need for compassion and the human element in innovation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's not been a great start to 2022 for your local venture capitalist's near-term liquidity chances.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some of the most high-flying stocks of the pandemic are struggling in the new year and it&#8217;s bad news for tech companies of all sizes.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/vcs-and-founders-are-max-bullish-as-public-markets-flash-warning-signs/">TechCrunch noted</a> yesterday that software stocks were having a pretty poor start to the year. That was, it turned out, only the beginning of the damage. Today&#8217;s trading took yet another bite out of the key tech sector.</p>
<p>Observe the following five-day chart of the WisdomTree Cloud Computing ETF, which tracks the <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bessemer Cloud Index</a>, long a key barometer of the performance of modern software shares:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254107" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2254122" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254122" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2254122 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254122" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: YCharts</p></div></p>
<p>Per <a href="http://ycharts.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YCharts data</a>, the index closed at 46.30, or some 29% and change from its recent all-time highs. The turnaround in the value of software stocks is pretty wild. Today alone the index shed 5.91%.</p>
<p>For a sense of scale, a 10% decline from highs is considered a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correction.asp">correction</a>. A 20% decline is a technical <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp">bear market</a>. And a 30% decline? I think that&#8217;s called a shitstorm.</p>
<h2>Public fear versus private ebullience</h2>
<p>The disconnect that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/vcs-and-founders-are-max-bullish-as-public-markets-flash-warning-signs/">we discussed yesterday</a> of the private markets staying incredibly bullish while public markets run colder on some of the hottest startup categories is underscored by today&#8217;s trading.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s worth noting that there is quite a lot of momentum to today&#8217;s pace of startup investment, hinting that the stock market&#8217;s decision to revalue software stocks may take some time to trickle down to the startup level. What do we mean? That venture capital funds have already been raised at particular dollar amounts and investment schedules. This in essence sets up a lot of big, high-priced startup rounds to get done even as their future exit window tightens; it&#8217;s going to be harder to land an up exit if the public markets keep their minds changed regarding the value of software revenue.</p>

<p>In more on-the-ground terms, startups that today raise, say, a Series A that values them on future revenues are setting up a challenge in which they have to keep raising at high revenue multiples as they grow. This will become a more difficult <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLTcdOr66lA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrow to shoot</a> as they scale through later rounds. The closer those startups get to IPO scale, the more that public markets will impact their ability to price their shares. Falling public prices and fat private valuations will get into a tangle at some point. And there are a lot of unicorns out there that won&#8217;t fare super well on the exit front if stocks keep falling as they are.</p>
<p>Not a great start for 2022 for your local venture capitalist&#8217;s near-term liquidity chances, it appears.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, there has been a growing number of startups </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trying to make credit more accessible to consumers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such startup, </span><a href="http://www.petalcard.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced today that it has raised a $140 million Series D round of funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s new valuation is $800 million &#8212; more than triple what Petal was valued at when it announced a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/valar-petal-series-c/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$55 million Series C round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September of 2020, according to a source familiar with the transaction.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254039" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2016, New York-based Petal offers two Visa credit card products aimed at underserved consumers with little to no credit history. The startup says its goal is to help people “build credit, not debt.” And it offers that credit based on cash flow rather than credit scores. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/kapor-capital-square-co-founder-sam-wen-back-tomocredit-in-its-10m-series-a-funding-round/">TomoCredit</a>, which TechCrunch has also covered, has a similar model. (The cards are issued by WebBank, a member of the FDIC). </span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, </span>Petal offers &#8220;modern&#8221; Visa credit cards, along with a mobile app, designed to help people &#8220;responsibly&#8221; build credit and manage their finances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its latest raise follows a year in which Petal has tripled its user base and more than quadrupled its revenue, from $11 million to nearly $50 million. Today, there are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nearly 300,000 Petal cardholders, which the company refers to as “members.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been adding 10,000 to 20,000 new members per month, according to Jason Gross, Petal’s co-founder and CEO. <span style="color: #000000;">Petal members are largely younger, digitally-native consumers that are building credit for the first time, although the startup has also served many other customer segments as well, including those seeking to rebuild their credit, noted Gross.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petal operated under stealth until launching its first product, and announcing its first funding, in September 2017. The company says its technology analyzes banking history — assessing creditworthiness by taking into account a person’s income, spending and savings to help people qualify <span style="color: #000000;">even if they’ve never used credit before. </span>It’s dubbed the process “CashScoring&#8221; and says the approach makes credit accessible to a greater pool of people and “on terms tailored to each person’s unique financial situation.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of Petal members had thin or no credit history when they first applied for a Petal card, and more than 40% of new members approved for a Petal card in 2021 were first denied credit by a major bank, the company said. The company claims that members who joined with no prior credit history have gone on to achieve an average credit score of 676 — a “prime” score qualifying them for auto loans, mortgages &#8220;and other financial opportunities previously out of their reach.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petal’s CashScore became a product of its own in 2021 as the company announced the launch of its first B2B enterprise service,</span><a href="http://www.prismdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Prism Data</span></a>. That new B2B platform, designed to help other fintech startups and financial institutions use Petal’s “CashScoring” technology to grow their own businesses, <a href="https://medium.com/petal/from-raw-data-to-actionable-insights-introducing-prism-data-and-the-cashscore-bb7c97ff407e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went live</a> in early 2021 and is described as a &#8220;sister company&#8221; by Gross. <span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to say that Prism is a “next-generation data intelligence platform that translates raw transaction data into actionable insights and scores,&#8221; making the CashScore<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> technology &#8220;available to the broader market for the first time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Allard, who previously held executive positions with Bloom Credit, Green Dot and The Bancorp, has been named general manager of the company and will lead Prism Data. Petal now has more than 160 employees, doubling its team over the last year.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We’re following in the footsteps of other fintech firms like Lithic and Upstart that have created sizable new B2B platforms by productizing the novel technologies they initially created to solve their own problems,&#8221; Gross told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, he added that Prism Data was founded on the belief that open banking and access to consumer-permissioned bank account transactional data will change the way consumer finance works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With this change, the credit score of the future will be a complete, real-time and holistic assessment of a consumer&#8217;s financial position, including their income, cash flows and assets, in addition to debt and repayment history,” Gross said. “Prism Data exists to give financial providers the tools they need to create next-generation products and capabilities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tarsadia Investments led Petal’s Series D financing, with participation from Valar Ventures (which led its Series C), CUNA Mutual, Encore Bank, Volery Capital Partners, Gopher Asset Management, RiverPark Ventures, Afore Capital, Gaingels and “a number” of other new and existing investors. To date, Petal has raised more than $240 million in equity capital and more than $450 million in debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rishi Reddy, head of venture and growth investing at Tarsadia, believes that the traditional credit system is broken and that consumers “are in desperate need of more modern and accessible financial products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In addition to exponential user growth, Petal has proven the power of its tech as evidenced by stellar credit performance and the rapid scaling of Prism,” Reddy said in a written statement. “We are excited to double down on Jason and the team as they pioneer a new way to accelerate financial inclusion.”</span></p>
<p>Gross said Petal is hiring for more than 100 new roles in 2022 and we will use its capital &#8220;to add hundreds of thousands of new cardmembers in the coming year.&#8221; The company also plans to add new features and benefits to its cards.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After fitting some of its cars with comfy lounge chairs at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/bmw-wants-you-to-lounge-during-your-autonomous-ride/">CES 2020</a>, BMW today unveiled the next step in its in-car entertainment story: a 31-inch 8K smart TV with support for Amazon&#8217;s Fire TV service (with a country-specific streaming service for China in the works, too). This new 32:9 &#8220;My Mode Theatre&#8221; screen for rear passengers, combined with a Bowers &amp; Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System, is meant to give passengers a cinema-like experience while they cruise down the highway.</p>
<p>With its 5G connection, the car will be able to stream the latest shows on demand, while BMW&#8217;s My Mode system will set the mood for binge-watching the latest episodes of The Expanse. For now, there isn&#8217;t a lot of 8K content to watch &#8212; and Fire TV doesn&#8217;t support it yet &#8212; but at least your car will be ready for it when that time comes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253389" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253389" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253389" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg 9411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253389" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253379" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>And because you don&#8217;t always want a giant screen blocking your view, the screen is extended out of the headliner on request. The touch controls to do so are built into the rear doors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We develop immersive, digital experiences for sheer driving pleasure,&#8221; Frank Weber, member of the board of management of BMW AG Development, said in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;In Theatre Mode, the rear of the interior is transformed into a private cinema lounge. With the 31-inch display, 5G connectivity, 8K resolution, surround sound and individual streaming program, an unprecedented experience is created that sets new standards for in-car entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>To set the mood in the car, whether for movie watching or anything else, BMW&#8217;s latest iDrive displays and operating system these days feature My Mode, which changes the driving and transmission controls to change the car&#8217;s overall driving behavior, as well as the theme of the displays, sounds and overall lighting in the car based on your personal preferences.</p>

<p>Until now, the available modes were &#8220;Efficient,&#8221; &#8220;Sport&#8221; and &#8220;Personal,&#8221; but at CES today the company also introduced a few new variants: &#8220;Expressive,&#8221; &#8220;Relax,&#8221; &#8220;Digital Art&#8221; and &#8212; for watching movies &#8212; &#8220;Theatre.&#8221; These new modes will roll out in the second half of the year and for most of these new modes, we&#8217;re mostly talking about theming the car more than changing its driving characteristic.</p>
<p>For the digital art mode, BMW partnered with Chinese multimedia artist Cao Fei, who created new artwork for the launch that is meant to symbolize&#8221; the deep connection of humankind and nature.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253410" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253410" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253410" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg 4961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253410" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, for its sound design, BMW has once again partnered with film music composer Hans Zimmer to create specific sounds for its electric fleet. BMW IconicSounds Electric will make their debut in the BMW i4 in the first half of 2022 and the BMW iX in the second half of the year, and will be available as an over-the-air software update.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After first teasing it a few weeks ago, BMW today officially unwrapped its color-changing car at CES. The BMW iX Flow, as the German automaker has dubbed this experimental vehicle, is wrapped in what is basically a form of e-paper, which BMW developed in cooperation with <a href="https://www.eink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E Ink</a>.</p>
<p>As of now, we&#8217;re only talking about black and white as color options (with a few shades of grey in between), but that could change over time. And because just like your Kindle&#8217;s screen doesn&#8217;t use any energy after the content has changed, the iX Flow&#8217;s electrophoretic technology doesn&#8217;t use any energy either after you&#8217;ve set up your preferred color and design.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253428" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bmw_flow.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253428" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253428" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bmw_flow.gif" alt="" width="800" height="364" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253428" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253827" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>First and foremost, this is obviously about giving drivers more options to customize their car&#8217;s look. <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This gives the driver the freedom to express different facets of their personality or even their enjoyment of change outwardly, and to redefine this each time they get into their car,&#8221; says Stella Clarke, head of Project for the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink. &#8220;Similar to fashion or the status ads on social media channels, the vehicle then becomes an expression of different moods and circumstances in daily life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Right now, BMW is only showing off the entire surface of the vehicle changing at once, but you could easily imagine the equivalent of e-ink bumper stickers or &#8212; because this is the world we live in &#8212; full-sized ads on the side of the car.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253831" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253831" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253831" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="674" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg 4961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=1536,1010 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=2048,1347 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253831" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>But BMW also argues that there are other motivations here. Maybe drivers could choose a light surface on warm sunny days instead of a black, heat-absorbing one, for example (or the other way round on cold days). &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">This reduces the amount of energy the vehicle electrical system needs and with it also the vehicle&#8217;s fuel or electricity consumption,&#8221; the company argues in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;In an all-electric car, changing the colour in line with the weather can therefore also help to increase the range. In the interior, the technology could, for example, prevent the dashboard from heating up too much.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the end of the day, that&#8217;s a nice bonus, but what most people will simply want is a supervillain-style color-changing car. They won&#8217;t be getting that anytime soon, though. For now, this is only an experiment, with no ETA for when &#8212; or if &#8212; it&#8217;ll come to a production car.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is adding two more electric vehicle SUV models under the Chevrolet brand by 2023 in addition to the upcoming Silverado EV WT pickup, General Motors CEO and Chair Mary Barra said at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">2022 CES</a> tech trade show Wednesday.</p>
<p>The company, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/the-chevy-silverado-finally-goes-electric/">revealed Wednesday two versions of the upcoming Silverado EV pickup</a>, also announced that it will begin selling electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Chevrolet Blazer in 2023.</p>
<p>&#8220;As our most popular vehicle brand, Chevy will be front and center in our mission to provide EVs for everyone,&#8221; Barra said. &#8220;We&#8217;re at the tipping point of electrification and we are expecting this to be a massive year for Chevrolet&#8217;s EV future.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253974" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Chevrolet will also launch a Silverado Work Truck (WT) in spring 2023, followed by a more expensive luxury model called the Silverado RST in 2024. Both trims will have an estimated range of 400 miles and standard DC fast-chaging up to 350 kilowatts.</p>
<p>The Silverado launch has been expected for weeks now, but Wednesday was the first time the company has provided more information, and even some teaser images, of other upcoming Chevy electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Chevrolet said it will expand its EV lineup in fall 2023 to include the Equinox EV, an affordable, functional compact SUV that will start at an estimated MSRP of around $30,000 in the United States. The company plans to launch the Equinox EV in fleet and retail versions, including LT and RS trims.</p>

<p>Barra also confirmed that the Chevrolet Blazer is coming in 2023 (as a 2024 model) and said more details would come at a later this year. She did add that the Blazer would be &#8220;priced right and will offer a high level of refinement and options.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Equinox, Bla0zer and Silverado will join the two existing EVs — the Bolt and Bolt EUV — under the Chevy brand. All of these new EVs will be based on GM&#8217;s Ultium EV platform.</p>
<p>GM introduced in March 2020 its Ultium electric architecture that was designed to be the foundation of the automaker&#8217;s future EV plans and support a wide range of products across its brands, including compact cars, work trucks, large premium SUVs and performance vehicles. This modular architecture, called &#8220;Ultium,&#8221; is be capable of 19 different battery and drive unit configurations, 400-volt and 800-volt packs with storage ranging from 50 kWh to 200 kWh, and front-, rear- and all-wheel drive configurations.</p>
<p>At the heart of the new modular architecture are large-format pouch battery cells manufactured as part of a joint manufacturing venture between LG Chem and GM.</p>
<p>Chevrolet is not the only GM nameplate that is introducing EVs in the next two years. The company has started to deliver the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/first-drive-the-electrifying-gmc-hummer-ev/">GMC Hummer EV pickup truck</a> and is also introducing the Hummer EV SUV in 2023. An electric GMC Sierra is coming to market, likely in 2023 as well.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s luxury Cadillac brand is launching the Lyriq this year.</p>
