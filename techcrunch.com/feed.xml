										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta, formerly known as Facebook, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/taking-legal-action-against-phishing-attacks/">announced</a> today that it has filed a federal lawsuit in California court to take action to uncover individuals running a phishing scam. The company says the legal action aims to disrupt phishing attacks that are designed to trick people into sharing their login credentials on fake login pages for Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>For context, phishing attacks lure unsuspecting victims to websites that appear legitimate but are actually deceptively fake. The websites then persuade victims to enter their sensitive information, such as passwords and email addresses. Meta says it found more than 39,000 websites that are impersonating the login pages of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp as part of the phishing scheme. It also notes that reports of phishing attacks have been on the rise and that it is filing this lawsuit to take legal action against these attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;On these websites, people were prompted to enter their usernames and passwords, which Defendants collected,&#8221; Jessica Romero, Meta&#8217;s director of platform enforcement and litigation, wrote in a blog post. &#8220;As part of the attacks, Defendants used a relay service to redirect internet traffic to the phishing websites in a way that obscured their attack infrastructure. This enabled them to conceal the true location of the phishing websites, and the identities of their online hosting providers and the defendants.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249978" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Romero says that in March, Meta started working with the relay service to suspend thousands of URLs that hosted the phishing websites. Meta plans to continue to collaborate with online service providers to disrupt phishing attacks. It notes that it works to proactively block instances of abuse to the security community, domain name registrars and others. The company says it also shares phishing URLs so other platforms can block them as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;This lawsuit is one more step in our ongoing efforts to protect people’s safety and privacy, send a clear message to those trying to abuse our platform, and increase accountability of those who abuse technology.&#8221; Romero wrote in the blog post.</p>
<p>Meta&#8217;s latest lawsuit isn&#8217;t the first time that the company has cracked down on phishing scams on its platforms. Last month, Meta revealed that it <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/taking-action-against-hackers-in-pakistan-and-syria/">took action against</a> four several groups of hackers from Syria and Pakistan. The groups used phishing links to manipulate users into giving up their Facebook credentials. Earlier this year in March, the company also <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/taking-action-against-hackers-in-china/">took action against</a> a group of hackers in China known as Earth Empusa or Evil Eye. Meta, which was known as Facebook at the time, said it disrupted the hackers&#8217; ability to use their infrastructure to abuse its platform. The company also <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/taking-action-against-hackers-in-bangladesh-and-vietnam/">took similar action</a> against hackers in Bangledesh and Vietnam in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zepto, a Mumbai-based startup that operates a 10-minute instant grocery delivery service, has more than doubled its valuation to $570 million from $225 million less than two months ago as it expands into newer cities.</p>
<p>Y Combinator’s Continuity Fund led the $100 million Series C round in Zepto, the two said Monday. Glade Brook, Nexus, Breyer Capital, Lachy Groom, Global Founders Capital and Contrary Capital also participated in the round, which brings its to-date raise to $160 million.</p>
<p>The startup, founded by two 19-year-old entrepreneurs who left Stanford last year, came out of stealth mode in November. But long before it began talking about the business, Zepto had captured immense interest from the local startup community as people began voicing their opinion about the business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249966" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="http://zeptonow.com">Zepto</a>, whose name playfully uses a <a href="https://twitter.com/pacificleo/status/1452554053603450884" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mathematical term</a> to describe the business, offers a 10-minute grocery delivery service, a category that has become red hot in several parts of the world in recent quarters. Heavily-backed players Swiggy and BlinkIt (formerly known as Grofers) have also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/swiggy-to-invest-700-million-in-express-delivery-service-instamart/">entered the instant grocery delivery business</a> in recent months.</p>
<p>But neither of them had opted in for this business until Zepto arrived and aggressively started to win customers. Zepto’s arrival in the scene, too, was serendipitous. Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra had returned to India for a break shortly before the pandemic engulfed the nation.</p>
<p>The teenagers, who previously collaborated on a number of projects, including a ride-hailing commute app for school kids, suddenly found themselves locked in their houses in Mumbai. As the pandemic raged, the two struggled to get their grocery supplies even as grocery deliveries, categorized as essential by the local government, was still permitted in much of the nation.</p>
<p>“We felt that the online play of the Indian grocery delivery space, which is one of the world’s largest, was grappling with some gross execution errors,” Palicha told TechCrunch in an earlier interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an interview last week, Palicha said the startup is overwhelmed with the support and excitement it is seeing from the customers, but it doesn’t want to “become complacent.”</p>
<p>“We are somewhat overly critical of ourselves and hold ourselves to very high standards. People are happy that they are getting their deliveries in 10 minutes or less, but can we continue to focus on scaling our SKUs and improving our unit economics?” he said. (But at the same time, Zepto is cautious about keeping its employees and delivery partners happy, he said, pointing to the retention and internal feedback.)</p>
<p>Vohra said that its month-on-month buyer retention is 65% and has built a network of micro-warehouses, each of which has a capacity to do over 2,500 orders a day.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s e-grocery market that is estimated to be worth $25 billion by 2025, according to a note from Sanford C. Bernstein. “Online grocery penetration is expected to reach ~3-5%, by 2025 from less than 1% today. Long-term structural drivers remain strong: rising income and affluence, lower tier consumption, e- commerce penetration (~30% CAGR) and a young population (~50% below 25). Grocery spend as a proportion of income remains high at ~ 30%,” its analysts wrote.</p>

(<strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zepto)</p></div></p>
<p>Zepto today operates in Bangalore, Delhi, Gurgaon, Chennai and Hyderabad, and plans to soon expand to Pune and Kolkata. To ensure instant deliveries, it has set up a maze of over 100 dark stores across these cities that it says are optimized for fast deliveries.</p>
<p>“We are looking at a pretty crazy runrate,” he said. “In the past one and a half months, we have grown our business by 10 times. And now we are working to grow another 10 times by February or March,” said Palicha.</p>
<p>Another thing moving in the right direction for Zepto is the talent it has been able to attract in recent months. Several high-profile executives from Flipkart, Amazon Uber, Dream 11 and Pharmeasy have joined the startup.</p>
<p>Palicha said one of the reasons why so many executives have joined Zepto is that it has enabled many who had moved from Mumbai to Bangalore to come back to their home city. But the startup’s aggressive growth, disciplined execution, and ambitions have made it attractive for people with similar taste, he said. “We have been able to walk the walk,” he said.</p>
<p>“We are excited to double down and lead this round in Zepto (YC W21). Since Aadit and Kaivalya went through Y Combinator, we have observed that they&#8217;re exceptional founders who bring relentless focus and &#8220;Doordash-like&#8221; execution to the quick commerce model,” said Anu Hariharan, a partner at Y Combinator, in a statement.</p>
<p>“They originally launched with a different model, swiftly pivoted to quick commerce in August 2021 and are now adding 100,000 new customers every week, 60% of them women. Their attention to detail on the logistics experience is unparalleled and this has enabled them to scale to most major metros in just 5 months. Simply put, we&#8217;re confident Zepto will win in this space over the long-term.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI chips, which are semiconductors designed to accelerate machine learning, have many applications. One of the promising use cases, according to Albert Liu, is using AI chips in autonomous driving vehicles.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Liu&#8217;s AI chipmaking startup Kneron has been quietly racking up investments to march into smart transportation. It recently closed a new round of $25 million funding led by Lite-On Technology, a Taiwanese optoelectronic pioneer, which was a strategic investor in the round. Other investors included Alltek, PalPilot, Sand Hill Angels and Gaingels.</p>
<p>The new proceeds lifted Kneron&#8217;s total funding to over $125 million since its inception in 2015. The San Diego- and Taipei-based company has assembled a list of renowned investors, including Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-Shing&#8217;s Horizon Ventures, Alibaba, Qualcomm, Sequoia and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/kneron-foxconn-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foxconn</a>, the world&#8217;s largest electronics manufacturer and Apple&#8217;s supplier.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249154" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Liu previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/kneron-foxconn-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> TechCrunch that the company was expected to turn profitable in 2023, which would be a &#8220;good time&#8221; to go public. When asked more recently, the founder was more tight-lipped about the firm&#8217;s IPO prospects, though he said the listing would likely be in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future of L4 or L5 autonomous driving lies not only in the vehicle but also roadside AI,&#8221; Liu, who worked on computer vision at Qualcomm, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Kneron&#8217;s latest investment followed the release of its first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/kneron-releases-its-first-automotive-grade-chip-for-adas-and-av-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">auto-grade semiconductors</a> for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>With roadside perception units that can communicate with nearby vehicles, an ambulance would not have to stop at intersections, Liu explained. Such infrastructure is particularly useful in Asian countries where traffic conditions are more complicated than those in the U.S., he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through the strategic investment, Kneron and Lite-On will jointly develop roadside AI boxes that will be powered by Kneron&#8217;s edge AI chips.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s chips are &#8220;reconfigurable&#8221;, meaning they combine the flexibility of software and the high speed of the hardware. In the case of AV, its silicon can be used for both the large AI engine inside a vehicle and powering the small sensors layered on the exterior of the car, explained Liu and as shown in this demo video:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLdt3wgnuDs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kneron is currently pulling in $3-4 million in monthly revenue from its pool of 30 enterprise customers. 30-40% of its revenues come from the U.S. at the moment.</span></p>
<p>The company has been forming deep alliances with industry partners. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In May, Kneron agreed to</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.deltaww.com/en-us/news/7531" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> buy image signal processor Vatics</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from Vivotek, a subsidiary of Delta Electronics. Kneron counts Foxconn as a strategic investor, which has been using the startup&#8217;s chips in its &#8220;MIH&#8221; manufacturing platform for electric vehicles.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new forecast has dubbed TikTok as the world&#8217;s third-largest social network, just behind Facebook and Instagram. In its <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/tiktok-is-the-third-largest-worldwide-social-network-behind-instagram-and-facebook/">inaugural forecast</a> on TikTok&#8217;s global install base, Insider Intelligence &#8212; the firm <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/business-insider-intelligence-emarketer-merger-details-2019-7">previously known as eMarketer</a> &#8212; predicts that TikTok will reach 755.0 million monthly users in 2022, after seeing 59.8% growth in 2020, followed by 40.8% growth in 2021.</p>
<p>Facebook, as of its most recent <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/FB-09.30.2021-Exhibit-99.1.pdf">earnings</a>, reported 2.91 million monthly active users after seeing 6% year-over-year growth. And recently, Instagram employees leaked its network had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/instagram-surpasses-2-billion-monthly-users.html">surpassed 2 billion</a> monthly users, up from the 1 billion monthly user milestone reported in June 2018.</p>
<p>However, Insider Intelligence&#8217;s forecast is referencing its own 2022 predictions, which uses a slightly different set of calculations. The firm has its own definition of a monthly active user that may differ from those of each company it analyzes.  For example, it only counts users who log in at least once a month consistently over a calendar year period, and it attempts to weed out the fake accounts from its estimates.

<p>TikTok, over the past couple of years, has been growing quickly.</p>
<p>App intelligence firm Sensor Tower reported the short-form video app <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-2-billion">crossed 2 billion downloads</a> across the App Store and Google Play in the first quarter of 2020. A separate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">report by App Annie</a> later found TikTok saw 325% growth in 2020, and the monthly time spent per user also grew faster than any other app &#8212; including by 65% in the U.S., surpassing Facebook.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In July 2021, Sensor Tower noted TikTok (including sister app Douyin in China) had become the first non-Facebook mobile app (outside of games) <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion">to reach 3 billion downloads globally</a> across the App Store and Google Play, while TikTok consumer spending surpassed $2.5 billion globally. This put the app in the company of only a handful of others that had reached that milestone, including Tinder, Netflix, YouTube, and Tencent Video.</p>
<p>While other firms had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">predicted</a> TikTok&#8217;s monthly active user base would top 1 billion in 2021, Insider Intelligence&#8217;s forecast is a bit more conservative due to its methodology. But it does expect the app to continue to grow, if at a slower rate of 15.1% in 2022.</p>
<p>As a result of its growth, TikTok&#8217;s share of overall social networking users is also climbing upwards. Insider Intelligence&#8217;s forecast believes TikTok will surpass a 20% share for the first time and will approach a one-quarter share by 2024.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rise of TikTok is especially challenging for Snapchat, with which it competes head-to-head for the youth audience,&#8221; remarked Insider Intelligence principal analyst, Debra Aho Williamson. &#8220;Although TikTok does not share much similarity to Twitter, its massive size relative to the more–established platform is a clear reflection of the addictive nature of TikTok’s content,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still plenty of room for TikTok&#8217;s future growth, the firm also pointed out, as next year, 3.57 billion people will use a social networking app at least once per month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://rocketcompanies.com">Rocket Companies</a> <a href="https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Acquire-Truebill-Adding-Rapidly-Expanding-Financial-Empowerment-FinTech-to-the-Rocket-Platform/default.aspx">announced</a> this morning that it will purchase <a href="https://www.truebill.com/">Truebill</a> for $1.275 billion in cash.</p>
<p>Rocket Companies is best known for its Rocket Mortgage product, while Truebill is a consumer-facing app that helps consumers manage subscriptions, automate savings and budget. The deal&#8217;s price tag will prove lucrative for Truebill shareholders. PitchBook <a href="http://pitchbook.com">data indicates</a> that Truebill&#8217;s final private valuation was $530 million after its last round was counted. That <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/truebill-raises-45-million-for-its-personal-finance-app/">$45 million investment took place earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>So, a quick more-than-double for Truebill&#8217;s final investors, and an even bigger return for its earlier backers. Not bad, right?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249886" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Let&#8217;s play<em> Guess! That! Multiple!</em></h2>
<p>Given that Truebill is selling for a hair under $1.3 billion, you have the information you need to come up with an estimate for the startup&#8217;s annual recurring revenue (ARR). In broad terms, where do you think the company&#8217;s top line will land at the end of the year?</p>
<p>If you guessed something around $50 million, our heads are in the same spot. Tech valuations are high despite some recent declines, and fintech is hot. So, a multiple in the mid-20s felt like a good guess.</p>
<p><em>Wrong.</em> Here&#8217;s Rocket (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote><p>This new line of business will also add consistent monthly revenue for Rocket Companies. Today, monthly payments made by clients to the company&#8217;s mortgage servicing operations generate $1.3 billion in servicing income on an annualized basis. Rocket Companies boasts 2.5 million serviced clients and has an industry-best retention rate of 91 percent. <strong>Truebill is on track to generate $100 million in annual recurring revenue. That number is consistently growing, with 2021 revenue more than doubling that of 2020.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Hot dang. That&#8217;s a surprise.</p>
<p>Truebill is going to close out the year with roughly double the ARR that we anticipated. And even more, the company is doubling in size yearly. That&#8217;s the precise profile that companies want to put up before going public: big revenues and fast growth. And yet instead of going public, Truebill is selling itself for under 13x its current ARR. That number will compress as time continues, to the single digits in 2022, provided that growth can keep up at Truebill in the new year.</p>
<p>It feels rather cheap, frankly.</p>
<p>The deal being all-cash means that Rocket might have gotten a discount of sorts; shares are cheaper than cash, and Truebill likely could have eked out another $100 million if the deal had been, say, 50% stock. We&#8217;re speaking in very loose numbers, mind.</p>
<p>Still, the deal is good news of a sort, but also an omen. Why did a ~100% growth, nearly nine-figure ARR fintech just sell for barely unicorn money? As noted, the price means sweet, sweet holiday liquidity for Truebill&#8217;s backers, but for other fintech companies that may have just received an unwelcome comp for the holidays, the numbers are hardly bullish. They feel a bit soft, honestly.</p>
<p>Perhaps we&#8217;re seeing the impact of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/nubank-hashicorp-provide-startup-market-with-end-of-year-ipo-wins/">Nubank&#8217;s somewhat slack IPO</a>. Or this could just be a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/lets-talk-about-the-saas-selloff/">general downward tilt in software multiples</a> that we&#8217;ve seen in recent quarters. Or there&#8217;s something inside Truebill that is yucky &#8212; perhaps it has far greater sales and marketing expenses than we might anticipate; fusing itself to Rocket could lower its customer acquisition costs, perhaps improving its economic profile.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Regardless, we&#8217;ll get more data when Rocket reports its first full quarter inclusive of Truebill. The deal is expected to close this year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ameelio.org/">Ameelio</a>, a nonprofit startup that intends to replace inmate-paid video calling in prisons with a free service, is making inroads against the companies that have dominated the space for decades. With 9 facilities in Iowa up and running and talks progressing with dozens more ahead of a planned 2022 launch, the company may soon usher in a fundamental change in how incarcerated people access communication and education.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/ameelio-wants-to-take-on-for-profit-prison-calling-rackets-after-starting-with-free-letters-to-inmates/">Founded less than two years ago</a>, Ameelio had its sights set on the calling system from the start, but began by offering a web and mobile service to send letters to inmates, which ordinarily is a surprisingly difficult process.</p>
<p>&#8220;We maybe had 8,000 users when we spoke to you, and a few months later we launched our mobile app. Now we&#8217;re hosting something like 300,000 users, in every state and some territories,&#8221; said Uzoma Orchingwa, founder and CEO of the company. But while letter writing is a useful service, the team&#8217;s efforts have been focused on developing and testing the suite of digital products they hope to offer across the country starting next year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>By building their own tech stacks and shifting the resulting (much lower than market) costs away from inmates, Ameelio provides an enticing alternative to the totally outdated systems in most prisons today.</p>
<p>Many may not be aware that a handful of for-profit companies perform nearly all of the for-profit video-calling services used by the nation&#8217;s often for-profit prisons, which collect a share of this tainted revenue. Securus and Global Tel have provided calling services for a long time, and their business practices were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/04/fcc-commissioner-mignon-clyburn-talks-privacy-compromise-and-connecting-communities/">described by former FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn</a> as &#8220;the clearest, most glaring type of market failure I’ve ever seen as a regulator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite costing nearly nothing to provide, calls can cost inmates as much as a dollar a minute — extortionate ten years ago but positively criminal today, when free video calling is a basic feature we all expect for free or a nominal charge. The deeply unpopular Securus is in the middle of a rebranding (to &#8220;Aventis&#8221;) and potentially a SPAC deal to reinvent itself and purge the past, following the example of Facebook and Blackwater. But the zebra can&#8217;t change its stripes, and all that.</p>
<p>Not only that but customers — that is to say, the Departments of Corrections that contract with these businesses — are beginning to doubt the value of the services being provided. The pandemic resulted in a suspension of in-person visits and their temporary replacement with free video calls, and Ameelio&#8217;s CTO Gabriel Saruhashi said that many a DOC would prefer to keep it that way. The old, and rather unethical, method of charging inmates and sharing the income is growing increasingly indefensible in the modern era, and they are more interested in keeping things simple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2249688" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249688" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2249688" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png" alt="Screenshot of the Ameelio video call scheduling interface." width="1024" height="646" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png 1190w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png?resize=768,485 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png?resize=680,429 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2249688" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of the Ameelio video call scheduling interface.</p></div></p>
<p>Orchingwa explained that they&#8217;ve structured Ameelio as a turnkey system for whatever level of involvement a facility or department chooses. The cumbrous RFP system for selecting providers of state-paid services can be a barrier to adoption at scale, but Ameelio can be used as a basic replacement for free video calling platforms like Google Meet; In fact Louisville Metro DOC has made the switch to free communications with Ameelio without any need for legislation, an important precedent to explore.). Later on, if desired, the company can also provide the required and regulated scheduling, storage, and security services for a fee.</p>
<p>This would come in far, far below quotes from existing providers. That&#8217;s because the entire problem has changed from being a telecoms problem to a tech problem, and &#8220;They aren&#8217;t tech companies,&#8221; Orchingwa said. &#8220;Their products haven&#8217;t changed in two decades.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, they buy companies to bolt onto their existing services or pay for off the shelf tech like Twilio. So in order to pay for the service in the first place, then provide the state its cut, and still come out ahead, they have to charge as much as the market will bear. And since the market consists of largely disenfranchised incarcerated folks and their families — not exactly the lobbying type — complaints can be written off more or less completely. The result is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/10/prison-visitation-homewav-leak/">poor service</a> at maximum price.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have that pressure,&#8221; said Orchingwa. &#8220;We&#8217;re a lean startup, and we do everything in house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We leverage a lot of open source tech, which is part of why our costs are so low,&#8221; said Saruhashi. &#8220;They use Twilio, we use Mediasoup; the only thing we&#8217;re paying for servers. And we use Kubernetes, so our total cost right now is like $100 a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also done their own hardware, standard Android tablets with custom enclosures that can very easily be provisioned and deployed anywhere there&#8217;s wi-fi. Facilities looking to replace landlines love that they can decommission a dozen phones and bring on five dozen tablets, through which both video and audio calls are possible. Video calls must be scheduled and recorded (by Ameelio or another), but audio can be done any time, and having one service and one device do both streamlines things.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2249690" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png" alt="Screenshot of Ameelio's prototype education interface." width="1024" height="648" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png 1148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png?resize=768,486 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png?resize=680,430 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The last area where Ameelio hopes to move things forward is in education. Currently there is a real hodgepodge of education systems available to inmates. Sometimes security requirements mean paper resources or homework must be physically brought and collected by a representative of the school (something we talked about at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/recap-pathways-for-returned-citizens/">TC Sessions: Justice this summer</a>). Some places there is a virtual service, but only accessible at certain times, or with limited topics. As interesting as a course on English Literature might be, not every inmate is interested in completing their BA, possibly preferring to learn a trade.</p>
<p>The same tablets that provide audio and video calls — and of course other services like telehealth, official communications, text-based messaging and so on — would be the platform for education or simply reading. Orchingwa said there is great interest from both sides of the market (educators and DOCs, to say nothing of the inmates themselves, who have fought for this for decades), but that digitization has been a slow process.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are grants available, but no education platform,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The news is Ameelio is actually doing it, at two facilities and just we just signed our first county. LinkedIn Learning, Masterclass, PBS, we&#8217;re uploading thousands of books from Gutenberg. We&#8217;re also trying to do job training; we identified CDL [commercial drivers license] training as being of interest, and we&#8217;ve been running that on the outside with about 50 formerly incarcerated students with computer literacy issues, using the app to study.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="INutrlRP8i"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/build-products-that-improve-the-lives-of-inmates/">Build products that improve the lives of inmates</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Build products that improve the lives of inmates&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/build-products-that-improve-the-lives-of-inmates/embed/#?secret=INutrlRP8i" data-secret="INutrlRP8i" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s all still very much on the horizon, but it&#8217;s telling that in the short time since its founding Ameelio has already clawed away numerous facilities from industry incumbents that got their start in the &#8217;80s. This is an industry ripe for change and there are plenty of stakeholders willing to try something new, even if it means rocking the boat a bit.</p>
<p>Although Ameelio does intend to fund itself by acting as the provider for commercial services states already pay for (recording and storing video calls) and by charging attorneys for secure, private calls instead of inmates or families, it will remain free to users. &#8220;Ameelio will always exist as a nonprofit. We are committed to never charging families to communicate with their loved ones and will always keep our services that face incarcerated people as nonprofit. We don&#8217;t believe that a for-profit model that relies on incarcerated people is justifiable,&#8221; Orchingwa said.</p>
<p>It does help to have a few deep-pocketed allies, though. Orchingwa mentioned Jack Dorsey, Vinod Khosla, Eric Schmidt, Brian Acton, Sarah and Rich Barton, Devin and Cindy Wenig, Kevin Ryan, and Draper Richards Kaplan as individuals who are presently supporting Ameelio, and that True Ventures has awarded it grants as well. The company is working on a planned $25M round to get them through the next few years as they establish their own income streams.</p>
<p>The idea that an incarcerated person could — and should — have a device that lets them communicate securely and even spontaneously with their loved ones and legal representation, as well as access educational resources and other services, seems like a fairly self-evident one. But the market, and the lobbying and industry that define it, have thwarted this path forward for a long time. Ameelio is just now building momentum but in a few years may be the provider of a free (as in beer, as in speech, perhaps even as in FOSS) platform that provides it for this perennially mistreated population.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founder and CEO Devo Harris got the idea for Adventr while working with the music industry&#8217;s biggest artists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adventr was inspired by my experience creating content for artists like Kanye West, Britney Spears and Nas,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The music videos where I introduced interactive components shot up in popularity, proving that engaging viewers was not just about expensive footage and editing.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, Harris stepped out of his role as a Grammy-winning media executive and into the shoes of an early-stage startup founder. Now, Adventr is a drag-and-drop SaaS tool for creating, viewing and sharing interactive media &#8212; people can interact with the videos through touch screens, clicks, and even their voice. Adventr patented this voice-controlled technology, called &#8220;SmartListen,&#8221; which allows media content to change mid-stream based on voice commands. This could technology could be applied to advertisements, where a viewer can say something like &#8220;buy the green shirt.&#8221; Or, if a creator made a movie in Adventr, they could invite audience members to tell the characters what to do, like saying &#8220;don&#8217;t go down that hallway!&#8221; to the star of a horror film.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249401" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As of now, the patented SmartListen features aren&#8217;t quite ready yet, but Harris said that they will be available for select partners in early 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a game changer and is going to open creators&#8217; minds to the possibilities of connected media beyond clicking in a video,&#8221; Harris told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>Adventr <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/adventr-uses-patented-voice-control-tech-to-allow-anyone-to-create-interactive-videos/">competed</a> in the Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt this fall, earning a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/here-are-the-five-startup-battlefield-finalists-at-disrupt-2021/">top-5 finalist spot</a> only about a year after launch. The company has refined its product in beta with 8,000 users, including AsiaNet News, MSI Gaming, SK Interactive and the New South Wales Government. These companies also can see analytics about how users are interacting with their videos, which offers another way to learn about their consumers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After Disrupt, Adventr raised $5 million in seed funding led by Paladin Capital, along with Reinventure Capital, In Visible Ventures, and EGOT-winner John Legend, who also happens to be Harris&#8217; longtime collaborator and former college roommate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw a six-figure jump in revenue immediately following Disrupt, and to this day we receive inbounds from people who see our pitch video online,&#8221; Harris said.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.adventr.io/index.html?link=https%3A%2F%2Fd252srr1zuysk4.cloudfront.net%2Fclients%2F642%2F5579%2Fpublished%2F642-adventr-commercial-draft-83373436.data" width="960px" height="540px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Adventr plans to use this funding to continue building out its team &#8212; when the company participated in the Startup Battlefield, they only had five employees. The company recently brought on former Vimeo General Manager Peter Gerard as a product lead. Harris said that soon, Adventr will roll out integrations into social media platforms, allowing customers to share their interactive videos natively on those platforms.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Overjet is now covering nearly 75 million members through its dental insurance partnerships.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just four months after announcing <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/overjet-raises-27-million-in-series-a-financing-to-accelerate-adoption-of-ai-driven-dentistry-301363607.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$27 million in Series A funding</a>, <a href="https://www.overjet.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overjet</a>, a company developing dental artificial intelligence software, came forward again with another $42.5 million in Series B financing backed by existing investors.</p>
<p>Prior to the company’s Series A, we profiled them in 2020 when the company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/overjet-raises-7-85m-for-its-dental-focused-ai-tech/">$7.85 million in funding</a>. The latest funding was led by General Catalyst and Insight Partners and included Crosslink Capital and E14 Fund. Overall, the company has raised just under $80 million in total. Now even more well capitalized, Overjet’s valuation has nearly quadrupled to $425 million, says Wardah Inam, PhD, co-founder and CEO of Overjet.</p>
<p>“We were valued at $115 million at the last round, so this is a substantial increase,” she added. “For a dental company, not many have reached that milestone yet.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249321" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2W2KcdrwmN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/overjet-raises-7-85m-for-its-dental-focused-ai-tech/">Overjet raises $7.85M for its dental-focused AI tech</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Overjet raises $7.85M for its dental-focused AI tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/overjet-raises-7-85m-for-its-dental-focused-ai-tech/embed/#?secret=2W2KcdrwmN" data-secret="2W2KcdrwmN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Having just completed a round of funding, Inam told TechCrunch that it was a quick Series B, and though the timing was unexpected, it was the result of much inbound inquiries from investors. New investors showed interest, but the company decided to do the round internally when it was able to get the terms it wanted for the future, she said.</p>
<p>Boston-based Overjet&#8217;s dental AI software supports dentists in understanding what the scans show with regard to disease identification and progression. Its Dental Assist product has FDA clearance and its strategy of targeting dental groups with large numbers of providers, for example its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/overjet-and-new-england-family-dentistry-partner-to-bring-artificial-intelligence-to-over-50-dental-practices-301399523.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnership with 50-clinic New England Family Dentistry</a>, announced in October, is keeping the company busy working to implement its software into thousands of practices, Inam said.</p>
<p>On the insurance side, the company counts 16 major carriers as customers. It was covering 50 million members at the time of the Series A, and that figure is now around 75 million, Inam said.</p>
<p>“The raise was to set up practice operations, and now that we have good hires in, we have a huge backlog of practices that we want to launch,” she added. “Milestones that we were planning to hit in a year, we ended up hitting in a few months.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In December, Overjet reached 50 employees after starting the year with 20, and Inam expects to triple that headcount in the next six months in the areas of customer success and engineering. It switched to remote-first operations so it could reach a broader range of talent. The company also plans to use the new funding to develop new products.</p>
<p>Next up, the company remains on course with its focus on improving oral health and oral care and building technology. Inam believes that “for the first time ever” the technology is there to analyze dental data through computers and be able to more accurately see the progression of disease and measure outcomes toward more value-based care.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dental industry is one that has been slow to embrace technology, but many startups have emerged in the past decade to assist payers and providers in automating some of the traditionally manual parts of the business, particularly the clear aligner space and analyzing dental scans, and educating people about dental health.</p>
<p>This year, companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/y-combinator-backed-adra-wants-to-turn-all-dentists-into-cavity-finding-super-dentists/">Adra</a>, which is turning X-rays into images for better identification of problems, also received funding, as did dental insurer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/beam-raises-80m-as-the-dental-insurer-looks-to-keep-up-rapid-historical-growth/">Beam Dental</a>.</p>
<p>“Dental practices are fast being run more like businesses and they are ready to pay for technology and other tools to help them improve care and revenue,” Inam said. “That’s why more and more good startups are being formed in this space, because everyone underestimates the value of oral health, but now there is an opportunity to really provide greater technology.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/zerofox/">ZeroFox</a>, an enterprise threat intelligence cybersecurity startup that helps companies detect risks found on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/social/">social media</a>, has announced plans to become a publicly-traded company via a merger with blank-check company L&amp;F Acquisition.</p>
<p>As part of the transaction, Maryland-based ZeroFox — which has raised more than $154 million in funding since it was founded in 2013 — will acquire IDX, a consumer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/privacy/">privacy</a> platform that claims to be America&#8217;s largest provider of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-breach/">data breach</a> response services.</p>
<p>The company’s technology will be combined with the ZeroFox platform, an AI-powered service that aims to protect organizations against threats like scams, malicious links, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/hacking/">account hijacking</a>, to become a cybersecurity provider that addresses &#8220;the full lifecycle of external cyber threats and risks for its customers.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249897" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Since ZeroFox was founded in 2013, we have helped companies address emerging security challenges caused by the transformational shift to a ‘digital everything’ world. This rapid digital transformation has made companies vulnerable to attackers, resulting in the highest breach rate the industry has ever seen,” said ZeroFox chief executive James Foster. “We believe that external cybersecurity must be a top-three priority and part of the critical security tech stack for chief information security officers because perimeter firewalls and internal endpoint agents alone are not enough to protect company assets and customers.”</p>
<p>Upon closing of the transaction, the combined company will be renamed ZeroFox Holdings and will have more than 650 employees and almost 2,000 customers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The company is expected to be listed under the ticker symbol ZFOX, and the expected equity value of the combined entities is approximately $1.4 billion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australian edtech start-up <a href="https://www.vivi.io/">Vivi</a> has raised $20 million from education investor Quad Partners, funds that it intends to use to improve its platform, upgrade its operational infrastructure, and hire more sales and marketing teams in the Americas, Europe, and Asia.</p>
<p>This latest round sees Vivi reach $24.3 in total capital over five years, after it raised <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-01-23/vivi-partners-with-riverside-acceleration-capital-in-latest-round-of-funding?sref=gni836kR">$4.3 million last year</a> from New-York’s Riverside Acceleration Capital (RAC) and a syndicate of Australian investors.</p>
<p>The new investment will help the startup to accelerate its overseas expansion across the world with a focus on the United States, the country with the highest percentage of educators using one-to-one computing (1:1) computing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249869" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One-to-one computing refers to academic institutions like schools and colleges, which allow all enrolled students to use electronic devices to access the internet, digital course materials, and digital textbooks.</p>
<p>Using Vivi, tutors can display their teaching material including videos and exercises to students, who then have the ability to annotate the content with their own notes on their own devices. Its other features include digital signage, emergency broadcasts, formative assessment, as well as student health and wellbeing checks.</p>
<p>The US, thus, remains a rich market for edtech companies like Vivi, which offers wireless presentation and screen mirroring technology to over 40,000 classrooms around the world, with the plan of reaching one million learning spaces in the next five years.</p>
<p>“Vivi has created demand overseas in a way that’s pretty unique – and largely by word of mouth. The company has evolved from a point solution into a comprehensive student engagement platform that has proven to be incredibly sticky,&#8221;said Vivi founder and executive chairman, Dr. Lior Rauchberger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our next big goal is to be in a million classrooms as soon as possible and partnering with Quad will certainly speed that up,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In particular, the US remains attractive to Vivi as it offers a market comprising nearly 14,000 school districts, with over 130,000 K-12 schools, and over 5,000 universities and colleges.</p>
<p>Additionally, and as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, there is unprecedented federal funding in the US going into education, increasing the number of students with laptops, tablets and phones. This is as hybrid learning maintains a growing presence across the country.</p>
<p>“…right now, we are moving quickly to take advantage of some significant tailwinds, particularly in the US. With a rapidly increasing focus on technology enablement at schools, the highest ratio of 1:1 student devices ever, and increasing awareness of the instructional and administrative benefits of screen mirroring, we are thrilled to be able to get Vivi into the hands of more students, educators, and administrators quickly,” said Vivi’s chief executive officer, Natalie Mactier of their expansion plans.</p>
<p>Vivi was launched in 2016 as a simple and intuitive classroom engagement that enables students to instantly share their screens with the class or small groups for immediate feedback. The advent of the startup, however, goes back to 2013, as Australian entrepreneur Dr. Lior Rauchberger sought a wireless presentation solution for a client.</p>
<p>Unable to find one that was cost-effective compatible with all devices, he set out to innovate, and three years later, Vivi was born as a partnership between Dr. Rauchberger, startup specialist Simon Holland and tech guru Tomas Spacek from Papercloud Ventures.</p>
<p>So far, Vivi is in 12 countries spanning Australia, Europe, Middle East, South East Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>In its international expansion, Vivi is contesting challengers like Airtame, Eupheus, Coorpacademy and Droplr, all being part of a global edtech market that is set to increase <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/edtech-market-to-grow-by-usd-112-39-bn-from-2020-to-2025evolving-opportunities-with-alphabet-inc--blackboard-inc17000-technavio-reports-301412825.html">by USD 112.39 billion from 2020 to 2025</a>, 46% of which will originate from North America.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to engineering talent in the world of tech, demand continues to outpace supply, a predicament so acute that by 2030, that disparity will balloon to 85 million positions being unfilled, according to <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2019/03/global-competition-for-technology-workers-costa.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research from Korn Ferry</a>. Today, a startup that believes it can stem that tide with a more inclusive, global approach to sourcing, hiring and managing talent is announcing a big fundraise to continue building out its platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.turing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing</a> &#8212; which uses AI to source, evaluate, hire, onboard and then manage engineers remotely (including the HR and compliance aspects) in a bigger platform that it calls the &#8220;Talent Cloud&#8221; &#8212;  has raised $87 million, a Series D round of financing that values the startup at $1.1 billion. WestBridge Capital is leading the round, with previous backer Foundation Capital; new investor StepStone Group; and AltaIR Capital, strategic backer HR Tech Investments LLC (an affiliate of Indeed), Brainstorm Ventures, Frontier Ventures, Modern Venture Partners, and Plug and Play Scale Fund all also participating. The round was oversubscribed and so the company also opened up a <a href="https://www.contractscounsel.com/t/us/safe-note" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAFE note</a> at a $4 billion valuation, which is now also oversubscribed.</p>
<p>The funding comes on the back of strong growth for Turing. Demand from engineers in far-flung parts of the world who could not or did not want to relocate to work ramped up. Jonathan Siddharth, the founder and CEO, told me in an. interview that the total pool of candidates has grown 9x to 1 million engineers and developers from 140 countries in the last year, with that pool either looking for projects or already engaged in them. (Note: last year when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/turing-nabs-32m-more-for-an-ai-based-platform-to-source-and-manage-engineers-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced $32 million in funding</a>, it told me it had 180,000 developers on the platform.) It covers some 100 technologies and 15 job titles currently, ranging from entry-level roles all the way up to engineering directors and CTO candidates, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249823" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Popular requests are for full-stack engineers, those who specialize in front-end or back-end languages, and site reliability engineers. In the near future, Turing will expand into adjacent areas like project management, paving the way for an upcoming product where companies can engage entire teams on Turing, rather than individuals that are then potentially managed as teams.</p>
<p>Demand is also scaling on the platform. Customers span from technology companies through to non-tech companies that still need engineers to help run and build different aspects of their businesses. They include Johnson &amp; Johnson, Coinbase, Rivian, Dell, Disney, Plume, and VillageMD.</p>
<p>&#8220;We now live in a remote-first world and everyone is racing to reap the value of that,&#8221; Siddharth said.</p>
<p>Turing was founded on some basic premises about hiring and remote work that have borne out in the current market climate, shifted and altered perhaps permanently by Covid-19. Before the pandemic, working remotely was occasionally accepted but in many situations businesses actually built infrastructure not just to enable people to work together in office environments, but to encourage them to stay there for as many hours as possible, with free and excellent food at all hours, pool tables and other diversions, and even nap pods for when you did need a short kip.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This not only played out in entrenched ideas about office culture, but also impacted recruitment and hiring overall: you relocated for your job, and the company and you had to go through a major visa process to do so. And more often than not you were required to relocate to specific tech hubs like the Bay Area. This meant major strain on regional infrastructure, rent and bigger social make-up of cities and towns.</p>
<p>Now with Covid-19 totally changing the game, we&#8217;re collectively asking ourselves if all that was really necessary, in order to do work, and do it well.</p>
<p>Turing plays on all of that with a platform that effectively is providing a resounding &#8220;no&#8221; to those questions.</p>
<p class="p7">&#8220;Twitter, LinkedIn, Siemens, they are all going remote and the reasons are obvious,&#8221; he said. (Note: those are not named customers, just examples of companies going remote.) &#8220;You can now tap into a planetary pool of engineers, and smart people are looking where others are not. Also now we have more proven success of distributed teams.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not to say that remote management is easy: you need to build pipelines of engineers, you need to figure out how to evaluate them, and you need to stay communicated with them. Turing&#8217;s platform has been built, therefore, not just for sourcing but helping those at the company these other hard and soft skills. Most people come on board for fixed-term projects, Siddharth said, but some follow the path to taking on more extended, even permanent, roles at organizations. It&#8217;s not the only company addressing the talent gap.</p>
<p>Fiverr, Upwork, LinkedIn, and many others are also making it easier to find engineers wherever they might be, although what Turing has built covers more of the specialized end-to-end needs that arise around engaging them. (In that regard, it&#8217;s a little like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/superside-nabs-30m-to-connect-and-manage-freelance-creatives-working-with-in-house-marketing-and-design-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superside</a>, which raised money for its designer and creative talent hiring and management platform last week.)</p>
<p class="p3">“Turing’s ambitious vision of enabling fantastic opportunities for developers across the globe is inspiring,” said John Avirett, partner at StepStone Group, in a statement. “The Intelligent Talent Cloud truly is a remarkable way to democratize access and make lasting connections beyond inking the contract; they’re cultivating the process into long term career planning for the individual and the companies who use them.”</p>
<p class="p3">“Turing is productizing every leg of a massive industry and has forever changed its face and perception going forward,” added Ashu Garg of Foundation Capital.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today, we'll dig into Justworks' business, its economic performance and what it might be worth. Let's have a little IPO fun one last time this year!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The early 2022 IPO cohort is beginning to take shape. Recall that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/a-few-questions-about-the-impending-reddit-ipo/">Reddit recently filed to go public</a>, albeit privately. That&#8217;s going to be a huge debut.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/samsara-could-become-a-decacorn-in-upcoming-iot-themed-ipo/">Samsara closing out 2021</a> and Reddit set to ensure fireworks, we might be content. But there are more offerings coming, including Justworks: The HR software company <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001623414/000162828021025176/justworkss-1.htm">filed late last week</a>, so we&#8217;re going to tear into its S-1 to see just what the company has built.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TechCrunch has covered Justworks several times during its startup life, including when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/06/justworks-raises-40m-to-build-a-simpler-business-operations-suite/">raised a $40 million round back in 2018</a>. The former startup also <a href="https://justworks.com/about/press/archive/justworks-raises-50-million-series-e">closed a $50 million round</a> as 2020 kicked off, bringing its total known capital raised to just over $140 million. In addition, Justworks CEO Isaac Oates sat down with one of his investors and TechCrunch earlier this year to go over that 2018 Series B pitch deck.

At the time, our own Ingrid Lunden noted that HR software aimed at non-tech companies was having a moment.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;ll dig into Justworks&#8217; business, its economic performance and what it might be worth. Let&#8217;s have a little IPO fun one last time this year!</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s a &#8216;Justworks&#8217;?</h2>
<p>Justworks&#8217; software helps small businesses keep things running. What&#8217;s on offer? Things like payroll, vendor payments, payroll tax filings, unemployment insurance, accounting software and e-signature support.</p>
<p>A grab bag of tooling that, even at lower price tiers, allows SMBs to actually do the core work of being in business. The tech company also has more expensive plans that include access to health insurance products.</p>
<p>All told, Justworks sells its software on a per-employee, per-month basis, with set costs for companies up to 175 employees; past that, the company wants you to call them.</p>
<p>So, SMB-focused, HR-themed SaaS. That classification of Justworks helps us know what questions to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is Justworks a pure software company, or does its product require more human inputs that lower its gross-margin profile? (In simpler terms, how high-quality is its revenue?)</li>
<li>Does the company have churn under control? (In simpler terms, are SMB customers as churn-heavy as we&#8217;ve been historically warned by venture capitalists?)</li>
<li>Finally, does Justworks have attractive net retention metrics? (In simpler terms, how far can you upsell customers with limited employee footprints if you charge per worker?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore.</p>
<h2>Is it a good business?</h2>
<p>Yes? It&#8217;s certainly not a traditional software IPO, however.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s revenue mix contains software income <em>and</em> a huge chunk of low-margin insurance and benefits coverage. And Justworks has a history of profitability that we don&#8217;t see often.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon says it has fixed an issue with its Amazon Appstore that was causing issues with app launches for customers who had upgraded to Android 12 on their mobile devices. Earlier this month, reports began to circulate that Amazon&#8217;s Appstore was still not functional on Android 12 following its fall release. Users reported that not only did the Appstore itself not work, the apps and games they had installed from the Appstore also no longer worked.</p>
<p>The company had been responding to customer <a href="https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q000087E2wvSAC/amazon-appstore-not-working-after-android-12-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaints</a> in Amazon&#8217;s digital and device forums, only to say that its technical team was still investigating the issue. But things came to a head when an article by <a href="https://liliputing.com/2021/11/android-12-launched-a-month-ago-and-amazon-appstore-still-wont-run-on-it.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liliputing.com</a> detailing the problems got traction and was picked up by a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-app-store-broken-android-12-173131316.html">wider</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811710/amazon-android-12-appstore-drm-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">range</a> of news <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/19/amazon-appstore-is-broken-on-android-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sites</a>, forcing Amazon to publicly comment on the matter. It then said it was working on a fix that impacted &#8220;app performance and launches&#8221; that had affected the &#8220;small number of Amazon Appstore users that have upgraded to Android 12.&#8221; The company noted at the time the issue didn&#8217;t impact Amazon Fire TV devices or Amazon Fire tablets.</p>
<p>On Friday, Amazon said a fix has gone live, but did not detail what had gone wrong or how the issues had been addressed, more specifically.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249845" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have released a fix for an issue impacting app launches for Amazon Appstore customers that have upgraded to Android 12 on their mobile devices,&#8221; a company spokesperson said, in a statement shared with media. &#8220;We are contacting customers with steps to update their Appstore experience. We are sorry for any disruption this has caused,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>There had been some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811710/amazon-android-12-appstore-drm-issues">speculation</a> that the issues with the Appstore had been related to its built-in DRM and Android 12, given that one of the workarounds a user discovered involved decompiling the Android app APK file then commenting out the lines related to the DRM, among other technical steps. (Clearly, this was not a fix mainstream users could take advantage of, however.)</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s failure to address this issue for multiple weeks highlights how little traction its Appstore has on Android devices, where few users see any need to buy apps outside of Google Play, as well as how slow the Android upgrade cycle can be. It simply was not a priority for Amazon to address the issues with any sense of urgency, it seemed.</p>
<p>These days, Amazon&#8217;s focus with its Appstore is instead on how it can be used to deliver apps to Windows 11 users. Microsoft and Amazon this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/android-apps-are-coming-to-windows-11-through-the-amazon-appstore/">agreed</a> to partner on a new initiative that would allow Amazon to offer its third-party app store on the Microsoft Store, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/26/this-week-in-apps-android-apps-on-windows-11-app-store-search-ads-hit-china-apple-argues-against-sideloading/">allowing</a> Windows users to download Android apps to their PCs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">To be effective, each element of your brand’s ethos must be authentic. Your values must be aligned with your identity, your mission must match your purpose and your vision must be a moonshot that resonates with your team, your customers and, perhaps most importantly, with you as the founder.</p>
<p>A true ethos can’t be prescribed or copied. It must be extracted from the people building your company (sounds painful, I know). That’s where the visioning workshop comes in. A visioning workshop sequesters key players on your team in a room to dig deep into your collective motivations, inspirations and ambitions. It’s a collaborative, generative experience that surfaces the concepts that matter most to your brand and company.</p>
<p>Here’s how to do it:</p>
<p>Let the founder or CEO drive this process to signal the importance of the work. An outside facilitator could help you keep things on track, but the whole workshop can be DIY’d if budget is a concern.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Skipping ethos work is a costly mistake that produces a disjointed and rudderless brand, directly and negatively impacting the growth potential of the company.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>You should select five to six stakeholders for the working team, ensuring a cross section of perspectives in the room. Most early-stage companies will find it practical to include department leads and members of the founding team. This team will do most of the heavy lifting and is responsible for bringing insights from their respective areas.</p>
<p>Then, gather the team (preferably off-site to limit distractions) for at least a four-hour session to participate in a series of exercises, both individually and as a group. Make liberal use of a whiteboard (take pictures of the board as you go) and encourage note-taking. You might even consider making an audio recording of the session to reference later.</p>
<p>These exercises should be generative in nature, and you’ll use the results to prompt discussions and identify patterns.</p>

<p>Here are three of the most effective ones for early-stage companies:</p>
<h2>Exercise #1: Is and will</h2>
<p>Deceivingly difficult, this one is great to start with, as it tends to inspire productive conversation. Give each team member 10 minutes to complete the two sentences below. Responses should be short, ideally less than ten words total. Then share the responses and discuss as a group for 20-30 minutes.</p>
<blockquote><p>“My company is…”</p>
<p>“My company will…”</p></blockquote>
<p>The intent of this exercise is twofold: The first phrase helps derive your company’s mission, which is your team’s daily focus. The second phrase helps derive your company’s vision, which is your direction and purpose.</p>
<h2>Exercise #2: Desired end state<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Who says the holiday week is a slow news week? Oracle was kind enough to help tech journalists weary from working on year-end stories with some big news today: The database giant announced it was buying electronic healthcare records company Cerner in a deal valued at $28.3 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oracle Corporation and Cerner Corporation today jointly announced an agreement for Oracle to acquire Cerner through an all-cash tender offer for $95.00 per share, or approximately $28.3 billion in equity value,&#8221; the company said in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oracle-buys-cerner-301448252.html">a press release</a>.</p>
<p>With this deal, Oracle moves in a major way into the healthcare vertical, a growing market, and one that should help bolster Oracle&#8217;s fledgling cloud infrastructure business, which is languishing in the single digits, <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/amazon-microsoft-google-grab-the-big-numbers-but-rest-of-cloud-market-still-grows-by-27">according to Synergy Research</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249842" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, said it&#8217;s the biggest deal in Oracle history, a company that has a long record of being acquisitive.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a smart move by Oracle. It cements Oracle technology even deeper into healthcare, and brings a lot of current and especially future work load to Oracle Cloud. Not to mention that Oracle is buying into the largest and fastest-growing vertical industry,&#8221; Mueller told me.</p>
<p>That growth potential certainly didn&#8217;t escape Oracle CEO Safra Catz. &#8220;Cerner will be a huge additional revenue growth engine for years to come as we expand its business into many more countries throughout the world. That&#8217;s exactly the growth strategy we adopted when we bought NetSuite—except the Cerner revenue opportunity is even larger,&#8221; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, however, that as Catz talks of international expansion, Microsoft made a similar play into healthcare earlier this year, when it announced it was acquiring Nuance Communications in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">a deal valued at $19.7 billion</a>. But that is facing headwinds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/cma-microsoft-nuance/">from regulators in the U.K</a>. It will be interesting to see if this deal runs into similar regulatory scrutiny as it advances next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for Cerner, David Feinberg, president and CEO, who<a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/cerner-names-dr-david-feinberg-president-and-ceo"> just took over in the role</a> in October, saw an opportunity for shareholders and grabbed it. Of course, he frames the deal in the way most CEOs do &#8212; as a way to expand its markets in a way that wouldn&#8217;t be possible as a stand-alone company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joining Oracle as a dedicated Industry Business Unit provides an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate our work modernizing electronic health records (EHR), improving the caregiver experience, and enabling more connected, high-quality and efficient patient care,&#8221; Feinberg said in a statement.</p>
<p>Oracle stock was down 2.68% this morning on the news, while Cerner was up slightly at 0.92%.</p>
<p>For now, this announcement is the first in a series of steps, including an official filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Whether it makes it all the way to close in the current regulatory climate remains to be seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/youtube-tv-warns-customers-they-may-lose-access-to-18-disney-owned-channels-by-weeks-end/">warned customers</a> they may lose access to Disney-owned channels on its YouTube TV streaming service by the end of the week if the two companies couldn&#8217;t come to a new carriage agreement. As of Friday, negotiations fell through and YouTube TV alerted customers it would have to drop Disney channels from its service and would lower its pricing for customers. But over the weekend, things turned around. On Sunday, YouTube <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-disney-programming-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new agreement had been reached, but it will still offer customers a $15 credit for the disruption.</p>
<p>YouTube updated <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-disney-programming-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its blog post</a> where it had been keeping customers informed about its contract dispute to say that it had reached a new agreement that will allow Disney to continue to stream its content on YouTube TV. That means the pricing for YouTube TV customers won&#8217;t drop down to the lower rate, as had been warranted when it looked like the channels would be removed. Instead, YouTube TV will continue at the usual rate of $64.99 per month.</p>
<p>The new deal will include Disney&#8217;s networks, like ESPN and FX, as well as Disney&#8217;s on-demand and live content, as before. Customers with recordings from Disney properties in their YouTube TV Library will also see those restored. And YouTube TV noted that users would see their local ABC stations return to the service by the end of the day on Sunday.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249837" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Had an agreement not been reached, YouTube TV customers would have lost access to a large number of streaming channels and on-demand content offerings. In total, 18 Disney-owned channels were impacted, including users&#8217; local ABC station, ABC News Live, The Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, FX, FXX, FXM, National Geographic, National Geographic Wild, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, ESPNU, ESPNews, SEC Network and ACC Network.</p>
<p>YouTube had also <a href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/disney2021-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> its members a $15 discount while Disney content remained off its platform, as a result of the contractual dispute. Even though Disney&#8217;s programming had only been removed for a day, YouTube announced on Sunday it will still honor a one-time credit for all impacted members.</p>
<p>Members who haven&#8217;t already received their $15 discount on their monthly bill will see it applied to their next bill. No action will be needed on members&#8217; parts to receive the credit. In addition, if customers had opted to cancel due to the failed negotiations, YouTube says they&#8217;ll be able to return by visiting the website (tv.youtube.com/membership), then clicking &#8220;add&#8221; to return the Base plan to their membership. Members who had paused their membership will receive the credit one month after their first charge, the company noted. Members who are in a paused state will receive this credit one month after their first charge. (More details are on <a href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/disney2021-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dedicated website.)</a></p>
<p>Only weeks ago, YouTube had been on the other side of the negotiations table in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/roku-and-google-reach-a-deal-for-the-continued-distribution-of-youtube-and-youtube-tv-on-roku-devices/">a contract dispute with Roku</a> over its YouTube and YouTube TV apps. This one was later resolved without either company sharing deals as to how they settled what had been serious allegations on Roku&#8217;s part about Google&#8217;s increased demands to use data and anticompetitive behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of Roblox hitting it big with its platform for user-created gaming content, another startup has landed a major round of funding to build out its own user-generated platform aimed at immersive experiences. <a href="https://rec.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rec Room</a>, a free to download and play cross-platform social gaming company, has raised $145 million, funding that it will use to continue building out its tools and audience of gamers using them to create their own experiences across mobile devices, game consoles, PC and VR headsets (operating systems/platforms supported include iOS, Xbox, PlayStation, Oculus, Steam and, as of August, Android).</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Coatue Management, with participation from existing investors Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures and Madrona Venture Group, and it is coming in at a $3.5 billion valuation.</p>
<p>This is a significant hike on its valuation earlier this year, in March, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/rec-room-raises-at-1-25b-valuation-from-sequoia-and-index-as-vcs-push-to-find-another-roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $100 million led by Sequoia at a $1.25 billion valuation</a>. In that period it has seen some very impressive growth. It noted 2 million people playing and creating content in March; now, it said it has 37 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249824" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding is coming on the back of very significant growth and scale for Rec Room, amid a wider climate where suddenly a lot more attention is being focused on VR and immersive experiences, and specifically companies that are building content (or vehicles for content) that engage users in those mediums. (To be sure, one of the major sticking points up to now has been that there hasn&#8217;t really been enough compelling content to merit investment and use of clunky VR headsets and other bleeding-edge technology.)</p>
<p>Rec Room is a &#8220;social gaming&#8221; company in a couple of regards: The key to its growth, interestingly, has been not just the ability to create games and play those created by others and to join in rooms to play together (which is perhaps the most obvious &#8220;social&#8221; aspect), but the ability to provide a well-used, virtual social space for users to hang out beyond gameplay.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other social gaming companies &#8212; which relied on other platforms like Facebook to carry out the social aspect of their gaming experiences &#8212; Rec Room says it&#8217;s already been used for virtual weddings, business meetings and more casual meetups, all activities that have most likely been given an extra virtual boost as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the dampener that it has had on in-person social meetings and travel. That Rec Room provides a variety of experiences catering both to novices and more experienced gamers gives it and its &#8220;Rec Life&#8221; concept a very low barrier to entry with both demographics of users.</p>
<p>Rec Room has been around for just five years (launched in 2016 in Seattle), and it has &#8212; at least for now &#8212; avoided the fast-rise/precipitous fall that has characterized so many other social gaming hits. It has now racked up 37 million users who build and play games in &#8220;rooms&#8221; where they virtually hang out with other users. There are some 12 million rooms on the platform already, Rec Room said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not clear how many active users there are out of that 37 million figure, Rec Room said that monthly user count has grown by almost 450% in the last year (since November 2020), and that mobile users are driving some of that growth, up tenfold in that period.</p>
<p>“It’s been amazing to watch Rec Room grow from a tiny collection of mini-games into a global platform with millions of experiences built by the community. The platform has become a place where people can come together to form meaningful connections, build communities, and share their creativity,” said Rec Room co-founder and CEO Nick Fajt, in a statement. “There’s still so much more we want to do, and as we head into 2022, we’re excited to build more experiences, expand to new platforms, invest in best in class trust and safety systems, and continue to expand our creator tools.”</p>
<p>The company is not disclosing any revenue figures today but back in March it said it was paying out some $1 million to games creators on its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We love the world Rec Room has created for friends to build and play together,” said Matt Mazzeo of Coatue Management in a statement. “From phones to VR, millions of players are hanging out in Rec Room, and we&#8217;re excited to partner with the team as they make the digital world more fun and immersive.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the pandemic forced remote work, school and research to the forefront, decentralized clinical trials were probably on the horizon. Now, they’re here in earnest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, precision psychiatry startup Alto Neuroscience and Cerebral, an online mental health provider, announced that they’ve joined forces for a decentralized <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05157945?term=Alto+Neuroscience&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase 2 clinical trial</a> for Alto Neuroscience’s depression drug candidate &#8212; ALTO-300. The study will largely take place in patients’ homes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the project will recruit an estimated 200 volunteers from the Cerebral platform who are currently struggling with depression, and have seen no benefit from existing treatments. Alto Neuroscience, aside from providing the new drug, will also look to validate its approach to drug development: using patient biomarkers to predict which drugs patients will (or will not) respond to. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249444" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The idea that you would do deep phenotyping on a patient population and find out which subgroups of patients really benefit from the drug before you end up spending a billion dollars in clinical trials made all the sense in the world, but no one was doing it,” David Mou, the chief medical officer at Cerebral told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In a way it was a match made in heaven. We had what they needed, and I trust that their vision is going to be what’s most workable.” </span></p>
<h2>What’s interesting about decentralized clinical trials?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitions of a “decentralized clinical trial” </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrea-Coravos/publication/332599045_Decentralized_Trials_in_the_Age_of_Real-World_Evidence_and_Inclusivity_in_Clinical_Investigations/links/5f2748c992851cd302d57189/Decentralized-Trials-in-the-Age-of-Real-World-Evidence-and-Inclusivity-in-Clinical-Investigations.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vary slightly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but in essence, it means that care is brought to the patient in some form, either virtually or thanks to mobile clinicians. Data is also typically collected where patients are, rather than through regular visits to a study center.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bringing clinical trials to patients does have the potential to solve major problems currently facing clinical trials by making the process less cumbersome for patients. Nearly </span><a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2019/08/virtual-clinical-trials-a-new-model-for-patient-engagement#:~:text=Nearly%2070%20percent%20of%20potential,visits%20is%20not%20an%20option." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70% of clinical trial participants </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">live more than two hours away from a study center, for instance. Enrollment is also common reason trials are terminated, and an estimated </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7342339/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of clinical trials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fail to enroll patients on time. Finally, experts have suggested that bringing trials to patients </span><a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2019/08/virtual-clinical-trials-a-new-model-for-patient-engagement#:~:text=Nearly%2070%20percent%20of%20potential,visits%20is%20not%20an%20option." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">might help</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> improve the diversity and accessibility of drug research. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trial is far from the first decentralized clinical trial ever, but it does come during an inflection point for the field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the pandemic only 38% of pharma and contract research organizations (CROs) </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/no-place-like-home-stepping-up-the-decentralization-of-clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told McKinsey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that decentralized clinical trials would be a major part of their portfolios. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When McKinsey surveyed those same organizations again in 2020, 100% expected decentralized trials to play a large role. </span></p>
<h2>What this trial can tell us</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trial has the potential to reveal a lot about the strength of data collected at home, the FDA’s attitude toward that data and whether decentralized clinical trials really solve problems site-based trials have faced for years in real life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collecting in-depth data is especially important for Alto Neuroscience’s drug development strategy. That’s because the company is based on developing unique, biomarker-driven portraits of patients with mental health diagnoses, from EEG measurements to mood and emotion questionnaires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re developing new drugs for various psychiatric disorders, with a focus on identifying who the right patient would be using brain tests or brain biomarkers,” Amit Etkin, founder and CEO of Alto Neuroscience told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What that means in this case, is that a core part of everything we do is try to make sure that our biomarkers identify, in the most generalizable way, the patients who will respond to our drugs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cerebral became an attractive partner for Alto Neuroscience’s upcoming trial for a few reasons. The first was that the company was able to quickly find a population that fit the specifics for the clinical trial: “We pulled out those 200 patients within an hour,” Mou said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the key piece was that Cerebral had already compiled a huge amount of data on patients and their clinicians &#8212; suggesting that they had capacity to collect the high quality of data that Alto Neuroscience needs. That includes data on patients who suffer from severe forms of depression (a category who are often not served by apps that fall into wellness categories). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Cerebral patients already regularly fill out questionnaires on symptoms and mood. The company also has data on physician prescribing patterns, which could provide insight into what’s working and what isn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because we&#8217;ve focused so much on high-quality care, it forced us to create a data infrastructure on the back end to know much more about our patients and our clinicians than any other mental health provider in existence right now,” said Mou. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One lingering question is how the FDA will view data collected in a decentralized, even remote, way. That’s process is in development. </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/oncology-center-excellence/advancing-oncology-decentralized-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for instance, the agency required oncology decentralized trials to label their data sets to distinguish which data was collected in-person, and what was collected remotely, for instance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trial may offer a good point of comparison. Alto Neuroscience is actually currently running </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">two </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar clinical trials on ALTO-300: </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05157945?term=Alto+Neuroscience&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one with Cerebral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05118750?term=Alto+Neuroscience&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another in the traditional site-based format</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strategy there, says Etkin, isn’t just to evaluate the effectiveness of ALTO-300. It tests the whole concept of a decentralized precision psychiatry clinical trial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of what we&#8217;re trying to do is also validate our approach for FDA so that we can show that what we&#8217;re getting in a decentralized approach is equivalent to what we&#8217;re getting in a site-based approach,” said Etkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there’s some evidence that this trial overcomes barriers associated with traditional clinical trials &#8212; like enrollment issues. But it’s not perfect. The patients in the Cerebral trial, for example, are still based in New York, Dallas or Atlanta, not exactly populations that live hours away from major medical centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Does it solve the problem of representation? Not completely,” notes Mou. “But I would say it&#8217;s a higher fidelity group: The chances they have true depression is much higher than going out there in the classic way and recruiting patients through brick and mortar clinics.” </span></p>
<h2>From trial to commercialization</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both founders noted that decentralized trials could also pave the way for drug commercialization. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Mou notes that Cerebral could easily help deploy a drug to the patients who might benefit from it post-approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Alto Neuroscience’s perspective Cerebral could be a conduit to helping bring mental health biomarkers into clinical practice &#8212; a longstanding issue when it comes to diagnosing mental health conditions. (Historically, mental health diagnoses have been made through observing behavioral symptoms, rather than medical tests. Though some researchers, and commercial companies like Alto Neuroscience have been seeking to </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/mental-disorders-precision-psychiatry-ddd2f6b2-9f93-4854-9ef7-f52bf82e6068.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turn the field</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toward diagnosis based on validated biomarkers.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A partner like Cerebral would be ideal for bringing our biomarkers, once approved, for medication into clinical practice, because their clinical care is so structured and well-tracked.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for this current trial, the companies expect to get a first readout by the end of 2022. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Users of Searchlight saw a 45% improvement in retention, 40% faster hire time and employees hired stayed on average 72% longer than when hired through other approaches.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Someone’s education and work history can be similar to other resumes in a pile, but <a href="https://www.searchlight.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Searchlight</a> aims to improve how companies measure a person’s soft skills to provide not only a differentiator, but also a better indication of how well that person will ultimately fit into the organization.</p>
<p>Kerry Wang and her twin sister, Anna Wang, saw this problem firsthand when they tried to distinguish themselves when they applied for the same job. Kerry Wang told TechCrunch that she felt some interview processes didn’t enable enough time for them to fully demonstrate how they were different.</p>
<p>“Nearly half of all hires fail within 18 months, so we were inspired to change the current talent software that labeled us as the same person,” Kerry Wang said. “Right now, given ‘The Great Resignation,’ you can’t just hire fast, but you have to hire well to win the talent war. This is difficult when there is a gap in measuring the quality of hires.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249438" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They started Searchlight in 2018 to develop technology that uses behavioral reference data and prescriptive analytics to give employers a more 360-degree view of a potential candidate’s strengths and weaknesses that might not appear on a resume or come out during an interview.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How my company is winning the war for engineering talent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/how-my-company-is-winning-the-war-for-engineering-talent/embed/#?secret=tyyvB2HFTj" data-secret="tyyvB2HFTj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Companies using Searchlight’s new features in beta form in the last 12 months hired thousands of candidates, often with a faster process, less bias and better retention, according to Wang. In fact, users saw a 45% improvement in retention, 40% faster hire time and employees hired stayed on average 72% longer than when hired through other approaches, she said.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $17 million in Series A funding to expand their offerings to include one-click reference and candidate assessments that take less than 15 minutes, a quality of hire dashboard for greater visibility into how to improve future hiring and a “people science engine” that connects behavioral data collected pre-hire to employee outcomes as a way to show best practices for recruiting and highlight the profiles of high performers.</p>
<p>The latest round of funding was led by Founders Fund with participation from Accel, Shasta, Kapor Capital, Operator Collective and a group of angel investors including executives at companies like Coda, Confluent and Plaid. It gives the company total funding to date of $20 million, which includes a <a href="https://www.searchlight.ai/blog/seed-round-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.5 million seed round</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Talent comes in all shapes and sizes, and Searchlight is the latest to see its approach backed by venture capital. Other recruitment technology companies recently announcing funding include fractional worker marketplace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/continuum-unveils-its-on-demand-access-marketplace-for-top-tier-executive-talent/">Continuum</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/hr-tech-startup-sense-valued-at-500-million-in-softbank-vision-fund-2-led-funding/">Sense</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/karat-raises-110m-on-a-1-1b-valuation-to-grow-its-technical-interviewing-as-a-service-platform/">Karat</a>.</p>

<p>Wang says her company is unique in the level of data and insights given to users as well as better recommendations. It is also able to show companies characteristics that they should be looking for in candidates and even disproves assumptions that companies have of their workforce makeup.</p>
<p>“You have to recognize what leads to success, and typically that is relying on your gut,” she added. “We create success profiles on what leads to retention based on soft skills.”</p>
<p>The company now works with more than 100 companies, including Udemy, Talkdesk and Zapier, and has 15 employees, up from four last year. Its customer base also more than tripled in the past year. Wang also shared that after using Searchlight, many of its customers are doubling down on their investment in the product.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to make additional hires to double the size of the team next year, and invest in product development and its go-to market strategy.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Founders Fund general partner Keith Rabois has joined Searchlight’s board.</p>
<p>Rabois said over his 20-year career of founding, funding and leading technology companies, the common denominator was the need for good people, saying, “The team you build is the company you build.”</p>
<p>“Searchlight resonated with me,” he added. “I have been on more than 15 boards, and every company talks about retention and what to do to improve retention. Constantly replacing talent can’t build a good company. I was always looking to improve myself and have the data and tools for me to get better. Searchlight offers the best data to make those hiring decisions.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The digital healthcare revolution has already begun, and it will gain further momentum in 2022 as providers and patients look for new and better ways to improve care. Companies with strong offerings, management teams and balance sheets are poised to capture tremendous value.</p>
<p>Healthcare deals were hot in the first nine months in 2021. They brought in a total of $21.3 billion in venture funding across 541 deals, dwarfing the previous record of $14.6 billion set in 2020, according to Rock Health.</p>
<p>But startups will continue to lead the way in innovation with the use of AI, IoT and data analytics, especially with data becoming the central currency of healthcare.</p>
<p>Given this environment, here are six emerging trends that we’re watching closely in 2022.</p>
<h2>Telemedicine will change how chronic conditions are treated</h2>
<p>The pandemic showed how telemedicine could change how we think about care interactions, with virtual visits increasing almost 40 times, according to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data from McKinsey</a>. Most of these interactions were centered around acute care. But for telemedicine to achieve its full potential, it will need to engage patients more frequently, especially for certain chronic conditions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The companies that succeed will be the ones that change the way patients interact with the healthcare system by building their entire operation around the patient experience.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Costs around chronic care are poised to rise as baby boomers age and put greater strain on the healthcare system. One chronic condition where telemedicine will play a larger role is diabetes. That’s why Teladoc Health, a leader in the space, acquired Livongo last year for $18.5 billion.</p>
<p>In 2022, entrepreneurs and investors are likely to expand telemedicine into more chronic care spaces like cardiology. Today, someone in the U.S. suffers a heart attack every 40 seconds, and heart disease costs the country about $219 billion a year. Telehealth offers a convenient, cost-effective way to diagnose and treat cardiovascular disease. For instance, with telehealth, even patients in remote or rural areas can gain access to cardiologists to get treatment without traveling far.</p>
<p>Overall, expect telehealth players to build their offerings across the chronic care landscape in a meaningful way in 2022.</p>
<h2>Digital therapeutics will rewrite the future of healthcare</h2>
<p>Digital therapeutics is perhaps the most innovative development in healthcare today and has the potential to dramatically change how care is delivered. More than any other area, this is the space where I believe we’ll see the most entrepreneurial and investment activity in the coming year.</p>
