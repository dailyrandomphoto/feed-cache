										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><a href="https://doctoranywhere.com/">Doctor Anywhere</a>, a startup that takes an “omnichannel” approach to healthcare, announced today it has raised $88 million SGD (about $65.7 million USD) in Series C funding. The round was led by Asia Partners, with participation from Novo Holdings, Philips and OSK-SBI Partners. It also included returning investors EDBI, Square Peg, IHH Healthcare, Kamet Capital and Pavilion Capital.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">As part of the round, Asia Partners co-founder Oliver Rippel and Novo Holdings Equity Asia senior partner Dr. Amit Kakar will join Doctor Anywhere’s board of directors. The company’s Series C, which it claims is one of the largest private rounds raised by a Southeast Asian healthtech company, brings its total funding to more than $140 million SGD.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Doctor Anywhere’s omnichannel approach means that in addition to online consultations, it runs in-person clinics, provides home visits, medication deliveries and operates an in-app marketplace for health and wellness products.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Founded in 2017 by Lim Wai Mun, Doctor Anywhere claims it now serves more than 1.5 million users. It is available in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, and recently established tech hubs in Bangalore and Ho Chi Minh City.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Lim told TechCrunch in an email that when he started working on Doctor Anywhere, there were already successful telemedicine platforms in the United States, the United Kingdom and China, but the model was still nascent in Southeast Asia. A former investor, Lim began Doctor Anywhere as a side project because he had older relatives who could not leave their homes for medical visits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Doctor Anywhere launched as an online-only telehealth platform, but “we quickly realized that physical presence is very important in order to build trust with users,” Lim said. As a result, the company started its home care services and physical clinics.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">According to Doctor Anywhere’s estimates, the COVID-19 pandemic fast-tracked the adoption of telehealth services in Southeast Asia by at least five years. The company saw more demand for online medical consultations, medication deliveries and marketplace purchases.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p2">“In the past year, we have more than doubled the size of our network, from around 1,000 providers at the start of 2020 to currently close to 2,500 medical professionals across Southeast Asia,” Lim said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p2">In response to the pandemic, Doctor Anywhere launched an online COVID-19 Medical Advisory Clinic last year to provide on-demand consultations for people with suspected symptoms. It also created an online mental wellness module with psychologists. Lim said the company has seen an increase in demand for mental health-related services, like insomnia and anxiety.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Other telehealth startups in the region include WhiteCoat, Speedoc and Doctor World. Lim said Doctor Anywhere wants to differentiate by quickly launching new products in response to user inquiries, and “cultivating a balance between technology and human touch.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">The funding will be used to deepen Doctor Anywhere’s presence in its current markets and expand into new ones. It also plans to scale its tech infrastructure and big data capabilities for a better online-to-offline user experience, and will introduce new medical specialty modules, shorten medication delivery times and develop personalized healthcare plans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few robotics categories are poised to benefit more from the events of the past year than construction. It’s a booming field that could benefit massively from automaton, a fact that’s only been amplified as the pandemic brought many nonessential businesses to a standstill. We’ve seen a number of players in the category raise notable rounds over the past year or so, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/construction-robotics-company-toggle-raises-8m/">Toggle</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/construction-robotics-firm-dusty-raises-16-5m/">Dusty</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/construction-startup-scaled-robotics-raises-a-e2m-seed-round/">Scaled</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/__trashed-12/">SkyMul</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Houston-based Rugged Robotics raised a $2.5 million seed round back in 2019. While the company isn’t actively raising at the moment, it has already begun to roll out its technology in early pilots, including a partnership with Massachusetts-based construction-firm Consigli.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195934" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195934" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2195934" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-13.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-13.jpg 6016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-13.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-13.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-13.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-13.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-13.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-13.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-13.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195934" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rugged Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>“We had a client that was pretty progressive looking,” said Consigli’s Jack Moran. &#8220;It’s a building where we were controlling the core shell of the project, as well as the fit-out, which was pretty complex &#8212; lots of odd shapes that would be a challenge for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rugged’s self-described “layout Roomba&#8221; was used to help build a 10-story building in Cambridge, Massachusetts, effectively drawing blueprints on the ground of the space that amounted to around 40,000 square feet per floor. The partnership effectively finds Rugged taking a key step from its early research and development mode to commercialize.</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/589850054" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>“The layout process is the most important task in the construction process,” Rugged founder and CEO Derrick Morse said in an interview with TechCrunch. “Marking where things are installed defines where things are built. A mistake made during layout trickles into the overall construction process and it results in rework, delays and additional expenses.”</p>
<p>The team is still small, with a headcount of around six full-time employees, including co-founders with backgrounds at NASA and Samsung. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The team currently has three robots, with plans to expand to five. They print dot matrix </span>ink patterns on the ground to give construction teams a real-world orientation for the buildings they&#8217;re creating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2195937" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195937" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2195937" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-57.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-57.jpg 6016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-57.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-57.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-57.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-57.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-57.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-57.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rugged_Robotics-57.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195937" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rugged Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>A member of the Rugged team travels to the site with the robot to supervise the robot as it executes on its plans, with the startup charging the construction company through a RaaS (robotics as a service) model.</p>
<p>“We have insatiable customer demand,” said Morse. “We have several multibillion-dollar contractors that are excited to do pilots and demos with us. We’ll be growing the organization and fleet in the upcoming 12 months, and we’ll likely be bringing in additional capital to enable that growth.”</p>

<p>But we have some TechCrunch news to start: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ryan-reynolds-is-coming-to-disrupt/">Ryan Reynolds is coming to Disrupt</a> to talk about his company, Maximum Effort. That’s pretty hype. And we’re <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/everything-enterprise-software-and-saas-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">going to be talking about software</a>.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/china-restricts-kids-online-gaming-to-three-hours-a-week/">China restricts youth gaming:</a> </strong>To three hours per week! Which isn’t much! For a country with a large games market like China, this is big darn news. But it’s just one part of a larger regulatory push in China (including things as far afield as taking on online fan culture!) to bring its private companies more in line with the government’s plans.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">Toast’s IPO looks tasty:</a></strong> TechCrunch took a longer look at Boston-based Toast’s IPO filing today. Our takeaways? That the company has posted admirable growth since its COVID lows and has a very sturdy multipart business model. The company is doing <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">the very active Boston startup scene</a> </strong>proud.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/apple-buys-classical-music-service-primephonic/">Spotify buys Joe Rogan, Apple buys classical music?</a> </strong>The campaign to build differentiated music streaming services in an era when music is available everywhere hotted up this week with Apple buying Primephonic. The smaller company, based in Amsterdam, will be absorbed into Apple Music.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Ready for a broadside of startup news? Good. We have what you need. But first, as a sign of the times, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/telegram-tops-1-billion-downloads/">Telegram just crossed the 1 billion download mark</a>. That’s an achievement, sure, but also goes to show that maybe consumers do care about privacy after all.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/eight-sleep-raises-86m-as-its-smart-mattress-and-sleep-fitness-technology-approach-500m-valuation/">Casper’s unfriendly ghost fails to haunt Eight Sleep:</a> </strong>Remember when D2C mattress company Casper went public, and it went poorly? That misstep has not stopped investors from putting new capital into Eight Sleep, which makes smart mattresses. The startup just raised $86 million in a Series C round of funding that values it at nearly a half-billion dollars.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/prive-has-raised-1-7-million-to-build-a-more-configurable-e-commerce-subscription-platform/"><strong>Prive raises $1.7M for better e-commerce subscriptions:</strong></a> Two ex-Uber folks are building something new to make e-commerce subscriptions, helping both retailers sell more goods and consumers get better recommendations. Win/win.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/clay-debuts-a-new-tool-to-help-people-better-manage-their-business-and-personal-relationships/">At long last, a personal CRM?</a> </strong>I don’t want to get your hopes up, as building a personal CRM has been a white whale in startupland for some time. But Clay, a startup that just raised $8 million, has put together what TechCrunch calls “a system designed to help you be more thoughtful with the people in your life.” Please let it be good. I need help.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/alpaca-raises-50m-to-rapidly-scale-its-equities-trading-api-business/">Alpaca proves that embedded fintech is still hot:</a> </strong>TechCrunch has covered Alpaca a few times in recent years, both when it raised capital and when we were delving more deeply into the world of API-delivered startups. Today the company announced a $50 million Series B, a partnership with Plaid and support for crypto trading. Alpaca’s work to provide other fintechs with embedded equities trading appears to be going well.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/thatch-using-3m-round-to-put-travel-creators-on-the-map/"><strong>How does one become a travel influencer?</strong></a><strong> </strong>I don’t know. But if you become one, Thatch wants you to be able to better monetize your recommendations. If you are currently a travel influencer, this is good news. If you were hoping that influencers would lose influence in the coming years, this is not.</li>
<li>To cap us off today, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ola-electric-in-talks-to-raise-at-over-2-5-billion-valuation/">Ola Electric is looking to raise between $250 million and $500 million</a></strong>. That’s a huge chunk of change. The deal has yet to close, but our early reporting indicates that Ola’s electric vehicle business is about to be more than flush. “Falcon Edge Capital is in advanced talks to lead the round, which values Ola Electric between $2.75 billion to $3.5 billion,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li>Plus, over the weekend I wrote about <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/28/the-remote-work-argument-has-already-been-won-by-startups/">why startups are going to win the battle to set the tone</a></strong> regarding remote work, in case you wanted to give that a read.</li>

<h2>How Amazon EC2 grew from a notion into a foundational element of cloud computing</h2>
<p>In August 2006, AWS activated its EC2 cloud-based virtual computer, a milestone in the cloud infrastructure giant&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really can’t overstate what Amazon was able to accomplish,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>In the 15 years since, EC2 has enabled clients of any size to test and run their own applications on AWS&#8217; virtual machines.</p>
<p>To learn more about a fundamental technological shift that &#8220;would help fuel a whole generation of startups,&#8221; Ron interviewed EC2 VP Dave Brown, who built and led the Amazon EC2 front-end team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Square&#8217;s popular <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/invoices/features">free invoicing software</a> is becoming the company&#8217;s next big subscription service. The company is poised to announce a paid subscription offering called <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/invoices-plus">Invoices Plus</a>, which will offer sellers a set of advanced features, including some that had previously been available with the free service. The service itself had been quietly introduced to individual sellers, but has not yet been publicly announced.</p>
<p>Some sellers who were already using Square Invoices were recently alerted to the upcoming changes via email.</p>
<p>In the announcement shared with some sellers (the details of which can also be viewed <a href="https://www.sellercommunity.com/t5/General-Discussion/Thoughts-on-Invoices-Plus-announcement/m-p/293789">here</a> on a Square Seller Community forum), the new subscription will include a series of features that were released in the past year as part of a limited trial.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JcZbmxI6eA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">Square to buy &#8216;buy now, pay later&#8217; giant Afterpay in $29B deal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Square to buy &#8216;buy now, pay later&#8217; giant Afterpay in $29B deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/embed/#?secret=JcZbmxI6eA" data-secret="JcZbmxI6eA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This includes multi-package estimates, custom invoice templates and custom invoice fields. These will now become a part of Invoices Plus, as will two other features: the ability to automatically convert accepted estimates to invoices and the ability to build milestone-based schedules (three-plus installment invoices). Square&#8217;s announcement said it will introduce a &#8220;trial&#8221; button next to these features in the Square Invoices software to alert customers to the upcoming capabilities (see below).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195884" style="width: 1740px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195884" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2195884 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-4.30.41-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1730" height="290" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-4.30.41-PM.jpg 1730w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-4.30.41-PM.jpg?resize=150,25 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-4.30.41-PM.jpg?resize=300,50 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-4.30.41-PM.jpg?resize=768,129 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-4.30.41-PM.jpg?resize=680,114 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-4.30.41-PM.jpg?resize=1536,257 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-4.30.41-PM.jpg?resize=50,8 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1730px) 100vw, 1730px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195884" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Square website</p></div></p>
<p>Square&#8217;s free invoicing software will not go away, the announcement noted. Sellers will be able to send unlimited invoices for free, as well as estimates and contracts, with the free plan. Free users will also be able to use invoice tracking, reminders and reporting tools.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The free plan has historically relied on <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/invoices">processing fees</a> to generate revenue. At present, this is 2.9% + $0.30 per invoice paid online by check or debit card plus a 1% fee per ACH transaction, per Square&#8217;s website. (Fees are slightly lower on in-person transactions and slightly higher for &#8220;card on file&#8221; transactions.) Pricing for the new, paid subscription has not yet been publicly announced.</p>
<p>A Square employee had explained the reasoning behind the change on the community forum site. They noted that many of Square&#8217;s other products &#8212; like Square Online, Appointments, Square for Retail and Square for Restaurants &#8212; also offer both a free and paid tier. And although Square charges processing fees for Square Invoices, they aren&#8217;t enough to fuel its product development. With Invoices Plus, they said, the company aims to compete more directly with paid invoicing apps and products and the more advanced features those products offer.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Square confirmed to TechCrunch Invoices Plus is a software subscription the company plans to announce shortly. But the company didn&#8217;t want to share more details until the news is official.</p>
<p>References to the new subscription have also already made their way to the Square app&#8217;s code, where they were spotted by iOS developer <a href="https://thetapedrive.com/">Steve Moser</a>. The code indicates users who previously used some of the paid-only features will be able to still use them for the time being. But as the announcement also noted, sellers would not be able to use the paid features for free the next time they&#8217;re creating new files with Square Invoices.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195856" style="width: 2057px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195856" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2195856 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SrNhjOlE.jpg" alt="" width="2047" height="842" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SrNhjOlE.jpg 2047w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SrNhjOlE.jpg?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SrNhjOlE.jpg?resize=300,123 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SrNhjOlE.jpg?resize=768,316 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SrNhjOlE.jpg?resize=680,280 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SrNhjOlE.jpg?resize=1536,632 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SrNhjOlE.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2047px) 100vw, 2047px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195856" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Steve Moser</p></div></p>
<p>The new service arrived shortly after Square announced earnings, where it noted its seller business <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/square-posts-upbeat-profits-while-also-announcing-29-billion-deal-for-afterpay-11627863684">brought in $1.31 billion in revenue </a>(out of the total of $4.68 billion) and $585 million of gross profit in the second quarter, driven in part by continued strong online growth. The company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">announced</a> its plan to acquire the buy now, pay later giant Afterpay in a $29 billion deal, speaking to its interest in chasing the broader payments market. The deal also offers Square a way to connect its different products by allowing Afterpay customers to pay their monthly installments through Square&#8217;s Cash App, the company said.</p>
<p>An integration between Square and Afterpay is something that could be seen further down the road, as well, one could imagine. That&#8217;s something <a href="https://www.sellercommunity.com/t5/General-Discussion/How-do-I-do-instore-afterpay-purchases-using-square-as-my-POS-or/td-p/73933">Square also hinted toward</a> in a response to another seller on its community forum site, where a rep updated an older answer to share news of the acquisition, adding Square didn&#8217;t &#8220;have integration timelines to share at the moment.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adolescence is a turbulent period and its challenges are being exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Even in the best of times, teens dealing with personal and school problems might have trouble talking about them. New Zealand-based startup <a href="https://www.komodowellbeing.com/">Komodo</a> is a student well-being platform that wants to give students a place to communicate with staff, while providing schools with data to help them spot and address issues like depression or bullying.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 by Chris Bacon, Matt Goodson and Jack Wood, the startup announced today it has raised $1.8 million NZD (about $1.26 million) in seed funding led by Folklore Ventures, with participation from Icehouse Ventures and Flying Fox Ventures. Individual investors included employee engagement platform Culture Amp co-founder Rod Hamilton; Chloe Hamman, Culture Amp’s director of people science; leaders from learning platform Education Perfect; and Kristi Grant, the director of people experience at Auror.</p>

<p>Some of Komodo’s clients and partners in New Zealand and Australia include Marist College Ashgrove in Queensland; St. Andrew’s College in Christchurch; the Australian Boarding Schools Association (ABSA); Independent Schools of New Zealand; and the Council of British International Schools.</p>
<p>Komodo was originally created to monitor the well-being of youth athletes, based on research Bacon performed while earning a Ph.D. at the University of Canterbury. A lot of its clients were schools, and that’s when the team began to expand Komodo’s scope.</p>
<p>“The draw for us was witnessing specific examples,” Wood told TechCrunch. “We had schools coming back to us saying ‘we’ve got a kid that’s been bullied for the past three months who hasn’t even remotely felt confident to approach a staff member and start talking about it. We’ve finally seen that come up in Komodo and they feel happy they have a confidential channel to voice that concern.’”</p>

<p>Komodo has a web application and a mobile app, which is what most students use. The platform can be customized by schools and includes psychologist-designed surveys and questions about topics like how students feel about going to school, socialization and relationships or major transitions like starting high school or preparing for university. The amount of time students check into Komodo depends on their school. At some it’s once a week, others once every two weeks or month. Schools use the platform differently based on their environment — for example, if they’re learning remotely, they may do more frequent check-ins.</p>
<p>For schools, data collected from surveys can help them see trends emerge and catch potential problems earlier, like cyberbullying. Before implementing Komodo, its founders say some schools did well-being surveys a few times per year, but many of them relied on staff and teachers’ intuition — for example, if a student who is typically outgoing suddenly becomes withdrawn. Komodo gives them a more efficient way to identify and address issues, though Wood and Bacon emphasize that it’s not meant to replace person-to-person interactions.</p>
<p>“Ultimately our bigger vision is facilitating and getting well-being support to students as early as possible,” said Bacon. The founders have spent a lot of time talking with Culture Amp’s Hamilton “about how it’s really important that the individuals you’re providing data to can actually understand and use it on a regular basis,” he added. “The key part for us [is] to provide visibility and psychologists who can come in and support [school staff] even more.”</p>
<p>Komodo’s seed funding will be used to add more psychologists to its in-house team, develop the platform and expand into more schools in Australia and New Zealand before other markets, including the United States.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">There has been significant hype around Latin America’s startup success. For good reason, too: Startups have raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/">$9.3 billion</a> in just the first half of 2021, almost double the amount in all of 2020, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/like-the-us-a-two-tier-venture-capital-market-is-emerging-in-latin-america/">mega-rounds</a> are a growing trend.</p>
<p>But while the industry hails the rise of the region’s ecosystem and its growing fleet of <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/latin-america-unicorn-startups/?utm_source=cb_daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20210802&amp;utm_content=intro&amp;utm_term=content&amp;utm_source=cb_daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20210802">unicorns</a>, Latin America’s startup story has a far longer past. And it’s one we should keep in mind as entrepreneurs and investors around the world forge the region’s future.</p>
<p>People often ask me: How are consumers different in Brazil? How does the Peruvian market behave compared to the United States? These questions don’t really see each country for its inherent value, but instead gear people up to expect the unexpected from a historically economically disadvantaged region.</p>
<p>In fact, the evolution of business shares far more similarities across countries than we might expect. Latin America’s market has evolved over a very long time — as long as Silicon Valley and any other hub. This region has a global outlook, spectacular universities, a diverse population and an army of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			It’s important for investors outside of Latin America to get involved in fundraising at earlier stages, when founders need extra support from everyone around.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That’s why the unicorns and megadeals should come as no surprise: They’re the natural evolution of the ecosystem, of more capital generating more success after years of hard work.</p>
<p>As Latin America has grown, competition has grown even more intense in the United States. VCs have more money than ever, and it’s getting increasingly expensive to invest in North America. So they’re looking to diversify their investments with high-potential opportunities abroad. Big funds are now dedicating resources to exclusively targeting Latin America, from <a href="https://www.latinamericafund.com/team">SoftBank</a> creating a region-specific fund, to Sequoia saying it will <a href="https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/the-latin-american-startup-opportunity-46ace259777f">pay more attention</a> to the region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These incoming investors must bring more than money to ensure that entrepreneurship continues to grow in a healthy manner, rather than set it off balance. Investors should bring a local strategy that makes them an asset to Latin America’s startup ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Investors should look for younger markets</h2>
<p>Most Latin American companies reaching unicorn status and going public now were started around 2012. This is not very different from the timeline of businesses in other markets such as the United States. For instance, e-commerce giant MercadoLibre launched in Argentina around the time eBay was emerging.</p>
<p>What this tells us is that foreign investors would do well to keep a sharp eye on emerging opportunities beyond heavily covered markets like Brazil and Mexico. There is a huge opportunity to do what local investors did in Brazil and Mexico years ago, and play a significant role in the next chapter of countries with blossoming markets like Colombia, Peru or Uruguay.</p>
<h2>U.S. investors remain shy</h2>
<p>The amount of VC capital being funneled into Latin American startups has surged since 2017, with angel investment close behind. However, much of this investment comes from local and regional investors. Every top university in Brazil has a pool of angels. Investors in the Andean region cover Peru, Chile and Colombia. If today’s ecosystem is flourishing, it’s largely because native investors are lighting the spark.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. investor presence at the early stages is still low and risk averse. It’s much harder for a pre-seed or seed startup to get foreign investor interest than when they’ve already reached Series A or B. Investors also tend to come in on an ad hoc basis or as outliers brought about by a mutual contact. Foreign investors are the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p>It’s important for investors outside of Latin America to get involved in fundraising at earlier stages, when founders need extra support from everyone around. Investors should be pursuing a long-term strategy that will bring more consistency to the local ecosystem as a whole.</p>
<h2>Money is not enough, investors should bring dedicated resources</h2>
<p>Your contribution as an investor is largely about the resources you can offer. That’s especially challenging for a foreigner who has less of an understanding of the local industry and lacks a network and people on the ground.</p>
<p>While investors may say their your regular value offering is enough — network and U.S. customers — in truth, this won’t necessarily be of much use. Your hiring network might not be ideal for a Latin American company, and your thorough understanding of the U.S. market might not reflect developments in Latin America.</p>
<p>Remember that the region has a plethora of VC organizations who have worked with local startups over the course of a decade. Latin America is a very welcoming and open market, and local investors and accelerators will happily work with foreign investors, including in deal-sharing opportunities.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to create incentives within the ecosystem, which — like in the United States — largely means matching founders with unique opportunities. In North America, this often happens organically, because people are on the ground and actively engaged with what’s happening in the region, from networking events, to awards, and grants and partnership opportunities.</p>
<p>To create this in Latin America, foreign investors need to dedicate a team and money to their regional commitments. They will have to understand the local industry and be available to mentor founders with diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>In my experience helping EA, Pinterest and Facebook land in Latin America, we always had someone on the ground or working remotely but fully dedicated to the region. We had people focused on localizing the product, and we had research teams studying similarities and differences in user behavior. That’s how corporations land their products; it’s how VCs should land their money.</p>
<h2>Only disrupt when it adds value</h2>
<p>The idea is for foreign investors to strike a balance locally while creating disruptions when it helps startups look outward rather than attempting to overhaul steady, positive internal growth. That can mean encouraging companies to incorporate in the United States to make it easier for investors from anywhere to invest or preparing the company to go global. Local investors can help investors new to the region understand the balance of things that should or shouldn’t be disrupted.</p>
<p>Don’t be surprised when Latin America’s apparent &#8220;boom&#8221; starts happening in other emerging markets like Africa and Asia. This isn’t about a secret hack coming in from the outside. It’s just about creating the right environment for local talent to flourish and ensuring it maintains healthy growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For more than a year now, <a href="http://zoom.com">Zoom</a> has been on a mission to transform from an application into a platform. To that end it made three announcements last year: Zoom Apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/zoom-introduces-new-sdk-to-help-developers-tap-into-video-services/">development tools</a>, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/zoom-launches-its-events-platform-and-marketplace-brings-apps-to-your-calls/">Zoom Apps marketplace</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/zoom-launches-100m-zoom-apps-investment-fund/">a $100 million development fund</a> to invest in some of the more promising startups building tools on top of their platform. Today, at the closing bell, the company announced it has made its first round of investments.</p>
<p>Ross Mayfield, product lead for Zoom Apps and integrations, spoke to TechCrunch about the round of investments. &#8220;We&#8217;re in the process of creating this ecosystem. We felt it important, particularly to focus on the seed stage and A stage of partnering with entrepreneurs to create great things on this platform. And I think what you see in the first batch of more than a dozen investments is representative of something that&#8217;s going to be a significant ongoing undertaking,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>He said while they aren&#8217;t announcing exact investment amounts, they are writing checks for between $250,000 and $2.5 million. They are teaming with other investment partners, rather than leading the rounds, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t working with these startups using internal resources for advice and executive backing, beyond the money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every one of these investments has an executive or senior sponsor within the company. So there&#8217;s another person inside that knows the lay of the land, can help them advance and spend more personal time with them,&#8221; Mayfield said.</p>
<p>The company is also running several Zoom chat channels for the startups receiving investments to learn from one another and the Zoom Apps team. &#8220;We have a shared chat channel between the startup and my team. We have a channel called Announcements and a channel called Help, and another one that the startups created called Community,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Every week they use these channels to hold a developer office hour, a business office hour (which Mayfield runs) and a community hour, where the startups can gather and talk amongst themselves about whatever they want.</p>
<p>Among the specific categories receiving funding are collaboration and productivity, community and charity, DE&amp;I and PeopleOps, and gaming and entertainment. In the collaboration and productivity category, <a href="https://www.warmly.ai/">Warmly</a> is a sales tool that provides background and information about each person participating in the meeting ahead of time, while allowing the meeting organizer to create customized Zoom backgrounds for each event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another is <a href="https://fathom.video/">Fathom</a>, which alleviates the need to take notes during a meeting, but it&#8217;s more than recording and transcription. &#8220;It gives you this really simple interface where you can just tag moments. And then, as a result you have this transcript of the video recording, and you can click on those tagged moments as highlights, and then share a clip of the meeting highlights to Salesforce, Slack and other tools,&#8221; Mayfield said.</p>
<p>Pledge enables individuals or organizations to request and collect donations inside a Zoom meeting instantly, and Canvas is a hiring and interview tool that helps companies build diverse teams with data that helps them set and meet DEI goals.</p>
<p>These and the other companies represent the first tranche of investments from this fund, and Mayfield says the company intends to continue looking for startups using the Zoom platform to build their startup or integrate with Zoom.</p>
<p>He says that every company starts as a feature, then becomes a product and then aspires to be a line of products. The trick is getting there.  The goal of the investment program and the entire set of Zoom Apps tools is about helping these companies take the first step.</p>
<p>&#8220;The art of being an entrepreneur is working with that risk in the absence of resources and pushing at the frontier of what you know.&#8221; Zoom is trying to be a role model, a mentor and an investor on that journey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tryprive.com/">Prive</a>, a months-old, San Francisco-based startup founded by two former Uber product managers, just raised $1.7 million in pre-seed funding to create what it describes as a far more customizable e-commerce subscriptions platform for D2C brands.</p>
<p>The round was co-led by Patrick Chung and Brandon Farwell at XFund and Ben Ling from Bling Capital, with participation from Defy Partners, Halogen Ventures and Uber executives.</p>
<p>Founded by Claudia Laurie and Alex Craciun &#8212; who both spent two-and-a-half years at Uber and decided, based on their learnings about pricing and incentives, to leave the company earlier this year &#8212; Prive aims to better enable small retailers to compete with behemoths like Amazon.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="n7iZt83lhY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/5-predictions-for-the-future-of-e-commerce/">5 predictions for the future of e-commerce</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 predictions for the future of e-commerce&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/5-predictions-for-the-future-of-e-commerce/embed/#?secret=n7iZt83lhY" data-secret="n7iZt83lhY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The broad idea is that by plugging into existing APIs from Shopify and other e-commerce platforms, Prive can form an opinion that it sells to merchants about what customers tend to buy on a recurrent basis. Maybe it sees that people who buy razors also tend to buy toothbrushes on a similar cadence, for example. It passes that information along, then helps the brand create more customized, and flexible, offerings so that their shoppers are presented with items they might want, as well as can more easily cancel items that are starting to pile up.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market opportunity is huge, and the existing [e-commerce subscription] tools are just scratching the surface,&#8221; notes Laurie. Indeed, according to the group eMarketer, subscription e-commerce sales have grown 41% from the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and it foresees that 3% of U.S. retail e-commerce sales will come from subscriptions this year, totaling <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/more-us-consumers-ecommerce-subscription-models">$27.67 billion</a>. That&#8217;s up from $10 billion in just two years.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot has yet to be built, which is where the pre-seed funding comes in. Right now, Prive is a seven-person team with some serious competition, namely from Recharge, a seven-year-old, Santa Monica, California-based subscription e-commerce company that <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/recharge-raises-277m-to-plug-into-merchant-subscription-programs/">in May raised $277 million</a> in growth capital at a post-money valuation of $2.1 billion. As of that announcement, Recharge had roughly 330 employees and was fueling the subscription service for what it said was 15,000 merchants and 20 million subscribers worldwide.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other rivals include nine-year-old Bold Commerce (it has raised <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/powering-shopper-transactions-bold-commerce-bags-27m-series-b/">$44 million</a> altogether), and 10-year-old Chargebee, which has raised around <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/chargebee">$220 million</a> over the years, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>&#8220;E-commerce &#8216;subscription&#8217; is an incredibly hot buzzword,&#8221; Craciun acknowledges. But he also thinks today&#8217;s current product offerings are just scratching the service.</p>
<p>Clearly, investors are willing to gamble that he&#8217;s right, and that Prive could be a team that proves it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Current tools can create more headaches than they actually solve,&#8221; says Craciun. &#8220;There is a lot of rigidity in today&#8217;s subscriptions that makes it very difficult to identify the right recurring mix of offerings. We&#8217;re here to break down that mental model.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Rachael runs a bakery in New York. She set up shop in 2010 with her personal savings and contributions from family and friends, and the business has grown. But Rachael now needs additional financing to open another store. So how does she finance her expansion plans?</p>
<p>Because of stringent requirements, extensive application processes and long turnaround times, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) like Rachael’s bakery seldom qualify for traditional bank loans. That&#8217;s when alternative lenders — who offer short and easy applications, flexible underwriting and quick turnaround times — come to the rescue.</p>
<p>Alternative lending is any lending that occurs outside of a conventional financial institution. These kinds of lenders offer different types of loans such as lines of credit, microloans and equipment financing, and they use technology to process and underwrite applications quickly. However, given their flexible requirements, they usually charge higher interest rates than traditional lenders.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Securitization is another cost-effective option for raising debt. Lenders can pool the loans they have extended and segregate them into tranches based on credit risk, principal amount and time period.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But how do these lenders raise funds to bridge the financing gap for SMBs?</p>
<p>As with all businesses, these firms have two major sources of capital: equity and debt. Alternative lenders typically raise equity funding from venture capital, private equity firms or IPOs, and their debt capital is typically raised from sources such as traditional asset-based bank lending, corporate debt and securitizations.</p>
<p>According to Naren Nayak, SVP and treasurer of Credibly, equity generally constitutes 5% to 25% of capital for alternative lenders, while debt can be between 75% and 95%. &#8220;A third source of capital or funding is also available to alternative lenders — whole loan sales — whereby the loans (or merchant cash advance receivables) are sold to institutions on a forward flow basis. This is a “balance-sheet light” funding solution and an efficient way to transfer credit risk for lenders,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at each of these options in detail.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195705" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195705" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2195705" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Figure-1.png" alt="Funding sources for alternative lenders.

<h2>Equity capital</h2>
<p>Venture capital or private equity funding is one of the major sources of financing for alternative lenders. The alternative lending industry is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/05/trillion-dollar-alternative-lending-industry-is-a-vc-gold-mine/">said to be</a> a “gold mine” for venture capital investments. While it is difficult for such companies to receive credit from traditional banks because of their stringent requirements in the initial stages, once the founders have shown a commitment by investing their own money, VC and PE firms usually step in.</p>
<p>However, VC and PE firms can be expensive sources of capital — their investment dilutes the ownership and control in the company. Plus, obtaining venture capital is a long, involved and competitive process.</p>
<p>Alternative lenders that have achieved good growth rates and scaled their operations have another option: An IPO lets them quickly raise large amounts of money while providing a lucrative exit for early investors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Debt capital</h2>
<p>Once the business is in good shape, banks can be more willing to lend money through loans and revolving credit facilities. Term loans are the financing provided by traditional banks, credit unions and small business administration (SBA) lenders. Although they offer low interest rates and long payment terms, they require several indicators of security, such as substantial track records and collateral, which nascent alternative lenders do not have.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Popular instant messaging app Telegram has joined the elite club of apps that have been downloaded over 1 billion times globally, according to Sensor Tower.</p>
<p>The Dubai-headquartered app, which was launched in late 2013, surpassed the milestone on Friday, the mobile insight firm told TechCrunch. As is the case with the app&#8217;s chief rival, WhatsApp, India is the largest market for Telegram. The world&#8217;s second-largest internet market represents approximately 22% of its lifetime installs, Sensor Tower said.</p>
<p>&#8220;[India is] followed by Russia and Indonesia, which represent about 10% and 8% of [all installs], respectively. The app&#8217;s installs accelerated in 2021, reaching about 214.7 million installs in the first half of 2021, up 61% year-over-year from 133 million in H1 2020,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the number of installs doesn&#8217;t equate to the app&#8217;s active userbase. Telegram had about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/telegram-to-launch-an-ad-platform-as-it-approaches-500-million-users/">500 million monthly active users as of early this year</a>, for instance. But the surge in downloads, which coincides with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/controversial-whatsapp-policy-change-hit-with-consumer-law-complaint-in-europe/">WhatsApp&#8217;s poor handling of relaying its privacy policies to its massive userbase</a>, nonetheless suggests that Telegram has enjoyed some additional attention in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Telegram, which earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/telegram-raises-150m-from-mubadala-and-abu-dhabi-cp-via-pre-ipo-convertible-bonds/">raised over $1 billion</a>, is the fifteenth app worldwide to have been downloaded 1 billion times or more, Sensor Tower told TechCrunch. Other apps on the list include WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Spotify and Netflix, according to Sensor Tower. (Mobile research firms don&#8217;t track the installs of most Google apps that come pre-installed on Android devices.)</p>
<p>Telegram didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hair loss resulting from chemotherapy is one of the most recognizable side effects in all of medicine, and for many is an unwanted public announcement of their condition and treatment. <a href="https://www.luminatemed.com/">Luminate Medical</a> may have a solution in a medical wearable that prevents the chemical cocktail from tainting hair follicles, preventing the worst of the loss and perhaps relegating this highly visible condition to the past.</p>
<p>When Luminate CEO Aaron Hannon and his co-founder Bárbara Oliveira were asking patients and doctors about areas of cancer treatment that they could perhaps innovate in, &#8220;we were just astonished at how much hair loss dominated the conversation,&#8221; said Hannon. &#8220;So from then on out we&#8217;ve just been laser focused on making that something that doesn&#8217;t exist any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>When a patient is undergoing chemotherapy, the cancer-inhibiting drugs course through their entire body — anywhere the blood goes. This has a variety of side effects, like weakness and nausea, and on a longer time scale hair loss occurs as the substances affect the follicles. Luminate&#8217;s solution, developed in partnership with the National University of Ireland Galway, is to prevent the blood from reaching those cells in the first place.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195708" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-render.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195708" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2195708" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-render.png" alt="Image of a woman wearing the Luminate headset." width="449" height="545" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-render.png 449w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-render.png?resize=124,150 124w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-render.png?resize=247,300 247w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-render.png?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2195708" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Luminate</p></div></p>
<p>The device that effects this is a sort of mechanized compression garment for the head. If that sounds a bit sinister, don&#8217;t worry — it uses only soft materials to achieve the pressure; Hannon says that it isn&#8217;t uncomfortable and pressure is carefully monitored.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also no risk of damage from lack of blood flow in those cells. &#8220;Compression therapy has been really well studied,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are years of literature around how long you can apply these therapies without damaging the cells. There&#8217;s a certain amount of mechanical engineering involved in making it both comfortable and effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>The patient wears the cap during and after the whole chemo session. By restricting blood flow to the skin of the scalp only, it allows the drugs to flow unimpeded to wherever the tumor or cancer site is while saving the hair follicles from damage.</p>
<p>Tests have been done on animals, which saw strong hair retention of around 80% with no adverse effects — and while full human trials are something that will need some time and approval to set up, initial tests of the headset&#8217;s bloodflow-blocking effects on healthy patients showed that it works exactly as expected on people as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really excited about the efficacy of this therapy because it works with lots of hair types,&#8221; said Hannon. That&#8217;s a real consideration, since a tech that only worked with short hair, straight hair or some other subset of hairstyles would exclude far too many people.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195701" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-app.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195701" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2195701" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-app.jpg" alt="Luminate's app showing how long is left in therapy for the user." width="1024" height="616" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-app.jpg 1333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-app.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-app.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-app.jpg?resize=768,462 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-app.jpg?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/luminate-app.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2195701" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Luminate / Wild Island Pictures</p></div></p>
<p>As for competition, although there are some new treatments that cool the scalp instead of compressing it, Hannon noted that the most money is spent by far on wigs. An average of a thousand dollars per patient who opts for a wig means there&#8217;s considerable leeway for a device in that neighborhood.</p>
<p>Although hair loss is considered a medical condition by many insurance companies and other methods of reimbursement, and wigs are often covered, it will take time and lots of evidence to get Luminate&#8217;s device approved for those processes. But the team is confident that at around $1,500, the device is within the means of many as long as other costs are being picked up by insurance. People do, after all, spend that much and more not just on wigs but on other hair retention products and methods. If there was a checkbox for &#8220;don&#8217;t lose hair&#8221; on the chemo forms with a $1,500 price tag, a whole lot of people would check it without a second thought.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195703" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/medical-device-aims.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195703" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2195703 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/medical-device-aims.jpg" alt="Cofounders Bárbara Oliveira (left) and Aaron Hannon." width="768" height="514" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/medical-device-aims.jpg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/medical-device-aims.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/medical-device-aims.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/medical-device-aims.jpg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/medical-device-aims.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2195703" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Luminate</p></div></p>
<p>Ultimately, however, Luminate wants to be able to offer the device also to those who can&#8217;t afford the cost out of pocket, so they are progressing toward FDA approval and a U.S. launch, with Europe and others to come.</p>
<p>So far Luminate, just graduating from Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 batch, has been lucky enough to operate on funds provided through grants from the Irish government, which are of course non-dilutive. While more capital will almost certainly be required come time for scaling and international launch, right now the team is focused on getting the device into the hands (and onto the heads) of its first set of patients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok parent company ByteDance seems to be looking to one-up Facebook anywhere it can. After <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/TikTok-overtakes-Facebook-as-world-s-most-downloaded-app">taking over the mantle</a> of most-downloaded social media app in the world with TikTok, ByteDance is coming for Facebook&#8217;s moonshot, buying up its own virtual reality headset maker called Pico.</p>

Pico had raised some $62 million in venture funding from Chinese firms, including a $37 million Series B in March. Like Oculus, they create both hardware and software for their VR devices. Unlike Oculus, they have a substantial presence in China. Pico may not hold the same name recognition as Oculus or HTC, but the company is a top VR hardware maker, selling to consumer audiences in China and enterprise customers in the Western world.</p>
<p>With Pico finding its home now at ByteDance, two of the world&#8217;s largest virtual reality brands now reside inside social media companies. Ironically, many of the company&#8217;s North American customers I&#8217;ve chatted with over the years seem to have at least partially opted for Pico headsets over Oculus hardware due to general weariness of Facebook&#8217;s data and ads-dependent business models, which they fear Oculus will eventually become a larger part of.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the virtual reality market has been slow out of the gate, but Facebook has blazed the trail for the technology, dumping billions of dollars into an ecosystem that traditional investors have largely seemed uninterested in, in recent years.</p>
<p>Without knowing broad terms of the deal (I&#8217;m asking around), it&#8217;s hard to determine whether this is a moment of resurgence for VR or another sign of a contracting market. What seems most likely to me is that ByteDance is indeed interested in building out a consumer VR brand and is aiming to follow in Facebook&#8217;s footsteps closely while learning from their missteps and capitalizing on their contributions to the ecosystem. Whether the company solely focuses on the consumer markets in China or loosely pursues enterprise clients stateside as well is a big question ByteDance will have to address.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a bid to expand its classical music offering, Apple today announced that it has acquired Primephonic. The Amsterdam-based service, which launched in 2014, will bring a laser focus on a music genre that’s been sorely lacking in Apple Music&#8217;s generalized approach to streaming.</p>
<p>The service will effectively be discontinued as a standalone offering as it’s absorbed into the broader Apple Music platform. On September 7, Primephonic will shut down for good, while Apple readies the 2022 launch of a classical music app based on its own streaming service.</p>
<p>“Artists love the Primephonic service and what we’ve done in classical, and now we have the ability to join with Apple to deliver the absolute best experience to millions of listeners,” Primephonic co-founder and CEO Thomas Steffens said <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-acquires-classical-music-streaming-service-primephonic/">in a release issued by Apple</a>. “We get to bring classical music to the mainstream and connect a new generation of musicians with the next generation of audience.”</p>
<p>According to an interview with Primephonic’s CTO published last year, the service has launched in 150 countries. It also appears to have an older demographic than more generalized streaming services.</p>
<p>“Most of our users are age 55 plus and are highly educated and relatively well off,” Henrique Boregio <a href="https://mixpanel.com/blog/primephonic-product-roadmap-prioritization/">told Mixpanel</a> in 2020. “We joke in the office that we don’t know whether you start liking classical music and then you become wealthy, or if it’s the other way around.”</p>
<p>Apple notes of the upcoming offering, “Apple Music Classical fans will get a dedicated experience with the best features of Primephonic, including better browsing and search capabilities by composer and by repertoire, detailed displays of classical music metadata, plus new features and benefits.”</p>
<p>While the new classical service is being built out, the company is offering an olive branch to existing Primephonic users in the form of six free months of Apple Music.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram will begin prodding users to share their birthday with the service, if they haven&#8217;t already done so. The company today <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/asking-people-for-their-birthday-on-instagram/">announced</a> it will now start popping up a notification that asks you to add your birthday to &#8220;personalize your experience.&#8221; But the prompt can only be dismissed a handful of times before becoming a requirement. The move is a part of Instagram&#8217;s larger goal to create new safety features aimed at younger users, the company explains. This includes the teen privacy protections <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">introduced</a> earlier this year, as well as Instagram&#8217;s longer-term plan to launch a version of its service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/consumer-groups-and-child-development-experts-petition-facebook-to-drop-instagram-for-kids-plan/">aimed</a> at users under the age of 13.</p>
<p>This March, Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/instagram-adds-new-teen-safety-tools-as-competition-with-tiktok-heats-up/">rolled out new features</a> that made it more difficult for adults to contact teens through its app. Then in July, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">announced</a> a larger series of changes to the default settings for new users under the age of 16. It will now default these users&#8217; accounts to &#8220;private&#8221; and limit their accounts from being suggested elsewhere in the app. It also now restricts adults whose accounts are flagged as &#8220;potentially suspicious&#8221; from being able to reach out to other minors or interact with their posts.</p>
<p>Starting this week, Instagram says users who have not yet shared their birthday will begin to see pop-up notifications when they open the Instagram app.</p>
<p>These notifications will appear a handful of times, but at some point, users will no longer be able to dismiss the message by tapping &#8220;Not Now.&#8221; Instead, everyone will ultimately be required to share their birthday to continue to use Instagram.</p>
<p>The company will also now request you to share your birthday information when you come across a post with a warning screen. These screens, which hide content that&#8217;s flagged as sensitive or graphic, are not new. But Instagram has never before asked for a user&#8217;s birthday before displaying the hidden content.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195698" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195698" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2195698" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-hidden-content.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="415" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-hidden-content.jpg 1660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-hidden-content.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-hidden-content.jpg?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-hidden-content.jpg?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-hidden-content.jpg?resize=680,415 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-hidden-content.jpg?resize=1536,936 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-hidden-content.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195698" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>The birthday entry form itself is not complex. You simply scroll to choose the month, day and year of your birthday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, kids are commonly known to lie on these entry forms in order to bypass restrictions when signing up for apps. On this front, Instagram has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/age-verification/">developed</a> AI technology to help it identify accounts were kids may have lied. For instance, it may be able to infer someone&#8217;s birthday based on comments left on &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; posts, where the user&#8217;s age may be referenced. The company also hints at further plans in this area, noting how it will later require users to verify their age when Facebook&#8217;s technology determines a mismatch between the age the user submitted and what appears to be their real age, based on other signals.</p>
<p>That technology is still in the &#8220;early stages,&#8221; says Instagram, but will involve a menu of options that will allow someone to verify their age.</p>
<p>The need to have users&#8217; birthdays on hand isn&#8217;t only meant to power the recently launched teen protection features. Instagram is also working to bring its app to younger users &#8212; a decision that&#8217;s been met with a hostile response from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instagram-for-kids-facebook-wants-to-fix-its-preteen-problem-11617787802">legislators</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/consumer-groups-and-child-development-experts-petition-facebook-to-drop-instagram-for-kids-plan/">consumer advocacy groups</a> alike. In addition, age remains an important data point for ad targeting. Even as Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">pulled back</a> on the ability for marketers to target teens using interest data or their activity on other apps, it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">continue</a> to allow ad targeting based on age, gender and location across age groups.</p>

<p>The company is now one of several to have rolled out added protections for younger teen users, ahead of regulations that would force them to do so. Over the course of this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">YouTube and Google</a> have also announced changes to how younger teens can use their services and how they can be targeted by ads, in anticipation of a regulatory crackdown. While each has crafted its own set of teen safety features independently, the changes have largely addressed making the default settings for new teenage users more restrictive.</p>
<p>Instagram says the new birthday pop-up notifications will begin to appear this week on the mobile app and will continue to roll out over the weeks ahead to reach more users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than two weeks after its official launch, The Boring Company&#8217;s Loop system in Las Vegas had its first security breach.</p>
<p>On June 21, the morning of the final day of the International Beauty Show, an &#8220;unauthorized vehicle&#8221; joined the system&#8217;s fleet of Tesla taxis underground, emails between the Loop&#8217;s operations manager and a Clark County official show. The emails were obtained by TechCrunch under public records laws.</p>
<p>The emails provide new insight into the operations of the Loop beyond the intrusion, including the system&#8217;s surprising reliance on a non-Tesla electric vehicle, plans to allow Tesla vehicles to use its Autopilot driver assistance system and confirmation within company ranks that the technology is not autonomous.</p>
<p>The Boring Company (TBC) called the Las Vegas Metro Police to handle the intrusion. &#8220;The driver of the unauthorized vehicle was cooperative and eventually escorted out of the system,&#8221; reads one email.</p>
<p>While there were no injuries or fatalities as a result of the security breach, the incident could be embarrassing for TBC, which has touted the security and safety of its $53 million system to the LVCC.</p>
<p>According to a management agreement between TBC and the LVCC, the system is supposed to have &#8220;physical barriers [to] guard against entry of accidental, rogue, or otherwise unauthorized vehicles into the tunnels.&#8221; These include security gates on roadways into the system, and dozens of concrete bollards surrounding its ground-level stations.</p>
<p>Neither TBC nor LVCC responded to inquiries about the incident. TechCrunch will update the article if either party responds to questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Autopilot gets a chance</h2>
<p>The emails obtained by TechCrunch provide more than the exploits of a thrill-seeking trespasser.</p>
<p>The emails also detail plans by TBC to increase the number of Tesla vehicles in the LVCC Loop from 62 to 70, and to allow the use of Tesla Autopilot technologies. Until now, TBC has had to disable all driver assistance technologies on its vehicles, which are operated by human drivers.</p>
<p>The new scope of operations will require the use of seven active safety technologies — automatic emergency braking, front and side collision warnings, obstacle-aware acceleration, blind-spot monitoring, lane departure avoidance, emergency lane departure warning as well as two &#8220;full Autopilot&#8221; technologies: lane centering and traffic aware cruise control.</p>
<p>TBC&#8217;s justification for using Autopilot was set out in a letter to the Clark County Department of Building &amp; Fire Prevention in June, obtained by TechCrunch along with the emails.</p>
<p>TBC president Steve Davis wrote that disabling the features &#8220;actively removes a layer of safety,&#8221; from a &#8220;proven, road-legal technology.&#8221; Davis quoted Tesla&#8217;s Safety Report for the first quarter of 2021 that claims Tesla drivers operating with Autopilot experienced crashes at less than a quarter the rate of Tesla drivers operating without Autopilot or active safety features, per mile driven. &#8220;As demonstrated&#8230; disabling these features in Tesla vehicles increases the likelihood of an accident,&#8221; wrote Davis.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), however, last week opened a formal safety probe into the technology, following a number of crashes.</p>
<p>Jerry Stueve, the director of the building and fire protection in Clark County, replied in an email: &#8220;We will take this under consideration, although it may help in our evaluation of this request if you can better define the term &#8216;autodrive&#8217; and what it entails.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Agreed that the term &#8216;Autopilot&#8217; is often unclear and can mean many different things depending on the vehicle and scenario,&#8221; replied Davis. (In this, he apparently disagrees with his boss, Elon Musk, who has called criticism of the Autopilot name as misleading <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-defends-autopilot-against-criticism-misleading-name-accusations-2020-8?r=US&amp;IR=T">&#8220;idiotic.&#8221;</a>)</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;Agreed that the term &#8216;Autopilot&#8217; is often unclear and can mean many different things depending on the vehicle and scenario.&#8221; &#8211; Steve Davis, TBC					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>&#8220;These are not &#8216;autonomous&#8217; nor &#8216;self-driving&#8217; vehicles,&#8221; continued Davis. &#8220;The use of Tesla Autopilot and active safety features adds additional layers of safety while operating the vehicle, however the use of the features still requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take over the wheel at any moment.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Autopilot versus autonomous driving</h2>
<p>This distinction is key, as it appears to contradict what TBC has promised LVCC since it first pitched the Loop system. In its land use application in May 2019, prior to signing the construction construct, TBC wrote: &#8220;Tesla Autonomous Electric Vehicles (AEVs) will carry passengers in express, underground tunnels to three underground stations.&#8221;</p>
<p>A planning document in July 2019 stated: &#8220;Utilizing autonomous electric vehicles in underground tunnels is a unique transportation solution that will minimize disruptions and conflicts to existing buildings and transportation systems.&#8221; It has used similar language in applications ever since, including for a proposed Vegas-wide Loop with dozens of stations.</p>
<p>In January, TechCrunch obtained a management agreement between LVCC and TBC that stated: &#8220;[The LVCC] procured the People Mover System, in part, because of the ability for People Mover System vehicles to operate autonomously &#8230; The Agreement recognizes the intent for the System to move from drivers in the vehicles to autonomous operations and provides for a fee renegotiation, no later than December 31 2021, incorporating this expected transition in operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>That deadline now seems almost certain to be missed. In June, Stueve told Davis: &#8220;As stated early in the project, the approval of autonomous operation will require extensive scrutiny, testing and validation. This process could take a significant amount of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>In reply, Davis wrote: &#8220;I want to make sure that it is clear that we are not asking for autonomous or self-driving features/operations.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Humans in the Loop</h2>
<p>The problem is two-fold. One is that Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot system may not be able to operate completely without a driver for some time to come. The second, arguably more serious, challenge is that the Loop is heavily reliant on its drivers to meet the safety requirements for underground transportation systems, laid out in national standards. Passengers of such systems, whether monorails, subways or using electric cars, must be safe in the event of power outages, fires, floods and other emergencies.</p>
<p>The LVCC Loop&#8217;s basis of design document, obtained by TechCrunch along with the emails, states: &#8220;[Our] trained drivers serve as the system&#8217;s key layer of safety. In the event of an emergency, actions taken by drivers to direct passengers in the proper and safe directions are the primary risk mitigating responses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other documents obtained by TechCrunch from BFP confirm this. In the case of fire, the driver will &#8220;assist with deboarding passengers, and guide passengers on foot to the closest exit. Driver issues verbal instructions and may physically assist passengers.&#8221; As the driver leads passengers by walking ahead of them, they must &#8220;consistently look back to ensure every passenger is following closely behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drivers are responsible for assessing and responding to unruly or misbehaving passengers, and, in fact, for supervising the performance of the Autopilot itself, says TBC. &#8220;The [Loop] will have drivers, ensuring that there is always someone overseeing the use of active safety features who is ready to take over braking and steering as needed,&#8221; wrote Davis in June.</p>
<p>None of the dozens of documents or hundreds of emails obtained by TechCrunch, including those detailing the LVCC Loop&#8217;s future expansion, describe a path or timetable for TBC to move toward fully autonomous operation.</p>

<p>In response to a questionnaire on how the Loop will meet the American Society of Civil Engineers&#8217; safety principles for autonomous systems, TBC responded: &#8220;Criteria specific to autonomous operation are not applicable to the [LVCC Loop], as the system will have drivers to operate vehicles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether what TBC is telling Clark County, or what it is telling LVCC, is closer to how the Loop will operate in the future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if the Loop vehicles are not yet driverless, can the LVCC at least expect them all to be the latest Tesla models? Perhaps not.</p>
<p>Another requirement for the Loop is that it complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In an email to Clark County officials in July, a TBC executive noted that it was going to buy a non-Tesla ADA electric vehicle for the LVCC Loop.</p>
<p>Although the email did not specify the model, it has a low-range lead-acid battery with the same specification as the Tropos Motors Able electric utility vehicle. Neither Tropos nor TBC responded to inquiries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the consequences of rising CO2 levels in our atmosphere is that levels also rise proportionately in the ocean, harming wildlife and changing ecosystems. <a href="https://www.heimdalccu.com/">Heimdal</a> is a startup working to pull that CO2 back out at scale using renewable energy and producing carbon-negative industrial materials, including limestone for making concrete, in the process, and it has attracted significant funding even at its very early stage.</p>
<p>If the concrete aspect seems like a bit of a non sequitur, consider two facts: concrete manufacturing is estimated to produce as much as 8% OF all greenhouse gas emissions, and seawater is full of minerals used to make it. You probably wouldn&#8217;t make this connection unless you were in some related industry or discipline, but Heimdal founders Erik Millar and Marcus Lima did while they were working in their respective masters programs at Oxford. &#8220;We came out and did this straight away,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They both firmly believe that climate change is an existential threat to humanity, but were disappointed at the lack of permanent solutions to its many and various consequences across the globe. Carbon capture, Millar noted, is frequently a circular process, meaning it is captured only to be used and emitted again. Better than producing new carbons, sure, but why aren&#8217;t there more ways to permanently take them out of the ecosystem?</p>
<p>The two founders envisioned a new linear process that takes nothing but electricity and CO2-heavy seawater and produces useful materials that permanently sequester the gas. Of course, if it was as easy that, everyone would already be doing it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195687" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-founders.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195687" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2195687" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-founders.jpg" alt="Heimdal founders Marcus Lima (left) and Erik Millar sitting by a metal gate on stone steps.." width="1024" height="756" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-founders.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-founders.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-founders.jpg?resize=300,222 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-founders.jpg?resize=768,567 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-founders.jpg?resize=680,502 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-founders.jpg?resize=1536,1134 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-founders.jpg?resize=2048,1512 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-founders.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2195687" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Heimdal</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The carbon markets to make this economically viable have only just been formed,&#8221; said Millar. And the cost of energy has dropped through the floor as huge solar and wind installations have overturned decades-old power economies. With carbon credits (the market for which I will not be exploring, but suffice it to say it is an enabler) and cheap power come new business models, and Heimdal&#8217;s is one of them.</p>
<p>The Heimdal process, which has been demonstrated at lab scale (think terrariums instead of thousand-gallon tanks), is roughly as follows. First the seawater is alkalinized, shifting its pH up and allowing the isolation of some gaseous hydrogen, chlorine and a hydroxide sorbent. This is mixed with a separate stream of seawater, causing the precipitation of calcium, magnesium and sodium minerals and reducing the saturation of CO2 in the water — allowing it to absorb more from the atmosphere when it is returned to the sea. (I was shown an image of the small-scale prototype facility but, citing pending patents, Heimdal declined to provide the photo for publication.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195686" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-diagram.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195686" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2195686" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-diagram.jpg" alt="A diagram describing Heimdal's carbon extraction process" width="1024" height="566" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-diagram.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-diagram.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-diagram.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-diagram.jpg?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-diagram.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-diagram.jpg?resize=1536,848 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-diagram.jpg?resize=2048,1131 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heimdal-diagram.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2195686" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Heimdal</p></div></p>
<p>So from seawater and electricity, they produce hydrogen and chlorine gas, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate and magnesium carbonate, and in the process sequester a great deal of dissolved CO2.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For every kiloton of seawater, one ton of CO2 is isolated, and two tons of the carbonates, each of which has an industrial use. MgCO3 and Na2CO3 are used in, among other things, glass manufacturing, but it&#8217;s CaCO3, or limestone, that has the biggest potential impact.</p>
<p>As a major component of the cement-making process, limestone is always in great demand. But current methods for supplying it are huge sources of atmospheric carbon. All over the world industries are investing in carbon reduction strategies, and while purely financial offsets are common, moving forward the preferred alternative will likely be actually carbon-negative processes.</p>
<p>To further stack the deck in its favor, Heimdal is looking to work with desalination plants, which are common around the world where fresh water is scarce but seawater and energy are abundant, for example the coasts of California and Texas in the U.S., and many other areas globally, but especially where deserts meet the sea, like in the MENA region.</p>
<p>Desalination produces fresh water and proportionately saltier brine, which generally has to be treated, as to simply pour it back into the ocean can throw the local ecosystem out of balance. But what if there were, say, a mineral-collecting process between the plant and the sea? Heimdal gets the benefit of more minerals per ton of water, and the desalination plant has an effective way of handling its salty byproduct.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heimdal&#8217;s ability to use brine effluent to produce carbon-neutral cement solves two problems at once,&#8221; said Yishan Wong, former Reddit CEO, now CEO of <a href="https://www.terraformation.com/">Terraformation</a> and individually an investor in Heimdal. &#8220;It creates a scalable source of carbon-neutral cement, and converts the brine effluent of desalination into a useful economic product. Being able to scale this together is game-changing on multiple levels.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ProrVq8grk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/terraformation-gets-30m-to-fight-climate-change-with-rapid-reforesting/">Terraformation gets $30M to fight climate change with rapid reforesting</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Terraformation gets $30M to fight climate change with rapid reforesting&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/terraformation-gets-30m-to-fight-climate-change-with-rapid-reforesting/embed/#?secret=ProrVq8grk" data-secret="ProrVq8grk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Terraformation is a big proponent of solar desalination, and Heimdal fits right into that equation; the two are working on an official partnership that should be announced shortly. Meanwhile a carbon-negative source for limestone is something cement makers will buy every gram of in their efforts to decarbonize.</p>
<p>Wong points out that the primary cost of Heimdal&#8217;s business, beyond the initial ones of buying tanks, pumps and so on, is that of solar energy. That&#8217;s been trending downwards for years and with huge sums being invested regularly there&#8217;s no reason to think that the cost won&#8217;t continue to drop. And profit per ton of CO2 captured — already around 75% of over $500-$600 in revenue — could also grow with scale and efficiency.</p>
<p>Millar said that the price of their limestone is, when government incentives and subsidies are included, already at price parity with industry norms. But as energy costs drop and scales rise, the ratio will grow more attractive. It&#8217;s also nice that their product is indistinguishable from &#8220;natural&#8221; limestone. &#8220;We don&#8217;t require any retrofitting for the concrete providers — they just buy our synthetic calcium carbonate rather than buy it from mining companies,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>All in all it seems to make for a promising investment, and though Heimdal has not yet made its public debut (that would be forthcoming at Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 Demo Day) it has attracted a $6.4 million seed round. The participating investors are Liquid2 Ventures, Apollo Projects, Soma Capital, Marc Benioff, Broom Ventures, Metaplanet, Cathexis Ventures and, as mentioned above, Yishan Wong.</p>
<p>Heimdal has already signed LOIs with several large cement and glass manufacturers, and is planning its first pilot facility at a U.S. desalination plant. After providing test products to its partners on the scale of tens of tons, they plan to enter commercial production in 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to IPO season.</p>
<p>No, we won&#8217;t call it hot liquidity summer, but after an August lull, the public-offering cycle is back upon us. Last week we saw filings from Warby Parker, Toast and Freshworks. We&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">dug into Warby already</a>. This week, we&#8217;re tackling the details of the latter two debuts, starting with Toast.</p>

<hr />
<p>Why do we care about Toast? It&#8217;s a technology startup. It&#8217;s a unicorn. And it raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/toast/company_financials">more than $900 million</a> while private, per Crunchbase data. And the company is a leading constituent of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">Boston startup scene</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Even more, the software-and-payments company combines subscription incomes, transaction fees, hardware revenues and lending earnings. Its business is complex &#8212; in a good way &#8212; and may help us better understand what happens to software companies when they build more financial capabilities into their original applications.</span></p>

Let&#8217;s go over the company&#8217;s overall financial performance, dig into how COVID affected the company&#8217;s business, consider how its revenue mix is changing over time, discuss how important fintech incomes are for the company and what it might be worth. This will be good fun. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>Toast&#8217;s growth is accelerating</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll carve more deeply into <em>how</em> the company generates revenues shortly. For now, just keep in mind that the company has a number of revenue streams, each of which has a different gross-margin profile. So, we&#8217;re <em>not</em> only discussing high-margin software revenues in the following.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Toast&#8217;s top-line performance for 2019, 2020, and the first half of both 2020 and 2021, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001650164/000119312521258447/d166297ds1.htm">taken from its S-1 filing</a>:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195601" style="width: 893px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195601" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2195601 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-10.02.05-AM.png" alt="" width="883" height="157" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-10.02.05-AM.png 883w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-10.02.05-AM.png?resize=150,27 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-10.02.05-AM.png?resize=300,53 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-10.02.05-AM.png?resize=768,137 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-10.02.05-AM.png?resize=680,121 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-10.02.05-AM.png?resize=50,9 50w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195601" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Toast S-1</p></div></p>
<p>We can quickly see that the company grew from 2019 to 2020, albeit at a moderate clip. More recently, observing the two columns on the far right, we can see much more rapid growth from the company. In year-on-year comparative terms, Toast grew 24% in 2020 and 105% in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>Thinking about how COVID-19 hit the food business, observing modest growth at the company in 2020 feels somewhat strong; despite huge market chop, Toast still grew nicely. And the company&#8217;s H1 2021 results indicate that the product work that Toast engaged in during the global pandemic has worked well, allowing it to accelerate growth by a factor of four in the last two quarters when compared to 2020&#8217;s overall pace of revenue expansion.</p>
<p>The above data also helps us better understand why Toast is going public now. After pushing through 2020, the company&#8217;s current portrait is one of accelerating growth leading to massive top-line accretion. Toast looks more than strong. And there&#8217;s no better time to go public than when you have numbers to brag about.</p>

<p>Matteo Franceschetti, Eight Sleep&#8217;s CEO, said in an interview that the funding will be used in a few ways.</p>
<p>First, the plan is to double down on building out more technology. Today, Eight&#8217;s Pod technology can detect your temperature, heartbeat and breathing and heat or cool a bed accordingly. Tomorrow, that could also include more physical products, additional ambient factors like lighting, and other diagnostics related to you, the sleeper.</p>
<p>Second, Eight Sleep wants to expand internationally, with plans to sell New York-based Eight Sleep products across Europe and the U.K. by the end of this year. After all, it&#8217;s not just people in the U.S. who could use a better night of sleep.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Franceschetti &#8212; who co-founded the company with Massimo Andreasi Bassi, Andrea Ballarini and Alexandra Zatarain &#8212; told TechCrunch that he came to think about sleep and the need to improve it by way of having been an avid and active sports enthusiast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was into the idea of sleep as recovery,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is how we came up with the idea of sleep fitness.&#8221; Sleep he said, &#8220;is not just a waste of time.&#8221; Extrapolating that, it&#8217;s not just important for athletes, but everyone, to have better-quality sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vision for us is to compress your sleep and save your life,&#8221; he said. A good six hours, he added, &#8220;are better than eight hours that are not.&#8221; The company&#8217;s original name, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/02/eight-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eight</a>, was in reference to those fabled eight hours. Eight Sleep claims that when people use its products, they fall asleep 40% faster, get up to 20% more deep sleep and experience 30% fewer mid-night wake-ups and up to 30% fewer tosses and turns.</p>
<p>(But can it get me to stop worrying about COVID, the economy and societal collapse, whether my kids will be happy in life, and if we remembered to lock the door downstairs? Or maybe all of those just seem less serious when you are actually comfortable in bed&#8230;)</p>
<p>While Eight has definitely had a lot of traction with athletes &#8212; some 100 stars use it today &#8212; it&#8217;s hoping that the big boom in quantified self technology &#8212; hardware and software built to measure our blood pressure, heart rate, how much we sleep, how much we walk or do other activities, and much more &#8212; will mean that it can ultimately have a mass market appeal.</p>
<p>Indeed, that we are living in a world with wearable tech that tracks our every movement is nothing new. And, as computing and communications technologies have become smaller and more portable, and infinitely more powerful, and cloud technology and advances in big data analytics has made the gathering of data and the ability to parse it more sophisticated, we have only seen the possibilities for how that can be used to measure (and potentially &#8220;improve&#8221;) our lives increase.</p>
<p>Within that, sleep has been a large category of opportunity both for startups and tech companies. Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/fitness-ring-maker-oura-raises-100m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oura raised $100 million</a> for its fitness and sleep tracking rings; others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/zeits-early-warning-wearable-for-sleep-strokes-could-save-hours-and-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeit</a> have been exploring how to use wearable technology to address more acute sleep-related issues like sleep strokes.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zeit&#8217;s early warning wearable for sleep strokes could save hours and lives&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/zeits-early-warning-wearable-for-sleep-strokes-could-save-hours-and-lives/embed/#?secret=pdXrnaoC4G" data-secret="pdXrnaoC4G" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Larger tech companies are not asleep at the wheel, either. Google recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/google-nest-hub-2-review-the-solid-smart-screen-adds-sleep-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated its Nest Hub</a> to track sleep; and even Apple has acquired a sleep tech company, Beddit (that deal was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/09/apple-acquires-sleep-tracking-company-beddit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2017</a>, however, and it has been years since that hardware was updated: that could be one sign that Apple was more interested in using some of the technology in some of its other health-related efforts).</p>
<p>All this points to many more developments in a sleep tech market estimated to be worth around $30 billion. Within that, Eight Sleep has been on a roll, with revenues for 2021 currently on track to triple versus 2020 on the back of two main products, a mattress that retails for nearly $3,000 for its smallest size, a queen, and a smart cover that starts at $1,720. (The company does not disclose user numbers, but Franceschetti said that the figures are in the &#8220;several thousands.&#8221;)</p>
<p>“The sleep tech market is only in its infancy. The opportunity is limitless, as we spend up to a third of our lives asleep. Consumers are increasingly focused on sleep fitness as the understanding of how deeply important sleep is to overall health becomes more widely known,” said Antonio Gracias of Valor Equity in a statement.</p>
<p>Gracias founded Valor and is joining the board with this round, and as with other investors, he seems to have been won over in part by becoming a user: “The first night I slept on the Pod I knew we had to get involved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We’ve seen this in our portfolio many times &#8211; Eight Sleep’s products and technology are disrupting the sleep market, and its rapid innovation is outpacing the competition as it builds a new sleep fitness focused category that delivers results.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ryan Reynolds is America&#8217;s sweetheart, despite being both Canadian and somewhat irreverent. The actor, producer, screenwriter and entrepreneur has been nominated for a Golden Globe and Grammy for his work on the Deadpool franchise.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t just his acting that made Deadpool a record-breaking, billion-dollar franchise. Reynolds is one of the world&#8217;s greatest when it comes to fast-vertising, which he&#8217;s leveraged into his production company and marketing firm Maximum Effort, which ran some of the cheapest, and most impactful marketing for Deadpool from the start.</p>
<p>Maximum Effort is also responsible for some of the best ads of the past few years. It would be hard to forget his campaigns for Aviation Gin (remember how quickly he turned a terrible Peloton ad into an <a href="https://twitter.com/VancityReynolds/status/1203118775815622664">hilarious Aviation Gin ad</a>) or the devilishly funny Match.com spot.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qmb5ENInqVk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>His creative chops are impressive, but come with some clever entrepreneurial grit. Reynolds is an owner of Aviation Gin, which sold for more than $600 million in 2020, and an owner of Mint Mobile, a fast-growing MVNO. Reynolds has brought his marketing expertise to Mint Mobile, too, without becoming the joke.</p>

<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re thrilled to have him join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true&amp;promo=rrpost">Disrupt (Sept 21-23)</a> for a fireside chat to talk about how he leverages both his creativity and his platform in the world of entrepreneurialism, and pick his brain on how startups can use fast-vertising to have a maximum impact on a minimum budget.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll also get a feel for his investment appetite in the world of startups.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">With the arrival of U.S. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, breaking up Big Tech has reemerged as a major policy discussion in Washington. The issue seems to be bipartisan, with Republicans and Democrats alike in favor of stemming monopolistic behavior in the tech industry. Of course, the situation on the ground is more nuanced.</p>
<p>One month after the House Judiciary Committee voted to advance five bipartisan bills that would force Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Google to split up or walk away from core businesses, Republican committee members introduced new legislation to give Americans legal recourse against online censorship by Big Tech companies. The more conservative-driven policy measures also propose greater transparency into content moderation practices by Big Tech.</p>
<p>This sparring between lawmakers on how to regulate Big Tech is not expected to end anytime soon. But as the U.S. ushers in a new era of digital transformation accelerated by the pandemic, Congress stands firmly united in the belief that Big Tech’s power must be checked to preserve the free market.</p>
<p>As it stands now, small competitors and consumers alike have little choice but to be tethered to Big Tech to participate in today’s modern economic engine. And coming out of the pandemic, the five biggest tech giants <a href="https://www.axios.com/earnings-largest-companies-tech-giants-77de0e35-e3b3-42d6-9dd4-b56bb4064ea1.html">are growing</a> at breathtaking speed unseen before in the history of capitalism.</p>
<p>Big Tech companies have come out strongly against regulation that would break up their business operations, suggesting reform would result in the loss of research and development, impractical market fragmentation and higher service costs to consumers.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/23/new-poll-shows-voters-favor-tech-regulation-but-rank-it-low-priority.html">survey</a> commissioned by a tech industry trade group funded by Big Tech companies such as Apple, Facebook and Amazon suggests that Americans view tech regulation as a low priority for Congress. Among those listed as top priority for Americans were the economy, public health, climate change and infrastructure. The survey also revealed that Americans are more likely to oppose regulation if it were to affect offerings like free shipping on Amazon Prime products.</p>
<p>Perhaps this poll and the bipartisan sentiment among elected leaders signals that after COVID-19, society has become aware of its dependency on tech giants, for better or worse. For the last 18 months, American workers have adapted to remote work. They utilize programs run by Big Tech companies to communicate with other employees, to run companies, and to buy groceries and essentials. It is unlikely this dynamic will change, as many companies have announced their transition to a fully remote or hybrid work model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This topic has raised interest among professionals, more specifically those who work in the tech industry, startups and small businesses. We at <a href="https://www.fishbowlapp.com/">Fishbowl</a> thought we’d ask professionals &#8212; many of whom work in the tech industry &#8212; about breaking up tech giants. Fishbowl is a social network for professionals, so conducting surveys on this and other workplace topics is a natural fit.</p>
<p>The survey ran from July 26-30, 2021, to determine how employees in the field feel about antitrust laws. The survey asked professionals: Do you believe antitrust legislation should be used to break up Big Tech companies like Amazon and Google?</p>
<p>There were 11,579 verified professionals on the Fishbowl app who participated in the survey, and they were given the option to answer either yes or no. The survey was broken down into state and professional industries such as law, consulting, finance, tech, marketing, accounting, human resources, teachers and others.</p>
<p>Here’s what the survey revealed:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194677" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194677" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2194677 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194677" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fishbowl</p></div></p>
<p>Out of 11,579 professionals, the majority — 6,920 (59.76%) — responded yes to the survey question.</p>
<p>Based on responses, we found that law professionals were the highest group responding in the affirmative to the survey, with 66.67%. Consulting professionals followed with 61.97%, while finance (60.64%) marginally beat out tech (60.03%). Conversely, teachers had the lowest percentage with 53.49%. Human resources (55.65%), accounting (58.51%) and other professional industries (58.83%) trailed behind.</p>
<p>The survey’s data was collected from professionals in 25 U.S. states. The highest percentage responding “yes” was Colorado with 76.83%. In second place was Washington with 73.17%, and Michigan rounded out the top three with 69.70%. Missouri (51.35%) had the lowest percentage of employees responding &#8220;yes&#8221; to splitting up Big Tech. Following closely behind were Indiana (52.59%) and Massachusetts (52.83%). Overall, the majority of the states involved in the survey agreed that they believed antitrust legislation should indeed break up Big Tech companies.</p>
<p>Tech had the fourth-highest percentage of professionals agreeing that Big Tech companies should be broken up. Some benefits from breaking up Big Tech companies are more opportunities for small businesses — for a tech professional or entrepreneur, this could open up opportunities to launch new products, programs and services. It could also add more jobs for highly skilled professionals. Second, it can reduce data privacy and national security concerns. But some <a href="https://medium.com/chamber-of-progress/new-house-bills-would-ban-these-15-tech-conveniences-that-consumers-love-f55289701ae8">cons of breaking up Big Tech</a> companies include the loss of research and development — large companies provide major funding for artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, wearables, robots and more. Ultimately, breaking up Big Tech companies can also increase service costs for professionals and the overall public.</p>
<p>As policymakers continue to negotiate on how to break up Big Tech, the White House is also making moves. President Joe Biden recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/technology/lina-khan-ftc.html">named</a> Khan, a professor at Columbia Law School, as chair of the FTC. A staunch critic of Big Tech, Khan’s main priority is to protect the public from corporate abuse and ensure merger guidelines reflect economic realities and empirical learning and enforcement. Simply put, she reviews mergers with skepticism.</p>
<p>And in July, Biden announced his intention to nominate <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/20/president-biden-announces-jonathan-kanter-for-assistant-attorney-general-for-antitrust/">Jonathan Kanter</a> for chief of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. Kanter is an antitrust lawyer with over 20 years of experience who has been a leading advocate and expert in the effort to promote strong and meaningful antitrust enforcement and competition policy.</p>
<p>With these additional members, it is expected that there will be an aggressive approach to enforcing antitrust laws across industries, leaving it to Congress to ensure that moving forward things are different.</p>
