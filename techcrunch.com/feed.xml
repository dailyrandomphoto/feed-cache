										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of high-profile investors are chasing to invest in Slice, a fintech startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/27/slice-raises-20-million-to-go-after-credit-card-industry-in-india/">attempting to expand the market for credit cards in India</a>.</p>
<p>Tiger Global is in advanced stages of talks to lead a round of over $100 million in the Bangalore-based startup, sources familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>A number of other firms, including Insight Partners, Ribbit Capital and Greenoaks, are also engaging with the startup, sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215192" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Deliberations are ongoing and the terms can change, sources added.</p>
<p><a href="http://sliceit.com">Slice</a>, which has raised around $30 million in its previous equity financing rounds and was valued at under $200 million in a round earlier this year, declined to comment. Slice counts Blume Ventures, Gunosy Capital and Better Capital among its investors.</p>
<p>Tiger Global declined to comment.</p>
<p>Even as hundreds of millions of Indians today have a bank account, only about 30 million have a credit card. Most people in the South Asian market are not eligible to get a credit card, and even many of those who are don’t bother to get one because the experience of signing up is too clumsy, time consuming and the rewards don’t make up for it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Slice has made it easier for far more people — even those without a traditional full-time job — to get a card, and the signup process is swift. In the past two years, Slice has emerged as one of India’s largest card-issuing firms.</p>
<p>It has also become aggressive to reach potential customers. Last month, the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/indian-fintech-slice-launches-27-credit-limit-cards-to-tap-200-million-users/">launched a card with 2,000 Indian rupees ($27) as the default limit</a> to tap the nation’s potential addressable market of 200 million individuals.</p>
<p>In a separate announcement earlier this week, Slice said it issued 110,000 cards last month. The startup, founded by Flipkart alum Rajan Bajaj, says it has more than 3 million registered members, whose average age is 27.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is also <a href="https://twitter.com/anmolm_/status/1445338588611166209">exploring</a> applications atop of blockchain, according to Bajaj&#8217;s LinkedIn and the startup&#8217;s recruitment posts. Last week, the firm announced that it is offering new hires a three-day week with steady pay and benefits to attract talent that wishes to work on other opportunities &#8212; or do whatever else they like &#8212; at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tiger Global has emerged as the most aggressive growth-stage investor in India in recent quarters. It has backed over two dozen startups in India this year, propelling many of them to the covet unicorn club.</p>

<p>India&#8217;s startup ecosystem witnessed a record 519 deals in the quarter that ended in September this year, research firm CB Insights <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">said in a report</a> on Thursday. During the same quarter, the startups raised $9.9 billion, compared to $10.3 billion in all of last year, the report said. Sequoia Capital India was the most prolific investor in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market during the quarter with 33 deals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The founders of <a href="https://www.upmesh.io/">Upmesh</a> were building a game on top of Twitch’s API when they realized something about another group of livestreamers. Even though selling through Facebook Live has been gaining popularity in Southeast Asia for years, many vendors are still going through their comments afterward and using pen-and-paper to collect orders. Upmesh was created to automate the checkout process and ultimately wants to create a platform similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/whatnot-raises-another-150m-for-its-livestream-shopping-platform-evolves-into-a-unicorn/">Whatnot</a> where people can discover new live commerce sellers across different social media platforms.</p>
<p>Upmesh announced today it has closed a seed round of $3 million, led by Leo Capital, with participation from Beenext, iSeed, Goto Financial head of merchant financial services Jonathan Barki, BukuWarung founders Abhinay Peddisetty and Chinmay Chauhan, and Zopim founders Royston Tay and Kwok Yangbin.</p>
<p>Upmesh was launched nine months ago by Wong Zi Yang, Soh Jan, Nhat Vu and Shawn Teow, and is now used by almost 300 live commerce merchants in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. The startup says it processes annualized gross merchandise value of $40 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215283" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The platform’s tools provide e-commerce functions that automatically capture orders made in livestream comments (for example “white top +1”), matches it to the right item in a seller’s inventory and sends a checkout link to the customer. Upmesh currently works with Facebook Live, but will add other platforms, too, with the goal of becoming platform-agnostic.</p>

<p>Other companies that provide order-capturing tools for live commerce include CommentSold, Dibsly, Soldie and Buy It Live, but Upmesh’s founders say one of its most important differentiators is tailoring its platform to meet the expectations of sellers and customers in different Southeast Asian countries.</p>
<p>“If you look at the live selling climate in Southeast Asia, the way people are collecting orders between each country is very different,” said chief executive officer Wong. “Between Singapore and the Philippines, whether you key-in your inventory before or after your live really different, even whether people maintain stock counts is really different.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2215284" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215284" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2215284" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Collecting-Orders-Facebook-Live-Selling.png?w=410" alt="Upmesh's tool for collecting orders through Facebook Live comments" width="350" height="581" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Collecting-Orders-Facebook-Live-Selling.png 1581w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Collecting-Orders-Facebook-Live-Selling.png?resize=90,150 90w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Collecting-Orders-Facebook-Live-Selling.png?resize=181,300 181w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Collecting-Orders-Facebook-Live-Selling.png?resize=768,1275 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Collecting-Orders-Facebook-Live-Selling.png?resize=410,680 410w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Collecting-Orders-Facebook-Live-Selling.png?resize=925,1536 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Collecting-Orders-Facebook-Live-Selling.png?resize=1233,2048 1233w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Collecting-Orders-Facebook-Live-Selling.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2215284" class="wp-caption-text">Upmesh&#8217;s tool for collecting orders through Facebook Live comments</p></div></p>
<p>For example, he said in Singapore, inventory turnaround is usually very fast, which means even sellers who offer 1,000s of items only keep stock on the shelf for short periods of time. In the Philippines, however, many vendors do live commerce to supplement their brick-and-mortar shops. Inventory is often taken from their stores and they sell what they have on hand. “The way the software is structured has to be very customized to the individual markets,” Wong said.</p>
<p>Upmesh will use part of its new funding to double down on the Philippines and Malaysia for at least another six months, but it also wants to enter Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. The company plans to increase its headcount, launch marketing campaigns and create educational content for sellers.</p>
<p>Wong notes that even though COVID-19 drove adoption of e-commerce, it isn’t what created interest in live commerce. Many of its clients have been livestreaming for about three years. “The way that people interact with e-commerce is changing. It’s becoming more relationship driven. In fact, our sellers actually know their buyers on a first name basis, so they can call them out by name when they join their livestream,” said Wong. “It’s actually replacing advertising for small business.”</p>
<p>Most of Upmesh’s user acquisition so far has been through word-of-mouth, and it serves a lot of fashion live sellers, since they are a closely-knit community, said Wong.</p>
<p>Upmesh’s future plans revolve around turning those communities into new ways of making money, creating a platform that will let sellers and buyers interact with each other and discover live commerce videos on different social media platforms.</p>
<p>“If we look at an interesting comparison to the U.S., the U.S. has live commerce platforms like Whatnot, but Whatnot is focused on collectibles and vintage items, things that have a very strong secondary reseller market,” said Wong. “In the U.S., those verticals have the most amount of community, people who are talking to each other on eBay, on YouTube or offline, and they look those communities and gave them a home to be in.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2215285" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215285" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2215285" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard.png?w=680" alt="Upmesh's dashboard for live commerce sellers" width="680" height="321" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard.png 4680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard.png?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard.png?resize=300,142 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard.png?resize=768,362 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard.png?resize=680,321 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard.png?resize=1536,725 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard.png?resize=2048,966 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2215285" class="wp-caption-text">Upmesh&#8217;s dashboard for live commerce sellers</p></div></p>
<p>Southeast Asia, on the other hand, does not have a similar collectibles market, but communities spring up around different types of goods, like fashion or fresh foods. Those are the kinds of verticals that Upmesh wants to add to its platform.</p>
<p>“That’s the end game for live commerce, that you can discover and interact with different sellers and then once you find a seller you like, you can go deeper,” said Wong. “We direct users’ attention to where they goods are, and since we have the inventory of all our sellers, if you want a red dress, we can tell you which sellers have a red dress.”</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The acquisition comes after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/riiid-ai-education-softbank/">the company&#8217;s latest $175 million Series D round</a> from SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 in May. Riiid has said it will continue to fuel its global expansion with the funding. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Langoo, Riiid’s partner in Japan, offers Riiid Tutor, formerly known as Santa, a test prep app for the English-language proficiency test TOEIC in the region. Riiid claims that more than 2.5 million users downloaded the Riiid Tutor app in South Korea and Japan. When it launched in April 2019 in Japan, the Riiid Tutor app took the top ranking in sales among education applications in Android within the first week of its release. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2213986" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The exceptional capacity of Langoo in its local business with Riiid Tutor was the main reason for this acquisition,” said co-founder and CEO of Riiid YJ Jang. “Riiid’s strength is our scalability and ability to apply our technology anywhere, regardless of regions, languages and domains. By leveraging this investment, we will capture broader Japanese market opportunities. This acquisition is the first step in an inorganic strategy to ultimately apply Riiid’s AI technology to the global market and help more learners around the world.” </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Japan is one of the largest education markets and has enormous potential to grow in the Japanese edtech industry that still relies on the conventional in-person education system, a spokesperson at Riiid told TechCrunch. After penetrating the Japanese market, Riiid will gear up to enter other international regions, including Central and East Asia, the spokesperson added. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Japanese remote learning industry was estimated at $2.6 billion in 2020, increasing 22.4% year on year, based on <a href="https://www.yanoresearch.com/en/press-release/show/press_id/2702">a report</a> by Yano Research Institute. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Riiid plans to shore up marketing, sales and B2B business development in Japan by setting up a Japanese unit via the acquisition. The company expects to address local remote learning and education in the market.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In Japan, Riiid will offer its services, ranging from the TOEIC to English speaking and tutoring services, to broaden its customer base.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company would be moving its headquarters from Palo Alto, California to Austin, Texas, a city that has recently seen a flood of tech companies and remote workers. Musk announced the news at the 2021 Tesla, Inc. Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which took place at the Tesla Austin gigafactory, rather than in the Bay Area as it did in previous years.</p>
<p>Musk also said Tesla would be continuing to expand activities in California, increasing its output at its Fremont gigafactory by 50%, although he didn&#8217;t elaborate on how he would achieve such a ramp up in production. The factory is currently able to produce about <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/482499/tesla-production-sites-assignment-capacity-january-2021/">500,000</a> Model 3 and Model Ys per year and another 100,000 Model S and Model X per year.</p>
<p>Last May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/09/tesla-sues-alameda-county-to-force-california-factory-reopening/">Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alameda County</a> over the shuttering of the company&#8217;s manufacturing facility in Fremont, California to stop the spread of COVID and restrict any businesses not deemed essential and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/09/elon-musk-threatens-to-pull-tesla-operations-out-of-california/">threatened to take his business outside the state</a>. The automaker dropped the lawsuit just a couple weeks later, but Musk was certainly fired up, tweeting: &#8220;Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependent on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215191" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1259162367285317633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<div class="c-float-right">The drama with Alameda County wasn&#8217;t mentioned at the Shareholder event. Rather, Musk attributed the move to Texas in part due to a more accessible location for workers.</div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tough for people to afford houses and people have to come in from far away,&#8221; said Musk. &#8220;There&#8217;s a limit to how big you can scale it in the Bay Area. In Austin our factory is like five minutes from the airport, 15 minutes from Downtown.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk said Tesla plans to build &#8220;an ecological paradise&#8221; at the Austin location near the Colorado River.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During the event, Musk also provided updates on the Cybertruck, which he said would start production at the end of 2022, with “volume production” by 2023. The Tesla Semi and Roadster would follow with the start of production by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Musk cited multiple supply chain shortages, including the ongoing semiconductor shortage, as a reason for the delay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Semi in particular needs a lot of cells, needs a lot of cells [and] a lot of chips,” he said.</p>
<p>Although Tesla unveiled the Semi prototype in 2017 and the Cybertruck in 2019, both vehicles have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/tesla-delays-semi-truck-to-2022-cybertruck-back-burnered-for-model-y/">faced repeated delays</a> since, and always for supply chain issues.</p>
<p>Before Musk got around to sharing updates on vehicle production, the shareholders voted on a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021044307/tsla-pre14a_20210813.htm">range of proposals</a>, including to re-elect to the board Musk&#8217;s brother, Kimbal Musk, and former 21st Century Fox executive and son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch, despite a recommendation to vote against them by Institutional Shareholder Services.</p>
<p>The stockholders approved the recommendations of the Tesla board on almost all agenda items, including the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as Tesla&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending in December 31, 2021. However, investors did defy board recommendations on three proposal items. Usually, shareholders vote along the lines Tesla has set for them, but this year, investors voted to force Tesla board members to run for re-election annually, rather than every three years.</p>
<p>Shareholders also voted to require Tesla to publish more detail about efforts to diversify its workforce. This comes just two days after Tesla was ordered to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/tesla-must-pay-137-million-in-discrimination-lawsuit/"> pay $137 million in damages</a> to a former Black contract worker, Owen Diaz, who accused the company of allowing flat out discrimination and racial abuse at the company&#8217;s EV plant in Fremont.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Research shows that diverse and inclusive teams support more innovation,&#8221; said Kimberly Stokes, VP and corporate engagement strategist at Calvert Research and Management, a Morgan Stanley-backed firm focused on responsible investment. &#8220;<a href="https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/2020-DEI-impact-report.pdf">Tesla&#8217;s 2020 DEI report</a> lacks sufficient quantitative and qualitative information for investors to adequately compare the company&#8217;s performance over time, and relative to peer. What the report does reveal is that Tesla&#8217;s leadership is 83% male and 59% white, despite having what the company described as a majority minority workforce, all at a time in which Tesla&#8217;s customer base is evolving and growing more diverse.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Calvert&#8217;s proposal requires Tesla to publish annual diversity and inclusion effort reports, including a comprehensive breakdown of race and gender.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">Global startups raise record sums. Again</a>. </strong>Another quarter, another set of record funding totals for global startups. New data from CB Insights indicates that upstart companies around the world managed to just beat the records that they set in Q2 of this year. All told, 2021 is going to be a barn-burning year of venture capital investment that we may never beat in our lifetimes.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/microsoft-acquires-ally-io-okr-startup-that-raised-76-million/"><strong>Microsoft buys OKR software startup Ally:</strong></a><strong> </strong>TechCrunch has long tracked the OKR software market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/why-is-everyone-making-okr-software/">as crowded</a> and incredibly busy when it comes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/what-can-the-okr-software-sector-tell-us-about-startup-growth-more-generally/">raising capital and posting big ARR growth numbers</a>. Today, Microsoft shook up the startup niche by buying one of its better-funded competitors. Now what?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/in-hopes-of-app-store-changes-paddle-develops-an-alternative-to-apples-payments-system/">Developers are building tools to get around the Apple tax:</a> </strong>While global regulators figure out what to do with app marketplace payment lock-in, startups are getting to work. Paddle is building what TechCrunch describes as a “new in-app purchasing (IAP) system aimed at iOS developers that’s designed to be a drop-in replacement for Apple’s own IAP.” Good!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/robotire-raises-7-5m-to-automate-tire-replacement/"><strong>I am here for robot tire changing:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I don’t know how to change a tire, as I am a useless man-child who types for a living. But even among folks who know how, the rote task isn’t likely popular. Enter robots! RoboTire wants to bring robotic tire changing to the car service world and has raised a $7.5 million Series A round to fund its aspirations.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/fantasy-startup-investing-nft-platform-visionrare-shuts-down-paid-marketplace-after-a-day-in-open-beta/"><strong>You can no longer pay real money to buy fake stock in real companies:</strong></a> A day after Visionrare <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/fantasy-equity-nft-game-wants-you-to-spend-real-money-buying-fake-shares-of-real-startups/">announced a marketplace</a> where you could buy NFTs of fake shares of real startups, that appears to be over. Sadly. It was great for headlines.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/cruise-plans-to-have-tens-of-thousands-of-origin-avs-on-roads-in-coming-years/"><strong>We’re holding you to this deadline, Cruise:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Well-funded self-driving car company Cruise intends to have tens of thousands of self-driving cars on the roads by 2030. If the company misses this deadline, I have decided that all its execs have to bike to work for the next decade. (Sticking to the theme of my personal incompetence, driving is hard and I do not like doing it.)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/chronosphere-raises-200m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-cloud-native-monitoring-adds-granular-distributed-tracing-to-its-dashboard/"><strong>Startup with video game name that doesn’t deal in video games raises money:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you have ever heard of the game Chrono Trigger, you are excused from wondering if Chronosphere is a gaming company. It is not. It is, instead, a data observability company. And it has put together a $200 million round, which should be more than enough capital to take on Monte Carlo and other players in its niche.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/instacart-is-acquiring-catering-software-company-foodstorm/"><strong>Instacart buys FoodStorm:</strong></a> Grocery delivery behemoth Instacart announced this morning that it has purchased FoodStorm, what TechCrunch describes as “a SaaS order management system (OMS) that powers end-to-end order-ahead and catering for grocery retailers.” Terms were not shared, and because both companies are private, that doesn’t tell us too much.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/solo-io-reaches-1b-valuation-with-135m-series-c-investment/">Microservices meshing is macro business:</a></strong> Our own Ron Miller has a story out today looking at Solo.io, which provides software that helps customers “mesh” microservices together. I know what that means only from a very high perspective. What matters to both of us is that the company is now a unicorn, putting up some early points in Q4 for the larger Boston startup scene.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/cord-gets-17-5m-to-get-more-devs-plugged-into-its-api-for-real-time-collaboration/"><strong>Slackify in all the things:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s what Cord wants to do, put Slack-like features into any application. It offers its service via an API — naturally — and just banked $17.5 million for its project.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/backed-by-greycroft-klasha-gets-2-4m-to-improve-cross-border-commerce-in-africa/"><strong>Nigerian American company raises for cross-border African payments:</strong></a> The growing African e-commerce market is creating demand for new products, a trend that Klasha hopes to ride with its service that helps consumers pay across national borders on the continent.</li>
<li>And to round out our startup coverage today, ghost kitchens are not merely a trend in the United States. They are also taking off in India. Evidence of that fact? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/indian-cloud-kitchen-startup-rebel-foods-valued-at-1-4-billion-in-175-million-fundraise/">Rebel Foods just raised at a unicorn valuation on the back of its own dark kitchen work in the country</a>. It seems that good startup ideas are reaching international ubiquity faster than ever.</li>

<h2>After a proxy fight victory, it’s time for Box to make some bold moves</h2>
<p>The last few years included a delayed IPO filing and a proxy battle with a major shareholder, but events are now unfolding nicely for Box co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie.</p>
<p>Enterprise reporter Ron Miller says this is &#8220;a pivotal moment for the cloud content management company,&#8221; so he interviewed Levie to learn more about his plans, particularly in light of the company&#8217;s recent revenue growth.</p>
<p>For balance, Ron also spoke to Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder and principal analyst at Deep Analysis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next year is pivotal for Box,” he said. “It has to prove that it was right to win the proxy fight. To do that, it has to evolve the Box platform and grow steadily but surely and continue to carve out a niche for itself in the market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google announced Thursday that it would no longer allow ads or monetization for content that promotes climate change denialism. The <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321">policy change</a> will apply to publishers, advertisers and YouTube creators, who will no longer be able to make money from content that &#8220;contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google plans to enforce the new policy with a blend of algorithmic detection and human moderation and the change will go into effect next month. While there&#8217;s some room for interpretation in the new rules, according to Google they &#8220;[include] content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam, claims denying that long-term trends show the global climate is warming, and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a blog post, the Google Ads team said that the policy change reflects the desires of advertisers, who &#8220;simply don’t want their ads to appear next to this content.&#8221; The blog post also noted that creators and publishers don&#8217;t want ads pushing climate denialism on their videos either, though that fact seems a bit dubious considering how rife Google&#8217;s video platform is with misinformation.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s new policy takes a strong stance on false claims about the climate crisis, but social networks have only<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/16/facebook-climate-change-misinformation"> just begun to reckon</a> with their role in disseminating climate-related misinformation. YouTube has also proven notoriously slow to introduce new rules designed to stop the flow of misinformation in the past on other issues, including<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/youtube-declares-war-on-us-election-misinformation-a-month-late/"> false claims about the U.S. election</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the policy is an improvement — all platforms should build out robust rule sets around the accelerating existential threat to humanity — but new rules will only make a dent in the misinformation ecosystem if they&#8217;re aggressively and consistently enforced.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitch <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1445770441176469512">confirmed</a> yesterday that a massive cache of internal data, including creator payouts, was published online after a breach. The streaming platform said in <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/10/06/updates-on-the-twitch-security-incident/">a blog post</a> that the leak was caused by an error in a Twitch server configuration change, which was then accessed by a malicious third party. For many streamers, this leak exacerbates existing tensions over pay transparency in streaming and safety on Twitch.</p>
<p>These leaks follow a rocky few months for the Amazon-owned platform, which &#8212; as of earlier this year &#8212; <a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492">represented 72.3%</a> of live video game streaming viewership, remaining dominant over platforms like Facebook Gaming and YouTube Gaming. After marginalized creators were repeatedly targeted by hateful bot attacks, some streamers rallied the community to boycott the platform on September 1 for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/streamers-are-boycotting-twitch-today-to-protest-the-platforms-lack-of-action-on-hate-raids/">#ADayOffTwitch</a>, which caused the platform&#8217;s peak concurrent viewership to drop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-09-02-twitch-streamers-adayofftwitch-protest-hits-platform-viewer-totals">1 million viewers below average</a>. Though Twitch has added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/twitch-adds-phone-verified-chat-expands-email-authentication-settings-as-users-face-hate-raids/">new safety features</a> since, tensions remain high in the community.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Streamers are boycotting Twitch today to protest the platform&#8217;s lack of action on &#8216;hate raids&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/streamers-are-boycotting-twitch-today-to-protest-the-platforms-lack-of-action-on-hate-raids/embed/#?secret=EQf0YodAzM" data-secret="EQf0YodAzM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I think it was only a matter of time that something like this would happen,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luciaeverblack">Lucia Everblack</a>, a transgender streamer who was one of the organizers of the #ADayOffTwitch boycott. &#8220;It&#8217;s been kind of apparent that safety and security was never at the forefront of what Twitch was doing to begin with.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leak included data like source code, proprietary software development kits (SDKs) and an unreleased Steam competitor from Amazon Game Studios. But Everblack, a software engineer by day, thinks that the leak of creator payout data only affirms her feeling that Twitch&#8217;s priority is to cater to the streamers that bring in the most money. According to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/q2iq34/using_the_latest_data_leak_i_made_a_graph_of/">Reddit post</a> analyzing the leaked streamer data from 2019 to the present, 10% of the top 10,000 streamers comprise 49% of total streamer earnings on Twitch. About 2,000 streamers made over $100,000 on Twitch in that period.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re basing all of their features solely on that, but the rest of the platform can&#8217;t really grow,&#8221; she told TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s just such a huge deterrent for anyone else, especially those who are BIPOC, LGBTQI+ or disabled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott Hellyer, a Twitch Partner who has streamed as <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tehMorag">tehMorag</a> for over nine years, also feels that Twitch prioritizes its top-earning users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Across Twitch as a whole, discovery has always been an issue,&#8221; Hellyer told TechCrunch. &#8220;YouTube has a really cool algorithm &#8212; they help find a way to get you connected with people that want to watch your content, and on Twitch, they&#8217;ve been trying, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;re trying enough. Now, people are like, &#8216;Oh, no wonder they don&#8217;t want to improve discovery, they just shove people into the top streams, because they&#8217;re already making the money that they need for Twitch.&#8217; It&#8217;s a good return on investment, which is understandable.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213340" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213340" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2213340 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="410" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg 1906w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?resize=1536,925 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213340" class="wp-caption-text">TechCrunch screenshot of 4chan.</p></div></p>
<p>Per the leak, the majority of the top streamers are white men, reflecting a larger <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNoirEnigma/status/1445826468932734980">lack of diversity</a> in the gaming industry &#8212; the highest paid woman streamer on the list, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokimane">Pokimane</a>, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-06-twitch-leak-reveals-streamer-earnings-and-lack-of-diversity">only 39th</a>. But more discoverability features could help Twitch amplify more diverse creators. Everblack and other marginalized streamers pushed for Twitch to add <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/05/21/celebrate-yourself-and-your-community-with-350-new-tags/">identity-based tags</a> to streams so that users could seek out diverse creators to support. Twitch added these tags in May, and before that, Everblack founded <a href="https://peer2peer.live/">Peer2Peer.live</a>, an opt-in discoverability tool for marginalized streamers and viewers to find each other. Some users worry that these tags helped bad actors find targets for hate raids, but Everblack said that she&#8217;s seen huge growth from the tags. In the meantime, it&#8217;s on Twitch to protect these users from the potential for targeted attacks, which so far, it has done by adding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/twitch-adds-phone-verified-chat-expands-email-authentication-settings-as-users-face-hate-raids/">phone-verified chat</a> features.</p>
<p>But even once a streamer builds an audience, it&#8217;s a challenge to make substantial income on Twitch, despite what the top earners might receive. When a streamer gets popular enough, they might apply to join the Twitch Partner program, which offers creators more tools and monetization options. But multiple streamers TechCrunch spoke to consider it an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGJ2RiyxWk0">open secret</a> that not all Twitch Partners have <a href="https://creatorhype.com/twitch-signing-streamers-increase-sub-split/">the same pay structure</a> &#8212; in 2017, Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitch-raises-incentives-for-creators-2017-4">reported</a> that &#8220;Partners receive a 20/80 to 60/40 split on subscription revenues depending on how popular they are.&#8221; Though it&#8217;s standard for Twitch Partners to split their subscription earnings 50/50 with Twitch, some streamers claim that nowadays, big-name creators have managed to negotiate more beneficial 60/40 or 70/30 payouts, which matches up-and-coming YouTube Gaming&#8217;s default payout. Some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal">popular streamers</a> like CouRage, DrLupo, and Valkyrae have even left Twitch to take exclusive deals with YouTube.</p>
<p>Jess Bolden, who streams as <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/JessGOAT">JessGOAT</a>, told <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/gaming/lesbian-gamers-twitch-harassment-hate-raids">Input</a>, &#8220;If I compare the amount of LGBTQIA+ and women streamers who have a 50-50 split with Twitch compared to the men, who probably have a 75-25 split with ad agreements &#8212; which I don’t have &#8212; we’re about to have a big fucking issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitch declined to comment on the claim that some Partners have better contractual terms than others.</p>
<p>Hellyer <a href="https://twitter.com/tehMorag/status/1445706095876456453">posted on Twitter</a> after the leak that he has always wanted to talk more about his pay on Twitch, but his Partner contract prevented him from doing so.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">On the plus side, I have always wanted to talk about and disclose in-detail of my own payout info but contract barred me from such &#8211; The info is out there now~</p>
<p>Hit me up if you have questions about it<br />I&#39;m sure there will be a good talk about it on stream tonight</p>
<p>&mdash; Scott Hellyer (@tehMorag) <a href="https://twitter.com/tehMorag/status/1445706095876456453?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;So far in the leak, they don&#8217;t really talk about any of the splits or different types of contracts, but I am sure that now that we have these raw numbers out there, really smart people can figure out what is the <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/joining-the-affiliate-program?language=en_US">CPM</a> (cost-per-mile, the amount paid per 1,000 views of an advertisement) of some of these streamers, are they getting a better cut on their Bits, are they getting a better cut on their subscription revenue as well too, because there are different sites that will track all that information, minus this part of the equation: how much money are they making from it,&#8221; Hellyer told TechCrunch. &#8220;We can&#8217;t talk about the actual money we make, but we can give an arbitrary value, like how many subscribers we have. But there&#8217;s no transparency there. My subscribers don&#8217;t know if I have a 50-50 split.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the tech industry, there have been <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/men-in-tech-pay-transparency">larger movements</a> to establish <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/21/why-an-open-salary-policy-always-beats-secrecy/">greater pay transparency</a>, which holds companies accountable to make sure that, for example, two engineers with the same job responsibilities aren&#8217;t being paid vastly different salaries.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Twitch is reflective of society,&#8221; <a href="http://twitch.tv/rekitraven">RekItRaven</a> told TechCruch. Raven led the #ADayOffTwitch boycott and started the #TwitchDoBetter hashtag. &#8220;We&#8217;re not supposed to talk about pay or money, but there&#8217;s never been a good reason why.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>But the Twitch payout amounts are more complicated than a list of how much a tech company pays each of its engineers &#8212; Twitch sets the terms of its Partners&#8217; contracts, but not all channels are created equal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/criticalrole">Critical Role</a> topped the list of the highest paid streamers, allegedly making $9,626,712 since August 2019; in second place was <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xQcOW">xQcOW</a>, making $8,454,427. But the costs for a show of Critical Role &#8212; a Dungeons &amp; Dragons show with <a href="https://critrole.com/team/">31 team members</a> &#8212; would be more significant than those for xQcOW, an eSports streamer. Plus, not all streamers get the same percentage of their total revenue from Twitch &#8212; many creators have sponsorship deals, Patreon pages, direct donations and other projects that help them vary their income streams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twitch is only 40% of my actual revenue,&#8221; Hellyer said. &#8220;I had to diversify to make sure that when stuff like this happens, I&#8217;m going to be okay, hopefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everblack said she worried that smaller creators will receive more flack over their leaked payout numbers than those who are making millions. She thinks Twitch would be better for marginalized creators, leak or not, if Twitch implemented more community-driven features to help smaller streamers feel safer while growing their channels. She suggested adding ways for streamers to reward viewers for being great community members, or tools for big streamers to send out smaller raids to multiple streams, rather than dropping thousands of people onto one unsuspecting streamer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marginalized voices in the Twitch community matter so much, and I think that if Twitch were to actually honestly bring them in and listen to them, a lot of these situations they keep running into could be avoided, and they can also proactively add in features that actually do benefit people,&#8221; Everblack said. &#8220;I think that they&#8217;re so focused on just the small group of large creators that they&#8217;re absolutely missing out on a whole huge network of people that aren&#8217;t even on the platform yet, because they only really care about white men gaming.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many of the problems we face today in biology and agriculture have been faced before — but not by humans. Somewhere in nature there is a microscopic creature that accomplishes naturally and efficiently what chemists and bioengineers are struggling to do at all — and <a href="https://www.plutonbio.com">Pluton Biosciences</a> claims to have pioneered a way to find that creature, and others like it. They&#8217;ve already demonstrated anti-mosquito and carbon sequestering methods, and more are on the way.</p>
<p>All over the planet, inside and outside of plants and animals, embedded in the soil, are bacteria and other microorganisms totally unknown to science. Yet the few that humans have learned to culture and control, such as lactobacilli and E.coli, have been transformative, allowing all kinds of new foods, discoveries and industrial processes. But however useful they are, they&#8217;re only a handful out of a near-infinite variety.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a trillion species of microbes, and we only use a couple of them,&#8221; said Pluton founder and CTO Barry Goldman, who spent nearly two decades at Monsanto looking into similar ideas. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to use that huge reservoir of biodiversity out there to solve big problems. Nature spent 2 billion years trying to solve them, so let&#8217;s let nature tell us the answer.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2214830" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Of course Goldman is not the first to try to crack the planet&#8217;s untapped intellectual property holdings, if you will, and in fact Pluton&#8217;s approach is remarkably old-school. Basically, you grab a handful of soil or another medium rich in microbes, and test it to find whether it does anything interesting.</p>
<p>If that sounds a bit vague, well, it is — but done systematically it&#8217;s a huge source of new material. The problem, as Goldman explained, was simply that back when people were (literally) mining the earth to find the next penicillin, &#8220;they could never bring it down to a single organism and sequence it.&#8221; They knew that somewhere in this cubic centimeter of soil was a critter producing an antibiotic, or nitrogen-fixing, or insulin-producing effect — they could measure it! — but they didn&#8217;t have the tools to isolate it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That missing next step, where researchers left off decades ago, is what Pluton claims to have solved.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core tech is creating small populations of organisms that no one knows how to grow individually, but you can still test their effect,&#8221; said CEO Steve Slater. &#8220;It allows us to access and grow the 99.999% of microbes that are not currently culturable, and sequence them of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Goldman and Slater were understandably reticent to talk about the specifics of their platform, their early successes speak to the efficacy of the approach, and <a href="https://www.plutonbio.com/post/pluton-biosciences-raises-6-6-million-in-seed-round-funding">a $6.6 million seed round</a> shows investors are convinced as well. (Another win for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/illuminas-accelerator-has-an-impressive-93-percent-follow-on-funding-rate-herere-its-latest-picks/">Illumina&#8217;s accelerator picks</a>.)</p>

<p>&#8220;The key is knowing how to select or screen for whatever phenotype [i.e. measurable characteristics of an organism] it is you care about, whether it&#8217;s sequestering carbon or killing insects or fungi, then rapidly getting down to the set of organisms or genes that are performing that particular function,&#8221; said Slater. By a unique process they are able to perform this isolation process and get the sequencing done on organisms of interest.</p>
<p>To prove the validity of this &#8220;Micromining engine,&#8221; they explained that they decided to search for a natural pesticide that acts on mosquitoes, which are of course a serious threat in many regions. As Slater put it: &#8220;We asked, can we find novel, uncharacterized microbes that have the ability to kill mosquitoes? Yes, and it was actually pretty straightforward — we literally did it in months, and they came out of Barry&#8217;s backyard.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it seems remarkable that such a discovery was just lying in wait literally under the founder&#8217;s nose, you may be underestimating the extent of biodiversity in microorganisms. It&#8217;s one of those &#8220;surprising science facts&#8221; we don&#8217;t pay much attention to, but that sounds familiar — that a shovel full of soil contains a gazillion organisms, or a million species never seen by science, etc. We all absorb that and think, &#8220;Yes, life is everywhere, very inspiring.&#8221;</p>

<p>But these aren&#8217;t just organisms differing by a fraction of a percent in their genome — bacteria and other microbes are amazingly diverse and change quickly, and instantly fill niches we had no idea existed, finding a way to live off the castoff molecules of fructose production in a plant or a bit of warmth and decaying matter below the surface. Any one of these vastly different organisms may very well have developed on its own a novel chemical pathway that could transform food production, drug manufacturing or agriculture.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latter that Pluton is concerned with. The agriculture sector, like many others, is (driven by several motives) looking at how to reduce its carbon emissions. Pluton is working with Bayer AG on a microbe-based soil additive that could accomplish a number of things all by simply amplifying the effects of organisms likely already present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our proof-of-concept research predicts that the right grouping of microbes, applied in a spray at planting and harvest, can scrub nearly two tons of carbon from the air per acre of farmland per year, while replenishing nutrients in the soil,&#8221; the company says.</p>

<p>And the mosquito treatment could be commercialized as well as a naturally derived pesticide that&#8217;s more effective than many out there today to which the insect has developed a resistance.</p>
<p>Other companies are working along parallel lines. On one hand, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/pivot-bio-rakes-in-430m-round-d-as-modified-microbes-prove-their-worth-in-agriculture/">Pivot Biosciences</a> has raised an enormous amount of money to in essence make microbes in soil produce their own fertilizer. And <a href="https://www.hexagonbio.com/news/hexagon-bio-to-advance-novel-small-molecule-medicines/">Hexagon Bio</a> also recently raised on a similar proposition of locating naturally occurring molecules for use in drug development. In other words, Nature&#8217;s vault is being raided — but it&#8217;s not about to run dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the hardest thing to explain to investors,&#8221; said Goldman. &#8220;How do you explain the scale of a trillion species?&#8221;</p>
<p>All the same they seem to have had some success, as evidenced by the $6.6 million seed. It was led by Oakland&#8217;s Better Ventures, with participation from the Grantham Foundation, Fall Line Capital, First In Ventures, Wing Venture Capital and Yield Lab Institute. The money should allow Pluton to start operating like a real company — moving part time staff to full time, building out the lab and so on. They might even consider moving beyond the biodiversity of Goldman&#8217;s backyard.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Let’s be really generous to Facebook and assume that 50% of what Frances Haugen just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">testified</a> to before Congress was misconstrued in some way.</p>
<p>Regardless, Facebook will argue their case (as they always do), deny everything (as they always do) and claim that no one really understands them (as they always do). Everyone will view whatever they say with extreme skepticism, and nothing will change.</p>
<p>Maybe Facebook doesn’t care. Maybe the possibility of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/section-230-health-misinformation-act/">repeal of their liability</a> protection from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the threat of antitrust prosecutions, the implementation of a U.S. privacy framework akin to what exists in Europe and the inability to get Washington to authorize Libra (Facebook’s digital payment system) all don’t matter.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2214123" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Facebook is rich and powerful. They may think they can handle anything that comes their way. But the United States government and the media combined are a lot more powerful. And that’s why Facebook needs to change their strategy on just about everything related to politics, regulation and media.</p>
<p>While Facebook’s lawyers and lobbyists dig in for the next phase of an epic, costly confrontation, they should instead be charting an alternative course of humility, introspection and transparency as their best and only strategy for sustaining growth.</p>
<p>What does this look like? Well, it starts with an apology.</p>
<p>It’s incredible that someone as smart as Mark Zuckerberg can have so much difficulty expressing genuine contrition when it’s called for. Not every mistake will obligate the CEO to drag himself over the coals. But right now? He’s got to change his posture and start accepting responsibility and then actually implement real change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, take Haugen’s testimony about an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">internal study</a> finding that Instagram has a negative impact on teenage girls’ mental health.</p>
<p>That’s a problem Facebook <em>has</em> to own. They should <em>want</em> to own it. Because even if the federal government is unlikely to step in and censor Instagram, parents probably will. As much as my wife and I try to let our teenage daughter make her own decisions, the more we know about Instagram, the more convinced we are that its negative effects vastly outweigh any useful purpose it serves in her life. And we’re not alone. At some point soon, we could be the majority.</p>
<p>Second, it’s time for Facebook to be a lot more straightforward about its underlying business model. Consumers aren’t stupid; we know we don’t get something for nothing. So rather than pretend they don’t monetize people’s data in every way possible, Facebook should just be honest about it.</p>
<p>“If you want to keep using Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp for free, we’re going to sell ads based on your data.” And then give the public an alternative: “If you want your data protected, then you have to pay the platform a monthly fee to make up for the lost revenue.” People may not like that at first, but they’ll understand it and they’ll appreciate being treated like adults.</p>
<p>Third, Facebook needs to admit the truth about content moderation: “We thought we knew better than everyone else about everything; we dug in when we should have been honestly examining and changing our practices and policies. We’re genuinely, truly sorry for it. We’re willing to change.”</p>
<p>Some of that may mean sharing oversight responsibilities with third parties like regulators and academics. It probably means eliminating some content that generates clicks and ad revenue. It may even mean removing some of the top executives responsible for doggedly implementing the deny-reality strategy over the past 10 years. Of course, that will hurt. They still need to do it.</p>
<p>Finally, if Facebook is going to engage in federal legislation around issues like privacy restrictions, new antitrust standards or the repeal of Section 230, they should stop trying to outsmart and outspend everyone.</p>
<p>Instead, Facebook should engage with their critics &#8212; in both parties and in both chambers of Congress &#8212; to work toward a solution that embraces the ideals of existing privacy frameworks like Europe’s GDPR and California’s CCPA and recognizes that having full immunity from anything said on your platform has to change. Be part of the change, not the roadblock to it.</p>
<p>This isn’t China. Our government won’t just one day outlaw Facebook or Instagram. But that doesn’t mean Facebook won’t be subjected to new laws, regulations, standards and social norms.</p>
<p>Facebook has alienated the media. They’ve lost the progressives. They’ve lost the conservatives. They’ve infuriated the center. And even if revenue keeps growing, they’ve lost the faith and trust of the public, too.</p>
<p>Executives may worry that once the legislative flywheel starts turning, it will never stop. But we’re way beyond that point. If Facebook doesn’t start expressing remorse, accountability and openness to change, they’re at risk of losing everything else they’ve built, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube announced several <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/129769858/updates-to-captions-and-audio-features-on-youtube?hl=en">new audio features</a> on Thursday, some of which have already rolled out while others will launch in the coming months. Starting today, creators have the ability to enable live auto-captions for any livestreams in English to make streams more accessible. This feature was previously only available to creators with more than 1,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>YouTube plans to expand live auto-captions to all 13 supported captioning languages in the coming months. The supported languages include Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Turkish and Vietnamese.</p>
<p>The company is also currently testing the ability to add multiple audio tracks on videos to help provide multi-language audio for international audiences along with descriptive audio for people with vision impairments. The feature is currently available to a small group of creators. YouTube plans to roll out the feature more widely in the coming quarters.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215061" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>YouTube is also rolling out auto-translation for captions in supported languages on Android and iOS later this year. The feature is currently only available on the desktop version of the platform. Further, YouTube plans to give users the option to search through transcripts on Android and iOS. Later this year, YouTube will test the ability for users to search for specific keywords within transcripts on mobile.</p>
<p>Additionally, YouTube is working on new channel permissions in YouTube Studio that allow creators to delegate caption and subtitle creation on their videos to someone they trust. The company previously announced this feature under the name &#8220;Subtitle Editor&#8221; and has acknowledged that the rollout of the feature is taking longer than expected. YouTube notes that it’s actively working on the feature and plans to keep creators updated in the coming months.</p>
<p>“Improving accessibility is a top priority for YouTube, and we hope these updates will help creators reach a wider audience,” the company stated in a community blog post.</p>
<p>YouTube first launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/03/04/youtube-launches-auto-captions-for-all-videos/">auto-captions in 2010</a> and has since worked to improve them and make them more widely available. The company brought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/26/youtube-live-gains-automatic-captions-chat-replay-and-more/">auto-captions to YouTube Live</a> in 2018. YouTube is among many other platforms working to launch more features geared toward improving captions in order to make their platforms more inclusive and accessible. For instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/tiktok-adds-auto-captions-to-make-videos-accessible-to-hard-of-hearing-and-deaf/">TikTok added auto-captions</a> to its videos earlier this year while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/instagram-adds-a-captions-option-for-stories-and-soon-reels/">Instagram added a captions option</a> for Stories around the same time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, whose high-profile antitrust lawsuit against Apple<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/"> is now under appeal,</a> is today <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1445896711679840265">calling out</a> the iPhone maker for giving itself access to an advertising slot its competitors don&#8217;t have: the iPhone&#8217;s Settings screen. Some iOS 15 users noticed Apple is now advertising its own services at the top of their Settings, just below their Apple ID. The services being suggested are personalized to the device owner, based on which ones they already subscribe to, it appears.</p>
<p>For example, those without an Apple Music subscription may see an ad offering a free six-month trial. However, current Apple Music subscribers may instead see a prompt to add on a service they don&#8217;t yet have, like AppleCare coverage for their devices.</p>
<p>Sweeney suggests this sort of first-party advertising is an anticompetitive risk for Apple, as some of the services it&#8217;s pushing here are those that directly compete with third-party apps published on its App Store. But those third-party apps can&#8217;t gain access to the iPhone&#8217;s Settings screen, of course &#8212; they can only bid for ad slots within the App Store itself.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215037" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Writes Sweeney: &#8220;New from the guys who banned Fortnite: settings-screen ads for their own music service, which come before the actual settings, and which aren’t available to other advertisers like Spotify or Sound Cloud.&#8221;</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">New from the guys who banned Fortnite: settings-screen ads for their own music service, which come before the actual settings, and which aren’t available to other advertisers like Spotify or Sound Cloud. “It’s all about the customers!” <a href="https://t.co/p9FNpXT1Rx">https://t.co/p9FNpXT1Rx</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1445896711679840265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Sweeney had been retweeting another post by Mobile Dev Memo analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/eric_seufert">Eric Seufert</a>, who himself was sharing an image credited to Glassfy co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/zuck_fredo">Francesco Zucchetta</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zucchetta tells TechCrunch he spotted the ad on an iPhone 8 he owned which was running iOS 15. But others have seen the ads on newer devices, as well. And some respondents noted they <a href="https://twitter.com/simoarcher/status/1445989349548560384">were receiving</a> Apple&#8217;s promotions as push notifications, too.</p>
<p>The issue here is tricky because the promotion isn&#8217;t always a situation where Apple is disadvantaging a rival to its own benefit.</p>
<p>For example, on an iPhone 13 Pro Max we have which is running iOS 15.1, the prompt was used to inform us we still had a certain number of days left to add AppleCare+ coverage. (We already have most of Apple&#8217;s other subscriptions.). But in this case, there aren&#8217;t third-party apps offering a direct competitor to AppleCare, in the same way that Spotify directly competes with Apple Music. Instead, warranty companies like Asurion<a href="https://twitter.com/eric_seufert"> partner with mobile carriers</a> like AT&amp;T and Verizon to sell their iPhone insurance plans, instead of selling direct to consumers through the App Store.</p>
<p>Some might even argue that a reminder to add warranty coverage is a useful feature, not an unwanted intrusion.</p>
<p>While Sweeney&#8217;s tweet has raised awareness of the first-party promotions in Settings, they are not new.</p>
<p>Apple has often used the iPhone&#8217;s Settings screen to market its services to its customers in much of the same way as it&#8217;s doing now.</p>
<p>Last year, for example, it was spotted <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1327979418954977283">running promotions for Apple Arcade</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyrodgersis/status/1420152172939857923">AppleCare</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/austinnotduncan/status/1243343916398592000">Apple TV+ </a><a href="https://twitter.com/robleathern/status/1230173595579498496">in Settings</a>. Outside of this screen, Apple has also promoted its own services in other unusual ways, including through the use of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/02/16/apple-music-referral-notifications-disable/">push notifications</a>. And it has cross-promoted its services inside its own apps for years &#8212; like <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250837726">prompts to subscribe to Apple Music</a> while using <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-hide-apple-music-itunes-2941858">iTunes</a>.</p>
<p>But regulators today are taking a closer look at platforms and how they&#8217;re using or abusing their market power. Google is currently <a href="https://twitter.com/simoarcher/status/1445989349548560384">appealing a record penalty in the EU</a> for its requirement that device manufacturers preinstall Google&#8217;s suite of apps with the phones they sell. Samsung, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630332/samsung-ads-default-stock-apps-weather-pay-theme-confirmed">said it would stop</a> running ads in its first-party apps on Galaxy devices. (It had displayed ads for other companies and those that <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/09/samsung-galaxy-ads-turn-off/">promoted its own products</a>, at times.)</p>
<p>Epic Games didn&#8217;t have any further comments on Sweeney&#8217;s tweet, including whether or not the company would be using this latest bit of information in its upcoming appeal. Apple has been asked for comment but has not responded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> announced today that it has acquired <a href="http://Ally.io">Ally.io</a>, a software service that helps companies measure their progress against OKRs (objectives and key results), a common way the management measures both individual and company progress. The two firms did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>Microsoft plans to incorporate Ally into its Viva family of employee experience products. Microsoft says the idea behind Viva and the Ally acquisition is to provide a more transparent way to communicate company goals and objectives to employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aligning employee work to the company’s strategic mission and core priorities is top of mind for every organization. To do this, leaders need to invest in tools that communicate transparency around big company bets and create ways to cascade aspirational goals and report results at all levels of an organization,&#8221; Kirk Koenigsbauer, chief operating officer &amp; corporate vice president in charge of experiences and devices wrote <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/10/07/microsoft-acquires-ally-io-to-improve-employee-experience-by-aligning-peoples-work-with-team-goals-and-company-mission/">in a blog post</a> announcing the deal.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215081" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="s1XLiovL0X"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/what-can-the-okr-software-sector-tell-us-about-startup-growth-more-generally/">What can the OKR software sector tell us about startup growth more generally?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What can the OKR software sector tell us about startup growth more generally?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/what-can-the-okr-software-sector-tell-us-about-startup-growth-more-generally/embed/#?secret=s1XLiovL0X" data-secret="s1XLiovL0X" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As for Ally, CEO and founder Vetri Vellore says that this will enable his company to grow the product much more quickly as part of Microsoft than he could have on his own. &#8220;As a part of Microsoft Viva, Ally.io will continue to give leaders, teams and individuals the ability to align and focus everyday work to the company’s most important objectives. We will help bring goals and purpose to wherever the team is doing work including Teams, Outlook, Slack and the other systems you use every day,&#8221; Vellore wrote <a href="https://ally.io/blog/microsoft-acquires-ally-okrs/">in a blog post</a> on the Ally website.</p>
<p>Understanding your work objectives and how they fit with the broader company goals has become even more important in an age when many more people are working at home and aren&#8217;t sitting in face-to-face meetings with management. Having those goals and expectations laid out and incorporated into the work tools people are using as remote employees should help keep everyone on track and pointed in the same direction.</p>
<p>While Microsoft declined to share the price of the transaction, <a href="http://pitchbook.com/">PitchBook data indicates</a> that Ally last raised capital at a $345 million post-money valuation. That price was set when the company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/ally-io-rasies-50m-series-c-as-the-okr-software-market-stays-explosive/"> raised $50 million earlier this year</a> for a total of $76 million raised.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The exit of Ally to Microsoft could signal the start of a round of consolidation in the OKR-focused software market. There are many players competing for the lead, including WorkBoard, Koan, Gtmhub, Perdoo and WeekDone.</p>
<p>As a startup cohort, they have done incredibly well in terms of attracting venture capital and growing early-stage revenues. And now with an exit under their belt, the collection of companies will have to choose to keep their venture-funded approach to growth intact or shift to dual-tracking private rounds with possible exits to mega-tech companies.</p>
<p>With Microsoft buying Ally, which is also headquartered in Washington state, it could set the stage for other major platform players to buy and offer similar tooling. It’s not impossible to imagine any of the other usual acquisitive suspects &#8212; from Salesforce to ServiceNow to SAP &#8212; considering making a similar move and plucking one of these properties off the market.</p>
<p>For now though, just Ally is off the board, and we will have to watch to see how the rest of the market develops as a result of this move.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Throughout its history as a public company, Box has had a bit of a bumpy ride. The company was founded back in 2005 as a simple consumer file sharing service, but shifted a few years later to focus on enterprise and build a modern content management system for the still-developing cloud and mobile world.</p>
<p>Once a Silicon Valley startup darling, Box fell hard <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/box-files-for-250m-ipo-on-full-year-revenue-of-124m-net-loss-of-168m/">after filing its S-1</a> to go public in 2015 as people questioned its cash burn rate. That led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/23/why-is-box-taking-so-long-to-pull-ipo-trigger/">its IPO being delayed for months</a>, perhaps a sign of the struggles it would have finding traction in the market in later years. Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/activist-investor-starboard-value-makes-official-bid-for-box-board-seats-in-letter/">Box had a proxy battle</a> with one of its larger shareholders, Starboard Value, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/box-wins-proxy-board-battle-with-activist-investor-starboard-value/#:~:text=Box%20wins%20proxy%20board%20battle%20with%20activist%20investor%20Starboard%20Value,-Ron%20Miller%40ron_miller&amp;text=A%20battle%20between%20Box%20and,of%20directors%20easily%20defeated%20Starboard's.">the company eventually won</a>.</p>
<p>It is now a pivotal moment for the cloud content management company. Box has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">$500 million investment from KKR</a>, which means it has funds to buy some small companies, fill in the product road map and perhaps fuel some inorganic growth, as it did when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">it bought e-signature company SignRequest</a> in February.</p>
<p>Box has been on a bit of a revenue roll as well, in recent quarters. After posting 13.6% growth in in the third quarter of FY20, it began a downward trend that saw growth drop to 8.3% in the fourth quarter of FY21. That was when Starboard decided to pick its proxy fight. But Box came off the mat from that nadir, beginning a slow upward trajectory that its management is projecting will continue for the next few quarters.</p>

<p>This chart doesn’t detail huge growth, but it shows growth all the same. Co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie has faced down trouble before, and he took a mostly conciliatory tone when it came to his detractors, admitting that there was much to learn and he&#8217;s always been about improving the company.</p>
<p>We spoke to Levie about his trials and tribulations and where he expects to take his company from here.</p>
<h2>Onward through it all</h2>
<p>The last year hasn&#8217;t been easy for Levie as leader of a company in the midst of a proxy battle, but the CEO says he has not lost his optimism or his enthusiasm for the job. That is impressive when you consider he started the company in a dorm room at USC in 2005 — he&#8217;s been working on Box his entire adult life.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s one thread that runs through any difficult situation we&#8217;ve ever been in, it&#8217;s actually just my sheer excitement and optimism for the future. And I have that optimism about technology in general and its impact on the world, and what it can do for us. I have that even more so for Box, specifically, and the opportunity around what we&#8217;re building,&#8221; Levie told TechCrunch.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[We're beginning to see why it feels so busy out there. It is!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following a record-breaking second quarter, venture capitalists around the world stayed busy in Q3, investing astronomical sums into global startups.</p>
<p>Since the back half of 2020 kicked off and the venture capital and startup worlds discovered that COVID and its related economic impacts were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux/">largely set to miss the upstart technology market</a>, investors have been busy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">stuffing ever-larger amounts of cash into new companies around the world</a>. The acceleration of capital deployment has generated more unicorns, more mega-rounds and simply more available dollars than ever before in the history of startups.</p>
<p>The deluge of record venture capital data points can be difficult to put into context at times. In the coming weeks, TechCrunch will explore the global Q3 venture capital market’s results in detail, by business genre (fintech, edtech, etc.) and geography, along with notes on stage-by-stage data and more.</p>
<p>Today, however, we’re taking a high-level look. Thanks to a <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">fresh report from CB Insights</a>, we have a sheaf of numbers to unpack. To start, we’re looking at the third quarter from four perspectives: <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> will look at aggregate numbers, <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann</a> will provide an overview of unicorn results, <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna</a> is looking into geographic outliers and <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanlawler">Ryan</a> has notes on fintech.</p>
<p>Lots to come, but this is the first look. Let’s get into the data!</p>
<h2>All-time record venture capital activity</h2>
<p>After some $156 billion was invested into global startups in the second quarter, the third quarter managed to just top the record by $2 billion, as investors put $158 billion to work in the last three months. The numbers are effectively a tie, meaning that we’ve just lived through the two strongest periods for investment into private companies in the history of startups.</p>
<p>This year is looking simply superlative.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re building a startup to the stars, you’ll find an un-earthly amount of opportunity waiting for you at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=earlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=earlypricingsunsetpost&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> on December 14-15. This virtual two-day conference focuses on all aspects of a sector — both public and private — that’s thrilling, complex and expanding at an incredible pace.</p>
<p>You won’t find a better or more targeted platform to showcase your space technology. Global in its reach, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=earlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=earlypricingsunsetpost&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> is expected to increase attendance by 30% over last year’s inaugural event. We’re talking the top CEOs, founders, scientists, engineers and investors determined to expand humanity’s reach into and far beyond our orbit.</p>
<p>Only a very limited number of space startups will be allowed to exhibit this year, which means you’ll receive more access to investors, aerospace primes and government entities that can cut through mountains of red tape.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2212631" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>Don’t space out:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=earlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=earlypricingsunsetpost&amp;display=true">Buy a Space Startup Exhibitor Package</a> ($345 &#8211; prices increase next week!) and get your space startup in front of the industry’s leading movers and shakers.</p>
<p>Bring your team and connect with opportunities; the exhibitor package includes full event access for four people, virtual booth space, lead-generation capabilities, breakout sessions, networking and video on demand. Exhibitors will also take part in a pitch feedback session with TC staff over both days.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to space than blasting billionaires into it and, when you’re not networking, you’ll hear major players on the TC Sessions stage talking about commercial launches, data-gathering satellites and human space flight missions. You’ll also hear from space-happy VCs like Tess Hatch, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners.</p>
<p>She knows her stuff when it comes to frontier tech — from space commercialization, drones and autonomous vehicles to the future of agriculture and food technology. You don’t want to miss her insights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We’re accepting speaker applications until October 15, so if you’d like to toss your space helmet into the ring or have a recommendation, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/KUFW2e?typeform-source=techcrunch.com">fill out this submission form</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[Developer marketer Adam DuVander explains why education should be the focus for companies that market directly to developers. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Most of the technical content published misses the mark with developers. I think we can all do a better job,&#8221; author and developer marketing expert <a href="https://www.adamd.org/">Adam DuVander</a> says.</p>
<p>That was the very realization that led DuVander to share what he had learned about marketing to developers in two ways: He recently launched a book, <a href="https://everydeveloper.com/developer-marketing/book/">&#8220;Developer Marketing Does Not Exist,&#8221;</a> and also works through his consultancy, <a href="https://everydeveloper.com/">EveryDeveloper</a>, which helps its clients, including Algolia, HelloSign and Stoplight, with technical content strategy and production.</p>
<p>DuVander was recommended to us by Karl Hughes, the CEO of Draft.dev, which specializes in content production for developer-focused companies. When we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/draft-dev-ceo-karl-hughes-on-the-importance-of-using-experts-in-developer-marketing/">interviewed him last July</a>, Hughes explained that he would refer leads to EveryDeveloper when they needed to sort out their content strategy.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2212513" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hughes was therefore happy to recommend DuVander via our experts survey. (You can share your own recommendations <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">here</a>!) &#8220;Adam draws from deep experience as a developer and developer advocate to make sure his clients set a winning strategy in motion,&#8221; he wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This made us curious, so we got ourselves a copy of DuVander&#8217;s book and reached out to him for additional insights. The main takeaway? If you are reaching out to developers, you&#8217;ll absolutely want to avoid coming across as too promotional or too generic.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more:</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><b>Why did you write a book titled “Developer Marketing Does Not Exist”?</b></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212518" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212518" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2212518" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?w=300" alt="Adam DuVander" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212518" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adam DuVander</p></div></p>
<p>Developer marketers certainly exist, because I work with them every day. The book title is a call to these marketers to treat their technical audience differently. To reach more developers requires more education and less promotion. Your “marketing” should not feel like marketing.</p>
<p>The idea for this book dates back to my time at <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> (2009-2014). Every press release looked the same. A company has a new API, but they haven’t bothered to explain why developers should care.</p>
<p>After ProgrammableWeb, I spent five years on the provider side in developer marketing roles. The book is a compilation of the philosophy I learned and created along the way. I hope the book helps anyone who wants to reach developers directly in an authentic way.</p>
<p><b>You mentioned reaching &#8220;the right developers.&#8221; What does that mean?</b></p>
<p>Every developer (the origin of our name) has a few basic needs, like clear documentation, help getting started and use cases to spark creativity.</p>
<p>The educational and inspirational content you use to attract developers will depend on who is the best fit for your product. If you provide a mobile SDK, the right developer is building iOS and Android apps. If your customers are data engineers, it probably won’t make sense to discuss front-end web technologies.</p>
<p>If the most common developer marketer mistake is being too promotional, the second is being too generic. Be specific with the best developer match for your product.</p>
<p><b>What are some arguments in favor of getting external help for developer marketing?</b></p>
<p>It’s tough for companies to see their own products the way someone outside that company does. Also, they may not have the development background within their marketing team to fully understand the audience.</p>
<p>In addition, hiring a full-time, experienced developer marketer can be difficult and expensive. An outside partner can provide better results, often for less than a full-time salary.</p>
<p><b>And what should startups keep in mind when picking these partners?</b></p>
<p>Look for that magical combination of technical skill and communications. The &#8220;education, not promotion&#8221; ethos should be obvious in the work they do.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p><b>This brings us to EveryDeveloper — can you tell us more about it?</b></p>
<p>EveryDeveloper helps attract the right developers to our clients’ technical products. Our content strategy plans remove the guesswork and enable companies to produce content developers want to read.</p>
<p>There are about a dozen of us, split between content strategy and production. Most of the team can write code but prefer to write words about code.</p>
<p>Once we have jointly created a developer content strategy with a client, we’ll typically deliver two to four pieces a month.</p>
<p><b>What type of clients are best suited for the help you provide?</b></p>
<p>Anyone can benefit from fresh eyes on their developer experience and an objective plan to attract developers.</p>
<p>Those with a full staff of developer advocates or experienced developer marketers are best set up to execute on the plan we deliver. We sometimes work with unlaunched products, but usually there’s some initial success they are looking to amplify and improve. We also advise clients on how to build internal expertise.</p>
<p>All in all, we’ve helped companies from seed stage to Fortune 50 create better developer content strategies. The difference is whether it’s a product or an entire company that needs to reach more developers.</p>
<p><b>Do you have some recommendations for content and activities that you encourage companies to come up with?</b></p>
<p>EveryDeveloper focuses on content, which I believe is the most scalable way to reach developers. Blog articles are certainly core, but you want to make sure you’re covering the right topics in the right way. Don’t just publish to check a box. Make sure what you write has a strategic purpose and is something a developer wants to read. I think most developer-focused companies publishing multiple times per week would be better off with fewer, deeper pieces.</p>
<p>Other types of content include deep subject matter guides that barely mention the product (see the <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/blog/the-developer-content-mind-trick-for-signature-content/">Developer Content Mind Trick</a>) and all sorts of documentation.</p>
<p>Outside content, there’s events (in-person and virtual), advertising, sponsorships, open source and tools. I cover all of these in the book and the philosophy is the same: You’re more likely to attract developers when you aim to educate and inspire first.</p>
<p><b>What are some good targets for developer-oriented startups to sponsor? What should they keep in mind when it comes to sponsorship?</b></p>
<p>You want to use the same &#8220;education over promotion&#8221; philosophy even when you’re paying for the message. Developers are always skeptical, but especially with advertising.</p>
<p>Look for where your developers are already learning and getting their development news. If your sponsorship can feel as naturally helpful as other content from that source, you’ll be doing well.</p>
<p>I encourage developer marketers to think broadly about the sites, podcasts, events and tools they sponsor. Your best partner may not do any sponsorship yet.</p>
<p><b>In your book, you mention Netlify as an example others might want to follow when it comes to using tools as developer marketing. Could you sum that up? And why are acquisitions a good option in this context?</b></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212519" style="width: 205px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212519" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2212519 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png?w=195" alt="Book cover - Developer Marketing Does Not Exist - Adam DuVander" width="195" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png?resize=97,150 97w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png?resize=195,300 195w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png?resize=768,1183 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png?resize=442,680 442w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png?resize=32,50 32w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212519" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adam DuVander</p></div></p>
<p>There are dozens of technology choices for content management and static site generation. That leads to hundreds of potential combinations and can be overwhelming for a developer that wants to build something new. Netlify recognized that problem and built filtered galleries to help developers choose the right tools.</p>
<p>It goes to show that developer-focused companies can recognize a problem their audience wants solved and build a tool to address it.</p>
<p>Better yet, look for existing tools that already have traction. Sponsor or even acquire them. I write about &#8220;the Runscope playbook&#8221; in the book, because they executed this strategy fabulously.</p>
<p><b>Do you have any final piece of advice to share with developer-focused companies?</b></p>
<p>Developer experience is foundational for developer-focused companies. They should continually look to improve the experience — both initial and ongoing. It takes a lot of effort and resources to reach the right developers, and too many companies send them directly into a poor experience.</p>
<p>You want to make it clear you have a product for developers, show what’s possible and get them started quickly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">RoboTire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/your-next-tire-change-could-be-performed-by-a-robot/">crossed our radar in February of last year</a>, just before much of the world was brought to a complete standstill courtesy of the pandemic. Things were still fairly early stages for the Detroit-based startup, which was founded by former Spark Robotics CEO Victor Darolfi.</p>
<p>The company has clearly picked up some good, strategic interest in the intervening year and a half, as more and more industries are looking to embrace the benefits of automation. Today it announced that it has raised a $7.5 million Series A round, led by The Reinalt-Thomas Corporation, the major tire retail brand behind Discount Tire and America’s Tire. The latter, funnily enough, got a bit of a mixed shout-out when we spoke to Darolfi last year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2214611" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2214611" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2214611" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RoboTire-Image-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RoboTire-Image-2.jpeg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RoboTire-Image-2.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RoboTire-Image-2.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RoboTire-Image-2.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RoboTire-Image-2.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RoboTire-Image-2.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RoboTire-Image-2.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RoboTire-Image-2.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2214611" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> RoboTire</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2214639" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“I sat at America’s Tires for three hours and thought, hey, we use robots to put tires on at the factory,” he told us. “Why don’t we bring robots into the service industry?” Clearly Reinalt-Thomas was listening. The company was joined by Automotive Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners and 640 Oxford Ventures in the round. RoboTire says the funding will go toward expanding its operations in Detroit.</p>
<p>The underlying technology is capable of changing a set of tires in less than 15 minutes, by the company’s count. From the sound of things, Discount Tire will be among the first to adopt the automated tech.</p>

<p>“Discount Tire is excited to support RoboTire in the development of new and innovative technologies that drive a better customer experience,” Discount Tire Chief Experience Officer Tom Williams said in a release. “As customer expectations around the ‘buy and book online’ experience and our ability to deliver reduced wait times continue to grow, we will continue to pursue automation and enhancements that ensure an inviting, easy and safe experience for all our customers.”</p>

		Henry Mahncke has a Ph.D. in neuroscience from UCSF and is the CEO of Posit Science, developers of the <a href="https://www.brainhq.com/">BrainHQ</a> brain training program.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The war is over now. Our troops have come home, many after years of service across multiple tours of duty. And as they return, their next phase of service begins — to their families, where they are parents to children and caregivers to parents, and to their communities, where they will return to school or launch new careers.</p>
<p>But for far too many, the battle continues. Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) — considered to be the signature injury of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars — were sustained by more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/military/index.html">430,000 U.S. service members</a>. The most common type of TBI is the somewhat misleadingly named “mild” TBI (mTBI, or concussion), <a href="https://www.brainline.org/article/how-many-service-members-have-sustained-tbi">affecting more than 82% of service members diagnosed with TBIs</a>.</p>
<p>Many were able to recover from those injuries, but thousands are plagued by persistent cognitive issues affecting speed, attention and memory — years after their injury — that make it challenging to return to work, school and family roles. People with a history of TBI are also at higher risk for complications from other conditions, notably pre-dementia and dementia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2214032" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That’s a burden on those service members and their families &#8212; and it’s also a burden on our nation because the talents and experience of these citizens aren’t being used to their fullest potential.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense recognized this problem more than 10 years ago and called for academic and industry researchers to find new kinds of treatments for this new kind of war injury. A number of research groups answered the call. At Posit Science, where I am a scientist and the CEO, we responded with a team including leading clinicians from military hospitals and VA medical centers from around the country with a proposal to put a new kind of computerized brain training to the test.</p>
<p>We recognized we had to solve two problems to help service members with TBI.</p>
<p>First, the brain training program needed to work. Fortunately, we built a brain training program, <a href="http://www.brainhq.com/">BrainHQ</a>, shown to improve cognitive function in older adults through multiple studies funded by the National Institutes of Health — we just needed to adapt it for use by younger service members. The brain training exercises in BrainHQ work differently than traditional cognitive training because they are designed to improve the fundamentals of information processing in the brain using brain plasticity — the ability of the brain to rewire itself through learning and experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Second, the brain training program needed to reach people where they were. Many active duty service members and veterans don’t have the ability to come into a clinic several times a week for several months for in-person treatments — they’re about to be deployed, or they’re going back to school or work, or they’re located in areas outside of big cities with top clinics. Computerized brain training can be helpful here: Because it’s delivered over the internet, it can reach people in their own homes on their own schedules — wherever they are and whenever they have time.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/144/7/1994/6328669">BRAVE Study, which was published this summer in the journal Brain</a>, five U.S. military and veterans hospitals enrolled 83 patients diagnosed with a history of cognitive impairment and mTBI in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. The average participant in the study had experienced persistent cognitive issues for more than seven years before this intervention.</p>
<p>The BRAVE study pitted the intervention of BrainHQ plasticity-based exercises against attention-demanding video games, used as an active control. The researchers found significant improvements in overall cognition among those who used BrainHQ compared to the video game control. While the intervention did not make each patient a genius, it did result in an average gain equal to about 24 percentile points (like moving from the 50<sup>th</sup> to the 74<sup>th</sup> percentile). This was the first scalable intervention of any kind to achieve a significant gain in a gold standard study of mTBI.</p>
<p>Those results were confirmed and extended in<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34420987/"> a second study from NYU, which was recently published in the journal NeuroRehabilitation</a>. That study was of 48 civilians with a mix of mild, moderate and severe TBIs. These researchers found a significant gain in an objective measure of overall cognition in patients using BrainHQ. They also used a self-rated assessment of cognitive function, which showed that the patients noticed a significant improvement in their own cognitive health.</p>
<p>We weren’t the only ones to show success. Several other academic and military research groups using cognitive compensation techniques delivered in person by a trained clinician (notably <a href="https://brainhealth.utdallas.edu/programs/smart-curriculum/">SMART</a> training, developed at the Center for Brain Health at UT Dallas, and <a href="http://www.cogsmart.com/">CogSMART</a> training, developed at UCSD and the VA San Diego Healthcare System, showed good results.</p>
<p>But right now, much of this science is sitting on the shelf. Congress and the Department of Defense have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on basic science and clinical trials for TBI — but when I visit military hospitals and VA medical centers, I find dedicated health care providers who are committed to helping people but lacking the staff, space, technology or other resources to put the results of research into practice. We need a concerted effort from the Department of Defense and the Veterans Affairs Administration to move this proven science out of the lab and into the world to help people in need.</p>
<p>As the wars abroad end, we cannot forget our obligation to ensure that our nation&#8217;s warriors benefit from the research that’s been done on their behalf. We need to unleash the discoveries of that research so that they — and our entire nation — can benefit from everything they have to offer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you&#8217;re exploring a city &#8212; whether one you&#8217;re visiting on your travels or your own &#8212; there are a number of tools that can help you find out where to go, what to see and what to do, like Google Maps, Yelp, TripAdvisor and others. But a startup called <a href="https://welco.me/">Welcome</a> thinks that today&#8217;s set of tools could be smarter and more personalized to the individuals who use them. Its new app instead uses &#8220;real-time&#8221; technologies to make recommendations that take into account a user&#8217;s preferences as well as other details about their current context &#8212; like the weather, season, traffic and the popularity of the place at the current time of day &#8212; in order to provide a better-curated set of recommendations.</p>
<p>The end result is meant to be a city guide that&#8217;s more like &#8220;a concierge in your pocket,&#8221; says Welcome co-founder Matthew Rosenberg.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2214225" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2214225" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2214225" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="415" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=680,415 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=1536,937 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=2048,1249 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2214225" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Welcome</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2214102" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Rosenberg says he was inspired to build Welcome after traveling, pre-pandemic, with his then-girlfriend, now-wife, following the acquisition of his first company, a mobile video creation app called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/17/cameo-vimeos-video-editing-platform-ditches-social-networking-functionality/">Cameo</a>,<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2014/03/18/vimeo-buys-cameo/"> by Vimeo</a>. During this time, the couple explored parts of Europe, Latin America, and the U.S., which was an amazing experience he says, and one that ultimately brought them closer together, as it turned out.</p>
<p>&#8220;But something I found myself doing in those moments &#8212; we&#8217;re in all these beautiful places&#8230;we&#8217;re in an incredible museum or at a wonderful lunch &#8212; and I found myself hunched over my phone, trying to figure out where to go next,&#8221; Rosenberg explains. He was sifting through Google Maps, recommendations from friends and trying to read reviews to make a decision about what was next on their journey.</p>
<p>This led him to wonder: &#8220;why isn&#8217;t there a tool that like can be smart and go beyond just place [recommendations] &#8212; that can really look at what&#8217;s going on in my life and in the world around me, and make smarter recommendations?&#8221; he recalls.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2214220" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2214220" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2214220" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="415" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=680,415 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=1536,937 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=2048,1249 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2214220" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Welcome</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This led to the development of what&#8217;s now become <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/welcome-smart-travel-companion/id1447252527">Welcome</a>, a city guide app that combines intelligence, recommendations, personalization, and even media, like photos and videos, to help users find things to do.</p>
<p>The startup is co-founded by fellow Vimeo employees Peter Gerard, Mark Armendariz and Mark Essel, who together with Rosenberg launched an early version of Welcome back in 2019 as something of a market test. Their idea landed them some seed money from Accel, which gave them enough runway to build the version of the app they had in mind.</p>
<p>That version has <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/welcome-smart-travel-companion/id1447252527">now arrived on the App Store</a>.</p>
<p>Upon first launch, you&#8217;ll give Welcome some input about your interests and you&#8217;ll have the option to pick from a series of publishers to follow &#8212; like Condé Nast, Lonely Planet, Eater, Culture Trip, Food &amp; Wine and others &#8212; whose content is used to help inform Welcome&#8217;s recommendations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2214222" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2214222" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2214222" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="415" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=680,415 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=1536,937 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=2048,1249 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2214222" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Welcome</p></div></p>
<p>You can then scroll through the app&#8217;s home feed to see relevant articles for the city you&#8217;re currently researching or browse the map, where suggestions are marked with icons related to the place &#8212; like a cheeseburger for a restaurant, martini glass for a bar, tree for an outdoor place (like a farmers&#8217; market), and so on.</p>
<p>As you tap into each place, you&#8217;ll be presented with photos and videos, and links to get directions, the website, the phone number, as well as a button to order an Uber or Lyft, and more. You can also leave your own tips for fellow Welcome users, mark the list as a favorite and add tags.</p>
<p>As you browse the map, buttons at the top let you filter to see only a subset of places, like food, drinks, activities, arts and more.</p>
<p>The app itself is well-designed in terms of the look of its user interface, but it&#8217;s perhaps not as simple to use as an app that&#8217;s more heavily focused on collecting user-generated content &#8212; like business ratings and reviews.</p>
<p>It was not immediately obvious, for example, how you could contribute your own photos and videos to a place, as some listings offered a prominently placed &#8220;Add&#8221; button for uploading your media, while it seemed others did not. In reality, the &#8220;Add&#8221; button wasn&#8217;t missing &#8212; you just had to scroll over to the right to see it. But it wasn&#8217;t clear that the row was scrollable. It looked like the Add button simply wasn&#8217;t there. (See below examples.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2214239" style="width: 519px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2214239" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2214239" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="509" height="358" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg 1256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg?resize=768,540 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg?resize=680,478 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2214239" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> screenshots from Welcome</p></div></p>
<p>Still, Welcome&#8217;s underlying data and parsing engines are interesting. The team developed custom tools that pick up keywords in the articles from publishers and turn them into tags. Eventually, it wants to expand this technology to any site &#8212; like local blogs, for instance &#8212; which users could click and save, perhaps via a web browser extension. The team is even thinking about offering a way to ingest the travel lists and tips people collect in less obvious places &#8212; like spreadsheets, notes and emails.</p>
<p>In time, Welcome would also like to better integrate suggestions and guides from travel content creators to enhance its recommendations further. This could also later aid its business model, where premium travel guides from specific creators or publishers could be made available for a fee. The company also plans to add more ways to transact in-app, like booking tickets or other activities where a revenue share would be involved.</p>
<p>Before its public debut, Welcome grew to over 50,000 beta users across more than 350 cities worldwide and now has over 6.5 million places its database. It&#8217;s offering over 300,000 curated recommendations globally, at launch.</p>
<p>The startup is backed by a $3.5 million seed round led by Accel, with Lakestar Ventures participating. The round closed in 2020 but hadn&#8217;t yet been announced. Including pre-seed funding, Welcome has raised $4.2 million to date.</p>
<p>Welcome&#8217;s app, for the time being, is available <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/welcome-smart-travel-companion/id1447252527">on iOS only</a> as a free download.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Department of Justice has said it will launch civil legal action against federal contractors if they fail to report cyberattacks or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-breach/">data breaches</a>.</p>
<p>The Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative, introduced by Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco this week, will leverage the existing False Claims Act (FCA) to “pursue cybersecurity-related fraud by government contractors and grant recipients.”</p>
<p>The initiative will hold entities, such as federal contractors or individuals, accountable when they put U.S. cyber infrastructure at risk by knowingly providing flawed cybersecurity products or services, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/deputy-attorney-general-lisa-o-monaco-announces-new-civil-cyber-fraud-initiative">according to a DOJ press release</a>. Similarly, government contractors now also face penalties for &#8220;violating obligations&#8221; to monitor and report cybersecurity incidents and breaches.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2214082" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest response by the Biden administration following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/">a spate of hacks</a> targeting federal agencies, including the Treasury, the State Department and Homeland Security. The DOJ later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">blamed</a> hackers working for Russia&#8217;s foreign intelligence service, the SVR, for the espionage campaign. The Russian hackers broke into SolarWinds’ network and planted a backdoor in its Orion software, which helps companies monitor their networks and fleets of devices, and pushed it directly to customer networks with a tainted software update.</p>
<p>The initiative will help it build “broad resiliency” against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> intrusions across the public sector and will help government efforts to identify, create and publicize patches for vulnerabilities in commonly used products and services, according to the DOJ. It will also help the government reclaim losses from the companies if found to have failed to meet the government&#8217;s security standards.</p>
<p>“For too long, companies have chosen silence under the mistaken belief that it is less risky to hide a breach than to bring it forward and to report it,” said Monaco. “Well that changes today. We are announcing today that we will use our civil enforcement tools to pursue companies, those who are government contractors who receive federal funds, when they fail to follow required cybersecurity standards — because we know that puts all of us at risk. This is a tool that we have to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used appropriately and guard the public fisc and public trust.”</p>
<p>The timing of the unveiling of the initiative coincides with the creation of a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, which has been set up to tackle complex investigations and criminal cases of cryptocurrency misuse.</p>
<p>Also this week Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Deborah Ross <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a-new-us-bill-would-force-companies-to-disclose-ransomware-payments/">proposed a new bicameral bill, the Ransom Disclosure Act</a>, which would require ransomware victims to disclose details of any ransom amount paid within 48 hours.</p>
