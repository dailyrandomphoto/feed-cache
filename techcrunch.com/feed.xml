										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space startup Astroscale has launched ELSA-d, the demonstration mission for its End-of-Life Services by Astroscale (ELSA) technology, which aims to dock with, and then safely remove, orbital debris. Astroscale&#8217;s demonstrator package includes two separate payloads, a servicer that represents its future production spacecraft, and a &#8216;client&#8217; satellite that&#8217;s meant to represent the debris satellites it&#8217;ll be de-orbiting on behalf of customers in future.</p>
<p>The Astrocale payload was launched via a Soyuz rocket that took off early this morning from Kazakhstan carrying 38 commercial satellites from 18 countries. It&#8217;s the first Astroscale spacecraft to reach orbit, since the startup&#8217;s founding in 2013 by Japanese entrepreneur Nobu Okada. Astroscale had launched a micro satellite designed to measure small-scale debris in 2017, but all 18 of the satellites on that particular mission failed to reach orbit, due to human error in the launch vehicle&#8217;s programming.</p>
<p>This ELSA-d mission is a much more ambitious effort, and involves what amounts to an active on-orbit demonstration of the technology that Astroscale ultimately hopes to commercialize. The mission profile includes repeat docking and release maneuvers between the servicer satellite and the simulated client satellite, which is equipped with a ferromagnetic plate to assist the servicer with its magnetic docking procedure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Maxar CTO Walter Scott thinks now is the time to address the orbital traffic boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/27/why-maxar-cto-walter-scott-thinks-now-is-the-time-to-address-the-orbital-traffic-boom/embed/#?secret=NAXaX7JIma" data-secret="NAXaX7JIma" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Astroscale hopes to prove out a range of its advertised capabilities with this demonstration, including the servicer&#8217;s ability to search out and located the client satellite, inspect it for damage, and then dock with it as mentioned, in both non-tumbling and tumbling scenarios (ie., a payload that&#8217;s maintaining a stable orbit, and one that&#8217;s spinning end-over-end in space with no ability to control its own attitude).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot riding on this mission, which will be controlled from a ground center established by Astroscale in the UK. Aside from its long-term commercial ambitions, the startup is also contracted to partner with JAXA on the Japanese space agency&#8217;s first orbital debris removal mission, which aims to be the first in the world to remove a large object from orbit, representing the spent upper stage of a launch rocket.</p>

		Howard Boville is the senior vice president of IBM Hybrid Cloud. He directs IBM’s global network of more than 60 cloud data centers across 19 countries and 18 availability zones across six regions.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Recent testimony before Congress on the massive SolarWinds attacks served as a wake-up call for many. What I saw emerge from the testimony was a debate on whether the public cloud is a more secure option than a hybrid cloud approach.</p>
<p>The debate shouldn’t surround which cloud approach is more secure, but rather which one we need to design security for. We — enterprise technology providers — should be designing security around the way our modern systems work, rather than pigeonholing our customers into securing one computing model over the other.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			An organization’s security needs to be designed with one single point of control that provides a holistic view of threats and mitigates complexity.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The SolarWinds attack was successful because it took advantage of a vast, intermixed supply chain of technology vendors. While there are fundamental lessons to be learned on how to protect the code supply chain, I think the bigger lesson is that complexity is the enemy of security.</p>
<h2>The &#8220;Frankencloud&#8221; model</h2>
<p>We’ve seen our information technology environments evolve into what I call a “Frankenstein” approach. Firms scrambled to take advantage of the cloud while maintaining their systems of record. Similar to how Frankenstein was assembled, this led to systems riddled with complexity and disconnected parts put together.</p>
<p>Security teams cite this complexity as one of their largest challenges. Forced to rely on dozens of vendors and disconnected security products, the <a href="https://research.esg-global.com/reportaction/cybersecuritylandscape/Marketing">average security team</a> is using 25 to 49 tools from up to 10 different vendors. This disconnect is creating blind spots we can no longer afford to avoid. Security systems shouldn’t be piecemealed together; an organization’s security needs to be designed with one single point of control that provides a holistic view of threats and mitigates complexity.</p>
<h2>Hybrid cloud innovations</h2>
<p>We’re seeing hybrid cloud environments emerging as the dominant technology design point for governments, as well as public and private enterprises. In fact, a recent study from Forrester Research found that 85% of technology decision-makers agree that on-premise infrastructure is critical to their hybrid cloud strategies.</p>
<p>A hybrid cloud model combines part of a company’s existing on-premise systems with a mix of public cloud resources and as-a-service resources and treats them as one.</p>
<p>How does this benefit your security? In a disconnected environment, the most common path for cybercriminals to compromise cloud environments is via cloud-based applications, representing 45% of cloud-related incidents analyzed by our IBM X-Force team.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, your cloud-based systems that authenticate that someone is authorized to access systems. A login from an employee’s device is detected in the middle of the night. At the same time, there may be an attempt from that same device, seemingly in a different time zone, to access sensitive data from your on-premise data centers. A unified security system knows the risky behavior patterns to watch for and automatically hinders both actions. If these incidents were detected in two separate systems, that action never takes place and data is lost.</p>
<p>Many of these issues arise due to the mishandling of data through cloud data storage. The fastest-growing innovations to address this gap are called Confidential Computing. Right now, most cloud providers promise that they won’t access your data. (They could, of course, be compelled to break that promise by a court order or other means.) Conversely, it also means malicious actors could use that same access for their own nefarious purposes. Confidential Computing ensures that the cloud technology provider is technically incapable of accessing data, making it equally difficult for cybercriminals to gain access to it.</p>
<h2>Creating a more secure future</h2>
<p>Cloud computing has brought critical innovations to the world, from the distribution of workloads to moving with speed. At the same time, it also brought to light the essentials of delivering IT with integrity.</p>
<p>Cloud’s need for speed has pushed aside the compliance and controls that technology companies historically ensured for their clients. Now, those requirements are often put back on the customer to manage. I’d urge you to think of security first and foremost in your cloud strategy and choose a partner you can trust to securely advance your organization forward.</p>
<p>We need to stop bolting security and privacy onto the “Frankencloud” environment that operates so many businesses and governments. SolarWinds taught us that our dependence on a diverse set of technologies can be a point of weakness.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it can also become our greatest strength, as long as we embrace a future where security and privacy are designed in the very fabric of that diversity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offer new ways for consumers to collect, wear and trade fashion online, and now that most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/fashion/what-happened-at-new-yorks-first-pandemic-fashion-show.html">fashion shows have scaled back</a> or <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/amp/articles/fashion-show-review/digital-shows-here-to-stay-as-fashion-week-gets-a-makeover">gone virtual</a>, they may become an important tool for the industry.</p>
<p>Because some of the most profitable NFTs are produced by <a href="https://twitter.com/lilmiquela/status/1329976205538324480">celebrities</a> with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/shawn-mendes-andrew-gertler-nft-marketplace-sturdy-exchange-1135558/">teams</a>, it makes sense that <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/tech/9535765/nft-music-gold-rush-sales-timeline-grimes-3lau">music corporations, </a><a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/companies/the-cryptocurrency-boom-will-luxury-fashion-brands-jump-in">fashion brands</a> and designers are venturing into the NFT market as well. Just this month, sneaker brand RTFKT Studios garnered <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/3/rtfkt-studios-fewocious-sale-nfts">$3.1 million </a>in seven minutes by selling crypto collectibles. In December 2020, NFT startup Enjin partnered with Netherlands-based fashion house <a href="https://www.thefabricant.com/">The Fabricant</a> on a <a href="https://enjin.io/blog/atari-the-fabricant-digital-fashion">virtual collection</a>. Real-life fashion brands use NFTs for marketing in virtual worlds like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/minecraft-enjin-microsoft-nfts">Minecraft</a>, plus several <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/Atari-Inspired-Virtual-Fashion-Line-Designed-By-The-Fabricant-Rolls-Ou">Atari</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/microsoft-teams-up-with-enjin-to-offer-crypto-collectible-rewards">Microsoft</a> video games.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The fundamental value NFTs offer to bridge virtual fashion items with video games is the option to secure custody of the item for use in other games or mobile apps.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>“Brands are coming up with some creative solutions because the pandemic is persistent, and fashion is something that is so close to our identities,” said Bryana Kortendick, Enjin’s VP of operations and communications. “You can snap a photo of yourself wearing your Atari-branded NFTs. You’ll also be able to wear them in video games.”</p>
<p>Breakout NFT star Beeple said he imagines a future where fashion NFTs could be redeemed for specific items in physical stores, especially at luxury retailers like his former client Louis Vuitton.</p>
<p>“You can relate NFTs to clothing in new and interesting ways,” he said. “This will be seen as the next chapter of digital art history. This is a continuation of digital art history that started decades ago, by that I mean art made on a computer and distributed through the internet.”</p>
<p>Fashion designers like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/polygondressing/">Schirin Negahbani </a>are already creating NFTs that represent <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKTttyqjD5r/">actual clothing</a>. Precisely because multimillion-dollar NFT sales are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/arts/design/beeple-nonfungible-nft-review.html">breaking records</a>, spectators have been prompted to question the role speculative trading plays in this trend.</p>
<p>Textile designer <a href="https://www.amberjdickinson.com/">Amber J. Dickinson</a> says fashionable NFTs shouldn’t primarily be viewed as speculative trading opportunities. “The way I think fashion translates to the digital world is to view an NFT as a collectible piece of the garment for history,” said Dickinson, known for hand-made silk scarves and her work with Alexander McQueen. “I would only buy art as a piece that I liked. Whether digital or in the real world, I don’t take an investor’s point of view.”</p>
<p>There are many fashion fans who disagree with Dickinson, preferring to invest through assets like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/your-money/birkin-bag-racehorse-invest.html">Birkin bags</a>. They may have a different approach to NFTs. The <a href="https://digitalax.medium.com/introducing-digitalax-the-digital-fashion-engine-42801a431283">DIGITALAX </a>crypto fashion platform, for example, is being built with a plethora of trading features. As for Dickinson, she said she is still looking for her tribe of crypto-savvy artists on Twitter.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lost item finder Tile, the maker of the popular Bluetooth-powered tracker that can help you find your misplaced keys, bag, wallet or more, is bringing its tracking service to a wearable device for the first time with the launch of its <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/inspire2">Fitbit partnership</a>. Starting today, all new and current Fitbit Inspire 2 users will gain access to Tile&#8217;s Bluetooth-finding technology at no extra cost, the company says.</p>
<p>As a result of the deal, existing Inspire 2 users will soon be prompted to update their device&#8217;s software via the Fitbit app, which will make the new Tile feature available. Once updated, users will be directed to download Tile&#8217;s mobile app for access to the lost item finding features. From the Tile app, Inspire 2 users will then be able to locate their misplaced Fitbit when they&#8217;re within Bluetooth range &#8212; for example, if the device has been lost somewhere inside their home. If the device is further away, users will be able to tap into Tile&#8217;s broader finding network which leverages the Tile app installed on all Tile users&#8217; smartphones. When anyone with the app is near the lost item, its location is shared back through the network to the original owner.</p>
<p>At present, Tile says it&#8217;s locating up to 6 million unique items per day across 195 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tile&#8217;s service is made available for free to <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/inspire2">Fitbit users</a> and other customers, but it monetizes through a combination of device sales, in-app subscriptions, and other partnerships. The <a href="https://tileteam.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004254653-Tile-Premium-Features">Tile Premium subscription</a> will also be available to Inspire 2 users as an optional upgrade from within the Tile app at $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year. This service, originally targeted towards Tile tracker owners, includes free battery replacements for Tile devices, access to 30-day location history, item reimbursements, and smart alerts that remind you when you&#8217;ve left home without important things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now with Tile technology, we’re adding even more convenience and helpful tools to Inspire 2, our accessible, easy-to-use activity and sleep tracker,&#8221; said Larry Yang, Director of Product Management of Fitbit Devices at Google, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/googles-fitbit-acquisition-is-official/">finalized its Fitbit acquisition in early 2021</a>. &#8220;We’re excited to partner with Tile so our users can focus on building healthy habits without worrying about not being able to find their misplaced device, with the potential to bring Tile’s finding technology to more Fitbit devices in the future,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Tile&#8217;s partnership with Fitbit is now one of <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/partners">over 20 partners</a> who are leveraging Tile&#8217;s technology in some way across audio, travel, smart home and PC categories. And while technically Fitbit is the first &#8220;wearable&#8221; partner, Tile has worked with others in the consumer electronics space, including headphone makers like Skullcandy, Bose and Sennheiser.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s ability to expand its reach through industry partners may become even more critical to its future in the face of new competition from Apple, and to some extent, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsung-unveils-its-newest-tile-competitor-the-galaxy-smarttag/">Samsung</a>. Apple has been developing its own Tile competitor, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags,</a> which the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">accidentally disclosed</a> in a YouTube video last year. These will leverage both Bluetooth and newer ultra-wideband technology to more precisely locate lost items. Meanwhile, S<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsung-unveils-its-newest-tile-competitor-the-galaxy-smarttag/">amsung&#8217;s newest Tile competitor</a>, the Galaxy SmartTag, will also come in an UWB-powered version later this year.</p>
<p>This competition, specifically from Apple, could spell trouble for Tile, which has become a vocal participant in the U.S. antitrust investigations against Apple. The company has testified against Apple<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-apple-tile/tile-says-apples-behavior-is-anticompetitive-and-has-gotten-worse-not-better-idUSKBN21J72V"> in congressional hearings</a> about how its business has been negatively impacted by Apple in the past, and it pushed for third-party access to Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Find My&#8221; app as a means of evening the playing field between Apple&#8217;s upcoming trackers and its own. Tile also joined the Coalition for App Fairness, an advocacy group that&#8217;s now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/08/arizona-bill-apple-google-app-fees-antitrust-challenge">pushing for legislation to regulate the app stores</a> in various U.S. states.</p>
<p>Partnering with Apple&#8217;s competitor, Google (by way of Fitbit), could be seen as another way for Tile to shore up a position for itself within a key section of the wearables market before AirTags arrive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London-based fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> has announced that it is applying for a bank charter in the U.S. The company has submitted a draft application with the FDIC and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.</p>
<p>If the company manages to get a charter in California, it would let the company operate throughout the U.S. as an independent bank. The discussions are still ongoing, which means it could take a while before the authorities grant a charter to the company.</p>
<p>After obtaining a charter in the U.S., Revolut could start offering more financial services. In particular, it would open up more opportunities when it comes to lending and savings products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Right now, Revolut partners with Metropolitan Commercial Bank in the U.S. — they handle your deposits and they are insured by the FDIC. They also issue cards for Revolut.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Revolut is also launching <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business">Revolut Business</a>. These accounts let a company send and receive international payments more easily. Companies can also use the service for payments with virtual and physical debit cards. Revolut Business is available across all 50 states. There are 500,000 companies using Revolut Business in Europe.</p>
<p>Revolut currently has 15 million customers for its financial super app — most of them are in the U.K. and the European Union. The company recently announced that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/revolut-applies-for-uk-banking-license/">applying for a banking license</a> in the U.K., its home country and its biggest market. In Europe, Revolut has a specialized license from the Bank of Lithuania — some customers are already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/revolut-lets-customers-switch-to-revolut-bank-in-10-additional-countries/">moving their account to Revolut Bank</a>.</p>
<p>Revolut isn’t the only fintech startup applying for a bank charter in the U.S. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/brex-applies-for-bank-charter-taps-former-silicon-valley-bank-exec-as-ceo-of-brex-bank/">Last month</a>, Brex announced that it would apply for a bank charter in Utah. Varo Bank also obtained its own bank charter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/mobile-banking-startup-varo-is-becoming-a-real-bank/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>It proves that leveraging another bank’s charter is great for growth. But at some point, if you want to launch new products and generate more revenue from those products, you have to get your own charter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One clear sign of a maturing platform is when the company exposes the services it uses for its own tools to other developers. <a href="http://zoom.com">Zoom</a> has been doing that for some time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/zoom-launches-its-events-platform-and-marketplace-brings-apps-to-your-calls/">introducing Zoom Apps</a> last year and the Marketplace to distribute and sell these apps. Today, the company introduced a new SDK (software development kit) to help developers embed Zoom video services inside another application.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Video SDK enables developers to leverage Zoom’s industry-leading HD video, audio, and interactive features to build video-based applications and desktop experiences with native user interfaces,&#8221; Zoom&#8217;s Natalie Mullin wrote in a blog post announcing the new SDK.</p>
<p>If you want to include video in your app, you could try and code it yourself, or you could simply take advantage of Zoom&#8217;s expertise in this area and use the SDK to add video to the application and save a lot of time and effort.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company envisions applications developers embedding video in social, gaming or retail applications where including video could enhance the user experience. For example, a shop owner could show different outfits to an online shopper in a live video feed, and discuss their tastes in real time.</p>
<p>Zoom CTO Brendan Ittelson said the SDK is actually part of a broader set of services designed to help developers take advantage of all the developer tooling that the company has been developing in recent years. As part of that push, the company is also announcing a central developer portal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be able to have a single point where developers can go to to learn about all of the tools and resources that are available for them in the Zoom platform for their work in development, so we&#8217;re launching <a href="http://developer.zoom.us">developer.zoom.us</a> as that central hub for all developer resources,&#8221; Ittelson told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zoom launches its events platform and marketplace, brings apps to your calls&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/zoom-launches-its-events-platform-and-marketplace-brings-apps-to-your-calls/embed/#?secret=FIZgxukDUR" data-secret="FIZgxukDUR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In addition, the company said that it wanted to give developers more data about how people are using the Zoom features in their applications, so they will be providing a new analytics dashboard with usage statistics.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are adding additional tools and actually providing developers with analytic dashboards. So folks that have developed apps for the Zoom ecosystem are able to see information about the usage of those apps across the platform,&#8221; Ittelson said.</p>
<p>He believes these tools combined with the new video SDK and existing set of tools will provide developers with a variety of options for building Zoom functionality into their applications, or embedding their application into Zoom as they see fit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.y42.com/">y42</a> (formerly known as Datos Intelligence), a data warehouse-centric business intelligence service that promises to give businesses access to an enterprise-level data stack that&#8217;s as simple to use as a spreadsheet, today announced that it has raised a $2.9 million seed funding round led by <a href="https://lafamiglia.vc/">La Famiglia VC</a>. Additional investors include the co-founders of Foodspring, Personio and Petlab.</p>
<p>The service, which was founded in 2020, integrates with over <a href="https://www.y42.com/product/integrate">100 data sources</a>, covering all the standard B2B SaaS tools from Airtable to Shopify and Zendesk, as well as database services like Google&#8217;s BigQuery. Users can then transform and visualize this data, orchestrate their data pipelines and trigger automated workflows based on this data (think sending Slack notifications when revenue drops or emailing customers based on your own custom criteria).</p>
<p>Like similar startups, y42 extends the idea data warehouse, which was traditionally used for analytics, and helps businesses operationalize this data. At the core of the service is a lot of open source and the company, for example, contributes to GitLabs&#8217; <a href="https://meltano.com/">Meltano</a> platform for <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/05/18/why-gitlab-is-building-meltano-an-open-source-platform-for-elt-pipelines/">building data pipelines</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2127963" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127963" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2127963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png" alt="y42 founder and CEO Hung Dang" width="1024" height="657" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png 1389w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png?resize=768,493 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127963" class="wp-caption-text">y42 founder and CEO Hung Dang.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re taking the best of breed open-source software. What we really want to accomplish is to create a tool that is so easy to understand and that enables everyone to work with their data effectively,&#8221; Y42 founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hung-dang-y42/?originalSubdomain=de">Hung Dang</a> told me. &#8220;We&#8217;re extremely UX obsessed and I would describe us as no-code/low-code BI tool &#8212; but with the power of an enterprise-level data stack and the simplicity of Google Sheets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before y42, Vietnam-born Dang co-founded a major events company that operated in over 10 countries and made millions in revenue (but with very thin margins), all while finishing up his studies with a focus on business analytics. And that in turn led him to also found a second company that focused on B2B data analytics.</p>

<p>Even while building his events company, he noted, he was always very product- and data-driven. &#8220;I was implementing data pipelines to collect customer feedback and merge it with operational data &#8212; and it was really a big pain at that time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was using tools like Tableau and Alteryx, and it was really hard to glue them together &#8212; and they were quite expensive. So out of that frustration, I decided to develop an internal tool that was actually quite usable and in 2016, I decided to turn it into an actual company. &#8221;</p>
<p>He then sold this company to a major publicly listed German company. An NDA prevents him from talking about the details of this transaction, but maybe you can draw some conclusions from the fact that he spent time at Eventim before founding y42.</p>
<p>Given his background, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that y42&#8217;s focus is on making life easier for data engineers and, at the same time, putting the power of these platforms in the hands of business analysts. Dang noted that y42 typically provides some consulting work when it onboards new clients, but that&#8217;s mostly to give them a head start. Given the no-code/low-code nature of the product, most analysts are able to get started pretty quickly  &#8212; and for more complex queries, customers can opt to drop down from the graphical interface to y42&#8217;s low-code level and write queries in the service&#8217;s SQL dialect.</p>
<p>The service itself runs on Google Cloud and the 25-people team manages about 50,000 jobs per day for its clients. the company&#8217;s customers include the likes of <a href="https://www.lifemd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lifemd.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGF1J01xU9lwGPsAn0hLL6Cn0QYg">LifeMD</a>, <a href="https://thepetlabco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thepetlabco.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDUzlxtUx7seE8InbBS4ZyKEtOFw">Petlab</a> and <a href="https://www.everdrop.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.everdrop.de/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGHLzJlfl3V1yIw8lWpDtwEF7ZeVw">Everdrop</a>.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/kVB612On9KA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Until raising this round, Dang self-funded the company and had also raised some money from angel investors. But La Famiglia felt like the right fit for y42, especially due to its focus on connecting startups with more traditional enterprise companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first saw the product demo, it struck us how on top of analytical excellence, a lot of product development has gone into the <span class="il">y42</span> platform,&#8221; said Judith Dada, General Partner at LaFamiglia VC. &#8220;More and more work with data today means that data silos within organizations multiply, resulting in chaos or incorrect data. <span class="il">y42</span> is a powerful single source of truth for data experts and non-data experts alike. As former data scientists and analysts, we wish that we had <span class="il">y42</span> capabilities back then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dang tells me he could have raised more but decided that he didn&#8217;t want to dilute the team&#8217;s stake too much at this point. &#8220;It&#8217;s a small round, but this round forces us to set up the right structure. For the series, A, which we plan to be towards the end of this year, we&#8217;re talking about a dimension which is 10x,&#8221; he told me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s clear that automated workflow tooling has become increasingly important for companies. Perhaps that explains why <a href="http://camunda.com/">Camunda</a>, a Berlin startup that makes open source process automation software, announced an €82 million Series B today. That translates into approximately $98 million U.S.</p>
<p>Insight Partners led the round with help from A round investor Highland Europe. When combined with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/camunda-hauls-in-28m-investment-as-workflow-automation-remains-hot/">$28 million A investment</a> from December 2018, it brings the total raised to approximately $126 million.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s attracting this level of investment says Jakob Freund, co-founder and CEO at Camunda is the company is solving a problem that goes beyond pure automation. &#8220;There&#8217;s a bigger thing going on which you could call end-to-end automation or end-to-end orchestration of endpoints, which can be RPA bots, for example, but also micro services and manual work [by humans],&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added, &#8220;Camunda has become this endpoint agnostic orchestration layer that sits on top of everything else.&#8221; That means that it provides the ability to orchestrate how the automation pieces work in conjunction with one another to create this full workflow across a company.</p>

<p>The company has 270 employees and approximately 400 customers at this point including Goldman Sachs, Lufthansa, Universal Music Group, and Orange. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Matt Gatto, managing director at Insight Partners sees a tremendous market opportunity for the company and that&#8217;s why his firm came in with such a big investment.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Camunda’s success demonstrates how an open, standards-based, developer-friendly platform for end-to-end process automation can increase business agility and improve customer experiences, helping organizations truly transform to a digital enterprise,&#8221; Gatto said in a statement.</p>
<p>Camunda is not your typical startup. Its history actually dates back to 2008 as a business process management (BPM) consulting firm. It began the Camunda open source project in 2013, and that was the start of pivoting to become an open source software company with a commercial component built on top of that.</p>
<p>It took the funding at the end of 2018 because the market was beginning to catch up with the idea, and they wanted to build on that. It&#8217;s going so well that company reports it&#8217;s cash-flow positive, and will use the additional funding to continue accelerating the business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://worldswaterfund.com/">Waterfund</a>, an investment and trading firm that specializes in acquiring and managing water-related infrastructure assets, today announced a deal with Israel-based crowdfunding platform <a href="https://www.ourcrowd.com/">OurCrowd</a> that will see the Waterfund team commit $50 million to build a water- and agtech-focused portfolio of 15 companies. The first of these investments is in <a href="https://www.plenty.ag/">Plenty</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/plenty-has-raised-over-500-million-to-grow-fruits-and-veggies-indoors/#:~:text=Plenty%E2%80%8C%20%E2%80%8CUnlimited%E2%80%8C%20has%20raised,the%20berry%20farming%20giant%20Driscoll's.">well-funded vertical farming startup</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to these direct investments, the two companies are also working together on a new water-focused platform called Aquantos, which aims to issue so-called <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/content/dam/msdotcom/ideas/blue-bonds/2583076-FINAL-MS_GSF_Blue_Bonds.pdf">Blue Bonds</a> and other financial products related to the water industry. Comparable to Green Bonds that focus on projects with environmental benefits &#8212; and which have been around for more than a decade now &#8212; Blue Bonds are still a new idea and focus on projects that could benefit the oceans.</p>
<p>“We are working to issue Blue Bonds that can be both climate bonds-certified and backed by sovereign or sub-sovereign borrowers,&#8221; said Waterfund CEO Scott Rickards. &#8220;This new financial tool and others are being designed to enable water projects in the Middle East to acquire leading technologies to address water scarcity in a fundamentally new way.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rickards argues that a lack of private capital has held back innovation in the water sector and that this new partnership &#8212; and the equity and debt financing opportunities it brings with it &#8212; will help change this.</p>
<p>OurCrowd, meanwhile, currently has about $1.5 billion in committed funding and has made investments in about 250 companies across its 25 funds. Among the companies the platform has invested in are the likes of Lemonade, Jump Bikes and Beyond Meat. Its portfolio also includes a number of existing agtech startups and last November, OurCrowd partnered with <a href="https://agfundernews.com/why-israels-ourcrowd-is-teaming-up-with-new-zealands-sprout.html">Sprout Agritech</a> (a company in its portfolio) to run a new agtech accelerator in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Abraham Accords present a huge opportunity to bring new water and agricultural technology to the water scarcity challenges of the entire Middle East,&#8221; said OurCrowd founder and CEO Jon Medved. &#8220;Alongside Waterfund, it is our mission to invest in and help build game-changing technology companies. We are excited to be working together with Waterfund to drive more private capital to address the critical challenges of water.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The once untouchable semiconductor sector continues to attract fervent attention from VCs.</p>
<p>The latest news this morning is that Ajay Royan of Mithril Capital has led a $55 million Series D round of financing into <a href="https://flex-logix.com">Flex Logix</a>, which builds chips designed to bring AI workflows to the compute edge. That follows on earlier rounds in the company totaling $27 million from the likes of Lux, Eclipse Ventures and Tate Family Trust, the investment vehicle of the company’s founder and CEO Geoff Tate.</p>
<p>This isn’t Mithril’s first foray into the chip investing world. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/nuvia-series-b/">The firm previously backed Nuvia</a>, a promising entrant in the server chip market which was founded by several of the top chip designers of Apple’s A-line of processors. Mithril invested $240 million in Nuvia last September, just a few months before the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/two-year-old-nuvia-sells-to-qualcomm-for-1-4-billion/">flipped over to Qualcomm in a $1.4 billion transaction</a> announced in January.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Back to Flex Logix though: we last covered the company in October, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/flex-logix-chip-availability/">when it announced the availability of its X1 AI chip</a>. As I wrote at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Flex Logix wants to bring AI processing workflows to the compute edge, which means it wants to offer technology that adds artificial intelligence to products like medical imaging equipment and robotics. At the edge, processing power obviously matters, but so does size and price. More efficient chips are easier to include in products, where pricing may put constraints on the cost of individual components.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mithril in its statement noted the company’s strength in designing a competitive processor which meets tight power and cost requirements in a white-hot segment of semiconductors. It also was excited that Flex Logix has developed a strong well of intellectual property in the eFPGA space, where there has been energetic activity given increasing interest from customers for flexible processors that can adapt to application needs over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has led to people everywhere shopping more online and Latin America is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo-based Nuvemshop has developed an e-commerce platform that aims to allow SMBs and merchants to connect more directly with their consumers. With more people in Latin America getting used to making purchases digitally, the company has experienced a major surge in business over the past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for Nuvemshop&#8217;s offering was already heating up prior to the pandemic. But over the past 12 months, that demand has skyrocketed as more merchants have been seeking greater control over their brands. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than selling their goods on existing marketplaces (such as Mercado Libre, the Brazilian equivalent of Amazon), many merchants and entrepreneurs are opting to start and grow their own online businesses, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop co-founder and CEO Santiago Sosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most merchants have entered the internet by selling on marketplaces but we are hearing from newer generations of merchants and SMBs that they don’t want to be intermediated anymore,” he said. “They want to connect more directly with consumers and convey their own brand, image and voice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proof is in the numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop has seen the number of merchants on its platform surge to nearly 80,000 across Brazil, Argentina and Mexico compared to 20,000 at the start of 2020. These businesses range from direct-to-consumer (DTC) upstarts to larger brands such as PlayMobil, Billabong and Luigi Bosca. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtually every KPI tripled in the company in 2020 as the world saw a massive transition to online, and Nuvemshop’s platform was home to 14 million transactions last year, according to Sosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With us, businesses can find a more comprehensive ecosystem around payments, logistics, shipping and catalogue/inventory management,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop&#8217;s rapid growth caught the attention of Silicon Valley-based Accel. Having just </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/nuvemshop-a-latin-american-answer-to-shopify-raises-30-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $30 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series C round in October and achieving profitability in 2020, the Nuvemshop team was not looking for more capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Ethan Choi, a partner at Accel, said his firm saw in Nuvemshop the potential to be the market leader, or the “de facto” e-commerce platform, in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Accel has been investing in e-commerce for a very long time. It’s a very important area for us,” Choi said. “We saw what they were building and all their potential. So we pre-emptively asked them to let us invest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Nuvemshop is announcing that it has closed on a $90 million Series D funding led by Accel. ThornTree Capital and returning backers Kaszek, Qualcomm Ventures and others also put money in the round, which brings Nuvemshop’s total funding raised since its 2011 inception to nearly $130 million. The company declined to reveal at what valuation this latest round was raised but it is notable that its Series D is triple the size of its Series C, raised just over six months prior. Sosa said only that there was a “substantial increase” in valuation since its Series C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop is banking on the fact that the density of SMBs in Latin America is higher in most Latin American countries compared to the U.S. On top of that, the $85 billion e-commerce market in Latin America is growing rapidly with projections of it </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/445860/retail-e-commerce-sales-latam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reaching $116.2 billion in 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Brazil, it grew 40% last year but is still underpenetrated, representing less than 10% of retail sales. In Latin America as a whole, penetration is somewhere between 5 and 10%,” Sosa said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127927" style="width: 575px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127927" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2127927" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="565" height="376" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2127927" class="wp-caption-text">Nuvemshop co-founder and CEO Santiago Sosa;<br />Image courtesy of Nuvemshop</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the company transitioned from a closed product to a platform that is open to everyone from third parties, developers, agencies and other SaaS vendors. Through Nuvemshop’s APIs, all those third parties can connect their apps into Nuvemshop’s platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our platform becomes much more powerful, vendors are generating more revenue and merchants have more options,” Sosa told TechCrunch. “So everyone wins.” Currently, Nuvemshop has about 150 applications publishing on its ecosystem, which he projects will more than triple over the next 12 to 18 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for comparisons to Shopify, Sosa said the company doesn’t necessarily make them but believes they are “fair.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Choi, there are many similarities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw Amazon get to really big scale in the U.S.. Merchants also found tools to build their own presence. This birthed Shopify, which today is worth $160 billion. Both companies saw their market caps quadruple during the pandemic,” he said. “Now we’re seeing the same dynamics in LatAm&#8230;Our bet here is that this company and business has all the same dynamics and the same really powerful tailwinds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Accel partner Andrew Braccia, Nuvemshop has a clear first mover advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past decade, direct-to-consumer has become one of the most important drivers of entrepreneurship globally,” he said. “Latin America is no exception to this trend, and we believe that Nuvemshop h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the level of sophistication and ability to understand all that change and fuel the continued transformation of commerce from offline to online.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Sosa expects Nuvemshop will use its new capital to significantly invest in: continuing to open its APIs; payments processing and financial services; “everything related to logistics and logistics management” and attracting smaller merchants. It also plans to expand into other markets such as Colombia, Chile and Peru over the next 18-24 months. Nuvemshop currently operates in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While the countries share the same secular trends and product experience, they have very different market dynamics,” Sosa said. “This requires an on the ground local knowledge to make it all work. Separate markets require distinct knowledge. That makes this a more complicated opportunity, but one that enables a long-term competitive advantage.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zaver.io/">Zaver</a>, a Swedish fintech that enable merchants to accept cardless payments and offer buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) as an option, has raised $5 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The company, which began life focused on P2P payments for marketplace transactions, is now doubling down on the durables sector (think: automotive, health &amp; beauty, craftmanship etc.) for both online and offline commerce, after claiming to have found product-market-fit.</p>
<p>Backing Zaver&#8217;s new round are VCs Inbox Capital (the firm that has invested in the likes of Revolut and Klarna), and Inventure. Other investors include Fredrik Österberg (founder of Evolution Gaming), Magnus Rausing (angel investor), Joen Bonnier (partner at Atomico), and Fabian Hielte, Max Hobohm and Johannes Hobohm, (owners of Ernstrom).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Amir Marandi and Linus Malmén in mid 2016, while both were students at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Zaver wants to accelerate the move away from plastic cards, to mobile payments. Its target market is &#8220;durables,&#8221; starting in Sweden. Payments functionality and features include online and offline cardless payments powered by open banking, instant payouts for merchants, BNPL and credit scoring.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="k9OelQAwSs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/zaver/">Swedish fintech Zaver has raised $1.2M seed for its P2P payments platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Swedish fintech Zaver has raised $1.2M seed for its P2P payments platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/zaver/embed/#?secret=k9OelQAwSs" data-secret="k9OelQAwSs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;By durables, we mean goods (and services) that do not need to be purchased often, and typically last for a longer period of time e.g. automotive, a visit to the dentist clinic, or kitchen renovation,&#8221; Marandi tells me. &#8220;[These] are often higher transaction value than &#8216;common&#8217; retail products or services&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since the launch of &#8220;Zaver for Business&#8221; two years ago, Marandi says the company has gone from zero to &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars&#8221; in processing volume. “Today, we have a product market fit proving that the users are willing to leave old habits, and instead use their phone in order to pay for even larger items or services,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Through bypassing the card rails, Marandi argues that Zaver is able to customize pricing, user experience and product development in-house, in a way that isn&#8217;t possible until now. &#8220;The focus in on replacing legacy-solutions with a comprehensive banking and payments platform for SMEs in this sector, where BNPL plays a key role in the transition in customer behaviour,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zaver&#8217;s main competitors are cited as legacy products, such as credit cards, and factoring companies. &#8220;What makes us different is that we focus on the shift to mobile payments in a sector with low margin sales, and high average transaction values,&#8221; says Marandi. &#8220;By focusing on new customer behaviours (e.g. BNPL, direct debit, instalments at point-of-sale) and real time settlements, we can offer the same frictionless payment experience online and offline, no matter the size of the tickets&#8221;.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">In the 170 years since Western Union was founded, no company has managed to solve two basic problems that continue to bedevil the remittance business &#8212; exorbitant fees and slow deposit times. For instance, it takes days or weeks for money sent from an immigrant in the U.S. to reach a relative in Nigeria.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/ben-eluan">Ben Eluan</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/osezele-orukpe-1a37a9167">Osezele Orukpe</a>, two software engineers based in Nigeria, faced this problem in 2019</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They had executed a project for a client in the U.K. and when the time came for them to get paid, they settled with Skrill. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it took a week for the friends to get their money, and they lost a considerable chunk of it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to charges</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The experience made us think of the payments and, more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cross border payments,&#8221; Eluan said to TechCrunch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gig economy and the service economy for small businesses economy is very massive, and we care about it enough to dedicate all our time into building payments for Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last three years, crypto remittance companies have emerged to fill in this need, as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via an application and from a wallet, people can convert fiat into crypto and send it to the wallets of people in other countries who convert back to fiat if they choose</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127947" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127947" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2127947" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="414" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png 1775w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=768,467 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=680,414 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=1536,935 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2127947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flux</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s the same proposition Eluan (CEO), Orukpe (CTO) and the team have with their product, <a href="https://iflux.app/">Flux</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto remittance company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enable merchants to send and receive money from anywhere in the world, Eluan tells me</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that what differentiates Flux from other crypto remittance startups lies in the ease and speed of the platform&#8217;s transactions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He claims that facilitating payments on Flux is 100x faster than fiat, and is cheaper too. The platform charges $0.50 for every transaction, regardless of the amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May 2020, Flux got <a href="https://pioneer.app/blog/meet-the-pioneers-may-2020/">accepted into Pioneer</a>, an accelerator launched by ex-YC partner Daniel Gross</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pioneer gives founders access to funding streams and talent hardly found outside Silicon Valley</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has already backed more than 100 founders who give up 1% equity to join the accelerator. Depending on their progress, Pioneer can decide to give either $20,000 for 5%, $100,000 for 5%, or $1 million for 10%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the program, Flux </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised $77,000 pre-seed investment from different investors &#8212; Hustle Fund and Mozilla, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eluan says the six-month-old company has 5,000 customers who have transacted over $750,000 in payments volume</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the CEO, the startup is growing 40% month-on-month and has made $25,000 in revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company witnessed this growth despite the Central Bank of Nigeria&#8217;s clampdown on crypto exchange activities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The country&#8217;s apex bank <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2021/CCD/CBN%20Press%20Release%20Crypto%2007022021.pdf">ordered local banks</a> to stop aiding crypto transactions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This meant that crypto users on Flux and other crypto platforms could no longer convert fiat to crypto using their bank accounts or cards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We had to be compliant because of the CBN policy and our customers can&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> convert their crypto to fiat but can still transact their crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is why we want to make Flux available in the US and UK, where people can use Flux and send money to Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s currently not available but that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re building and is the next phase of our application,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is also working on a peer-to-peer feature that will see users </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transact crypto and fiat with one another</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has launched Flux Merchants, a product that allows merchants to accept payments by creating payment links for their products and services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eluan, Orukpe, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/israel-akintunde">Israel Akintunde</a> (VP, Engineering) and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/ayomide-lasaki-1208b6172">Ayomide Lasaki</a> (head of Marketing) &#8212; met in their freshman year at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) in Ile-Ife, Osun</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studying various engineering disciplines, the four friends formed a &#8220;programming club&#8221; with other software developers on campus where they would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meet to write code and make applications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Eluan even tells me they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regularly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> skipped class for these sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Flux, the friends built an e-commerce platform called Joppa that helped people find merchants around them within the city</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they had 20,000 users, Eluan says the team didn&#8217;t understand the dynamics of what it entailed to run a startup, so the business had to shut down</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A factor that eventually led to founding Flux was the university&#8217;s budding tech talent ecosystem, which is teeming with stories of prominent startups launched by alumni. Some include J</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obberman, Africa&#8217;s largest recruitment site; Kudi and Cowrywise, two YC-backed companies; and Techstars company Farmcrowdy among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These founders came from our school and it was a huge motivation for us. We always knew that we wanted to build something but we weren&#8217;t sure what this would be. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> landed on Joppa, then Flux,&#8221; Eluan added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, according to <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/10/29/oau-cu-mwas/">Techpoint Africa</a>, OAU alumni have founded startups that have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cumulatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised $1 million more than other alumni from other universities in West Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unlike others, the founders dropped out of the university to start Flux. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We dropped out to focus on our startup and scaling it into a $1 billion company. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the opportunity here is huge. So for us, the right thing to do is to get the job done well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Startups need time so dropping out was inevitable,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are they the first set of African founders that are all dropouts to get into Y Combinator, but they&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arguably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the youngest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a feat Flux </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is thrilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about, and Eluan believes it will open the doors for more young founders on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about that, and it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means brilliant young people in Nigeria and Africa can definitely go ahead to build stuff and get funded too </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like founders from the U.S.,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while their acceptance into Y Combinator </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a much-needed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> validation for their work and sacrifice, there&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, now based in Lagos, is playing in a competitive payments space. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different companies like Chipper Cash, Flutterwave, MFS Africa and other crypto startups are trying to fix cross-border payments, and there&#8217;s a race against time to capture market share</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, YC, Pioneer, other backers, and the team&#8217;s understanding of the market will propel Flux to dominance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Caesar Sengupta, the long-time head of Google’s Next Billion Users initiative, is leaving the company next month, he said Monday. Sengupta, who additionally also led the company&#8217;s payments business in the past three years, is leaving the firm after nearly 15 years.</p>
<p>A regular fixture at Google’s events in India, Brazil, and Indonesia, Sengupta (pictured above) is best known outside the company for leading the company’s Next Billion Users unit, an initiative to make internet and services more accessible to users in developing markets.</p>
<p>As part of Next Billion Users initiative, Google brought internet connectivity to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/07/google-says-over-8-million-people-use-its-free-wifi-service-at-railway-stations-in-india/">hundreds of railway stations</a> and other public places in India and other markets (then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/google-ends-its-free-wi-fi-program-station/">shut down Station</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/17/google-debuts-tez-a-mobile-wallet-and-payments-app-for-india/">launched Google Pay in India</a> (which unlike Google Pay in the U.S., wasn&#8217;t developed atop credit cards) and built several products such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/android-go-is-a-lightweight-version-of-android-for-crazy-cheap-phones/">Android Go</a>, Datally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/google-launches-kormo-app-in-india-to-help-people-find-entry-level-jobs/">Kormo Jobs</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/after-leak-googles-new-file-manager-for-android-files-go-launches-into-public-beta/">Files</a> apps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prior to Next Billion Users unit, Sengupta served as VP and Product Lead at ChromeOS, the company&#8217;s desktop operating system that powers Chromebooks.</p>
<p>&#8220;After 15 years with Google, Caesar Sengupta has made a personal decision to leave the company and start something entrepreneurial outside of Google. Through his time at Google, Caesar has played a key role in starting, building and leading initiatives such as ChromeOS, Next Billion Users and Google Pay. We are excited to see what he builds next and wish him the best in his new journey,” said a Google spokesperson in a statement. Sengupta&#8217;s current position at the firm is VP and GM of Next Billion Users and Payments.</p>

<p>“To the many, many Googlers working in Africa, APAC, LATAM and MENA, it has been inspiring to hear your voices take more weight in the products Google builds. I know there is so much more work to do,” Sengupta wrote in an email to his colleagues, which he also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/thank-you-google-caesar-sengupta/">shared publicly</a>.</p>
<p>“But we are light years ahead of where we were just a short time ago. You’ve helped digitize your economies, made Google feel local and driven Google’s investment into your countries to unprecedented levels,” wrote the Asia-based executive. Sengupta didn&#8217;t share what he plans to do next.</p>
<p>Under Sengupta&#8217;s watch, Google also made several investments in startups in Asia. Some of these investments include Bangalore-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/google-backs-indias-dunzo-in-40-million-funding-round/">delivery startup Dunzo</a>, Android <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">lockscreen developer Glance, and popular news and entertainment app Dailyhunt</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture capital firm Spark Capital has decided to ‘sever all ties’ with Dispo, a photo-sharing app co-created by famous YouTuber David Dobrik. The move, announced by the firm late Sunday, was triggered by a<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"> recent investigation by Business Insider</a> that exposed allegations from a woman who said that a member of Dobrik’s Vlog Squad sexually assaulted her.</p>
<p>“In light of recent news about the Vlog Squad and David Dobrik, the cofounder of Dispo, we have made the decision to sever all ties with the company,” Spark Capital tweeted. “We have stepped down from our position on the board and we are in the process of making arrangements to ensure we do not profit from our recent investment in Dispo.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ In light of recent news about the Vlog Squad and David Dobrik, the cofounder of Dispo, we have made the decision to sever all ties with the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Spark Capital (@sparkcapital) <a href="https://twitter.com/sparkcapital/status/1373855197064097794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Hours later, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/29a2fc">Dobrik stepped down from the board of Dispo</a>, as first reported by The Information. Dispo, in a statement to TechCrunch, said the following: &#8220;David has chosen to step down from the board and leave the company to not distract from the company&#8217;s growth. Dispo&#8217;s team, product, and most importantly- our community- stand for building a diverse, inclusive, and empowering world.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The VC angle</h2>
<p>Spark Capital’s decision to step back from the Dispo investment feels like a first of its kind, and if not, rare. It could trigger other investors with stakes in the company to do the same.</p>
<p>Spark Capital<a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-david-dobriks-retro-photo-app-dispo-raises-20-million-0a056861-6ea2-46d2-92af-eda697eb179b.html"> led a Series A in Dispo</a>, a $20 million dollar financing event that valued the company at $200 million, less than one month ago. The current statement by Spark does not indicate that the investment has been pulled from the company.</p>
<p>Spark Capital did not immediately respond to request for comment in regards to what this process would look like, and if the shares will be sold back to the company or to another buyer. While the mechanics of the decision are unclear, the fact that the firm led a deal so recently in the company may have given it some leeway to walk away.</p>
<p>Unshackled Ventures, a firm that backs immigrant founders, was an early investor in Dispo and declined to comment on the record. Seven Seven Six, an early-stage venture capital firm founded by Reddit’s Alexis Ohanian, led the seed round and was unable to be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Other sponsors of Dobrik, including HelloFresh and Dollar Shave Club, have ended their partnerships with the creator.</p>
<p>Update: This story has been updated to reflect Dobrik&#8217;s departure from Diispo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indonesia-based fintech <a href="https://pluang.com/">Pluang</a> announced today it has raised $20 million in a pre-Series B round led by Openspace Ventures, with participation from Go Ventures and other returning investors. The company offers proprietary savings and investment products that allow users to make contributions starting from 50 cents USD.</p>
<p>Go Ventures, the investment arm of Gojek, also participated in Pluang&#8217;s $3 million Series A, which <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pluang-receives-over-us3m-in-funding-led-by-go-ventures-300915718.html">closed in March 2019</a>. Pluang is available through partnerships with &#8220;super apps&#8221; like Gojek, Dana and Bukalapak, and currently claims more than one million users.</p>
<p>The company says it is able to maintain a low customer acquisition cost of $2 per transacting customer because it creates its own products, including investment accounts for gold, U.S equity indices and cryptocurrencies, instead of working with third-party financial service providers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Pluang&#8217;s latest round will be used to develop proprietary financial products to cover more asset classes, including government bonds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Previously, these assets classes were only available to the wealthy in Indonesia,&#8221; said Pluang founder Claudia Kolonas in a statement. &#8220;However, we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to grow their savings, and our new products will reflect that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pluang is among several Indonesian financial apps, including Ajaib, Bibit and FUNDtastic, that have recently raised funding. All focus on making investing accessible to more people by giving them an alternative to traditional brokerage firms that typically charge high fees.</p>

<p>M Capital Management, a Singapore-based venture capital firm, announced today it has closed its debut fund, <a href="https://www.m-venturepartners.com/">M Venture Partners </a>(MVP), totaling $30.85 million USD. It plans to invest in 40 early-stage startups, primarily seed and pre-Series A, with an average initial check size of about $500,000.</p>
<p>M Capital Management was founded by Mayank Parekh, whose investment experience includes launching Grange Partners and leadership positions at Southern Capital Group and McKinsey &amp; Company, and Joachim Ackermann, former managing director of Google Asia Pacific. Other senior team members include Dr. Tanuja Rajah, previously Entrepreneur First’s launch manager, and Chethana Ellepola, former research director at Acquity Stockbrokers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MVP, a sector-agnostic fund, has already invested in 11 companies, including one, 3D Metal Forge, that <a href="https://stockhead.com.au/ipo-watch/ipo-watch-3d-metal-forge-gains-45pc-on-asx-debut/">recently went public on the Australian Securities Exchange</a>.</p>
<p>Other portfolio companies include behavioral health coaching startup Naluri; AI-enabled lending and credit-as-a-service company Impact Credit Solutions; alternative investment fund aggregator XEN Capital; and Cipher Cancer Clinics, which is focused on making oncological care more affordable and accessible in India.</p>
<p>Parekh told TechCrunch that M Capital Management was launched because &#8220;we believe that the early-stage investing space in our region has substantial room for growth. A decade ago there were very few unicorns. This has changed substantially more recently, not only because of obvious advancements bringing online previously underserved or untapped populations, but also because they venture system has developed nicely in Singapore and, for that matter, across the region with support from institutional VCs at various stages of funding need, government agency support, the advent of local accelerators and rapidly growing network of angel investing bodies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parekh added that he expects to see more unicorns and &#8220;soonicorns&#8221; (or companies expected to hit unicorn valuation in the near future) emerge.</p>

<p>As early-stage, sector-agnostic investors, Parekh said MVP&#8217;s focus is on founders, specifically those who have &#8220;pedigree professional experience and strong academic backgrounds.&#8221; For example, Naluri chief executive officer Azran Osman-Rani was previously founder of AirAsiaX, guiding it from launch to its 2013 initial public offering in six years.</p>
<p>MVP will focus mostly on Singapore-based startups because it invests primarily in B2B or B2B2C companies. &#8220;We need a fertile ground for our chosen startups to launch their business models with leading corporate or business partners,&#8221; said Parekh. &#8220;Singapore provides just that. It&#8217;s the hub for market leading institutions and it’s not uncommon to see them creating opportunities for new technology or disruptive ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of MVP&#8217;s portfolio companies have &#8220;regional or global aspirations, leveraging Singapore as the core launch platform,&#8221; he added. MVP has also already made investments in Malaysia and India, and is actively looking at companies in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The historical trajectory of venture capital has been to move to earlier and earlier finding rounds in order to capture the greatest potential multiple on exit. In the US, we’ve seen an explosion of Pre-series A funds, and similarly in Europe. But there’s been an opportunity to tie a lot of that activity together and also produce data that can feed into decision-making about growth rounds, further up the funding pipeline. Now, newly-formed <a href="https://aldea.ventures/">Aldea Ventures</a> intends to do just that.</p>
<p>Today’s it’s announcing a €60M first close of its Pan-European fund with the aim of reaching its target €100M first fund. The idea is ambitious: to invest in 700 startups across Europe, but with an unusual, “hybrid” strategy. First up, it will operate as a fund-of-funds, investing in up to 20 early-stage ‘micro VC funds’ across Europe. Second of all, it will act as a co-investment platform from Series A upwards.  So far it has invested in London-based <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com/">Job and Talent</a> and most recently, Copenhagen-based <a href="https://podimo.com/en/">Podimo</a>.</p>
<p>The model is more common in Silicon Valley than in Europe, so Aldea Ventures hopes to capitalize on this trend as one of the earlier players with this strategy. Aldea is also effectively stepping into the gap where corporate VCs in the US would normally fill, but in Europe is generally a gaping hole.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aldea Ventures is led by managing partners Carlos Trenchs, formerly at Caixa Capital Risc; Alfonso Bassols, previously at Nauta Capital; Josep Duran, formerly with the European Investment Fund; and Gonzalo Rodés, Chairman. Aldea Ventures is partnering with Meridia Capital, a leading Spanish alternative investment fund manager.</p>
<p>Carlos Trenchs, managing partner of Aldea Ventures, said: “We believe Europe will continue to grow in influence and play an integral part in the next decade of technology… Our dual model as a fund of funds and co-investor into scaleups is the first of its kind in Europe. Seen only in Silicon Valley until today, we’re putting this model to work to fuel the next generation of growth across the European ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Aldea will look for five factors to selecting micro VCs: the firm&#8217;s thesis (specialist, thematic or generalist); location (pan-European or local); the experience of the partners; the size of the fund, and whether the fund is emerging or established. The fund will also take a long hard look at AI, Blockchain and DeepTech companies.</p>
<p>Trenchs explained to me during an interview that “we will have exposure to seed capital in different geographies with the 700 companies, and we reserve the other half of the fund to invest directly on the growth stage in the best performers in their portfolios.” This, he says, will establish a roadmap from direct investing all the way up to later-stage rounds.</p>
<p>Aldea has so far made investments into six micro VCs; <a href="https://www.airstreet.com/">Air Street Capital</a> and <a href="https://moonfire.com/">Moonfire</a> in London; <a href="https://www.helloworld.vc/">Helloworld</a> in Luxembourg; <a href="https://www.inventures.vc/">Inventures</a> in Munich; <a href="https://mustardseed.vc/mustard-seed-maze">Mustard Seed Maze</a> in Lisbon; and <a href="https://www.nina.capital/">Nina Capital</a> in Barcelona. </p>
<p>Nathan Benaich, Founding Partner of Air Street Capital, commented: “Investing in  European AI-first companies is a huge opportunity, with almost one-quarter of top global AI talent earning their university degrees here.. Our partnership with Aldea demonstrates a shared conviction that specialist managers with deep sector-specific knowledge will accelerate the success of tomorrow’s category-defining European companies that are AI-first by design.”</p>
<p>There&#8217;s clearly also a data play here because Aldea is likely to end up with a lot of data across companies, sectors and also across various stages.</p>
<p>And that was confirmed by Trenchs: “We want to make the VC world more transparent. If you have the 700 companies, in a few years from now, we&#8217;ll be able to collect a lot of data about what&#8217;s going on at seed stage in European valuations, geographies and sectors. Our intention is of course to use it as intelligence.” He also said the firm intended to share a lot of anonymized data with the wider European ecosystem.</p>
<p>“There is a funnel of few thousands of companies that get funded, but only a few make it through the funnel. As investors, we are looking for venture capitalists that can transform their seed portfolio into a portfolio that graduates from Series A to Series B,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kate Hiscox is having a moment. Her company, <a href="https://www.sivo.com/">Sivo</a>, founded eight months ago, has already raised $5 million from investors at a post-money valuation of $100 million, and she says she is in active talks with others who would like her to consider accepting Series A funding from them.</p>
<p>Surely the attention owes to the fact that Hiscox is part of the newest graduating class of the popular accelerator Y Combinator, along with roughly 350 other companies, and if there&#8217;s anything venture capitalists like, it&#8217;s freshly minted YC grads. Partly, fintech continues to be seen as a hugely lucrative area of investment.</p>
<p>But they also might like what Sivo aims to do, which is to strike deals with debt providers for gigantic credit lines that it will then, through its API, work with both big and small companies to disburse via their own lending products. Yes, Sivo is making interest off money that it&#8217;s simply divvying up into smaller amounts. But the real magic, says Hiscox, is in the risk management that Sivo provides. It doesn&#8217;t just parcel out debt; it helps its customers that don&#8217;t have their own risk management practices figure out who is worthy of a loan and how much.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hiscox &#8212; who has founded a number over the years, <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/Venzee+Commences+Trading+on+the+TSX+Venture+Exchange+Under+Symbol+VENZ/13661426.html">one of which</a> she took public on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2018 &#8212; calls it a Stripe for debt. But one question is how Stripe, among its other rivals, might feel about Sivo. Stripe was also once a YC company, it <a href="https://stripe.com/capital">also lends debt</a> to its customers, and it seemingly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/sequoia-is-giving-away-21-million-to-a-payments-startup-it-funded-as-it-walks-away-from-deal/">doesn&#8217;t like</a> when its investors fund emerging potential threats. Another question is how a company like Sivo fares when interest rates rise and the debt it borrows is no longer cheap.</p>
<p>Hiscox suggests she&#8217;s not worried about many roadblocks right now. We talked with her on Friday about the company in a conversation that follows, edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re building what you describe as Stripe for debt. But isn&#8217;t Stripe&#8217;s loan business competitive with yours?</strong></p>
<p>KH: No. Sivo is the first YC company that&#8217;s building debt as a service.</p>
<p>The reason why is that it&#8217;s very difficult for fintechs and neobanks and gig platforms to be able to raise enough capital to be able to lend money to their users at scale; that generally takes a couple of years. What we&#8217;re building gets these companies access to debt capital on day one. Our team has decades of experience with risk and raising debt and building enterprise tech at companies like Goldman Sachs and NASA and Revolut and Citigroup.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Give me a use case.</strong></p>
<p>KH: So we have more than 100 companies now in our customer pipeline, including Uber. In the case of Uber, they want to be able to offer financial products to their drivers. Maybe it&#8217;s to fund a vehicle or provide a payday advance. But Uber really can&#8217;t do that because it doesn&#8217;t want to look like an employer, and it also doesn&#8217;t want to necessarily deal with risk modeling, meaning who in their big driver base has the right risk profile [to rationalize a loan]. You plug in Sivo, and we will cycle through the Uber driver base to figure out to whom it makes sense to make a loan offer, and we do it all this through the API.</p>
<p><strong>TC: But Uber is not yet a paying customer.</strong></p>
<p>KH: No, we go live next month; that&#8217;s an example of how Uber would use us. There are also a lot of neobanks that are three- to five-years-old and want to start lending and really don&#8217;t know have that risk experience they need to get access to debt capital in order to have the money to be able to lend to their customers. With something like Sivo, they&#8217;re able to integrate our service through our API, and we&#8217;re able to pretty much tell them who they should be lending to, how much they should lend, and then we offer the debt funding.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have any debt deals in place?</strong></p>
<p>KH: We signed a debt deal last week for $100 million and we&#8217;re working on another debt deal for close to $1 billion that will be announced next month.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who is your debt partner and how have you convinced them to lend so much to such a young outfit?</strong></p>
<p>KH: I&#8217;m not sure I can say publicly yet who we&#8217;re working with, but we source our capital through all the usual suspects &#8212; mutual funds, pension funds, banks &#8212; and we&#8217;re able to do this is because as soon as we announced that we were going to start doing this as a product, we had tons of customers come and say, &#8216;I want this. [Trying to do this ourselves] is long and complex and painful, and we want just want to be able to do it in a simple way, like we would use Stripe for payments.&#8217; We could fill our boots, quite frankly, with YC companies forever.</p>
<p>I also have a lot of experience because I&#8217;d taken a company public and have lots of connections in the capital markets, and so does our CFO.</p>
<p>And there are actually a lot of banks that would love more exposure to fintechs and to a basket of YC-backed fintechs in particular because they can get yield, but the check sizes are too small for a bank. There&#8217;s also concern that the fintechs don&#8217;t really have a lot of risk experience. Meanwhile, our team has a lot of gray hair as far as risk is concerned.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What kind of economic agreement do you have with that debt lender and what percentage of each loan will you charge your customers?</strong></p>
<p>KH: I really can&#8217;t tell you, including because it&#8217;s going to vary from fintech to fintech; some have more complicated user models, some have bigger user bases, some operate in different regions around the world. What I can say is that it&#8217;s an incredible time for us to access debt capital from institutions because interest rates are so low and even negative in some parts of Europe. You just have to have the right team to know where to go and get it.</p>
<p><strong>TC You&#8217;re also raised $5 million in seed equity funding already at a post-money valuation of $100 million, including from Andre Charoo of Maple VC, who says he&#8217;s written you his biggest check yet. Are you done raising equity funding for now? That&#8217;s already a very high valuation.</strong></p>
<p>KH: We&#8217;re trying to decide now if we&#8217;re going direct to a Series A. This is our first raise, but everybody &#8216;gets&#8217; our business model, so we&#8217;ve had an avalanche of investors, and some very big VCs now have reached out.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Obviously, interest rates will go up. What then?</strong></p>
<p>KH: When interest rates go up, all lending gets more expensive. I mean, there&#8217;s a pandemic right now and a lot of cash in the system, and there&#8217;s some talk about inflation, but we don&#8217;t really see interest rates going up for a few years.</p>
<p>Of course they will eventually rise, but when that happens, everybody&#8217;s rates will go up, whether you borrow on a credit card or from a traditional bank or a fintech.</p>
