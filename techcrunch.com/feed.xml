					<description><![CDATA[Losing Chinese corporate venture capitalists entirely, and overnight -- which will not happen, mind -- would be sharply contractionary but not lethal.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since the Ant Group IPO was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">canceled by central authorities</a>, China&#8217;s government has been on a regulatory tear.</p>
<p>You know the broad outlines: After a lengthy period of growth, capital investment and aggressive business practices, China&#8217;s central government spent much of 2021 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">reining in its technology sector</a>. While some of the actions were reasonable from an antitrust perspective, many of the changes to the country&#8217;s tech sector appeared more punitive toward entities viewed as too powerful.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220368 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">for-profit edtech sector got hit</a>. Didi was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/04/didi-app-pulled-from-app-stores-after-suspension-order/">effectively executed</a> after it had the audacity to go public in the United States. Video game time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/china-restricts-kids-online-gaming-to-three-hours-a-week/">for kids was cut</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-game-regulator-stops-issuing-licenses-110541021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming titles left unapproved</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/china-proposes-strict-control-of-algorithms/">algorithms put under the microscope</a>, and more. The business climate for building tech companies under the new &#8220;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60034050" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Common Prosperity</a>&#8221; push in the country appeared to take a dramatic turn for the worse.</p>
<p>As a result of the changes, the value of many well-known Chinese technology companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/global-investors-flee-from-chinese-tech-stocks-after-the-government-crackdown-on-ant-and-alibaba/">suffered</a>.</p>
<p>Although the exit window for China-built tech companies is seemingly constricting to only domestic exchanges, and the space made available in the economy for tech companies to build and innovate apparently shrinking, venture capital activity was strong last year in the country.</p>
<p>We were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/china-venture-capital-q3-2021/">surprised to see it as 2021 entered its final months</a>, just as we were surprised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/data-show-2021-was-a-bonkers-record-setting-year-for-venture-capital/">when we got the full-year numbers</a>.</p>
<p>But there was more. ByteDance recently &#8220;dissolved its strategic investment team, sending worrying messages to other internet giants that have expanded aggressively by investing in other companies,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/tiktok-bytedance-dissolves-strategic-investment-arm/">TechCrunch reported</a>. Why did TikTok&#8217;s parent company do so? We explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the beginning of this year, ByteDance reviewed its “businesses’ needs” and decided to “reduce investments in areas that are not key business focuses,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. &#8230;</p>
<p>The “restructuring” still stirred up a wave of panic in the industry. China’s cyberspace regulator has drafted new guidelines that will require its “internet behemoths” to get its approval before undertaking any investments or fundraisings, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-cyberspace-regulator-drafts-new-rules-internet-behemoths-sources-2022-01-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters reported</a>. Some Chinese media outlets reported similar drafted rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hot damn.</p>
<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re still sorting out precisely what is going on, but it appears that the ability of large Chinese tech companies to deploy capital at will into smaller companies is rapidly coming to a close.</p>
<p>From this juncture, our question is simple: Will government regulations slowing Big Tech investments into smaller companies in China shake up its larger venture capital market? Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Tracking corporate venture capital investment in China</h2>
<p>The answer to our question is yes, but perhaps not lethally.</p>
<p>Tracking just how important corporate venture capital is to the Chinese VC scene is an interesting problem to crack. One way to view the data is to look at the list of most active investors in private Chinese tech companies in the last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram announced today it will allow users to remix any video content on the app, not just short-form reels videos. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/instagram-officially-launches-remix-on-reels-a-tiktok-duets-like-feature/">officially launched Remix</a>, its version of TikTok Duets, last March. The feature lets users record their reels video alongside a video from another user, as a means of interacting, reacting, collaborating, or highlighting other content on the Instagram Reels platform. Now Instagram says any public video on the app is fair game for a remix. But this only applies to videos published publicly from this point forward &#8212; the feature won&#8217;t work on older content.</p>
<p>The company said the expansion made sense as it&#8217;s watched as Remix has been embraced by Reels users. It wanted to offer more ways for creators to &#8220;reinvent their content&#8221; and collaborate with others. When remixing a non-Reels video, creators will still have access to Reels&#8217; set of creative tools, including Collabs, Voiceover, Effects and Audio Tools.</p>
<p>To use the new feature, users can tap the three-dot menu in the upper-right corner of any public Instagram video published after this update goes live. From there, you&#8217;ll choose &#8220;Remix this video&#8221; and record your answer or upload a video from your phone&#8217;s camera roll. Creators are able to remix either all or part of the other person&#8217;s video, and download it as part of the remix. The resulting remixed video will then be visible anywhere you share your reels.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259997" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Though the feature&#8217;s expansion could certainly inspire more remixing, resulting in more content for Instagram Reels, it&#8217;s not clear that all Instagram creators will be open to the idea of having their video content repurposed in this way. Those who don&#8217;t want to participate will need to opt out of having their videos remixed from their account settings, Instagram says. This is available under the &#8220;Reels and Remix Controls&#8221; setting, which now allows you to toggle on or off remixes for both reels and feed videos. All users are being defaulted to &#8220;on&#8221; for the new feature, however.</p>
<p>Alternately, creators who want to allow some videos to be remixed and others not, will be able to disable remixes on a per-video basis if they chose to leave the setting on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260097" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260097" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2260097" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260097" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>With the launch of remixes for public videos, Instagram seems to assume that everyone with a public account intends to be a &#8220;creator&#8221; and is open to the idea of having their content repurposed by other users. That&#8217;s not necessarily the case. A number of Instagram users may have simply allowed their accounts to default to public during their initial sign-up, without realizing that doing so would later expose their content to a potentially much wider audience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, Instagram isn&#8217;t the first to automatically opt-in users to having their content repurposed in order to better compete with TikTok. When YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">launched</a> its own TikTok rival, YouTube Shorts, it did so by allowing creators to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10623810?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=10343432">sample audio</a> from other people&#8217;s videos for use in their own. Instagram has just taken things a step further.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260096" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260096" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2260096" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260096" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Unrelated to the remix changes, Instagram also announced it would now allow users to highlight the topic, date and time of a scheduled Live on their profiles. This will give users an easier way to view and sign up for Lives and creators won&#8217;t necessarily have to create a feed post to promote the event.</p>
<p>The new features are rolling out to all Instagram users now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mitsubishi Electric, the automaker&#8217;s electronics equipment manufacturing company, is starting a pilot program to explore the value of autonomous robots. The company will be working with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/google-spinoff-cartken-and-reef-technologies-launch-miamis-first-delivery-robots/">Cartken, the Google alum startup that came out of stealth last March</a>, to unleash a small number of Cartken&#8217;s delivery robots in a Japanese mall to provide indoor and curb-side food delivery services, initially for Starbucks customers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers will be able to use their Starbucks app to select robotic delivery for their order, and a Cartken robot will meet the customer at one of the delivery points inside or outside the mall, <a href="https://www.e-logit.com/loginews/2022:011905.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Mitsubishi</a>. </span>The pilot, which will take place at <span style="font-weight: 400;">Aeon Mall Tokoname starting this month, </span>will run through April 2022 with plans to scale to a porter service that resembles curbside pickup for other shoppers, according to <span style="font-weight: 400;">Anjali Jindal Naik, COO and co-founder of Cartken. </span></p>
<p>The pilot with Cartken, Mitsubishi&#8217;s first time trying out delivery robots, will help the company explore other use cases for the tech while tapping into the nascent Japanese autonomous delivery market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259661" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mitsubishi Electric would like to create the new robot delivery market in Japan by using Cartken robots,&#8221; Naoki Fujita, who manages Mitsubishi Electric&#8217;s Mobility Innovation Department, told TechCrunch. &#8220;This is a totally new attempt for us, and in this process, we can utilize our knowledge, technology and even relationships with customers from Mitsubishi&#8217;s various business units to see the development of this program succeed and expand into new markets where the technology can be used.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>While the first phase of the partnership sees Mitsubishi as a distributor for Cartken&#8217;s tech, down the line, the two companies intend to work together to develop additional technology that will support Mitsubishi&#8217;s future partnerships. For example, they&#8217;re currently looking into the development of facility technology that can help Cartken&#8217;s robots interact with elevators, said Fujita.</p>

<p>Cartken, which partnered with REEF Technology last year to bring its self-driving robots to deliver food in downtown Miami, will not only gain from Mitsubishi&#8217;s expertise in electrical equipment, but it will also help the startup establish a presence in Japan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Starting a pilot at Aeon Mall will help with that. Aeon is one of the largest retailers in Asia, with a retail network that spans not just hundreds of malls, but also convenience stores and supermarkets.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The selection of Aeon Mall is because it is the perfect ecosystem to test the robots&#8217; success in a setting that is high-volume,&#8221; Naik told TechCrunch. &#8220;Also, Aeon Mall allows for a range of use-cases to be investigated, with the goal of quickly adding more robots to allow more visitors to experience delivery service, and then scaling up by 2022.&#8221;</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3sVyUpEwz1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/google-spinoff-cartken-and-reef-technologies-launch-miamis-first-delivery-robots/">Google alum startup Cartken and REEF Technology launch Miami&#8217;s first delivery robots</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google alum startup Cartken and REEF Technology launch Miami&#8217;s first delivery robots&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/google-spinoff-cartken-and-reef-technologies-launch-miamis-first-delivery-robots/embed/#?secret=3sVyUpEwz1" data-secret="3sVyUpEwz1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Cartken&#8217;s Model C robots were chosen by Mitsubishi because of their high rating in safety and dependability in both indoor and outdoor settings, said Fujita. The startup says its robots can navigate autonomously inside and outside the mall, but they are all equipped with remote monitoring systems that allow for human override if necessary.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So far we’ve only encountered a few situations that need emergency remote assistance,&#8221; said Naik. &#8220;New construction that requires an alternate robot route is an example of where a remote operator gets involved. Similarly, remote assistance is also used in the setup phase, allowing us to deploy in just a few days while the robots learn a map of the service area.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Recently, competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/serve-robotics-new-autonomous-sidewalk-delivery-robots-dont-require-human-assist/">Serve Robotics, a spinout of Uber, announced its robots&#8217; ability to handle similar levels of autonomy</a>. The company said in certain operational design domains, AKA geofenced areas, its robots can reach full autonomy.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Parliament has definitively backed major limits on behavioral advertising during a plenary vote on amendments to the pan-EU Digital Services Act (DSA).</p>
<p>The move looks set to crank up pressure on Big Tech business models that rely on pervasive tracking and profiling of users to target ads &#8212; with adtech duopoly Facebook and Google, which make most of their money through mass surveillance and microtargeting of Internet users, squarely in the frame.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In an </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">earlier vote</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the parliament already backed a full ban on profiling minors and limits on the use of special category data for ad targeting to be added to another piece of draft digital legislation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259927" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But while the DMA will apply to so-called internet &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; (such as Facebook and Google) the latest amendments expand the remit of restrictions even further as t</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he DSA updates the bloc&#8217;s long-standing ecommerce directive, so is set to apply to digital services more broadly. </span></p>
<p>Having the same provisions in both packages of legislation is also important for legislative consistency (which supports enforcement) &#8212; and sends a clear signal of where the parliament stands on this issue.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5XfDCHyxM0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Europe lays out its plan to reboot digital rules and tame tech giants</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out its plan to reboot digital rules and tame tech giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/embed/#?secret=5XfDCHyxM0" data-secret="5XfDCHyxM0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While MEPs rejected an amendment to the DSA that had proposed a complete ban on behavioral advertising, a number of amendments proposed by a coalition of MEPs, civil society organisations and companies &#8212; organizing as the <a href="https://trackingfreeads.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tracking-free Ads Coalition</a> &#8212; were passed during the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/sed/doc/news/flash/25941/Result_19-01-2022_Voting%20session_en.pdf">votes</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These included one that is &#8212; effectively &#8212; a ban on using UX tweaks to manipulate/force consent as the amendment requires platforms to offer parity in consent flows for refusing or agreeing to hand over data.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the event of a user denying profiling the amendment says they should be given &#8220;other fair and reasonable options&#8221; to access the service. This amendment was passed with 329 in favor vs 303 against (with 60 abstentions).</p>
<p>Another Coalition amendment which passed mirrors provisions in the DMA to ban the ad profiling of minors and also prohibit the use of highly sensitive personal data (such as racial or ethnic origin, political or religious affiliation, sexuality or health data) for behavioral targeting of <em>anyone.</em></p>
<p>It passed with a larger majority: 410:273 (with 9 abstentions).</p>
<p>At the same time, an attempt to weaken the draft legislation by removing existing restrictions in the text on dark patterns &#8212; via a split vote &#8212; was also resoundingly defeated by MEPs in a definitive rejection of Big Tech&#8217;s lobbying against regulation.</p>
<p>On dark patterns the parliament voted overwhelmingly (524:157; with 11 abstentions) to reiterate its desire for a ban.</p>
<p>Practices the parliament wants outlawed include giving more visual prominence to certain consent options vs others; repeatedly requesting consent after a denial to try to fatigue users into agreeing; nudging users to change settings after they have already made a choice; ignoring automated opt-outs signalled by users and requesting consent regardless; and making it &#8220;significantly more cumbersome&#8221; to terminate a service vs signing up.</p>
<p>The upshot of these votes is that the elected representatives of EU citizens have signalled strong backing for significant restrictions to microtargeting and related adtech practices (like manipulative consent flows) which &#8212; if they make it through into the final law &#8212; will put a significant squeeze on surveillance-based business models, increasing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/">pressure for adtech reform</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CvBjusAMIK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/">UK privacy watchdog warns adtech the end of tracking is nigh</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK privacy watchdog warns adtech the end of tracking is nigh&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/embed/#?secret=CvBjusAMIK" data-secret="CvBjusAMIK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This is extremely significant because &#8212; trilogue pending &#8212; you can&#8217;t target people anymore on all the sensitive data or whatever can be used to infer that sensitive data, so sexual orientation, political affiliation, trade union membership, ethnic origin and so on, that&#8217;s quite broad &#8212; and whatever could be used to infer that,&#8221; said MEP Alexandra Geese, one of the parliamentarians backing the Tracking-Free Ads Coalition, speaking to TechCrunch after the vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a game-changer &#8212; together with the other provisions we already had, and the compromise on the DMA which is the ban for targeted advertising on minors&#8230; the [provisions against] dark patterns [to] clearly allow people to say &#8216;yes&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217; to tracking. That&#8217;s a bunch of provisions that clearly limit the possibility to use surveillance advertising significantly and I think that could usher in a change of the whole business model of the internet &#8212; away from surveillance advertising and towards contextual advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be complicated for platforms,&#8221; she added. &#8220;They will defend [current targeting practices] but all the restrictions are significant and I think especially advertisers will start looking at that and say, well why do we have to put up with these &#8212; in the end we don&#8217;t reach the people, why can&#8217;t we just do context? So I&#8217;m really hoping for a change of the business mode&#8230; We&#8217;re clearly showing this is not working, this is not compatible with a democracy &#8212; do something about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>An industry standard framework for obtaining consents to serve tracking ads currently is already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">facing a finding that it breaches the General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR).</p>
<p>So quite how the current creepy adtech &#8216;standard&#8217; &#8212; of pervasive, consentless profiling of Internet, users combined with high velocity trading of people&#8217;s attention &#8212; would be able to survive with even less rope to lasso consumers&#8217; eyeballs in the future is indeed unclear.</p>
<p>Geese pointed to a statement by Facebook in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/facebook-will-no-longer-allow-advertisers-to-target-political-beliefs-religion-sexual-orientation/">November</a> &#8212; when the tech giant announced that it would not longer allow advertisers to target people based on &#8220;sensitive&#8221; topics, arguing: &#8220;They are feeling the heat, definitely,&#8221; before pressing the case to follow through and cement legislative limits: &#8220;But as long as we don&#8217;t have the instruments to check this that doesn&#8217;t mean anything &#8212; I mean who believes Mark Zuckerberg anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">DSA proposal</a> also contains a package of measures to dial up transparency and accountability on platforms and their hierarchy generating AIs &#8212; requiring larger platforms to submit to a degree of regulatory oversight of their algorithms, as well as to provide public interest researchers with access to data to enable independent scrutiny of platform effects.</p>
<p>Such measures will clearly be crucial in ensuring any legislative limits on Big Tech&#8217;s microtargeting are actually implemented by the platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We clearly can&#8217;t solve all the problems with the DSA &#8212; because first of all we need to do a lot more research, and the problem is so far we couldn&#8217;t do the research because we couldn&#8217;t access the data,&#8221; says Geese. &#8220;[But] with the DSA you give the Commission, the digital service coordinators, researchers and NGOs access to the data if they have good projects in order to assess the compliance so once the DSA&#8217;s in force we will start having an enormous amount of knowledge, of insights. And we will be able to come up with even better and more precise regulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t depend on Mark Zuckerberg or someone from Google telling us &#8216;oh we&#8217;re doing nothing wrong&#8217;; we will have the knowledge to deal with it. I think this is really what makes a difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s vote to restrict adtech is especially significant given the massive lobbying effort by Google and Facebook throughout last year, also looping in their extensive proxy network of third party industry organizations to lobby on their behalf.</p>
<p>US tech giants have poured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/us-giants-top-tech-industrys-100m-a-year-lobbying-blitz-in-eu/">literally millions into trying to influence</a> the shape of this major update to EU digital legislation in recent years &#8212; leading to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">some especially </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1483786510214303744">cringeworthy memeing</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> this week from internal market commissioner EVP, Thierry Breton. (Albeit, at least Breton avoided straight-up parroting of adtech talking points, <a href="https://twitter.com/_Kaari_N/status/1461269111611314186" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlike some others in the Commission</a>&#8230; ).</span></p>
<p>Big (ad)tech&#8217;s campaigning against regulation of tracking ads also &#8212; oh the irony! &#8212; included a blitz of ads targeted at EU lawmakers ahead of today&#8217;s vote, as well as plenty of cash splashed on traditional newspaper ads. Such as the below Facebook ad in a German newspaper pushing a self-serving claim that small businesses need tracking ads to survive&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the end, MEPs don&#8217;t appear to have been taken in by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">Nick Clegg&#8217;s favorite talking point</a>. (Aka: &#8216;Save Me(ta) to Save SMEs&#8217;.)</p>
<p>How did they resist all that spin? Paul Tang, another of the parliamentarians who&#8217;s backed the push against tracking ads, pointed to a <a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/french-and-german-smes-oppose-tracking-based-ads-survey-finds/">recent YouGov survey</a> of SMEs in France and Germany &#8212; which found a majority don&#8217;t actually want to use tracking ads but said they feel they have no choice but to use Facebook and Google because of their market dominance.</p>
<p>He also highlighted the impact of antitrust reports, produced by competition authorities in the UK and Australia in recent years, digging into the adtech duopoly &#8212; which have suggested the lion&#8217;s share of every ad dollar (or euro) ends up in the coffers of Facebook and Google. (Or, put another way, the Big Adtech philosophy is: &#8216;me, me, me; not SME&#8217;.)</p>
<p>Tang also pointed out that the Coalition put over a year of work into raising awareness and educating fellow lawmakers on the issues and harms linked to tracking ads, with all this effort inexorably buoyed up by a parade of Big Tech scandals over the period &#8212; such as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-european-parliament/">Facebook Files</a>. Or the flow of cartel-ish revelations from various <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">antitrust suits</a>.</p>
<p>So, in the European parliament at least, the penny appears to have dropped on Big Tech.</p>
<p>What happens next? The plenary vote amending the DSA sets the parliament&#8217;s negotiating position for trilogue discussions with its co-legislators, the Council (aka EU Member States&#8217; governments) and the Commission &#8212; so Facebook and Google&#8217;s lobbying will likely swing towards Member State governments in earnest. And perhaps we&#8217;ll see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy/">Sundar Pichai finding time for another politician-pressing tour of European capitals</a>.</p>
<p>In one early reaction to the parliament&#8217;s vote, the European arm of adtech industry association, the Interact Advertising Bureau (IAB), showed no signs of dialling down the lobbying &#8212; describing the vote as &#8220;disappointing&#8221;, and claiming that &#8220;personal data in advertising is already tightly regulated by existing legislation&#8221;, before urging EU lawmakers to &#8220;reconsider&#8221; to &#8220;ensure we end up with a DSA that provides legal certainty for all actors&#8221;.</p>
<p>The IAB&#8217;s regional director of public policy, Greg Mroczkowski, added in the statement: &#8220;It is disappointing that in a mistaken belief that targeted advertising causes online disinformation or breaches privacy and data protection principles, MEPs have decided to pass amendments that not only overlap with the GDPR and existing consumer law but risk undermining these rules, as well as the entire ad-supported digital economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, a Digital Services Act that boosts transparency and certainty across the online economy is in everyone’s interests. We will be consulting with our members and all interested stakeholders to try to come up with solutions that are workable, secure and efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is still months more road to run on this drama before the full and final detail of the DSA is hammered out &#8212; so plenty could change. But, after the trilogue discussions conclude &#8212; assuming a compromise is reached (it still has not over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/07/eprivacy-an-overview-of-europes-other-big-privacy-rule-change/">ePrivacy reform</a>) &#8212; MEPs get another vote on the final text s<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">o today&#8217;s vote underscoring the parliament&#8217;s red lines on adtech sends a strong signal to Member States over what the parliament will accept in the final legislative package. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Hence why anti-tracking ads campaigners are sounding so jubilant. (And, well, the IAB isn&#8217;t.)</span></p>

<p>&#8220;There was an enormous amount of lobbying on parliament&#8230; It was really enormous &#8212; and we still made it. So I&#8217;m a lot more optimistic than yesterday, I have to say,&#8221; adds Geese. &#8220;This is a really really good report we&#8217;re passing in parliament today.&#8221;</p>
<p>On potential Council pushback, she suggests any pro-tracking moves by Member State governments might be tempered by the momentum that&#8217;s now been generated on the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;In trilogue &#8212; let&#8217;s see. From what I know, surveillance advertising wasn&#8217;t a big issue in the discussions in Council that led to the general approach. It wasn&#8217;t even discussed much. And now there&#8217;s a momentum &#8212; that is very, very different &#8212; and I think governments will have to look into it. And ask themselves is that really the position we want to defend? Why are we defending Meta&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s interests rather than the interests of our own companies?</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s going to be a different debate, I think. I know the general approach of the Council is already fixed but this is a possibility. We have to find a compromise anyway &#8212; and we will discuss it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Germany the government has changed in the meantime. That might have some weight. It depends a little bit. We will see. Too early to foresee that I think &#8212; but there&#8217;s an open space right now to talk about it,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;If we had lost this vote it would have been a lot more difficult because it would have been limited to minors. But now we have to discuss it in the trilogue very actively.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about the defeat of the amendment that had proposed a full, default ban on profiling for ads, Geese suggests Big Tech&#8217;s  lobbying did succeed in sewing enough FUD around the issue to create doubt in MEPs&#8217; minds.</p>
<p>But she argues their spin won&#8217;t be able to survive the rising scrutiny &#8212; including from antitrust regulators interrogating the source of the adtech duopoly&#8217;s market power. So the direction of travel in the coming years looks clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the platforms manage to do was the instil the idea in people that either you have surveillance advertising or you have no advertising at all online. And that&#8217;s not true,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We need some more time to show that this is not true &#8212; there&#8217;s some very good alternatives that would be even a lot better for European companies, also in terms of competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have these huge competition issues with Google and Facebook controlling in Germany and France, 70% of the market &#8212; globally a lot more &#8212; and now the people who really follow competition policy in digital markets know that, with the Texas lawsuit discoveries and so on that there&#8217;s really cartel curbing going on&#8230;. So once there&#8217;s interest for the topic you can communicate these facts but first you need to raise awareness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s complicated to explain and it&#8217;s not something people really feel in their daily lives, so politicians are not too motivated to look into this&#8230; And this is why this success is so important because in trilogue, the media, everyone will start talking about it, looking into it, and see how rotten the system is &#8212; and why it&#8217;s so bad for us. This is why I have quite a lot of home that sooner or later we will either have a total ban or just phase out the business model.&#8221;</p>

The company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-will-test-cryptocurrency-wallet-novi-in-small-pilot-210320677.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Novi wallet</a> technology would power much of the &#8220;supporting functionality,&#8221; one tipster said. Instagram is reportedly testing a way to showcase NFTs, while Meta is also said to be discussing a marketplace that would help you buy or sell these digital collectibles.</p>
<p>The company has already declined to comment, and the sources cautioned the effort was still early and could change.However, Instagram leader Adam Mosseri said in December that his social network was &#8220;actively exploring&#8221; NFTs.

<p>A dip into NFTs would make sense.

This could also help Meta prevent third-party platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opensea-nft-insider-trader-resigns-190502174.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">OpenSea&#8217;s</a> market from gaining too strong a hold if NFTs prove to be more than a short-lived trend.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259979" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.workplace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workplace</a>, the app owned and originally built by Facebook (now Meta) as a version of the social network for enterprise employees to communicate with each other, has signed up upwards of 7 million users, finding traction in particular among multinational organizations with a mix of front-line, deskless and desk-based workers, as a way for management to stay connected to all of them, and for those employees to chat about work with each other.</p>
<p>Now, it is gearing up to add in more functionality to enhance that usefulness: Workplace will soon be adding in an integration with <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp</a>, the popular messaging app with billions of users and also owned by Meta, so that Workplace customers can cross-post announcements and share other data with employees using the messaging app.</p>
<p>WhatsApp functionality is expected to go live sometime later this year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259947" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It sounds like messaging communication will be part of that initial launch, but the company is also working on ways of integrating other kinds of Workplace productivity functionality into WhatsApp, such as integrating Shift Cover &#8212; a way for shift workers to swap shifts with each other other and keep managers and their planning systems in the loop, which was initially launched on Workplace back in <a href="https://en-gb.workplace.com/resources/news-updates/november-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Ujjwal Singh, the head of Workplace, would not be specific about the exact timing, explaining that there are still &#8220;working through the details&#8221; of how it will function, with some decisions still being made, the focus being how best to leverage what is in its DNA a consumer app as an enterprise service.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-2260112" width="5760" height="3600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5760px) 100vw, 5760px" />&#8220;This is something we&#8217;d been working on for a while,&#8221; he said in an interview, noting that even though the two have been a part of the same stable under Facebook, the different business announcements that WhatsApp has been making, for example <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-doubles-down-on-business-tools-with-whatsapp-api-updates-login-connect-for-messenger-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding the WhatsApp API</a> last year, needed to be in place first. It&#8217;s also been working with customers to build the feature. &#8220;We want to be careful about what goes out to a consumer app. We wanted to do this in a way that was safe for companies to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move to bring more business usage to WhatsApp and more functionality into Workplace are both a long time coming but fit with the broader strategies for both products, and with Meta&#8217;s strategy as a whole.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the Meta front, the company has been on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messenger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">years-long mission</a> to bring its various apps closer together both as customer-facing services and at the back end. That strategy has included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrating Messenger with Instagram&#8217;s messaging feature</a> so that consumers could communicate across the apps; and it&#8217;s also had a business/commercial focus, giving companies that use WhatsApp for Business the ability to initiate contacts on, say, Facebook, and <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/how-to-message-a-business-on-whatsapp-from-their-facebook-shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue conversations more directly over WhatsApp</a>. Those efforts have not been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/02/facebook-warned-over-privacy-risks-of-merging-messaging-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncontroversial</a>, although gradually they have been rolled out nevertheless.</p>
<p>This brings not just more activity to the different platforms, but creates more reasons to sway businesses to advertise, use premium products like WhatsApp for Business, and generally carry out more commercial activities across Meta. They are also potentially building out a bigger use case for Meta as more than just a consumer product that is based around advertising across its apps.</p>
<p>Workplace started out in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/10/facebook-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early days</a> as essentially Facebook&#8217;s answer to the rise of Slack: why let an upstart eat our enterprise lunch, the thinking went, when so many people are already using Facebook for non-work interactions (and some work ones), and our own employees have proven that it&#8217;s possible to use Facebook for work chit-chat and planning?</p>
<p>Longer term, it seems that this original thesis didn&#8217;t quite carry out as Facebook had thought it would: initially it brought in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/06/facebook-workplace-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of integrations</a>, similar to those you might find on Slack, to position Workplace as a useful productivity hub, and to that it added a lot of native functionality around collaboration and communication for knowledge workers. But more recently, it seems to have shifted focus somewhat.</p>
<p>First of all, products like Slack and Teams from Microsoft continued to stick around and grow their reputations &#8212; a shift that Workplace has followed by working more closely with those platforms. (Most recently, with a <a href="https://www.workplace.com/blog/workplace-and-microsoft-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teams integration</a> for video and other features.) Second of all, it&#8217;s found a new wave of users among those who are &#8220;deskless&#8221;, front-line and other customer-facing workers who are not sitting at computers all day, but on the go, with mobile phones being their primary way of interacting with their managers, colleagues and organizations overall.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px">&#8220;A lot of frontline workers outside the US are using consumer tools like WhatsApp to get work done,&#8221; Singh said. &#8220;We have data that says using WhatsApp for shift management is just part of it. The data shows that frontline workers feel disconnected from executives making decisions, and so that is the key point of this integration.&#8221; He&#8217;s referring here to new research the company is also releasing today that supports how Workplace is developing. If found that ju</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px">st over half (54%) of frontline workers said they felt connected to their organization’s HQ &#8212; one reason why it sees an opportunity to build out Workplace, and WhatsApp as a way to bridge that gap.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Longer term, this WhatsApp integration, and the wider shift that the company is making to serve deskless workers, are positioning Workplace among a new wave of apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/blink-a-productivity-app-aimed-at-frontline-workers-raises-20m-at-a-100m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blink</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/yoobic-raises-50m-for-its-chat-and-communications-app-app-aimed-at-frontline-and-service-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoobic</a> targeting front-line employees and their specific requirements and functions in the workplace. It will be interesting to see whether Facebook chooses to remain a simple messaging and communications tool in that mix or whether it starts to build more features to cater specifically to those users. It&#8217;s a crowded field, with others also vying for customers in this space including When I Work — which last year raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/when-i-work-an-messaging-app-that-lets-shift-based-teams-schedule-work-and-more-raises-200m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/homebase-raises-71m-for-a-team-management-platform-aimed-at-smbs-and-their-hourly-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebase</a>, which raised $71 million; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/workiz-locks-in-13m-for-productivity-tools-aimed-at-home-services-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workiz</a>, which focuses on home services pros;&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/workwhile-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WorkWhile</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/crew-a-workplace-and-slack-messaging-rival-for-shift-workers-raises-35m-adds-enterprise-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crew</a>&nbsp;(which&nbsp;<a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-acquires-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Square acquired</a> last year); and <a href="https://www.justworkshours.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justworks</a> (which in September 2021 filed to go public).</p>

<p>Laura McGee, co-founder and CEO, started the company in 2018 after doing diversity and inclusion consulting for corporate clients and the government that led her to do a lot of CEO roundtables. She kept hearing from them that while diversity was well understood, they didn’t know how to do it.</p>
<p>“We said, ‘we hear you,’ but there were no metrics or accountability, and those were the kinds of tools that will help us set targets and then actually drive change,” McGee told TechCrunch. “From our perspective, this is a software solution. This has got to be something that companies use on an ongoing basis, is tied to business records and ultimately provides evidence-based recommendations.”</p>
<p>Diversio’s software takes in survey data from employees and uses natural language processing algorithms to analyze the data. From that feedback, Diversio can identify specific problems that are preventing diverse employees from doing their best work. Then the company matches those pain points to action items pulled from a recommendation engine of 1,600 validated programs and policies from around the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series A is the company’s first institutional funding after raising $60,000 from angel investors and bootstrapping the company. In fact, fundraising for this particular business case was a challenge until she met Meka Asonye, partner at First Round. The questions in 2018 were around if companies would spend money in this area, McGee said.</p>
<p>Then in 2020, the world changed, particularly surrounding the death of George Floyd. That, and for a variety of reasons, diversity and inclusion were recognized as a critical business — and rightly so, McGee explained.</p>
<p>“Customers are expecting companies to take action, and investors are starting to ask questions when they allocate capital,” she added. “And then equally the risk is becoming ever greater. If as a company you undergo a scandal, there is really nothing that can bring you down faster.”</p>
<p>Since launching in 2018, Diversio has grown 300% year over year. Over the past 12 months, the company doubled its customers and is now working with about 400 customers, many that have come through working with investors across their portfolios, McGee said.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to invest in its team. The company currently has 35 employees, and McGee’s plan is to double that by the end of the year, especially in the company’s new offices in London and New York. It will also work on product development, including more targeted and customized data analysis and the recommendation engine.</p>

<p>Next up, McGee expects to grow the company’s international footprint in Europe and the U.K. and grow more in North America. Diversio is also working on getting additional partnerships.</p>
<p>“The 30% Club is one example, and investors are another,” McGee added. “Our vision is establishing a set of inclusion metrics that are widely adopted and creating a platform and a system that allows companies to really learn from one another in order to refine the recommendation.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, First Round’s Asonye said when talking to Diversio customers, they would tell him that they know they have a diversity and inclusion problem and didn’t know where to start, but having a platform like Diversio helped them not only measure, but then act, was a differentiator from other companies in the market.</p>
<p>And at a time when a lot of companies are raising money because it is a convenient time in the market, or they are raising money because they have to, it was “impressive” to see the way Diversio was able grow to the size and scope it did and to get to the number of customers essentially as a bootstrapped company, he added.</p>
<p>“One of the other really interesting things about the business is that this is a problem that hits medium companies, small companies and big companies, and despite the fact that you would think somebody would have this figured out, that&#8217;s not the case,” Asonye added. “They have the high-growth tech companies that go from 50 to 200 and start asking if they should be thinking about values. Almost every piece of the market actually has this sort of problem and is traveling to find the solution. That really resonated with us.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A cyberattack targeting a contractor working for the International Committee of the Red Cross has spilled confidential data on more than 515,000 &#8220;highly vulnerable&#8221; people, many of whom have been separated from their families due to conflict, migration and disaster.</p>
<p>The Red Cross did not name the contractor, based in Switzerland, which it uses to store data nor say what led to the security incident, but said that the data comes from at least 60 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies.</p>
<p>In a statement, the international organization pleaded with the attackers not to publicly share or leak the information given the sensitivity of the data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259963" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Your actions could potentially cause yet more harm and pain to those who have already endured untold suffering. The real people, the real families behind the information you now have are among the world&#8217;s least powerful. Please do the right thing. Do not share, sell, leak or otherwise use this data,&#8221; read <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/sophisticated-cyber-attack-targets-red-cross-red-crescent-data-500000-people">the statement</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of the breach, the organization shut down its Restoring Family Links program, which aims to reunite family members separated by conflict or disaster.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Red Cross told TechCrunch that the stolen information included names, locations and contact information, as well as credentials used to access some of the organization&#8217;s programs.</p>
<p>The hack compromised personal data such as names, locations, and contact information of more than 515,000 people. The people affected include missing people and their families, unaccompanied or separated children, detainees and other people receiving services from the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement as a result of armed conflict, natural disasters or migration. Login information for about 2,000 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers who work on these programs has also been compromised. No other information at the ICRC was compromised due to the segmentation of the systems,&#8221; said Red Cross spokesperson Crystal Ashley Wells.</p>
<p>International human rights groups and disaster relief agencies are an increasing target for hackers. Last year the United Nations had its <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/09/09/united-nations-hackers/">network breached</a> by unknown cyberattackers, and Microsoft revealed that the U.S. Agency for International Development <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/us/politics/russia-hack-usaid.html">was targeted</a> to launch malicious emails to thousands of targets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Customer service is making and breaking companies over the past two years as shopping moved online and consumers wanted more out of the traditional service companies were offering.</p>
<p><a href="https://zingtree.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zingtree</a> provides interactive contact center software that guides agents to the next best action so that they can cater to even the most discerning customer.</p>
<p>To continue developing its product, the company raised $15 million in Series A funding. Conductive Ventures led the round and was joined by Storm Ventures, Madrona and angel investors like Hilarie Koplow-McAdams. Existing investors participating in the round included Rally Ventures, Parade Ventures and Vitalize Ventures. The new investment brings the company’s total funding to $18.5 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Zingtree was founded in 2014 to make business information actionable for teams so that agents could quickly make decisions during complex service calls. Users leverage no-code “decision trees” to create detailed agent scripts, guide customers to solve their own issues and manage their internal processes at scale. As a result, agents are able to improve their average handling time, resolution and consumer satisfaction, Juan Jaysingh, CEO of Zingtree told TechCrunch via email.</p>
<p>“Unlike our competitors, business users can build and maintain Zingtree agent scripts without any IT or engineering development resources, and we have ready-built integrations for CRM systems so agents work out of one place, and our interface is so easy to use for agents that it requires little to no training,” Jaysingh added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Alpha Edison leads customer service platform Thankful’s $12M round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/alpha-edison-leads-customer-service-platform-thankfuls-12m-round/embed/#?secret=4zGgLBT3IO" data-secret="4zGgLBT3IO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company is the latest in the customer service sector to attract venture capital. For example, in the past few months, we’ve seen companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/alpha-edison-leads-customer-service-platform-thankfuls-12m-round/">Thankful</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/sanas-aims-to-convert-one-accent-to-another-in-real-time-for-smoother-customer-service-calls/">Sanas</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/zendesk-acquires-ai-automation-startup-cleverly-to-advance-customer-service/">Zendesk</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/level-ai-lands-13m-series-a-to-build-conversational-intelligence-for-customer-service/">Level AI</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/goodcall-picks-up-4m-yelp-partnership-to-answer-merchant-inbound-calls/">Goodcall</a> announce similar news.</p>
<p>Several drivers affected business and customer care processes over the past two years. For example, employee shortages due to COVID cases rising and “The Great Resignation.” Contact center agents now working at home could no longer rely on in-person subject matter experts, managers or experienced peers.</p>
<p>Jaysingh explained that the global pandemic, in particular, has put more onus on companies to improve their customer service capabilities. They are having to manage customers that become frustrated quickly and will leave a brand or enterprise quickly if they don’t get high-quality service at speed.</p>
<p>“This is negatively impacting companies’ revenues if they don’t solve for providing consistent high-quality service to their customers,” he added. “Not only has the pandemic accelerated remote-first culture, it is now seen as a competitive edge to acquire top-notch global talent.”</p>
<p>Zingtree’s enterprise annual recurring revenue grew three times in 2021 after growing two times in 2020. The company “is in striking distance” of profitability, but decided to prioritize growth in taking the latest capital raise, Jaysingh said. It was bootstrapped for six years before taking its first institutional seed funding in 2020 to scale the business.</p>
<p>It is working with more than 600 customers in 50 countries to make more than 15 million human decisions every month. Among the list are consumer brands and enterprise customers like SharkNinja, Groupon, Getty Images, Ricoh, Fossil and Experian.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Though Jaysingh did not give a specific valuation, he did say the new funding round was almost a five-time lift from the previous round a year ago.</p>
<p>He expects to invest heavily in building the Zingtree ,team with plans to double headcount across all departments. It has 46 employees currently after having 10 employees at the end of 2020. The new funding will enable the company to get to 70 by the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>The company will also deploy funds in product development to add enhancements like artificial intelligence and machine learning and data insight solutions and features, as well as build integrations and partnerships with even more contact center core technologies, like current partner Talkdesk.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Carey Lai, founder and managing director of Conductive Ventures, is joining Zingtree’s board of directors, along with Vikram Verma, former CEO of contact center communication platform 8&#215;8.</p>
<p>Lai told TechCrunch via email that Zingtree’s no-code solution was a differentiator from competitors due to its ease of use, while also offering sophisticated features and functionalities. He also was impressed by the company’s early customer traction in attracting top-tier customers and its experienced management team.</p>
<p>“Interesting companies are built when you combine the market opportunity paired with the experience, commitment and vision of the executive leadership team,” he added. “Zingtree is helping enterprises deliver on the promise of great customer support. Over the past seven years, businesses have repeatedly come to Zingtree to help their employees make better and faster decisions daily while still being able to follow standard operating procedures. That&#8217;s a game-changer for contact centers and support teams with complex products, strict compliance and the need to scale.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://codesee.io">CodeSee</a> is an aptly named startup, one that is building a set of tools to help developers understand how all the parts of a code base fit together. Today, the company announced a $7 million secondary seed on top of the $3 million it received in 2020. The round was led by new investors Wellington Access Ventures, Plexo Capital and Menlo Ventures along with several industry angels who had participated in the first seed investment.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder Shanea Leven says that her company is solving a problem of understanding the entire code base, something that every developer struggles with, no matter their level of experience, especially when they encounter a new code base.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always this feeling of dread and anxiety of just how overwhelming this is going to be, and how long is this going to take me before I can actually feel confident that I can make a meaningful contribution to this codebase,&#8221; she said, adding &#8220;No matter how experienced you are. You hit that moment, and you hit it all the time because the code base is actually changing from under you every day.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259946" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Leven says that the company has continued to grow and develop since we last spoke at the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/codesee-launches-oss-port-open-source-project-to-help-developers-visualize-code-base/">their open source OSS Port</a> project last September, and that they are getting closer to releasing a paid version of the product, which is being tested with companies now.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are getting much closer to [completing] a teams and enterprise offering, which is what we are currently working on right now,&#8221; she said. They are also working on a new tool called Review Maps, which makes it easier to visualize changes to the code base in GitHub. Instead of an alphabetical list of the changed files, which doesn&#8217;t actually help understand how the files changed or how they relate to the whole, they get a map of the changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;So when you go to make your meaningful contribution, like you&#8217;re going to go write your first pull request, which is your first code change, we can visualize your change in the context of the rest of your codebase.&#8221; This becomes even more crucial in large, complex projects where hundreds of changes are being pushed a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gets really daunting when you see a code review that has 600 files changed&#8230;and so what most people do when your code review gets that that big is they just don&#8217;t review it. But with us you can, since now you can see your changes. You can zoom out to see the bigger picture. You can kind of see what kind of impact overall your change is going to have to the code base. And that is making developers really happy,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company currently has 13 employees with plans to add 5 or 6 more this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneur John Roa believes in the value of privacy. After selling his design consultancy, ÄKTA, to Salesforce in 2015, he decided to spend a few years “off the grid” on an island in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, he’s back in New York City, launching <a href="https://www.caden.io/">Caden</a>, a startup that allows consumers to share their data with companies and get paid for it in return. Roa wrote the business plan in the form of a thesis on the future of data privacy while he was working at Salesforce, right before he began his sabbatical, he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he first wrote the business plan, it was “purely speculative,” Roa said. He anticipated that regulation would present challenges for companies in storing third-party, or passively collected, data, and envisioned a long-term shift to a “privacy-first” world where users own their personal data and have full control and consent over its use. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259844" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caden, which just came out of stealth mode with a $3.4 million pre-seed round, is Roa’s attempt towards building this world. Jerry Yang, cofounder of TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company, Yahoo!, participated in the round alongside Starwood Capital’s Barry Sternlicht, former Citigroup CTO Don Callahan, and other angel investors, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259849" style="width: 408px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259849" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2259849" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="398" height="265" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg 5252w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259849" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Caden founder John Roa<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Caden</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company calls itself a “zero-party” data platform, which means users share data with brands only on a voluntary basis. One of its core products is an encrypted “on-device vault” where a user can store their personal data and see insights drawn from it – a feature Roa compared to Spotify’s “Year in Review” but spanning a broader set of preferences and behaviors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caden’s second core product is an API called Link, which allows users to connect to accounts like their e-mail or bank and extract their data to store in the vault. Once it’s in the vault, the user can then opt to give permission to specific companies they trust to use the data, and can revoke or alter the permissions at any time because users ultimately own their data stored with Caden, Roa said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roa’s team started working on the technology nine months ago, and plans to bring its beta mobile application to market in the next six months. It will allow users to immediately begin receiving compensation for their data, Roa said, likening the app to a savings account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of US states have either passed or are considering legislation similar to the </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a state law enacted in 2018 that gives consumers the right to opt out of allowing companies to sell their personal information. Although companies have collected third-party data about their users for years, Roa said regulation is turning third-party data collection into “more of a liability than an asset” for companies because of onerous audit and compliance requirements. Zero-party data, he added, is more accurate and robust because it comes directly from the user.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caden hopes to attract consumer brands first because they have the most to gain through better access to data, investor Jerry Yang told TechCrunch in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you think about how much effort and resources are required to collect and store data, infer insights, protect it, buy third-party data, and keep it all current, Caden is creating a platform solution that allows many companies to tap into without doing it themselves. Beyond the first phase, I’m confident that Caden can also go beyond consumer companies,” Yang wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caden isn’t the first company to make a foray into this space. Datacoup tried it back in 2012 with its platform that allowed users to sell their data directly to companies, and </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-andrew-yangs-plan-to-pay-you-for-your-data-doesnt-add-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ended up shutting down in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because users were only making paltry sums of money. Consumer data is difficult to value, and companies are incentivized to find ways to pay as little as possible for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roa believes Caden will be able to surmount these challenges by providing a superior user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While brands are not generally eager to give users their data back, Roa said, &#8220;now, they legally have to, but they don&#8217;t have to make it easy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What Caden and others are doing is devising ways to make that a much more streamlined process that is completely user-driven, so we don&#8217;t actually need the third-party companies to elicit that action back,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also wants to unlock intangible value for consumers through better brand experiences, not just direct payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If by using Caden your life just becomes a little more enjoyable, things are catered to you, and you&#8217;re being spoken to – it&#8217;s those value points that we&#8217;re focused on. And this is where a lot of our contemporaries have struggled,” Roa said.</span></p>

It will offer brands consumers &#8220;know and love,&#8221; according to Amazon, and an app will let you choose an item, size and color and send it directly to a fitting room or pickup counter. The first store is coming to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23676409011" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">The Americana at Brand</a> in Los Angeles sometime &#8220;later this year,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Amazon said it will offer &#8220;hundreds of brands&#8221; chosen by fashion creators and &#8220;feedback provided by millions of customers shopping on Amazon.com.&#8221; It didn&#8217;t specify which, but its online store currently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/luxury/page/AFE3EE04-D5A9-4B33-868A-630812FC42CC?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ref_=sv__2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">carries</a> products from designers like Oscar de la Renta, Altuzarra and La Perla. However, many luxury and high-end brands have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-25-amazon-fashion.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">resisted</a> listing goods online with Amazon.</p>

<p>The stores will offer double the number of styles of traditional stores, while not forcing customers to search manually for the right size or color. Instead, if you see a clothing item you like, you can scan its QR code using the Amazon Shopping App to see sizes, colors, customer ratings and other details. You can then send it to the fitting room or directly to the pickup counter if you don&#8217;t need to try it on. As you might expect, it also uses an AI-powered algorithm to recommend more products based on what you&#8217;ve already picked.</p>
<p>You can open the fitting room door using the app, with all the items you&#8217;ve picked inside. Each one offers a touchscreen that lets you continue shopping and request new items to try on without having to leave. They&#8217;ll then arrive in &#8220;minutes&#8221; thanks to tech that Amazon also uses in its fulfillment centers.</p>
<p>You can feel free to buy items online that you found in the store, with the same prices in both places. Items can be returned in store, and any item you&#8217;ve scanned will be saved in the shopping app so you can revisit it later.</p>
<p>Amazon has already opened a number of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fresh-woodland-hills-la-open-to-public-200248518.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Fresh grocery stores</a>, along with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-02-amazon-books-seattle.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">book stores</a> and even a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-hair-salon-ar-color-bar-121013314.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">hair salon</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, a fintech unicorn known for its APIs that connect consumer bank accounts to financial applications, announced today that it is buying <a href="https://cognitohq.com/">Cognito</a>. The price is around $250 million, paid in a blend of cash and stock TechCrunch understands, though we couldn&#8217;t suss out the exact mix of each.</p>
<p>The deal highlights where Plaid is heading in its post-Visa form. Recall that the company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/">previously intended</a> to sell itself to the consumer credit giant before the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">deal ran into a regulatory wall</a>; since then Plaid has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/plaid-raises-425m-series-d-from-altimeter-as-it-charts-a-post-visa-future/">raised capital and expanded its valuation</a> by a factor of around four.</p>
<p>Cognito is an interesting buy for Plaid, offering verification services for the fintech world, which is distinct from what its acquirer is best known for. In practice, Cognito offers ID verification, along with help with thorny issues like know your customer (KYC) rules, and anti-money laundering requirements.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259799" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If you deal with money in motion, there&#8217;s work to do behind the scenes to ensure that your service is not facilitating nefarious activity, for example. (Unless, naturally, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/outrageous-hsbc-settlement-proves-the-drug-war-is-a-joke-230696/">your company is named HSBC</a>.) By buying Cognito &#8212; the acquiring entity is bringing aboard all of the smaller firm&#8217;s staff, including its three co-founders &#8212; Plaid is layering more services atop its core remit of consumer bank account connections via developer hooks.</p>
<p>Plaid&#8217;s API work puts it in between consumers, and a host of financial applications and services. That&#8217;s a lucrative, important, and I would add sticky place to be &#8212; all good things for a business. But why merely shuttle data back and forth, when it is possible to do more?</p>
<p>Recall that Plaid bought another startup called Flannel last year, in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/plaid-moves-further-payments-march-acquihire-flannel-fintech-2021-6">what Insider described</a> as a push into the payments world; the company, flush with external cash and with equity worth north of $13 billion to use in deals, is adding to its roster of services that it can offer customers.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Plaid CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/zachperret">Zach Perret</a> and Cognito CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/alain">Alain Meier</a> (previously of <a href="https://t.co/IIZsk7uhZZ">Bloom</a>) about the transaction. Meier said that the talks started off as a chat about a partnership that evolved into a sale; per Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cognito-5ed4">data indicates that</a> Cognito raised single-digit millions while independent, meaning that its exit price was likely attractive to its investors and staff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For Plaid the deal makes sense from a number of angles. First, the issue of verifying users for fintech applications is, per Meier, an &#8220;extremely complex problem.&#8221; That means that Plaid can get past building all of what Cognito has thus far with its checkbook. And with Plaid customers asking for ways to more quickly onboard users per Perret, Plaid knew that it had customer demand for what the smaller company had built; buying Cognito means that Plaid can instantly layer on another service to its already growing customer base.</p>
<p>From that perspective, the deal is something akin to Microsoft acquiring an enterprise software company, knowing that it can sell its product via existing channels and customer relationships. By selling to Plaid, Cognito can likely scale its in-market footprint far more quickly than it could have by itself. Plaid, the company shared with TechCrunch via email, has around 5,500 customers today, a rich vein for Cognito to mine now under the larger company&#8217;s aegis.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Perret about where Plaid is heading from a product perspective. Our hunch, given the Cognito deal, was that it intends to build an ever-wider cadre of services that customers of its core product can add as they will to their existing contracts. As Cognito will be priced as an add-on, our thesis felt directionally correct.</p>
<p>The CEO noted that Plaid had launched a product called &#8220;Signal&#8221; <a href="https://plaid.com/blog/highlights-from-day-1-at-plaid-forum/">recently</a>, aimed at helping reduce fraud as an example of what the company has been working on in recent quarters. Plaid has also built a <a href="https://my.plaid.com/">consumer portal</a> where end-users can check their various connection points.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s illustrative. Plaid&#8217;s work to build more services atop its core product &#8212; which feels very similar to the product work that <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe has done</a> on top and adjacent to its payments nucleus &#8212; doesn&#8217;t appear to be merely a push to better support business customers. It has a consumer play in the mix as well. I would add at this juncture that the company remains, in our view, a firmly B2B company today.</p>
<p>Still, you can imagine what could be coming in the future. If consumers use Plaid as the de facto way to connect to the larger web of fintech and finservices products, and the company provides a central hub, or source of truth, it could build relationships with myriad individuals. That would give it sway on both ends of the fintech-user relationship, a powerful place to sit.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping that Plaid dreams big and uses its relationships on both sides of the app-user coin to do lots. Like, say, reinvent credit scoring. That would be a net-good for individuals everywhere.</p>
<p>Regardless, the Cognito deal is not the final acquisition that we anticipate from Plaid before its eventual public offering. More when we have it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By adding some electrodes and some electronics to your earbuds, <a href="https://www.wisear.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisear</a> can make your music experience a lot more hands-free than before. Bite down on your own teeth twice to pause a track, or three times to skip to the next tune &#8212; without making a noise, hand gesture or much visible movement at all, the technology enables you to interact with your music players or AR/VR headsets without needing to nudge any switches. The founders are envisioning that this is particularly helpful in scenarios where you have your hands full, or if it&#8217;s too loud for typical voice commands.</p>
<p>The company today revealed that it raised a total of €2 million (around $2.5 million), with a goal of licencing its technology to existing headset and headphone manufacturers. The round was led by Paris Business Angels and Kima Ventures, with the support of BPI France.</p>
<p>Wisear showed me its neural interface: By using the aforementioned electrodes to record the brain and facial activity, its patent-pending AI technology transforms these signals into controls that let the user take actions. The company is pretty skeptical of its competitors, and suggests that other &#8220;control by thought&#8221; startups are trying to pull the proverbial wool over our eyes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258236" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Anyone that tells you today that they&#8217;re doing thought control or mind control, or whatsoever, are basically twisting the truth for you,&#8221; explains Yacine Achiakh, co-founder at Wisear, &#8220;If they really have something, then honestly take all your money and give it to them, because it will revolutionize everything. It was quite frustrating for us: We realized people that were saying mind control either had a demo that would work in a very specific setup, when there is no noise around; people are not moving; it&#8217;s sunny outside; and it&#8217;s the right temperature.&#8221;</p>
<p>To overcome the &#8220;it works in the lab&#8221; syndrome, the company went back to the drawing board, and created a new set of tech with off-the-shelf components. The idea is to build a prototype of the technology that works well enough to show it off, and then licence the tech to headphone and AR/VR headset manufacturers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that the hardest part in trying to do anything brain based was actually generalizing it across users and making it work in any environment. We took a step back and we decided that the neural interface would first be based on muscle and eye activity. The main controls we have are based on jaw activity,&#8221; says Achiakh &#8220;We have sensors on the earpiece that can capture your jaw muscle movement, and transform it into controls. You don&#8217;t need to make any noise whatsoever. And our goal for 2022 is to have two controls: double and triple clench of the jaw. The goal is to scale this to 12 controls in the next three years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s founder showed off the company&#8217;s tech on a video call last week, and it was, in a word, impressive. The headphones were not confused by noises, movement or anything else the Achiakh did while speaking with me. When biting down on his own teeth &#8212; jaw clenching, you might call it &#8212; the audio player paused and resumed the demo music.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The tech isn&#8217;t quite ready for prime time yet, but the success rate is rather high.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are building the first technology that really works for everyone. At our booth at CES, we managed to have the demo work for around 80% of people who tried it &#8212; and we are working to improve that further,&#8221; says Achiakh. &#8220;We are building the only neural interface that can work today. Muscular activity is the real new interface that you can build in 2022.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.greenlabs.co.kr/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Greenlabs</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a South Korean agtech startup, announced this week it has closed a $140 million Series C led by <a href="http://www.brvcap.com/">BRV Capital Management</a>, with participation from <a href="http://www.skylakeincuvest.com/kor/index.php">Skylake Incuvest</a> and <a href="https://www.sksquare.com/eng/index.do">SK Square</a>.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup plans to use the Series C, which brings its total raised to $170 million to date, to expedite its global expansion, make acquisitions and increase its headcount, Charlie Sanghoon Shin, co-founder and CEO of Greenlabs, told TechCrunch. Greenlabs’ pre-money valuation was around $700 million, according to a source familiar with the situation. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Greenlabs, founded in 2017 by Scott Sungwoo Choi, Shin and Luke Donghyun Ahn, wants to digitize the entire value chain of agriculture space from crop production to distribution with a mission to address the global food supply problem in a sustainable way.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259908" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Greenlabs empowers farmers to have better control over their fresh produce and helps enterprises customers have reliable sourcing channels. The startup offers services including “Farm Morning,” an app that aggregates reliable data using AI, giving more than 500,000 farmers insight into crop lifecycle, and “Sinsun Market,” a B2B fresh produce marketplace for over 10,000 enterprise buyers, the company said. It also built smart farming software and hardware for farmers. Smart farming refers to managing farms using technologies like internet of things, robotics and artificial intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Seoul-based firm has expanded to China and Vietnam with its smart farm technologies since 2021. It also plans to </span>penetrate to other overseas countries this year by forming strategic partnerships with local agtech and foodtech players, which play similar strategies to Greenlabs, Shin said. Also, the startup is open for collaboration to speed up the process of resolving the global food supply problems, Shin added.</p>
<p>Its comparable peers include <a href="https://www.fbn.com/">Farmers Business Network</a>, Climate Corporation,<a href="https://www.indigoag.com/"> Indigo Ag</a> and <a href="https://www.ninjacart.in/">Ninjacart</a> in the global market, the company said.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Greenlabs currently has 320 employees, Shin noted. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Greenlabs has quickly realized the digital agriculture through Farm Morning and Sinsun Market services in Korea, and we are all well poised to become a unicorn within five years since the foundation. We hope to contribute to resolving the global food supply system issues with other like-minded players,” Shin said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moroccan B2B e-commerce and retail startup <a href="https://chari.co/">Chari</a> confirmed to TechCrunch that it has secured a bridge round at a $100 million valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bridge round welcomed new investors Khwarizmi Ventures, Air Angels and Afri Mobility, the venture capital arm of AKWA Group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They join existing investors (Y Combinator, Rocket Internet, Global Founders Capital, Plug n Play, Orange Ventures, Harvard University Management Company, Village Capital and P1 Ventures) who invested in Chari&#8217;s $5 million seed round last October <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/chari-a-moroccan-startup-digitizing-mom-and-pop-stores-raises-5m-at-70m-valuation/">at $70 million</a>. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259818" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many startups playing in the B2B e-commerce space across the continent, Chari digitizes the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fragmented FMCG sector in Morocco and Tunisia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chari operates as a mobile app, allowing small retailers in these two countries to order products from partnering FMCG multinationals and local manufacturers and get items in less than 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last October, the YC-backed company</span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2021/morocco-ecommerce-startup-chari-ma-acquires-mobile-credit-book-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired Moroccan ledger book Karny.ma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Khatabook-esque platform provides credit and bookkeeping services to about 50,000 merchants. It allows these merchants to handle the credit they give to their clients.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chari, a Moroccan startup digitizing mom and pop stores, raises $5M at $70M valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/chari-a-moroccan-startup-digitizing-mom-and-pop-stores-raises-5m-at-70m-valuation/embed/#?secret=n35vW2ZAws" data-secret="n35vW2ZAws" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://karny.ma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karny</a> acquisition and bridge round fits into Chari&#8217;s strategy to provide payment facilities. It puts the company in a sweet position to offer financial services, particularly buy now, pay later, to its retailers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chari will use the money of this bridge round to test the BNPL services with its existing customers. Upon successful results, Chari will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a local credit company to enable shop owners to lend money to their end-users and further grow their business,&#8221; said chief executive</span><a href="https://ma.linkedin.com/in/belkhayat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ismael Belkhayat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karny gives Chari valuable data on the loans provided by grocery stores to their customers and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows Chari to credit-assess the unbanked shop owners, determining the most applicable payment terms to give each</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in essence, Karny data allows Chari to find out about the items sold by the shop owners to their end clients and the amount lent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Through its internal closed-loop digital wallet, Chari will now offer payment terms and BNPL options to some of its shop owners based on their date of registration, order frequency, average basket order and amount of money lent to their end consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belkhayat, who founded the company with </span><a href="https://ma.linkedin.com/in/sophia-alj-40333960" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophia Alj</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> said Chari has selected a few shop owners to test run this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Based on the four criteria, merchants can</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have a negative balance on their digital wallets; the ceiling is between -$100 to -$500 and no more than 30 days without charge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once it gets operations right in Morocco, Chari plans to expand this BNPL service to Tunisia and other French-speaking countries in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BNPL services are starting to experience strong growth in Africa due to the rapid penetration of e-commerce and the effects of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several BNPL services cater to consumers, such as Nigeria&#8217;s Carbon Zero, South Africa&#8217;s Payflex (</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/zip-acquisition-of-payflex-means-africa-is-ripe-for-bnpl-disruption/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently acquired by Australian BNPL Zip</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and Kenya&#8217;s LipaLater (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/kenyan-bnpl-startup-lipa-later-eyes-more-african-markets-after-raising-12-million/">recently raised $12 million</a> in equity and debt). Others serve businesses like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/tradedepot-raises-110m-from-ifc-novastar-to-extend-bnpl-service-to-merchants-across-africa/">TradeDepot</a>, a Nigerian company similar to Chari, while some make infrastructural plays like Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/nigerias-thankucash-secures-5-3m-to-build-infrastructure-for-cashback-deals-and-bnpl-services/">ThankUCash</a>.</span></p>
<p>Usually, companies raise debt financing for their BNPL initiatives; most of the players, as mentioned above, have done so. But Chari opted not to. According to <span style="font-weight: 400;">Belkhayat,</span> the reason was that the debt venture funds Chari was in talks with wanted to charge the company as high as 15% in interest rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since this is just a pilot, I prefer to raise the money at a high valuation from funds that could help me with my strategy. I get a little diluted, but in exchange, I get a lot of help from experienced founders,&#8221; he said, explaining Chari&#8217;s high valuation at seed level and why it only raised equity. &#8220;Once the pilot succeeds, I will need much more funding for my working capital requirement and will raise debt instead of diluting equity.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mention-me.com/">Mention Me</a>, a platform to generate customer referrals, has raised a $25m Series B round, led by London’s Octopus Ventures. Eight Roads Ventures, the lead investor from the prior round, a $7 million Series A in a 2018, also participated.<br />
 <br />
The London-based startup helps businesses turn referrals into a channel for acquiring customers, while also gathering data for other marketing activities.<br />
 <br />
Mention Me now plans to expand into the US, and develop its product offering.</p>
<p>Customers include Puma, Pret a Manger, InsurTech Bought By Many, Bloom &amp; Wild and ASOS.</p>
<p>Its competitors include Friendbuy (raised $1.8M), Talkable (raised $4.2M), Extole (raised $28.7M) and Yotpo (raised $436M).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259753" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Andy Cockburn, CEO and Co-Founder of Mention Me said: “With third-party data disappearing, paid social delivering diminishing returns and consumers increasingly overwhelmed by endless brand advertising, our technology puts advocacy at the heart of marketing to reconnect marketers and consumers. The most successful brands are realizing how this can drive growth, increasing customer acquisition and returns across the marketing activity spectrum.”</p>
<p>Octopus Ventures Principal Uthish Ranjan, who will join Mention Me’s board, commented: “Mention Me’s pioneering approach to customer advocacy and impressive growth trajectory is creating a new strategic channel of marketing technology.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://terraquantum.swiss/">Terra Quantum</a>, a Zurich, Switzerland-based startup that aims to build a Quantum-as-a-Service platform (including, eventually, its own proprietary quantum hardware), today announced that it has raised a $60 million Series A round led by <a href="https://www.lakestar.com/">Lakestar</a>, which also backed the company&#8217;s 2019 seed round. The additional investors in this round prefer to remain anonymous. According to Terra, they include two of the largest and globally renowned German family offices and one of the most influential cryptocurrency investors globally.</p>
<p>The idea behind Terra Quantum is to build a new end-to-end quantum platform. With its own quantum chips still a couple of years out, this currently means the company focuses on offering a library of quantum algorithms to its customers and quantum security tools, including a quantum key distribution service.</p>
<p>As for its own hardware, the company tells me that it is &#8220;very interested in superconducting qubits.&#8221; It currently offers its users access to simulated virtual qubits and is able to support workloads on any of the currently available hardware platforms, no matter the topology or architecture.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Series A funding round enables us to drive forward our leading position in the field of quantum computing as we have evolved from a DeepTech start-up into a global quantum business,&#8221; said Markus Pflitsch, founder and CEO of Terra Quantum. &#8220;I am extremely proud of our recent milestones having launched the first hybrid quantum cloud data center (QMware) and a super-secure global quantum protocol based on quantum key distribution (QKD), and grateful for the support of all of our partners who have and will support us on our path.&#8221;</p>
<p>Terra Quantum currently counts a number of DAX40 companies in the automotive and biotech industry among its clients.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to expand its R&amp;D capabilities (something it&#8217;ll need if it wants to build its own quantum hardware) and extend its Quantum-as-a-Service offering (for which it&#8217;ll need that hardware).</p>
<p>“We strongly believe in partnering with exceptional technology founders. We have trusted the incredible potential of Terra Quantum&#8217;s quantum technology from day one,&#8221; said Lakestar partner and CTO Stephen Nundy. &#8220;Terra Quantum has consistently proven its leading role in driving the second quantum revolution. Its pioneering quantum applications have tremendous potential, for example to solve the imminent quantum cryptography challenges. We are incredibly excited to further support Terra Quantum in its continued growth on a global scale.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in March Vienna-based <a href="http://PlanRadar.com">PlanRadar</a> snapped up a €30 million Series A to digitize construction and real estate. The Austrian startup &#8211; a platform for documentation and communication in construction and real estate projects &#8211; is continuing its funding roll with a $70 million fundraising round co-led by Insight Partners and Quadrille Capital.</p>
<p>The round also drew participation from existing investors including Headline, Berliner Volksbank Ventures, aws Gründerfonds, and Cavalry Ventures, plus new investors Proptech1, Russmedia and GR Capital. </p>
<p>To add context to that, this is a significant raise for an Austrian company and PlanRadar claims it’s the third-largest Series B in Austrian history to date. I&#8217;ve detailed previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/vienna/">detailed</a> how Austria is one of the newer, emerging tech hubs in Europe in one of my European city surveys.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258086" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>PlanRadar now plans new offices in the US, Australia, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The company will also boost R&amp;D investment and hopes to double its global headcount over the coming 12 months.</p>
<p>Since launching in Vienna, Austria, in 2013, PlanRadar says it has grown revenues by over 250% and more than doubled its customer base to 14,500 customers in over 60 countries. It has launched 10 new markets across Europe and Russia since 2020, with offices in Vienna, London, Amsterdam, Moscow, Paris, Madrid, Milan, Zagreb, Warsaw, and Bucharest.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Imam, PlanRadar Co-Founder and Co-CEO said: “We’re on a mission to make construction and building operations easier to manage, and we’ve proven there’s a huge global appetite for our technology.”</p>
<p>Thomas Krane, Principal at Insight Partners said: “The PropTech sector is poised for enormous growth, and PlanRadar is bringing the global construction and real estate industry into the digital future.” </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Competitors to PlanRadar include Bluebeam Revu, Autodesk Construction Cloud, Procore, and IBM&#8217;s TRIRIGA.</p>
