										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Seed rounds are up!” “Seed rounds are higher valued than ever!” “There were 10% less VCs investing in seed rounds last year!” !!!!!!!!1</p>
<p>We’ve all seen these stories, and we’re fine connoisseurs of them here at TechCrunch, for sure. Trend data about VC investing are always enticing to startup founders and investors, since they affect so much of the strategy and planning of building a company. If seed rounds are becoming more elusive, maybe skip on that last hire, extend the runway, and try to gain some revenues. If Series A is the new bottleneck, well, invest more in product and growth so you don’t slam into the capital wall. If money is raining down from the sky, double the team, double growth marketing spend, and go blitzscale.</p>
<p>It’s key market intelligence, and important. Which is why it is so frustrating that the aggregate data on VC rounds is so, goddamn bad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s a friendly reminder: there are no comprehensive datasets on VC rounds, at least in the United States) And the data quality has only gotten worse over time, particularly at the seed stage.</p>
<p>It’s a theme I have been harping on for years now. SEC Form D filings, which form the backbone of most trend data of VC investment rounds, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/the-disappearing-form-d/">have been disappearing for years now</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="q0v1lPIFdJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/the-disappearing-form-d/">The disappearing Form D</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The disappearing Form D&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/the-disappearing-form-d/embed/#?secret=q0v1lPIFdJ" data-secret="q0v1lPIFdJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As I described in my analysis from way back in 2018, the biggest reason is also one that isn’t very visible: a transformation in the culture among lawyers from a culture of “always file” to a culture of avoiding filings if at all possible.</p>
<p>That cultural change has been driven by founders and investors who want to keep their startups stealthy and their competitors in the dark about where their finances are. Plus, founders can avoid the spectacle of salespeople beating down their door when they find out the startup has cash in the coffers.</p>
<p>When I talked to lawyers about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/how-to-delay-your-form-ds/">how to delay filing a Form D</a>, all gave the standard perfunctory response about the necessity of filing — until we went off-the-record. Then, lawyers opened up about how much they skirt around SEC securities regulations. As one lawyer essentially put it, there’s what the law says is required, and then what the SEC ever bothers to enforce. No one in Silicon Valley has ever been charged with a crime related to skipping out on a Form D filing, or even paid a fine that anyone seems to have any memory of.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="szraIzS3UP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/how-to-delay-your-form-ds/">How to delay your Form Ds (or not file them at all)</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How to delay your Form Ds (or not file them at all)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/how-to-delay-your-form-ds/embed/#?secret=szraIzS3UP" data-secret="szraIzS3UP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One lawyer at the time described to me a prototypical conversation he has with founders. He doesn’t tell them not to file their Form Ds. Instead, he says that almost none of their peer founders will file securities paperwork, and thus, if they <i>do</i> follow the law, they would be at a competitive disadvantage. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of founders follow the directed course.</p>
<p>While it might seem like the law is the law, what’s far more important than what is written in the law or SEC regulations is how the law is interpreted, which is really about the sociology of attorneys. Years ago, I was talking to a securities attorney about company valuations. He was describing to me how East Coast-based securities lawyers at the time would blanche at some of the valuation tricks that West Coast / Silicon Valley lawyers would use with startups. You can follow the law closely, and you can follow the law loosely — and neither group is altogether breaking the law.</p>
<p>A change in legal culture driven by founders is one aspect of the dilemma facing VC investment trend surveyors. Another, particularly at the seed stage, is the complexity of rounds today.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/are-safes-obscuring-todays-seed-volume/">As my colleague Alex Wilhelm wrote this morning in The Exchange newsletter</a>, alternative investment models are having a large effect on aggregate VC data. Rolling rounds, convertible notes, SaaS securitization products, crowdfunding, and other mechanisms have massively transformed the seed-stage investing world from the ol’ write-a-check-and-buy-equity approach. While some of these forms of investment trigger filings requirements, many of these models are so new that lawyers have been willing to skip filings given the paucity of case law associated with the regulations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="W8ugW1WpnJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/are-safes-obscuring-todays-seed-volume/">Are SAFEs obscuring today&#8217;s seed volume?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Are SAFEs obscuring today&#8217;s seed volume?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/are-safes-obscuring-todays-seed-volume/embed/#?secret=W8ugW1WpnJ" data-secret="W8ugW1WpnJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Finally, you can generally avoid a Form D by filing in the relevant state jurisdictions of the company and its investors. As much as securities law may seem federal (we talk about the SEC a heck of a lot more than the California Department of Financial Protection &amp; Innovation), the reality is that much of securities law is still practiced at the state level. What that means is that startups can use state filings in lieu of federal filings, and those are essentially invisible since literally no one besides me and a few other journalists in the world read state securities filings.</p>
<p>Take for instance a cool company I covered a little while back called Hebbia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/hebbia-wants-to-make-ctrl-f-or-command-f-actually-useful-through-better-ai/">which is reinventing search on the desktop</a>. They raised a $1.1 million pre-seed round led by Floodgate with a lot of other great investors. Now, go to the SEC search page and look for the Form D. Nothing. But if you go to the California DFPI, you will find three filings submitted on September 21, 2020 for a $1.2 million total round. There’s your filing.</p>
<p>Even late-stage companies can mostly go without any Form D filings. Take DoorDash, for instance, which just had a monster IPO last year. If you search through the SEC database for “DoorDash Inc,” you will find nary a Form D filing for any of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doordash/company_financials">the company’s 11 venture rounds that Crunchbase identifies</a>. The first filings with the SEC are for its originally confidential Draft Registration Statement to go IPO in early 2020. Now, if you head over to California’s database again, you will find filings going back to 2016, which I presume is the five-year limit for the site’s search function.</p>
<p>Using state filings is not wrong, illegal, or unethical — it’s just the standard way to do business today. But few industry datasets go beyond federal Form D filings to take into account every state’s database for securities filings. There are 50 states, and many of them (looking at you Florida) are all but impenetrable to researchers and investigators.</p>
<p>So if the legal culture around filings has changed, more rounds are using alternative investment models, and startups aren’t filing federally, what are analysts supposed to do?</p>
<p>Well, they try to compensate for this sparsity by augmenting the dataset they have with publicly reported information from sites like TechCrunch, Twitter conversations, self-reported data from startups, surveys of lawyers and accountants and more to attempt to statistically estimate how many rounds were actually conducted given the limited information they have on hand. For example, if lawyers report a 15% uptick in rounds, we can guesstimate roughly how many rounds took place in a given year.</p>
<p>At least, that’s the idea. Unfortunately, there really is no way to measure the inaccuracy of this approach, since there is no administrative dataset to compare our estimations to.</p>
<p>What percentage of rounds go undisclosed? It’s impossible to count something we can’t count, but my guess covering the industry is something on the order of 50-60% of seed rounds, a third of Series A/B rounds, and a declining percentage the later a company goes (at a certain point, Form Ds solve <i>a lot</i> of problems for companies when it comes to securities paperwork and mitigating legal risk).</p>
<p>Even the government doesn’t have data better than us. Take a story from last week in the Wall Street Journal about how <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-swat-team-is-reviewing-past-startup-deals-tied-to-chinese-investors-11612094401">the Department of Justice is investigating startups that took money from Chinese investors</a>. The DoJ isn’t taking advantage of some secret database to identify all the investors that are hidden from the general public. They don’t know themselves! From the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Startup investments are exempt from many of the disclosures required from public companies. Last year, Cfius launched a new confidential tip line to help surface deals. In some cases, companies have alerted Cfius to a rival’s connections with foreign investors, said startup executives and lawyers.</p></blockquote>

<p>(That last bit is just so juicy – a good reminder that we have a Secure Drop if you want to similarly slam a rival).</p>
<p>Ultimately, VC investment trend data is interesting and key market intelligence, and it might be — at a very high level — directionally right. There are just huge constraints on the ability of market researchers and data companies to comprehensively analyze the market in an accurate way. Everyone tries their best, but the reality is that if startups don’t have to disclose their investor data, there’s literally no other source for the information.</p>

<p>We need a serious conversation on the equitable and ethical use of tech, what can be done to combat the spread of misinformation and more. As we work to solve these problems, however, I hope this dialogue doesn’t overshadow one silver lining of the past year: The rise of the developer activists who are using tech for good.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>The responsibility lies with all of us to empower this community to unleash their entrepreneurial growth mindset and ensure more people have the opportunity to create a sustainable future for all. I’m calling on my colleagues, our industry, our governments and more to join me in supporting a new wave of developer-led activism and renew efforts to collectively close the skills gap that exists today.</p>
<p>From the COVID-19 pandemic, to climate change, to racial injustice, developers are playing a crucial role in creating new technologies to help people navigate today’s volatile world. Many of these developers are working on social problems on their own time, using open-source software that they can share globally. This work is helping to save lives and going forward, will help millions more.</p>
<p>The international research community acted early to share data and genetic sequences with one another in <a href="https://nextstrain.org/">open-source projects</a> that helped advance our early understanding of coronavirus and how to mobilize efforts to stop it. The ability for researchers to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55388846">track genetic codes</a> around the world in near real-time is crucial to our response.</p>
<p>St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital was able to <a href="https://thenewstack.io/why-covid-19-is-ushering-in-innovation-with-citizen-developers/">digitize its contract signature process</a> in just 10 days during this critical time. A team of four developers hailing from Taiwan, Brazil, Mongolia and India <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/agrolly/">helped farmers</a> navigate climate change by using weather data to make more informed crop management decisions.</p>
<p>From the civil rights and anti-war movements of the 1950s and 1960s through the recent rallies supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, people have used passion and protests to shape the conversations that lead to a better future. Now, this rich history of people-powered action has an important new set of tools: The data, software and tech know-how that’s needed to mount a coordinated global and local response to our greatest challenges.</p>
<p>Today’s software developers are akin to civil engineers in the 1940s and 1950s who designed bridges and roads, creating an infrastructure that paved the path for enormous widespread progress.</p>
<p>The open-source code community already collaborates and shares, producing innovations that belong to everyone, focusing on progress over perfection. If a hurricane is about to create havoc in your community, don’t just fill sandbags, hit your keyboard and use open-source technologies to not only help your community, but to scale solutions to help others. <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/droneaid-is-now-open-source/">DroneAID</a>, for example, is an open-source tool that uses visual recognition to detect and count SOS icons on the ground from drones flying overhead, and then automatically plots emergency needs on a map for first responders.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">recent GitHub study </a>shows that open-source project creation is up 25% since April of last year. Developers are signing on to contribute to open-source communities and virtual hackathons during their downtime, using their skills to create a more sustainable world.</p>
<p>In 2018, I helped found <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/">Call for Code</a> with IBM, David Clark Cause and United Nations Human Rights to empower the global developer community, and a big part of our mission was to create the infrastructure needed to shepherd big ideas into real-world deployments. For our part, IBM provides the 24-million-person developer community access to the same technology being used by our enterprise clients, including our open hybrid cloud platform, AI, blockchain and quantum computing.</p>
<p>One winner, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-kq18qV3AE">Prometeo</a>, with a team including a firefighter, nurse and developers, created a system that uses artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things to safeguard firefighters as they battle blazes and has been tested in multiple regions in Spain. We’ve seen developers help teachers share virtual information for homeschooling; measure the carbon footprint impact of consumer purchases; update small businesses with COVID-19 policies; help farmers navigate climate change; and improve the way businesses manage lines amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>This past year, <a href="https://devpost.com/">Devpost</a> partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO) and <a href="https://covid-global-hackathon.devpost.com/">challenged developers to create COVID-19 mitigation solutions</a> in categories including health, vulnerable populations and education. The Ford Foundation and Mozilla led <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/introducing-our-10-newest-mozilla-fellows/">a fellowship program</a> to connect technologists, activists, journalists and scientists, and strengthen organizations working at the convergence of technology and social justice. <a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/">The U.S. Digital Response (USDR)</a> connected pro-bono technologists to work with government and organizations responding to crisis.</p>
<p>The most complex global and societal issues can be broken down into smaller solvable tech challenges. But to solve our most complex problems, we need the brains of every country, every class, every gender. The skills-gap crisis is a global phenomenon, making it critical that we equip the next generation of problem solvers with the training and resources they need to turn great ideas into impactful solutions.</p>
<p>This year, we can expect to see a newly energized community of developers working across the boundaries of companies, states and countries to take on some of the world’s biggest problems.</p>
<p>But they can’t do it alone. These developer activists need our support, encouragement and help pinpointing the most crucial problems to address, and they need the tools to bring solutions to every corner of the world.</p>
<p>The true power of technology lies with those who want to change the world for good. To ensure anyone who wants to create change has the tools, resources and skillsets to do so, we must renew our focus on closing the skills gap and addressing deep inequalities in our society.</p>
<p>Our future depends on getting this right.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">I have a confession to make: my company fell short of its DEI goal in 2020.</p>
<p>Heading into the year, our goal was to build a workforce that’s 44% women and 14% Underrepresented People (URP). We made some strides, but currently those figures are 43% and 13%, respectively.</p>
<p>Here’s why these goals are important to me: I immigrated to America at 17 with my mother and brother from Nicaragua. I was promised a land where anything is possible with some know-how and hard work. Yet, growing up, I can’t recall ever seeing a business leader, an elected official, or even a school principal who looked like me. There was never a Black Marc Benioff or a Latino Steve Jobs in the press to make that kind of accomplishment feel possible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Things have changed at the very highest levels, beginning with the election of President Obama in 2008, which can’t be understated for its impact on people of color. Now, as a new administration takes power, President Biden is doing something well overdue in building a cabinet that “represents the diversity of our nation.”</p>
<p>His team is highlighted by influential voices from the Black and Latinx communities, including Ambassador to the United Nations nominee Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Department of Homeland Security Secretary nominee Alejandro Mayorkas.</p>
<p>I thought back to how a 17-year-old me would have felt seeing a former refugee steering the future of our country and how differently my worldview might have developed. I became more motivated to double down on our commitment. After all, if the public sector is able to make this commitment, then surely it should be possible for businesses to do the same.</p>
<p>Every business should have a DEI game plan in 2021. Here’s ours:</p>
<h2>Skip the board and tap employees for ideas</h2>
<p>While the board room is becoming a <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2019/06/18/u-s-board-diversity-trends-in-2019/">more diverse place</a>, ultimately, this isn’t where progress is made. Rather, progress is made when employees feel empowered to combine their skills with their passions.</p>
<p>This is exactly what happened in our company this year.</p>
<p>Watching the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/18/us/coronavirus-Black-owned-small-business.html">outsized impact</a> that the coronavirus pandemic has had on Black-owned businesses, several employees came to us with an idea: they wanted to find a way to use our products to help Black-owned businesses outlast the shutdowns. They started by working with William Murrell, owner of <a href="https://Blackboston.com/">BlackBoston.com</a> to understand his needs–and how we could help him connect with website visitors. By working with William’s network, we became more aware of the barriers that deter Black-owned businesses from adopting technology and created a repeatable process to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>These decisions, and the resulting initiative weren’t made in a boardroom–where so much time is spent determining the path to profitability–but rather among employees that wanted to improve their community and saw a way how.</p>
<p>To make these efforts more commonplace, we’ve hired a diversity-focused recruiter to make sure our teams better reflect our communities. We&#8217;ve also created processes like Balanced Hiring, to help underrepresented groups get to the interview stage and reduce bias in the hiring decision. On the other side of the coin, we also aim to learn from our leavers–so we understand areas for improvement and can help them thrive beyond our company.</p>
<h2>Don’t let remote work hinder expression and belonging</h2>
<p>Right now, people are not working normal hours; they are juggling childcare, remote work and more; for leaders, understanding and relating to that trauma is an essential. To date, we announced that we moved our fiscal year-end to January. This way, our sales and go-to-market teams could spend the holidays recharging with family, rather than scrambling to hit year-end goals.</p>
<p>Moreover, we are empowering and expanding the role of our employee-led Employee Resource Groups (ERG) to create safe spaces for expression among peers. Belonging is essential in any business, and as founders who have often found themselves a token in a boardroom, we know the value in having an outlet for employees to express themselves and encourage the sharing of learnings from individual successes, and mishaps.</p>
<p>These steps alone will not directly improve diversity, but they will go a long way toward building trust.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t stop at race or gender: embrace diverse perspectives</h2>
<p>The final consideration we are making is acknowledging that diversity is not solely inclusive of outward appearance. Rather, diversity of thought and background are critical factors to how teams collaborate to reach a unified goal.</p>
<p>After all, building a <a href="https://qz.com/work/1915278/five-percent-of-coinbase-staff-rejected-its-apolitical-future/">culture</a> where differences aren’t acknowledged only seeks to push minorities further to the outskirts of organizational structure. Part of our focus on DEI will encourage diversity of thought as much as it does ethnic diversity–and hold ourselves accountable to employees that will speak up when it matters.</p>
<p>2020 was a year of trauma, and one where every person was alike in sharing the same fears and anxieties. Thankfully, we have a light at the end of the tunnel with two promising vaccines, and an incoming administration that knows the value in encouraging equal representation across gender and ethnic borders.</p>
<p>Regardless of these positive developments, our focus toward empowering diverse communities must remain steadfast. After all, the systemic issue of low representation of URPs in tech will not be ended because of these efforts alone, but through sustained attention toward addressing the issue and learning each day. We might have missed our mark in 2020, but now we will take the President’s lead and build equity within our offices in 2021, wherever they might be.</p>
<p>I encourage all business owners to make this same commitment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SAFEs have effectively pushed a lot of public signal regarding seed deals, and even smaller rounds, underground.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just over a year ago in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/three-takeaways-from-the-2019-venture-capital-market/">coverage of the 2019 venture capital market</a>,  we noted that &#8220;United States-demarcated angel and seed deals dipped in 2019.&#8221; Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/vc-activity-goes-upside-down-as-seed-deals-fall-and-mega-rounds-rise/">reporting concerning the Q1 2020 venture capital market</a> had a similar tone, noting that &#8220;domestic seed rounds, in slow decline since peaks in 2017, have sharply fallen since Q3 2019.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same theme <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/second-quarter-vc-investing-totals-appear-lackluster/">continued in the second quarter</a>. Widening our lens to global seed data, own we wrote that &#8220;global seed and angel deals [&#8230;] were down from 4,256 rounds in Q2 2019 worth $3.7 billion to 1,791 rounds worth just $2.3 billion in Q2 2020.&#8221;</p>

<hr />
<p>Of course, the second quarter of 2020 was the middle of the storm when it came to the temporary decline in venture capital confidence. So, what about Q3? One source noted, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/late-stage-deals-made-q3-2020-a-standout-vc-quarter-for-us-based-startups/">we wrote at the time</a>, that the &#8220;percentage of U.S. VC deals that were for rounds of $5 million or less was the lowest since at least 2010.&#8221; Another data source showed a slight rebound in domestic seed rounds, but it was a rare positive data point.</p>
<p>Then came Q4 2020 data and a full-year look at the market. We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/in-2020-vcs-invested-428m-into-us-based-startups-every-day">wrote that in</a> &#8220;the U.S., seed deal count was high in 2020, around 5,227,&#8221; per that day&#8217;s data source.</p>
<p>Weird, right?</p>

I&#8217;m not citing individual sources in the above (you can find them at the links) to avoid appearing to be cross with any particular entity; that&#8217;s not my goal.</p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;m curious how we can have so many different seed data signals in the same year. This is a question I&#8217;ve had for some time, as whenever I&#8217;d report that seed deal volume in any particular part of the world was looking light &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/how-vcs-invested-in-asia-and-europe-in-2020/">Europe, for example</a> &#8212; investors would tell me, in polite tones or with sheer incredulity, that the seed data in question did not match their lived realities.</p>
<p>Investors were seeing a hot seed market, while data often showed a flat-to-down seed market. So, what&#8217;s going on?</p>
<h2>SAFEs could be to blame</h2>
<p>Thanks to angel investor and Twitter bon vivant <a href="https://twitter.com/Trace_Cohen">Trace Cohen</a>, I think we have a good idea of what&#8217;s to blame for discrepant data and reality when it comes to seed and earlier dealmaking. Per Cohen, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1358536771869569030">could SAFEs be to blame</a>?</p>
<p>SAFEs, or <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/"><em>Simple Agreements for Future Equity</em></a>, are a method of raising capital that is quick and cheap. Y Combinator invented them back in 2013, and they&#8217;ve become rather popular amongst seed deals over time.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During a small gathering of journalists in China, Ren Zhengfei made his first public remarks since Joe Biden was inaugurated at the 46th President of the United States. The Huawei CEO struck a hopeful tone for those gathered around the table, in comments reported <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-welcome-phone-call-from-us-president-biden.html">by CNBC among others</a>.</p>
<p>“I would welcome such phone calls and the message is around joint development and shared success,” the executive said, noting a readiness to speak with the new administration in translated remarks. “The U.S. wants to have economic growth and China wants to have economic growth as well.”</p>
<p>Huawei’s future in the U.S. has been a major question mark hanging over the new administration. Under Trump, a number of high profile Chinese companies were added to the Commerce Department’s so-called “entity list” to various effects. Huawei has been among the hardest hit by the moves.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In addition to blocking sales in the world’s third-largest smartphone market, the company has been unable to work with key U.S. companies, including Google. That, in turn, has blocked access to key technologies, including the Android ecosystem and left Huawei scrambling. The company’s support among consumers has increased within China, but the move has been a big blow to the smartphone maker’s bottom line.</p>
<p>The incoming Biden administration has mostly been quiet on the matter. Though, facing mounting criticism from Republican lawmaker, Commerce Secretary nominee Gina Raimondo has since added that, “I currently have no reason to believe that entities on those lists should not be there. If confirmed, I look forward to a briefing on these entities and others of concern.”</p>
<p>While there haven’t been many positive signs for Huawei thus far, the company’s Chief understandably would prefer to make nice with the new administration.</p>
<p>“If Huawei’s production capacity can be expanded, that would mean more opportunities for U.S. companies to supply too,” Ren said in the translated comments. “I believe that’s going to be mutually beneficially. I believe that (the) new administration would bear in mind such business interests as they are about to decide their new policy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://eniac.vc/">Eniac Ventures</a>, a seed firm with a focus on New York startups, is announcing its fifth fund totaling $125 million.</p>
<p>Eniac&#8217;s four general partners — Hadley Harris, Nihal Mehta, Vic Singh and Tim Young — have been making seed investments together for more than a decade, and they&#8217;ve known each other for even longer, having first met at the University of Pennsylvania. Singh described the firm as &#8220;one of the OGs&#8221; in seed investing, while Mehta said, &#8220;Consistency has been our superpower.&#8221;</p>
<p>The size of Eniac&#8217;s funds has grown dramatically over the past decade, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/01/eniac-ventures-launches-1-6-million-seed-fund-to-invest-in-mobile-startups/">its $1.6 million first fund</a> in 2010 to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/eniac-ventures-closes-100-million-fund/">its $100 million fourth fund</a> in 2017. However, Mehta said the team approached the latest fund with $125 million as both a goal and a &#8220;hard cap.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The larger funds allow Eniac to make more investments, and to lead rounds as the definition of a seed deal has expanded. (<a href="https://eniacvc.medium.com/a792b07b2da9">The firm says</a> it can invest anywhere from $350,000 to $3 million in a single round.) At the same time, GP Hadley Harris emphasized that Eniac will remain focused on seed deals rather than Series As, and that it wants to remain &#8220;really collaborative, so that we never need to take more than half the round.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eniac&#8217;s general partners usually only two or three investments each per year, which Harris said is &#8220;quite a bit less than average seed fund.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AF3UFuxcO1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/eniac-ventures-closes-100-million-fund/">Eniac Ventures closes $100 million fund</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;We always want to be the investor of record in the companies that we invest in, leading or co-leading these rounds,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;And we want to have the bandwidth to be partners with them in the early stages of their journey. We think the only way to do that is concentration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eniac&#8217;s <a href="https://eniac.vc/companies/">portfolio</a> now includes more than 120 companies, with 50-plus exits. Recent successes include mobile messaging company Attentive (which <a href="https://www.attentivemobile.com/2020/09/23/attentive-raises-230-million-series-d-investment-led-by-coatue/">raised a $230 million Series D last fall</a>), podcasting startup Anchor (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">acquired by Spotify</a>) and online retailer Boxed (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/boxed-asia-expansion/">recently partnered</a> with one of Asia&#8217;s largest brick-and-mortar companies, Aeon).</p>
<p>While Eniac initially billed itself as a mobile-focused firm, it now invests across software-as-a-service, developer platforms, consumer and deeptech. Harris said they&#8217;re not pointing to any specific industries or trends that they&#8217;re focused on because, &#8220;We want to be balanced between thesis-driven and opportunistic &#8230; The theses that we tend to focus on tend to be on a per-partner basis and change pretty quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firm is headquartered in New York, with an office in San Francisco. Hadley said New York-based startups remain a priority, while at the same time, &#8220;We also believe that great founders can be anywhere and we&#8217;re more and more interested in distributed teams.&#8221;</p>

<p>Singh added that despite the hype around other emerging startup hubs, &#8220;A lot of the founders we partner with in New York are staying in New York. They have not left.&#8221;</p>
<p>They might hire team members elsewhere, he said, but there&#8217;s a high bar for remote employees. And if a startup wants to be fully distributed, &#8220;You have to be fully remote and distributed first. You can’t go distributed later; you have to very intentionally build the organization in that way from the start.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the team&#8217;s longevity, I noted that it also has a potential downside from a diversity perspective, especially since all four of the founding GPs are men. However, the firm has recently promoted two other team members — Vice President of Finance and Operations Anna Nitschke and Investor Kristin McDonald — who Singh noted &#8220;votes on deals with us&#8221; and &#8220;feels as if she has an equal say in how the firm is run.&#8221; And the firm plans to hire <a href="https://eniacvc.medium.com/a792b07b2da9">six new team members</a> this year.</p>
<p>If you want to hear more from the firm&#8217;s partners, I&#8217;ll be <a href="https://superpeer.com/eniac/event/eniac-extras-5-big-news-from-eniac">interviewing them on Superpeer</a> (another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/superpeer-funding/">recent Eniac investment</a>) tomorrow, February 10, at 2:30pm Eastern.</p>

<p>Founded by Carolyn Mooney and Ryan O’Neil, nextmv simplifies the process of optimizing and testing logistics-focused decision models. Consider a company like GrubHub, where the duo worked previously. GrubHub has to weigh a wide variety of priorities each time an order comes through on the platform, from speed of delivery to mileage on the drivers&#8217; cars to overall efficiency.</p>
<p>It takes an immense amount of resources, and personnel talent, to optimize the algorithm running those platforms based on the company&#8217;s key performance indicators, or KPIs. And if those KPIs change, or tweaks to the algorithm need to be made, it takes even more resources to test those modifications.</p>
<p>And you would need a simulated environment to test the changes, something that nextmv has provided since its launch.</p>
<p>On the heels of this latest round, nextmv is working to simplify its product. The company has launched nextmv Cloud to allow developers, not just operations researchers, to use its software. nextmv Cloud has quick start models in the routing and delivery space to allow developers to automate decision-making, with plans to launch into new verticals in the coming months.</p>
<p>Before nextmv, it could take an entire team of operations researchers to optimize decision-making models and simulate test environments. When nextmv launched, a team still needed to have at least one operations researcher to use the product. Now, developers can hop on the platform and get started.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are hundreds of thousands of operations researchers, like my cofounder, out there that are trying to solve these problems in a research capacity or in very specialized groups within companies,&#8221; said Mooney. &#8220;But there are millions of developers out there. Why can&#8217;t this be a superpower that every developer has in their pocket. It&#8217;s the same way that Twilio made it so that every every engineer could be a messaging engineer.&#8221;</p>

<p>A good chunk of the funding is going toward building out that Cloud platform to productize and distribute the nextmv technology and increase accessibility, but the company is also using funding to ramp up a content arm to help users explore the software.</p>
<p>Eventually, nextmv wants to build out a community arm of the platform, letting developers show each other how they&#8217;re automating decisions, not unlike Figma Community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shopify announced this morning it&#8217;s partnered with Facebook to expand its payment option, <a href="https://shop.app/what-shop-does">Shop Pay</a>, to all Shopify merchants selling across both Facebook and Instagram. This is the first time Shop Pay will be made available outside of Shopify&#8217;s own platform, and represents a significant expansion for the e-commerce platform&#8217;s payments technology.</p>
<p>The company tells TechCrunch Shop Pay will first become available to all Shopify merchants using checkout on Instagram in the U.S., and will then be rolled out to Facebook in the weeks that follow.</p>
<p>Prior to this launch, Facebook&#8217;s platform has been one of Shopify&#8217;s most popular sales and marketing channels for merchants, Shopify says. At the beginning of the pandemic last year (March through April 2020), marketing on Facebook and Instagram via Shopify&#8217;s channel integration saw 36% growth in monthly active users, and that trend continues to rise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, Shop Pay&#8217;s payment option is used by a number of top direct-to-consumer and newer brands, including Allbirds, Kith, Beyond Yoga, Kylie Cosmetics, Jonathan Adler, Loeffler Randall, Blueland and others. <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/shop-pay-checkout">Over 40 million buyers</a> now regularly use Shop Pay at these merchants and others on Shopify&#8217;s platform to complete their purchases.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110742" style="width: 411px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110742" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2110742" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg?w=401" alt="" width="401" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg 872w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg?resize=88,150 88w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg?resize=177,300 177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg?resize=768,1302 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg?resize=401,680 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110742" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shopify</p></div></p>
<p>Through the course of 2020, Shop Pay helped buyers complete 137 million orders. And by the end of the year, Shop Pay had facilitated nearly $20 billion in cumulative GMV since its launch in 2017. Through its <a href="https://shop.app/carbon-offsetting">carbon offsetting feature</a>, this also represented 75,000 tons of carbon emissions.</p>
<p>In addition to the carbon offsets, Shopify claims Shop Pay on its own platform is 70% faster with a conversion rate that&#8217;s 1.72x higher than a typical checkout. It also includes order tracking and management, which, to date, have tracked over 430 million orders across over 450 million miles.</p>
<p>Once available on Instagram, consumers will be able to find tagged products from Shopify merchants in the app, then add them to their in-app cart. At checkout, they can then select Shop Pay as their preferred payment option from among credit card, debit card, and PayPal. The consumer will receive a confirmation code to their phone, then enter the code to complete the order without leaving Instagram. A similar experience will be available on Facebook.</p>
<p>These orders can also be tracked via Shopify&#8217;s Shop app, the same as those processed on Shopify itself.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110743" style="width: 402px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110743" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2110743" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg?w=392" alt="" width="392" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg 858w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg?resize=173,300 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg?resize=768,1334 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg?resize=392,680 392w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110743" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shopify</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;People are embracing social platforms not only for connection, but for commerce,&#8221; said Carl Rivera, General Manager of Shop, in a statement. &#8220;Making Shop Pay available outside of Shopify for the first time means even more shoppers can use the fastest and best checkout on the Internet. And there’s more to come; we’ll continue to work with Facebook to bring a number of Shopify services and products to these platforms to make social selling so much better.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not the first third-party payment option integrated into Facebook&#8217;s shopping platforms, as PayPal is also accepted. But it is a notable addition, given how heavily Facebook has pushed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/">own &#8220;shops&#8221; platform</a>, which encourages merchants to sell and transact within its own apps &#8212; an even more critical source of revenue now that Apple&#8217;s privacy changes will<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/01/22/apple-privacy-change-may-cost-facebook-google-25-billion-over-next-12-months/?sh=2c874eaa5695"> impact Facebook&#8217;s ads business</a> to the tune of billions of dollars. But likely, working with a third-party like Shopify is allowing the company to spin up a new revenue stream.</p>
<p>Shopify, however, declined to discuss its financial arrangement with Facebook.</p>
<p>Shopify isn&#8217;t limiting itself to Facebook in an effort to expand its e-commerce business. Last fall, it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">partnered</a> with TikTok on social commerce, allowing merchants to publish their marketing ads directly to the video platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/">Monte Carlo</a>, a startup focused on helping other companies better monitor their data inflows, announced that it has closed a $25 million Series B.</p>
<p>The round, which was co-led by <a href="https://www.ggvc.com/">GGV</a> and <a href="https://www.redpoint.com/">Redpoint</a>, comes mere months after its <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/monte-carlo-raises-16m-to-build-the-worlds-first-data-reliability-platform/">September Series A that was worth $15 million</a>. <a href="https://accel.com/">Accel</a> led the company&#8217;s Series A and Seed deals, participating in its Series B as well.</p>
<p>The round caught our attention not only for the speed at which it was raised following Monte Carlo&#8217;s preceding investment, but also because your humble servant had no idea what data observability, the startup&#8217;s niche, really was.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So we got Monte Carlo co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/bm_datadowntime?lang=en">Barr Moses</a> on a call to explain both her company&#8217;s space, and how it managed to attract so much more capital so quickly.</p>
<h2>Data inflows</h2>
<p>Big data was the jam a while back, but it turned out to be merely one piece in the broader data puzzle. We can see evidence of that in recent revenue growth at Databricks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">which reached $425 million ARR</a> in 2020 by building an analytics and AI service that sits on top of companies&#8217; data.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo is another bet on the data space, sitting a bit earlier in the data lifecycle. Think of it this way: Snowflake can hold all your data, and Databricks can help you analyze it. But what&#8217;s checking to make sure that data flowing <em>into</em> your repositories is, you know, not bullshit?</p>
<p>Figuring out if data inflows are healthy and not bunk is what Monte Carlo does.</p>
<p>According to Moses, companies now have myriad data sources. That&#8217;s great in theory as more data is usually a good thing. But if one or two of those sources goes haywire, figuring that out before you collect, store, and analyze the bad information is pretty important.</p>
<p>So Monte Carlo sits upstream from the other data companies that are hot these days, keeping tabs on inbound data sources across a number of parameters to make sure that what&#8217;s actually arriving in your data lake is legit.</p>
<p>The startup does that, Moses said, by checking data freshness (how recent, or tardy the data in question is), volume (is there too little, too much?), schema (the data&#8217;s structure itself, to see if things have changed that could matter, or break downstream services), distribution (if data points suddenly jump from say, the single digits to the millions), and lineage, which can help find breakpoints in data inflows.</p>
<p>Hearing that Monte Carlo learns from a company&#8217;s particular data pipes to figure out what could be non-standard data inflow made me curious how long it takes to get the startup&#8217;s software set up and running; not long, per Barr, an hour to fire it up in many cases, and a week to learn.</p>
<h2>A growing sector</h2>
<p>Monte Carlo&#8217;s product is neat enough to warrant our attention by itself. But, fitting neatly inside the growth of the broader data space, and especially data tooling that isn&#8217;t directly concerning storage, makes it all the more worth considering.</p>
<p>And now with $25 million more, Monte Carlo can expand its current staff of 25, and keep attacking its mid-market and enterprise customer target. Let&#8217;s see how quickly it can scale, and how soon we can start squeezing the startup for growth numbers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Polish video game maker CD Projekt, which makes <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>The Witcher</em>, has confirmed it was hit by a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>In a statement posted <a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660">to its Twitter account</a>, the company said it will &#8220;not give in nor negotiate&#8221; with the hackers, saying it has backups in place. &#8220;We have already secured our IT infrastructure and begun restoring data,&#8221; the company <a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660">said</a>.</p>
<p>According to the ransom note, the hackers said they would release the company&#8217;s stolen source code and other internal files if it did not pay the ransom, since the company would &#8220;most likely recover from backups.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the company said for now that no personal data was taken. &#8220;We are still investigating the incident, however at this time we can confirm that — to our best knowledge — the compromised systems did not contain any personal data of our players or users of our services.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/maze-ransomware-group-shutting-down/">an increasingly hostile tactic</a> used by ransomware actors: Hackers target high-value businesses and companies with file-encrypting malware and hold the files for a ransom. But since many companies have backups, some ransomware groups threaten to publish the stolen files unless the ransom is paid.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red did not immediately respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s questions, including what kind of ransomware was used to attack its systems.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s thought to be the second time in recent years that the company has been hit by ransomware.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the original startups that set out to create a low-Earth orbit satellite constellation to provide a data network here on Earth is now open for business: <a href="https://swarm.space">Swarm</a>, which now operates 81 of its sandwich-sized satellites on orbit, announced today that its network service is live and available to commercial customers.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 by CEO Sara Spangelo and CTO Ben Longmier, Swarm has accomplished a lot in a relatively short time, culminating in its recent launch of 36 of its smalll satellites during SpaceX&#8217;s first ride-sharing rocket launch late last month. Now that those are all online and operational, Swarm is able to provide full global network coverage, with the ability to check in with connected devices on its network up to multiple times per day.</p>
<p>Swarm&#8217;s offering uses embedded modems also designed and built by the company – the Swarm Tile, a tiny, low-powered modem that&#8217;s designed for maximum compatibility. The network is low-power and low-bandwidth, meaning it&#8217;s ideally suited for situations that require relatively low amounts of data transfer, but on a regular frequency over very long durations. That describes a wide range of use cases, including in shipping in logistics, agriculture, and other Internet of Things (IoT ) deployments. The breadth of their customer base has actually been a surprise, and far outstripped the early vision for the startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We actually started with the containership use case [&#8230;] we talked a lot about how many containers there are in the world, how many ship there are in the world,&#8221; Spangelo told me in an interview. &#8220;We also knew that logistics, trucks, and agriculture would probably be interesting markets. But I&#8217;m frankly surprised not only how many verticals, this applies to – there&#8217;s a lot more in ag and global development and maritime than I probably ever anticipated – but also just the number of use cases within those industries.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110669" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110669" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2110669" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg" alt="Swarm's sandwich-sized IoT network satellites." width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110669" class="wp-caption-text">Swarm&#8217;s sandwich-sized IoT network satellites.</p></div></p>
<p>Spangelo is referring to the depth of the need for monitoring across the industries Swarm serves. So a client in green power wouldn&#8217;t want to just monitor the amount of power being generated by their turbines, but also to monitor the grid for power outgoing and power inbound. And in agriculture, industrial farms might want to monitor soil moisture levels, but also integrate Swarm connectivity in every single truck and tractor in operation in order to monitor their assets and their location. She also told me that vertically, she was surprised to discover just how many opportunities exist for low-bandwidth networks in construction, mining and in defense.</p>
<p>Swarm&#8217;s focus at this stage is strictly commercial, but Spangelo said that people have even approached the company to see if they can purchase a Swarm Tile and use it with an app with their phone for providing basic emergency connectivity while hiking. She says &#8220;they&#8217;re not quite&#8221; at the point where they have a commercially available product for consumers, but it&#8217;s an idea they&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p>One key aspect of Swarm&#8217;s business model is affordability: Its service is available for just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/swarm-prices-out-its-orbital-iot-networks-hardware-and-services/">$5 per month per connected device (with a one-time cost of $119 for each Swarm Tile itself)</a>, which is far below any other satellite service available today. Spangelo says that has meant they are seeing new customers not only in the form of switchers from other satellite network providers, but also from businesses entirely new to satellite connectivity – and for some of those, it&#8217;s changing what&#8217;s possible at a fundamental level.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take wineries – it&#8217;s a high-yield type of crop,&#8221; she said. &#8220;People want to monitor very accurately the moisture and soil. Traditionally, they&#8217;ve only been able to do that within cell range. So think of like Sonoma and Napa, cell connectivity is actually is really bad, because of the rolling hills. So now with Swarm you can have connectivity in those regions outside of cell, and provide that value, and much better knowledge and user data analytics to make much more informed business decisions, save water, save energy, save all those things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of these new use cases include projects like more finite weather and climate monitor to try to assist with efforts to control and contain wildfires, as well as providing detailed tracking of the cold storage chain required to safely and effectively transport COVID-19 vaccines. Spangelo says this is one of the most exciting aspects of Swarm reaching this commercialization stage – seeing what new opportunities are possible that just couldn&#8217;t be done before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Discovery and research of new molecular compounds is an expensive business, with development costs <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060115/how-much-drug-companys-spending-allocated-research-and-development-average.asp">exceeding $10 billion per substance</a> in some cases. Part of that comes from the need to closely examine every relevant molecule, studying its chemical composition and interactions as well as its physical structure at the atomic level. Despite advances in software to help model these compounds and molecules, there are still challenges in fully understanding their shapes through a two-dimensional computer screen.</p>
<p>San Diego-based startup <a href="https://nanome.ai/">Nanome uses virtual reality to solve that problem</a>. The idea for Nanome came out of CEO and Founder Steve McCloskey’s time in the nanoengineering program at UC San Diego, where he saw a need for a better understanding of three-dimensional molecular structures.</p>
<p>“Understanding structure empowers our users to understand how their designs function,” he wrote in an email. “Yet, the R&amp;D process for drug discovery relies on 2D monitors, keyboard, and mouse, which limits the understanding of complex 3D structures or interactions and contributes to massive R&amp;D costs averaging $2.5B per drug.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nanome recently closed a funding round led by <a href="https://www.bullpencap.com/">Bullpen Capital</a> for $3 million to establish new business partnerships, build up the company’s brand, and expand their science and engineering team. “Nanome is reimagining the way we interact with science at a time when innovation in collaboration is more important than ever before,” said Bullpen Capital General Partner Ann Lai in a press release. <a href="https://formic.vc/">Formic Ventures</a>, led by Oculus co-founder Michael Antonov, also took part in the round.</p>

<p>McCloskey thinks that Nanome’s platform has become even more relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic, as researchers might be forced to work remotely on occasion, limiting their access to in-lab technology and software.</p>
<p>“Nanome helps scientists get on the same page quicker,” he wrote in an email. “Traditionally scientists working with molecules use screenshots or screen sharing, and rely on the mouse cursor and Zoom to communicate their insights and ask for feedback from other team members.” Nanome streamlines this process by bringing researchers to the same virtual reality space to work on molecule development together.</p>
<p>So far, Nanome has worked largely on projects with companies in the food and beverage industry, as well as another to develop more sustainable batteries. But they have plans to use this new funding to expand into pharmaceutical chemistry, synthetic biology, and even education. Their next product update will feature what McCloskey calls &#8216;Spatial Recording,&#8217; that will allow users to record their work for later review – basically a screen recording but with a VR experience. “This is not only an amazing feature for asynchronous collaboration among researchers, it is also useful for producing lectures and lessons,” he wrote in an email.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Emergency response services have been one of the unsung heroes of the last chaotic year, providing essential and urgent medical and other assistance during a period that has faced not just the usual run of natural and man-made disasters, but a global health pandemic to boot.</p>
<p>Today, a startup that is building tools to make it easier for emergency response teams to do their jobs by providing them with more immediate data about callers and their circumstances, is announcing a big round of funding as it continues to grow.</p>
<p><a href="http://rapidsos.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RapidSOS</a>, which has built a data platform for emergency response services, has closed a Series C of $85 million, money that it will be using to build in more integrations to provide its customers with better and bigger data sets, and to continue expanding its operations after providing data to assist in addressing some 150 million emergencies in 2020 &#8212; which works out to some 400,000 emergencies per day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These included not just responses to sudden downturns for Covid-19-stricken people, but also natural disasters and helping in related situations when other problems arose. For example, RapidSOS stepped in to provide data when the Nashville bombing took out a portion of 911 infrastructure on Christmas Day, affecting 300 agencies.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Insight, with other unnamed investors participating. Valuation is not being disclosed, CEO and co-founder Michael Martin said, but it has now raised $200 million.</p>
<p>The round comes also on the heels of the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/rapidsos-raises-21m-to-continue-expanding-its-data-platform-for-first-responders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raising $21 million</a> just in June of last year.</p>
<p>Founded in New York, RapidSOS has expanded in the last year to operations in Mexico, where it now covers some 70% of consumers working alongside first responders and partnerships with Google and Uber (which provide location and ride sharing data).</p>
<p>To add to that, today it is formally opening for business in the U.K., in partnership with MedicAlert, which has been working with the company quietly in the past year.</p>
<p>The opportunity it&#8217;s tackling in the U.K. is similar to what RapidSOS identified and built on in the U.S.</p>
<p>As in RapidSOS&#8217;s home country, the average U.K. home has 9 connected devices &#8212; from smartphones, smart watches and smart speakers, through to smart locks, alarm systems and more &#8212; and the idea will be to bring more of the data that these amass about a user&#8217;s location, medical statistics, and other data to provide a basic level of data so that when people call 999 (the U.K.&#8217;s equivalent of 911) for an urgent service, the conversation can quickly progress to finer details in what is a very fragmented market for emergency information.</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally, you are going from a world where 911 didn’t even know your name, so giving responders a name or location can shave critical seconds off response times,&#8221; said Martin.</p>
<p>In the U.S., RapidSOS now works with over 4,800 emergency communications centers, which together cover some 92% of the population, integrating with whatever software those centers happen to use to manage their services. (Case in point: we covered one of RapidSOS&#8217;s partners recently, Carbyne, which itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/carbyne-raises-25m-for-a-next-generation-platform-to-improve-emergency-911-responses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised $25 million last month</a>.)</p>
<p>On the other end of its ingestion engine, the startup&#8217;s platform currently brings in and consolidates data from some 350 million connected devices.</p>
<p>Martin likes to compare the challenge that RapidSOS is setting out to tackle to that of an hour glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Th<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ere are now close to 20 billion devices out there with critical information, and at the bottom is advanced software systems to work with that, but between is the 1960s voice infrastructure,&#8221; he said, holding up a giant blue sand hourglass in our video call. &#8220;So the challenge is to get between one and the other, but also to be able to get on the phone with someone in need and have a coherent conversation.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">His startup sits where the sand normally gets squeezed, and essentially provides an avenue not just to expand that opening but theoretically organise the sand to run through it in a more orderly way.</span></p>
<p>Indeed, the company is doing more than just connecting providers with data: it&#8217;s also trying to build a platform to make it easier for more of the companies holding data to contribute it in a more effective and useful way &#8212; a need that arose, Martin said, in the last year as companies approached RapidSOS asking how they could help.</p>
<p>That led to the startup working with the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross and Direct Relief, to launch the <a href="http://emergencyprofile.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emergency Health Profile</a>, which will allow people (starting in the U.S.) to opt into sharing more background health information to first responders by creating a profile associated with a person’s mobile number.</p>
<p>This complement&#8217;s RapidSOS’s existing business model and sources of real-time diagnostic data, with the aim to provide a more complete picture of a person and his or her problems. As we have said before, this is something of a Holy Grail in the medical world: it provides obvious benefits but also many challenges in terms of data protection and privacy longer term, one of the reasons why it has remained so elusive &#8212; and may indeed pose a challenge to RapidSOS and its partners in the longer term.</p>
<p>That, however, is the kind of problem that precisely can be attacked (if not necessarily completely vanquished) by technology, one reason why VCs have been knocking.</p>
<p>“Insight has a history of backing category-defining companies, and RapidSOS has all the makings of one in the emergency response space,” said Nikitas Koutoupes, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “We are excited to have our team of software ScaleUp and platform experts help drive RapidSOS’ mission.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://homagames.com">Homa Games</a> has raised a $15 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.eventures.vc">e.ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.idinvest.com">Idinvest Partners</a>. The company has built several in-house technologies that can take a game from a prototype to an App Store success. It partners with third-party game studios and has a few in-house game studios as well.</p>
<p>OneRagtime, Jean-Marie Messier, Vladimir Lasocki, John Cheng and Alexis Bonillo are also participating in today’s funding round. This is quite a big funding round, but Homa Games already has some impressive metrics.</p>
<p>For instance, the startup’s games have been downloaded 250 million times overall since the creation of the company in 2018. It has signed an IP partnership with Hasbro to launch a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nerf-epic-pranks/id1492810298">Nerf-themed game</a> that has been working quite well. Other games include Sky Roller, Idle World and Tower Color.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Home Games has developed three products in particular to optimize mobile game creation. Homa Lab helps you learn more about the competitive landscape with market intelligence and testing tools. Homa Belly is an SDK that helps you iterate and manage your game. And Homa Data optimizes monetization using data for both in-app purchases and ads.</p>
<p>Third-party developers can submit their games and choose Homa Games as their publisher. Both companies agree on a revenue-sharing model.</p>
<p>In addition to third-party games, Homa Games has also acquired IRL Team in Toulouse and has in-house game development teams in Skopje, Lisbon and Paris. Overall, there are 80 people working for Homa Games.</p>
<p>Benoist Grossmann from Idinvest Partners and Jonathan Userovici from e.ventures are both joining the board of the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four years ago when Zach Jones went to do due diligence on <a href="https://www.czero.energy/">C-Zero</a>, a startup out of Santa Barbara, Calif. commercializing a new approach to producing hydrogen, for the small family office he was working for, he had no idea he&#8217;d wind up as the company&#8217;s chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Or that the company would wind up raising money from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the billionaire backed investment vehicle focused on financing companies developing technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and some of the world&#8217;s largest industrial and oil and gas companies.</p>
<p>At the time, Jones was working for Beryllium Capital, a small investment office out of South Dakota, and had identified a potential investment opportunity in C-Zero, a company commercializing a new way of making hydrogen developed by <a href="https://chemengr.ucsb.edu/people/eric-mcfarland">Eric McFarland</a>, a professor at UCSB.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There was only one problem &#8212; McFarland had the research, but didn&#8217;t know how to run a company. That&#8217;s when Jones stepped in. His firm didn&#8217;t make the investment, but when the former Economist science writer took over, the company was able to nab a seed round from PG&amp;E and SoCal Gas, California&#8217;s two massive utilities.</p>
<p>The reason for their investments is the same reason Breakthrough Energy Ventures became interested in the young company. Even with renewable energy production coming on line at a breakneck pace, much of the world will still be using fossil fuels for the foreseeable future and the greenhouse gas emissions from that fossil fuel production needs to go to zero.</p>
<p>C-Zero is developing a technology that converts natural gas to hydrogen, a much cleaner source of fuel, and solid carbon as the only waste stream for use in <span style="font-weight: 400;">electrical generation, process heating and the production of commodity chemicals like hydrogen and ammonia. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our CTO talks about running a coal mine in reverse,&#8221; Jones said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1721136" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1721136" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1721136" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="590" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg?resize=768,443 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg?resize=680,392 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1721136" class="wp-caption-text">Night image of an industrial manufacturing plant. Image Credit: Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s technology is a form of methane pyrolysis, which uses a proprietary chemical catalyst to separate the hydrogen gas from other particles, leaving behind that solid carbon waste. The process, which is neither waste free (there&#8217;s that solid carbon) nor renewable (the feedstock is natural gas), is cleaner than current low-cost methods of hydrogen production and far cheaper than the more renewable ways of making hydrogen.</p>
<p>Making renewable hydrogen requires making electricity to send a charge through water to split the liquid into hydrogen and oxygen. And it takes far more energy to pull a hydrogen atom off of an oxygen atom than it does to split that hydrogen from a carbon atom.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The reason that hydrogen is interesting is that it is a great supplement to intermittent renewables,&#8221; said Jones. &#8220;It’s really about energy storage… when you look at long duration storage on a daily and seasonal basis… it becomes exorbitantly expensive. Having a chemical fuel is going to be critical part of decarbonizing everything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Jones describes the technology as &#8220;pre-combustion carbon capture&#8221;, and thinks that it could be critical to unlocking the benefits of hydrogen for a range of industrial applications including heavy vehicle fueling, utility power generation, and industrial power for manufacturing.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not alone.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over $100 billion of commodity hydrogen is produced annually,” said Carmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the new lead investor in C-Zero&#8217;s $11.5 million funding. “Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of that production comes from a process called steam methane reforming, which also produces large quantities of CO2. Finding low cost, low emission methods of hydrogen production – such as the one C-Zero has created – will be critical to unlocking the molecule’s potential to decarbonize major segments of the agricultural, chemical, manufacturing and transportation sectors.”</span></p>
<p>Joining the Bill Gates-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures in the new round is Eni Next, the investment arm of the Italian oil and gas and power company, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and the hydrogen technology-focused venture firm, AP Ventures.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries already has an application for C-Zero&#8217;s technology. The company is in the process of re-powering an existing coal plant to run on a combination of natural gas and hydrogen by 2025. It&#8217;s possible that C-Zero&#8217;s technology could help get there.</p>
<p>Beyond the lower cost methods used in manufacturing hydrogen, C-Zero may be one of the first companies that could qualify for new tax credits on carbon sequestration established by the IRS in the U.S. earlier this year. Those credits would give qualifying companies $20 per ton of sequestered solid carbon &#8212; the exact waste product from C-Zero&#8217;s process.</p>
<p>Even as C-Zero begins commercializing its technology it faces some stiff competition from some of the largest chemical companies in the world.</p>
<p>The German chemicals giant BASF has been developing its own flavor of methane pyrolysis for nearly a decade and has begun building test facilities to scale up production of its own clean hydrogen.</p>
<p>And yesterday, two other big European corporations are also joining the hydrogen production game as the French chemicals company Air Liquide announced a joint venture with Siemens Energy to work on hydrogen production.</p>
<p>Jones acknowledges that the company&#8217;s technology is only a stopgap solution&#8230; for now. In the future, as the world moves to renewable natural gas production from waste, he envisions the potential of a potentially circular hydrogen economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 100 years will this technology be around? If it is it’ll be because we’re using renewable natural gas,&#8221; Jones said. There are a lot of steps that need to be traveled to get there, but Jones is confident in the near-term success of the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There’s always going to be  a need for a very energy dense fuel. Liquid hydrogen is the most energy dense thing that’s out there outside of something that’s nuclear in nature,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think that hydrogen is here to stay. At the end of the day the lowest cost of energy that has the lowest cost for avoided CO2 is what’s going to win.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://sentinelone.com/">SentinelOne</a>, a late-stage security startup that helps customers make sense of security data using AI and machine learning, announced today that it is acquiring <a href="https://www.scalyr.com/">Scalyr</a>, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the high-speed logging startup for $155 million in stock and cash.</span></p>
<p>SentinelOne sorts through oodles of data to help customers understand their security posture, and having a tool that enables engineers to iterate rapidly in the data, and get to the root of the problem is going to be extremely valuable for them, CEO and co-founder Tomer Weingarten explained. &#8220;We thought Scalyr would be just an amazing fit to our continued vision in how we secure data at scale for every enterprise [customer] out there,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>He said they spent a lot of time shopping for a company that could meet their unique scaling needs and when they came across Scalyr, they saw the potential pretty quickly with a company that has built a real-time data lake. &#8220;When we look at the scale of our technology, we obviously scoured the world to find the best data analytics technology out there. We [believe] we found something incredibly special when we found a platform that can ingest data, and make it accessible in real time,&#8221; Weingarten explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Scalyr scores $20M Series A for super-fast log reading tool&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/20/scalyr-scores-20m-series-a-for-super-fast-log-reading-tool/embed/#?secret=hxTkxTx871" data-secret="hxTkxTx871" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He believes the real time element is a game changer because it enables customers to prevent breaches, rather than just reacting to them. &#8220;If you&#8217;re thinking about mitigating attacks or reacting to attacks, if you can do that in real time and you can process data in real time, and find the anomalies in real time and then meet them, you&#8217;re turning into a system that can actually deflect the attacks and not just see them and react to them,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>The company sees Scalyr as a product they can integrate into the platform, but also one which will remain a stand-alone. That means existing customers should be able to continue using Scalyr as before, while benefiting from having a larger company contributing to its R&amp;D.</p>
<p>While SentinelOne is not a public company, it is a pretty substantial private one, having raised over $695 million, according to Crunchbase data. The company&#8217;s most recent funding round came last November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/sentinelone-an-ai-based-endpoint-security-firm-confirms-267m-raise-on-a-3-1b-valuation/">a $267 million investment</a> with a $3.1 billion valuation.</p>
<p>As for Scalyr it was launched in 2011 by Steve Newman, who first built a word processor called Writely and <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/09/writely-confirms-google-acquisition/">sold it to Google in 2006</a>. It was actually the basis for what became Google Docs. Newman stuck around and started building the infrastructure to scale Google Docs, and he used that experience and knowledge to build Scalyr. The startup raised $27 million along the way, according to Crunchbase data including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/20/scalyr-scores-20m-series-a-for-super-fast-log-reading-tool/">a $20 million Series A investment in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>The deal will close this quarter, and when it does Scalyr&#8217;s 45 employees will be joining SentinelOne.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fabric.inc">Fabric</a>, a startup powering e-commerce for companies like GNC and ABC Carpet and Home, has raised $43 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The announcement comes less than four months after <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/next-top-brand-fabric-closes-9-5m-seed-for-e-commerce-platform/">Fabric announced its $9.5 million seed round</a>. CEO Faisal Masud said Fabric hadn&#8217;t intended to raise more funding so quickly, but given its growth and investor interest,  the startup&#8217;s leadership team had to ask, &#8220;Do we delay the growth or do we just go now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer is probably self-evident, since you&#8217;re reading this funding story. The round was led by Norwest Venture Partners, with Norwest&#8217;s Scott Beechuk joining Fabric&#8217;s board of directors. Redpoint Ventures and Sierra Ventures also participated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Fabric is the only headless commerce platform that combines the simplicity of drag-and-drop configuration with the power to create rich modern customer experiences, without the need for a large dev team,&#8221; Beechuk told me via email. &#8220;Most importantly, however, is the fact that Faisal (CEO) and [co-founder Ryan Bartley] are rockstar veterans of the e-commerce world from Amazon, eBay, Staples and Groupon. They empathize with their customers’ challenges and have the expertise to disrupt the mature e-commerce market with a significantly better product.&#8221;</p>
<p>E-commerce has <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-ecommerce-2020">grown rapidly during the pandemic</a>, and there are a number of platforms offering a &#8220;headless&#8221; approach, which (as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/making-headless-commerce-less-spooky-faisal-masud/?trackingId=xWcUHL8WRNu0BkBDyz0MJA%3D%3D">Masud explained in a blog post</a>) separates the frontend and the backend of the shopping experience.</p>
<p>But Masud said there&#8217;s still &#8220;a large gap in the market today&#8221; when it comes to supporting large, growing brands, whether they&#8217;re direct-to-consumer or business-to-business.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110532" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110532" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110532" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg?w=680" alt="Fabric screenshot" width="680" height="392" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg?resize=680,392 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110532" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fabric</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We like to say that Shopify Plus is our on-ramp and Salesforce Commerce Cloud is our off-ramp,&#8221; he said. In other words, Fabric serves businesses that have &#8220;outgrown Shopify Plus but don&#8217;t want to spend a fortune on Salesforce Commerce Cloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>To serve those customers, Fabric has built 32 separate applications which can be integrated with existing commerce tools, and which collectively cover everything from customer experience to product information and order management.</p>
<p>Masud argued that most other products billing themselves as headless e-commerce platforms are &#8220;jerry rigging themselves to become headless&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were built in 2007, they&#8217;re not flexible or modular,&#8221; he said, adding that while older platforms might require 18 months to on-board a large customer, Fabric only requires weeks.</p>
<p>The startup isn&#8217;t discouraging its customers from having a presence on Amazon and other marketplaces, either. But Masud (who was previously director of AmazonBasics and AmazonWarehouse) said they need to build their own differentiated shopping experiences and their own direct relationship with consumers at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I built AmazonBasics and AmazonBasics is coming for you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We encourage them to differentiate and continue their journey as a marketplace, building a direct business with their customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the new funding, Fabric will be able to expand its sales and marketing team while also continuing to improve the product. Masud said he&#8217;s less interested in reaching larger or smaller customers, and more interested in expansion by &#8220;building out a bigger suite co-pilot apps,&#8221; for example by doing more to support order logistics and fulfillment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic-fueled economic uncertainty of the last year has led many to project that the rate of credit defaults among consumers will <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spexperian-consumer-credit-default-indices-show-composite-rate-unchanged-in-december-2020-301211015.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">continue to wobble</a> into 2021. Today a startup that has built a platform to help consumers mitigate that situation is announcing some funding on the back of more demand for its services.</p>
<p><a href="http://symend.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symend</a>, which builds behavioral analytics that integrate with customer engagement products to help identify customers having trouble paying bills, and then suggests payment alternatives to keep them from defaulting altogether, has picked up $43 million in funding.</p>
<p>The money is an extension to its Series B, closed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/symend-raises-52m-to-help-mediate-when-customers-are-at-risk-of-defaulting-on-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May of last year</a>, bringing the total for the round to $95 million, and over $100 million for the Calgary, Canada startup since being founded in 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Inovia Capital is leading this latest funding injection, with other unnamed investors participating.</p>
<p>Symend is not disclosing its valuation but Hanif Joshaghani, Symend&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Tiffany Kaminsky (the startups CMO), said that it comes on the heels of a &#8220;massive uptick&#8221; among enterprises investing in solutions to help support customers finding it hard to meet payments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Customer uncertainty has been extremely high and service providers don’t have the capacity to support the mass volumes of inquiries in a way that effectively resonates with and empathetically reassures customers,&#8221; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>The startup has been working primarily with clients in telecommunications, financial services, utilities and media and claims to have two-thirds of the major telecommunications providers in North America, as well as a multinational bank, as customers.</p>
<p>Last year, Symend said it was on track to work with 100 million customers (that is, customers of its clients) by the end of 2020, and we are asking the company whether it has passed that number.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s aim is twofold: it identifies when their customers are having trouble paying bills, and offers those customers alternatives beyond simple deferrals, which for many just put off addressing the issue.</p>
<p>At the same time, Symend&#8217;s solution is not just about avoiding deferrals: the company&#8217;s solutions aim to provide assistance and alternatives to companies that are seeing an overwhelming amount of traffic in its customer service operations.</p>
<p>Deferrals, however, remain a key point: Most service providers have been offering deferral periods this past year as their first-line approach to avoiding defaults. But Joshaghani said he believes that deferrals &#8220;can provide a false sense of financial security for customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>That, in part, is because those customers are usually deferring more than one bill.</p>
<p>A survey the company conducted in July among 500 of its users found a 27% increase in people falling behind in bill payments between April and July 2020, with those falling behind typically doing so on an average of three bills: 55% on at least one loan; 37% were behind on mortgage/rent; 21% were behind on their line of credit; 52% were behind on credit card payments.</p>
<p>Missing payments, and any personal financial trouble, is usually tied in with more than simply not having money: there can be job losses, illness, family trouble, and much more behind why someone finds himself or herself missing a bill deadline.</p>
<p>Symend therefore tries to take a sensitive approach both to identifying when problems are arising, and addressing them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given that Symend’s primary goal is to save customers from negative outcomes, we deployed strategies with our clients to ensure customers felt supported and empowered to act and avoid bills piling up through the deferral period,&#8221; Joshaghani noted. &#8220;By engaging customers with empathetic communications, self-serve tools and flexible repayment options, Symend has helped leading enterprises provide customers with a positive experience in an otherwise highly uncertain and stressful time. By empowering customers to act through digital tools, Symend alleviates pressure from overwhelmed call centres, increases customer satisfaction, lowers operating costs and helps customers resolve past due bills before they reach collections.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we have described before, Symend&#8217;s staff is around 25% behavioral science PhDs, but it does not go into a lot of detail about how it works, or the approach that it takes in evaluating customers. It uses data from businesses themselves, and combines that with third-party resources (not unlike the data trove that many AI-based fintechs might use to, say, weigh up the eligibility of a person for a particular loan at a particular interest rate).</p>
<p>Kaminsky notes that the last year of business has seen the company make more investments into its algorithms and analytics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using our behaviorally informed algorithms, Symend can identify and distinguish between key variations in customer behavior to personalize and optimize interactions based on the unique preferences of the individual,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Symend’s AI/ML model takes this a step further by combining insights from customer interactions with historical data on actions taken. These insights help Symend discover underlying psychological and behavioral traits to determine which engagement strategies will positively shape behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then to capture customer sentiment and further iterate on these strategies, she says that Symend uses NLP processing models to automatically categorize sentiment based on provided responses to communications and within self-serve tools. &#8220;Our metrics are shaped with the end goal of building a consistently positive brand experience that extends far beyond past due bills, which is why our AI/ML model uses sentiment analysis and engagement scoring,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This ultimately ensures that communications resonate with the customer’s unique and evolving needs, creating a consistently positive experience that retains customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Going ahead, the company is going to use the funding to continue hiring, in particular internationally, with a focus on opening up operations in Latin Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. It&#8217;s also going to be investing in expanding its products to include customer retention and acquisition tools, alongside more investment in expanding its product to help people avoid defaults on bills.</p>
<p>“We are big believers in Symend’s mission to add lasting value to enterprises, by helping their customers avoid collections,” said Dennis Kavelman, Partner at Inovia Capital, in a statement. “Their approach is differentiated and effective because it combines behavioral science and data science to drive a personalized approach for each customer. With this new investment, Symend is well funded to execute its strategy of scaling globally, and to partner with large enterprises in many industries.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Soon, your cloud photo backups could reside on beams of light transmitted between satellites instead of in huge, power-hungry server farms here on Earth. Startup <a href="https://www.lyteloop.com">LyteLoop</a> has spent the past five years doing tackling the physics challenges that can make that possible, and now it&#8217;s raised $40 million to help it leapfrog the remaining engineering hurdles to make its bold vision a reality.</p>
<p>LyteLoop&#8217;s new funding will provide it with enough runway to achieve its next major milestone: putting three prototype satellites equipped with its novel data storage technology into orbit within the next three years. The company intends to build and launch six of these, which will demonstrate how its laser-based storage medium operates on orbit.</p>
<p>I spoke to LyteLoop CEO Ohad Harlev about the company&#8217;s progress, technology and plans. Harlev said five years into its founding, the company is very confident in the science that underlies its data storage methods – and thrilled about the advantages it could offer over traditional data warehousing technology used today. Security, for instance, gets a big boost from LyteLoop&#8217;s storage paradigm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Everybody on every single data center has the same same possible maximum level of data security,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can provide an extra four layers of cyber security, and they&#8217;re all physics-based. Anything that can be applied on Earth, we can apply in our data center, but for example, the fact that we&#8217;re storing data on photons, we could put in quantum encryption, which others can&#8217;t. Plus, there are big security benefits because the data is in motion, in space, and moving at the speed of light.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of security, LyteLoop&#8217;s model also offers benefits when it comes to privacy, because the data it&#8217;s storing is technically always in transit between satellites, which means it&#8217;ll be subject to an entirely different set of regulations vs. those that come into play when you&#8217;re talking about data which is warehoused on drives in storage facilities. LyteLoop also claims advantages in terms of access, because the storage and the network are one in the same, with the satellites able to provide their information to ground stations anywhere on Earth. Finally, Harlev points out that it&#8217;s incredibly power efficient, and also ecologically sound in terms of not requiring million of gallons of water for cooling, both significant downsides of our current data center storage practices.</p>
<p>On top of all of that, Harlev says that LyteLoop&#8217;s storage will not only be cost-competitive with current cloud-based storage solutions, but will in fact be more affordable – even without factoring in likely decreases to come in launch costs as SpaceX iterates on its own technology and more small satellite launch providers, including Virgin Orbit and Rocket Lab, come online and expand their capacity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although it&#8217;s more expensive to build and launch the satellite, it is still a lot cheaper to maintain them in the space,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So when we do a total cost of ownership calculation, we are cheaper, considerably cheaper, on a total cost of ownership basis. However [&#8230;] when we compare what the actual users can do, you know, we can definitely go to completely different pricing model.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlev is referring to the possibility of bundled pricing for combining storage and delivery – other providers would require that you supply the network, for instance, in order to move the data you&#8217;re storing. LyteLoop&#8217;s technology could also offset existing spend on reducing a company&#8217;s carbon footprint, because of its much-reduced ecological impact.</p>
<p>The company is focused squarely on getting its satellites to market, with a plan to take its proof of concept and expand that to a full production satellite roughly five years form now, with an initial service offering made available at that time. But LyteLoop&#8217;s tech could have equally exciting applications here on Earth. Harlev says that if you created a LyteLoop data center roughly the size of a football field, it would be roughly 500 times as efficient at storing data vs. traditional data warehousing.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s technology, which essentially stores data on photons instead of physical media, just requires far less matter than do our current ways of doing things, which not only helps its environmental impact, but which also makes it a much more sensible course for in-space storage when compared to physical media. The launch business is all about optimizing mass to orbit in order to reduce costs, and as Harlev notes, photons are massless.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SplashLearn, a 10-year-old U.S.-headquartered edtech startup that teaches children through a game-based curriculum, has raised $18 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand to more markets.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Owl Ventures led the Series C funding round in SplashLearn, and Accel, which had earlier invested $7 million in the startup’s Series B, also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, <a href="https://www.splashlearn.com">SplashLearn</a> co-founder and chief executive Arpit Jain said one of the biggest hurdles the education system faces today is that kids do not wish to learn, so you have to broach the subject in a way they find engaging.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His startup offers math and reading courses to students in pre-kindergarten to grade five. It has developed, with guidance from teachers and other experts, over 4,000 games and other interactive activities to explain various concepts to the children.</p>
<p>In a demo, Jain showed an adventure game that was riddled with hurdles. A kid needed to visually apply the concept of addition to progress forward in the game. “When the kids are engaged, there is improvement in their learning outcome,” said Jain.</p>
<p>SplashLearn platform additionally provides 15 minutes to 20 minutes of personalized learning experience to each student every day, he said.</p>
<p>The startup charges $12 a month to parents for its service. Alternatively, the service is free for schools. Currently, one in every three schools in the United States use SplashLearn, Jain said.</p>
<p>“One of our goals has been to make quality education available to students for free. Our business model has enabled us to work on this,” he said. SplashLearn doesn’t reach out to schools, he said. Teachers use our platform, and if they like the offering, they make the case for wider adoption at the school, said Jain, who like the other three co-founders, is an alumni of IIT Kharagpur.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110659" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110659" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2110659 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110659" class="wp-caption-text">Image: SplashLearn</p></div></p>
<p>The team first created an edtech platform that was similar to what Coursera has evolved into over the past decade. But their previous venture failed to gain traction as the Indian market, which had fewer than 50 million internet users then, wasn’t ready for it, said Jain.</p>
<p>SplashLearn today caters to more than 40 million registered students on its platform, 10 million of whom joined last year as the coronavirus shut schools worldwide. More than 750,000 teachers have also joined the platform.</p>
<p>The startup is currently largely serving students in the United States, which accounts for 80% of its revenue. But students from over 150 other markets, including the UK, Australia, Canada and India use the platform today.</p>
<p>“SplashLearn is well poised to bring about a distinct change in the digital learning space with its unique blend of scientifically designed curriculum and its pedagogical methods with global appeal. SplashLearn fits into our objective of supporting innovative companies in the edtech space, helping drive a paradigm shift in the way education is imparted, bringing it to scale,” said Amit A. Patel Managing Director, Owl Ventures, in a statement. Patel is joining the SplashLearn’s board along with Abhinav Chaturvedi, a partner at Accel.</p>
<p>Last year, SplashLearn also started a tutoring service for kids, where teachers teach a group of three to five students. This service costs $10 to $25 an hour. “Even at this cost, we are offering the service at a fraction of what it would cost students in a private tuition,” he said.</p>
<p>The tutoring service is currently available in the U.S., and Jain said the startup plans to grow it within the country this year.</p>
