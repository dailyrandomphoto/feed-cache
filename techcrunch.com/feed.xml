										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the Trump administration <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/trump-ban-tiktok/">announced</a> it would ban TikTok in the U.S., a number of alternative short-form video apps began to flourish, as users hedged their bets on a potential TikTok exit. Among these was Byte, an app co-created by Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/byte-tops-a-million-downloads-amid-spam-issues-and-content-concerns/">topped 1.3 million downloads</a> in its first week alone. But when Trump&#8217;s ban on TikTok failed, Byte <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/style/clash-byte-app-acquisition.html">sold to</a> rival <a href="https://www.clashapp.co/">Clash</a> &#8212; an admission of sorts that TikTok&#8217;s momentum couldn&#8217;t be beaten. Now, new owner Clash is kicking off round two. It&#8217;s relaunching its app with the &#8220;best of Byte&#8221; under the hood alongside a suite of creator tools for monetizing a fan base.</p>
<p>This time, the focus isn’t on beating TikTok, but working in parallel alongside it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.clashapp.co/">Clash</a> was founded by Brendon McNerney, a former Vine star who at one point grew his own social following on the now-shuttered app to over 700,000 followers. As someone who worked directly in the creator space, McNerney believes he could offer a unique perspective on creator monetization &#8212; something even leading apps can still struggle with today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216198" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The newly rebuilt Clash’s premise is that it can help creators identify, engage and monetize their strongest and most loyal fans.</p>
<p>To do so, Clash is introducing a set of tools for creators and their fans, including a virtual tipping mechanism called Drops (not to be confused with product drops, popular in e-commerce) and a custom messaging system called Fanmail, for starters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216326" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216326" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2216326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=768,1660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=711,1536 711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216326" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clash</p></div></p>
<p>The idea is that creators could grow their overall fanbase by using larger platforms like Instagram, TikTok or YouTube, where they can monetize the crowd through various methods, like advertising revenue share, brand sponsorships and other more direct methods, when available, like tips and subscriptions. Meanwhile, Clash could serve as the backchannel for the fans who are more invested in the creator&#8217;s journey &#8212; like those who are willing to help fund a creator&#8217;s work, similar to Patreon, or those who want a closer relationship with their favorite creators than they would otherwise be able to achieve elsewhere.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>McNerney says large platforms, like TikTok, can limit creators&#8217; monetization potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;TikTok is a virality machine. It just creates new creators every day &#8212; an issue because there&#8217;s only so many ad dollars&#8230;there&#8217;s only so many dollars in the Creator Fund,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The founder took inspiration from what was working well in other industries, like Twitch with live content, OnlyFans for adult content and Patreon for more project-based work, like podcasts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216320" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216320" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2216320" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?resize=768,1660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?resize=711,1536 711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216320" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clash</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The thing that really stuck out was, in 2019, I started seeing creators post their Venmo links in their bio. It was kind of a head-scratch moment,&#8221; McNerney says. He began to think about how those link-in-bio systems could be turned into more of a product. &#8220;And so we really started from the question&#8230;if Patreon was built now, what would it look like? And then: how can we do what we know well &#8212; which is short-form video?&#8221; he continues. &#8220;We really wanted to build a short-form video platform, where the video was just the medium, but the whole point of the platform was to support your favorite creators and connect with your fans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The initial beta version of Clash launched last summer on the App Store. Soon, the team found creators wanted to use it as a more authentic place to engage with fans outside of larger platforms. Creators wanted to create content specifically designed for the top 10-15% of their fan base &#8212; people who were already supporting them in other ways, like buying their merchandise, for example.</p>
<p>This led to the launch of Clash&#8217;s first product, Fanmail, where fans could pay to unlock the ability to send personalized messages to top creators, who acknowledge them and respond directly.</p>
<p>It also introduced Drops, a digital good purchased from the App Store that fans can use as a token of appreciation or for access to send Fanmail.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216322" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216322" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2216322" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=768,1660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=711,1536 711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216322" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clash</p></div></p>
<p>Creators can redeem Drops at 2,500 (or $25), <a href="https://clashappco.medium.com/?p=f4a1f62b6e2c">Clash says</a>. This is a lower threshold than some creator platforms, like Twitch, where you need to <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/affiliate-payout-faq?language=en_US">have earned $100</a> to cash out. Clash says it will also seed its network by gifting hundreds of Drops to new users, free of charge. And, for the time being, Clash will not take a cut of these sales &#8212; meaning creators keep 100% of the revenue from the Drops they receive. (The company hasn&#8217;t yet decided what percentage it will take when the promotional period ends sometime next year.)</p>
<p>McNerney envisions how Clash can be used in the early stages of content creation and planning, which makes it more symbiotic with larger platforms, like TikTok, instead of a direct competitor. For example, one of Clash&#8217;s launch creators, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ladyyasmina1?">Yasmine Sahid</a>, who makes comedic videos on TikTok, is using Clash to fund her other passion: making music. She&#8217;s been building her first music video with the support of fans on Clash, who are funding it through their Drops. And as the video is produced, these fans get access to the behind-the-scenes content and other sneak peeks.</p>
<p>Plus, he argues, innovations in creator monetization may need to take place outside of larger platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest issue, I think, is while [these large platforms] are experimenting with these tools, they&#8217;re not leaning into them. At the end of the day, their revenue is 98, 99% from advertising revenue,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The model that they see themselves leaning into is just strictly focusing on keeping eyeballs glued to the screen. Whereas, they&#8217;re improving their algorithms &#8212; they want people viewing &#8212; we actually want people engaging,&#8221; McNerney adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216324" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216324" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2216324" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=768,1660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=711,1536 711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216324" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clash</p></div></p>
<p>At launch, Clash&#8217;s app has been rebuilt to handle future scale and to support monetization tools. Meanwhile, Clash is including what the team loved about Byte, including the way Byte&#8217;s Camera worked, the in-app feed and the app&#8217;s Discovery page. There are other similarities between Byte&#8217;s design and the new app, as well.</p>
<p>And while Clash will gain access to Byte&#8217;s existing registered user base of 5 million when it relaunches in Byte&#8217;s place on the app stores, it plans to support a variety of creators &#8212; not just the young Gen Z&#8217;ers who <a href="https://community.byte.co/t/wow-the-hate-towards-millenials-is-real/55146?page=3">used to try to</a> &#8220;<a href="https://community.byte.co/t/stop-bullying-millennials/56166">bully the millennials</a>&#8221; off the original Byte app.</p>
<p>In the near-term, Clash plans to add something called a &#8220;fan score&#8221; based on their engagement in the app, including entering chats and commenting on videos. It plans to release this feature soon after the public debut.</p>
<p>Of course, even as a platform for the most loyal fans, Clash will have its competition from startups and big tech alike. Twitter has built Super Follow to cater to creators while Instagram has been spotted working on its own fan subscription product in recent days.</p>
<p>Co-founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pj-leimgruber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/pj-leimgruber/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633623542719000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBxqFq37wCK2ezV-ySdrr15btWiQ">P.J. Leimgruber</a>, who previously founded influencer agency NeoReach, LA-based Clash is now a team of 17 full-time. Many early employees have backgrounds in social and creator platforms, including Facebook, TikTok, Vine, Snap, Twitter, Google, Pinterest and Cameo. Vine&#8217;s/Twitter&#8217;s head of Creator Development, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karynisaunicorn/">Karyn Spencer</a>, is also Clash&#8217;s creator advisor. Byte and Vine co-founder Dom Hoffman remains an advisor.</p>
<p>Ahead of its relaunch, Clash raised $9.1 million in funding over three rounds. The latest was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005283/en/Clash-Acquires-Byte-App-Secures-Investment-from-Alexis-Ohanian%E2%80%99s-Seven-Seven-Six">a seed round</a> led by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian’s new fund Seven Seven Six. Other investors in Clash include M13 Ventures, Plug and Play, ACME Capital, and angels Jesse Leimgruber (NeoReach co-founder) and NBA Players, Austin Rivers and Seth Curry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.plume.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plume</a> &#8212; a communications startup that partners with carriers to provide smart mesh WiFi to improve broadband connectivity in homes, and then offers other smart home services on top of that network &#8212; has been in the middle of a massive boom in its business fueled by the rapid uptake, use, and complete reliance on broadband in the home working as best as it can.</p>
<p>Now it has closed a huge funding round to ride the wave. The Palo Alto-based startup has raised another $300 million led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 at a valuation of $2.6 billion. Plume&#8217;s CEO and founder Fahri Diner said the startup will be using the money to continue building out its software platform, inking and servicing more deals with carriers, and generally expanding its horizons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years ago, the killer app was WiFi, managing the pods,&#8221; he said, referring to the system of mesh routers that are used to improve the speed and quality of a WiFi network in homes. &#8220;That is no longer it, although it&#8217;s still a big piece of it. Access control and device security are growing fast, and people are also engaging with our motion sensors since indoor cameras are going away because of privacy reasons. IOT, health, energy management, and home security are all areas we have been testing for two years and they work, so we will be leaning into a lot of stuff.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216594" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Other investors in this latest round were not disclosed but previous backers include a strong mix of strategic and financial investors: Charter Communications, Comcast Cable, Foxconn, Insight Partners, Jackson Square Ventures, Liberty Global Ventures, Presidio Ventures, Qualcomm, Samsung, Service Electric Cablevision, Shaw Ventures, Silicon Valley Bank, and UpBeat Venture Partners among them. Insight was the sole backer in its last round, investing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/plume-picks-up-270m-at-a-1-35b-valuation-to-power-smart-home-wifi-for-broadband-providers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$270 million at a $1.35 billion valuation</a> in the startup. The fact that this latest SoftBank-led round is coming just eight months later is a mark of how rapidly Plume&#8217;s business has been growing.</p>
<p>Indeed, Covid-19 and the impact it had on how we use our broadband at home has probably been the biggest driver of Plume&#8217;s business in the last year.</p>
<p>As more people have been compelled to stay home to work, study, and pass the time, the more strain we&#8217;ve been putting on those home networks. In some cases, like mine, that strain also quickly led to major cracks: I am myself a Plume user; after trying a number of other things it was the only solution that could get the broadband to work well and reliably in our London Victorian house.</p>
<p>I guess we weren&#8217;t the only ones. Plume said that business ballooned in the last two quarters, adding 13 million new households to total 35 million (&#8220;more than our biggest customer, Comcast,&#8221; Diner pointed out to me); and it added 350 million more devices to its platform bringing the total to 1.2 billion devices; plus 60 more broadband carrier customers to now total 240 million globally (these include cable companies, telcos, and wireless carriers that also offer broadband).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s also now partnering with those carriers to branch out beyond their own broadband. In an OTT-style play, in the UK, Plume and Virgin Media are selling HomePass, which includes the Plume pod and software to manage it and run other services, across all of the UK (25 million households), regardless of whether Virgin is providing the broadband underpinning the service or not.</p>
<p>All of this is banked around services for consumers and the connected home. These are two areas where the startup will definitely continue to expand its reach, as outlined by the range of managed services Diner said the company has been working on for some time, along with others tapping into the connected home and specifically electronic objects that already have some degree of interfacing with the internet (think here: Plume letting you know when your connected Nespresso machines is about to need cleaning). These are due to start to get rolled out later this year when Plume releases an update of its app.</p>
<p>But further along, the company&#8217;s next steps will likely be outside the home, Diner said. One big area where you could see it doing more, for example, is in the area of industrial environments, where there are vast networks of often remote devices that are costly to connect to networks in a reliable way, which also need monitoring &#8212; two areas where Plume could figure in the future.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We might segment the market into residential, business, and industrial IoT,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have a phenomenal foothold in residential, which we are now moving into small business. Industrial is also in our scope. We have ambitious plans and this financing gives us more capability.&#8221; What is not in scope, he added, is enterprise campuses, where often there is already extensive internet wiring and bespoke WiFi solutions that fit into a company&#8217;s particular networking and security configurations. </span></p>
<p>“The pandemic has dramatically accelerated the adoption of digital services, increasing our dependence on smart devices,” said Nagraj Kashyap, Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, who joined the <span class="il">Plume</span> Board of Directors, in a statement. “Through its innovative cloud data platform, we believe <span class="il">Plume</span>’s consumer-first approach provides customers with reliable connectivity in their homes and beyond. We are pleased to partner with Fahri and the team to support their ambition of reinventing services for smart spaces globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cytrio, a Boston-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-privacy/">data privacy</a> and compliance startup, has launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/saas/">software-as-a-service</a> privacy rights management platform after landing $3.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The funding was secured from angel investors and institutional seed investors, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/dreamit-ventures/">Dreamit Ventures</a>, Food Retail Ventures, and Rockwood Group, and values the company at &#8220;north of $10 million&#8221;, Cytrio co-founder and CEO Vijay Basani told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The raise also included Cytrio’s founding team. This includes Basani, who previously founded WebManage Technologies (acquired by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/netapp/">NetApp</a>), AppIQ (acquired by HP), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/cygilant-ransomware/">Cygilant</a>, as well as chief privacy officer Pankaj Parekh, who previously worked at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/zscaler/">Zscaler</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/Microsoft/">Microsoft</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216059" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Cytrio’s founding team claims more than 50 years of data, privacy, and security experience. The startup said it&#8217;s looking to serve mid-market companies, which Cytrio claims often struggle to adopt data privacy regulations due to the fact that current privacy rights management solutions are expensive, complex to deploy, and difficult to use. The company says it&#8217;s filling this gap with its privacy rights management platform — built on AI-led data discovery and automated response workflows — which will help small and medium-sized companies comply with a range of emerging privacy legislation, including in California, Virginia, and Colorado.</p>
<p>“Current first generation privacy rights management solutions on the market do not play well in the mid-market due to deployment complexity, long time to value and the requirement of dedicated privacy teams,” Basani told TechCrunch. “Cytrio is challenging this paradigm with a next-gen privacy rights management solution where we believe we can deliver value on day one.”</p>
<p>Basani adds that “data privacy compliance is about to get even more critical”, with “a slew of new Acts, heftier fines, and potential impacts on revenues going to hit companies found unprepared.”</p>
<p>“While enterprises can absorb some of these challenges and have the resources to manage data privacy mid-market companies simply do not. We are going to fix that,” he says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cytrio tells TechCrunch it will use its $3.5 million seed raise to expand its team (from a headcount of 23 and expanding to more than 40 employees in the next 12 months) to validate its product, and to achieve annual recurring revenue of more than $250,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>, the $40 billion software startup looking to make design accessible to everyone, has today announced a video editing suite.</p>
<p>Launched in 2013, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/canva/">Canva</a> emerged during the design rennaissance, around the same time that Sketch, Figma and InVision were crashing the Adobe party. Unlike the others, Canva focused on democratization of design, creating a UI that allowed anyone to make just about anything, from slide decks to t-shirts to social media assets.</p>
<p>Today, Canva continues on that trajectory in the world of video.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216591" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Canva video software offers a scene-focused interface, meaning that users can break down their video into easy-to-manage pieces. From there, they can trim scenes (coming soon), manage multiple audio tracks and use in-editor video previews to check their work.</p>
<p>Canva is also offering video templates to simplify the process for users based on their end goals. For example, folks making a TikTok video are designing and editing in a different format than folks making Twitch banners.</p>
<p>Considering the growth in educational video &mdash; Canva says that 20 percent of knowledge workers either create or consume video for their job every single day &mdash; the company is also introducing screen and in-editor recording, so folks can record themselves or their screen to create a video for the rest of the team or organization.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216599" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216599" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="398" class="size-large wp-image-2216599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=2048,1200 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216599" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canva</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For users who are looking to polish up their video, Canva is also offering animations and automatic transitions in its classic easy-to-use interface.</p>
<p>Moreover, Canva Video is multiplayer, allowing users to edit in the same scene-based editor without having to download, reupload, etc.</p>
<p>In an email interview, Canva&#8217;s Head of Product Rob Kawalsky explained that the greatest challenge in building video creation software has been balancing the need for a powerful, robust tool with the simplicity of use that Canva has built its foundation on, adding that most video creation software relies on a multi-layer editing timeline.</p>
<p>&#8220;We landed on our unique scene-based timeline, which splits videos into scenes that have a similar look and feel to presentation slides,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This feels instantly familiar, and also means Canva’s editor offers an almost identical editing experience whether you’re creating a static or moving design. Powerful editing features, like the ability to add animations, scene transitions and crop clips are available, but rather than having hundreds of confusing buttons at once, everything is context-specific — meaning the options present themselves as you need them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canva Video is included as part of the company&#8217;s free tier.</p>
<p>Video represents a massive new frontier for Canva, which recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/">$200 million at a $40 billion valuation</a> and announced plans to double its workforce yet again over the next year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fJ4nkuwSSL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/">Canva raises $200 million at a $40 billion valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Canva raises $200 million at a $40 billion valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/embed/#?secret=fJ4nkuwSSL" data-secret="fJ4nkuwSSL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company is on track to do $1 billion in annualized revenue for 2021 with over 500,000 teams using the paid product.</p>
<p>Video only fuels the growth of the company, which has mastered the process of going B2B from B2C.</p>
<p>&#8220;People come to Canva to design a specific format, but quickly realize they can do much more,&#8221; added Kawalsky.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced a new feature for its AppSheet automation service that will allow developers on its no-code platform to create custom apps and automation that can interact directly with Gmail. By leveraging <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/take-action-and-stay-up-to-date-with-dynamic-email-in-gmail/">dynamic email</a>, developers can now build applications that users can trigger and execute right from inside their Gmail inbox &#8212; and while that has been the promise of dynamic email since Google announced it in 2019, we haven&#8217;t seen all that many developers really make use of these capabilities yet.</p>
<p>With this, an AppSheet developer could now build an approval workflow or asset management system that users can update right from within an email, for example.</p>
<p>Praveen Seshadri, the CEO and founder of AppSheet who sold the service to Google in 2020, noted that this is a small but important step in the service&#8217;s overall mission to enable more users to convert their idea into working software &#8212; and to help those developers (or &#8220;creators,&#8221; as he likes to call them) reach their users where they are.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216465" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re in the process of doing is saying, &#8216;how do we let people who are what we call <em>creators</em> &#8212; people with ideas of how to make things run better or automate things, and so on &#8212; build those things?&#8217; Traditionally, there were apps, but of late, we&#8217;re trying to say, &#8216;how do we integrate that deeper into the experience of those end users?&#8217; That&#8217;s what developers have been doing for a while with the workspace platform and now we&#8217;re broadening that to the non-developers,&#8221; Seshadri said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216467" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-2.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216467" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2216467" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-2.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="607" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2216467" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Typically, it&#8217;s the business users who are the closest to the business problems, so as Seshadri noted, they are also usually the ones who know what they want from an automation solution like this. And while they may not be able to code themselves, Seshadri argues that AppSheet&#8217;s focus on a declarative approach lets users focus on outcomes and not the &#8220;insanely tedious steps to achieve those outcomes.&#8221; But he also noted that in most businesses, no-code users and traditional engineers work together. Somebody has to build and maintain the database that the no-code application sits on top of, after all.</p>
<p>On top of broadening the capabilities of the AppSheet platform, though, the current focus for the team is on how those efforts are consumed by end users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Traditionally, if you&#8217;re building applications, you got to go to the application and do something there,&#8221; Seshadri said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to do an expense report. I&#8217;ve got an expense report application, a web web page or something And I do that. And then I have to do something with recruiting, I go to that application. We tend to transform your context in all these places. What we&#8217;re doing now is taking AppSheet applications built by creators and bringing them into your Gmail, so that the users can stay in the context they are in and the work comes to them, the application comes to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that Gmail is an obvious starting point inside of Google Workspace, though the overall goal is to meet the users where they are so they can stay within their current work context as much as possible.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216493" style="width: 472px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/oI1EI7dy-AD3FEDCivlyLc7hEXQ4D7BVUyrAPjSAo941HH6fCBCrxehOCV8jBIBa0723vEF-somSLyvY6SG7Qmee-EPk3oOJkb9ndiE0kwIJycp3ynTPbKD7xX3bgFtJnR2C77BDDQs0.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216493" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2216493" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/oI1EI7dy-AD3FEDCivlyLc7hEXQ4D7BVUyrAPjSAo941HH6fCBCrxehOCV8jBIBa0723vEF-somSLyvY6SG7Qmee-EPk3oOJkb9ndiE0kwIJycp3ynTPbKD7xX3bgFtJnR2C77BDDQs0.gif" alt="" width="462" height="455" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2216493" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In this context, it&#8217;s also worth noting that Google is also launching a new integration with Atlassian today that brings a Jira integration to Google Chat and Spaces (formerly called &#8220;Rooms&#8221;). With this, users will be able to create new Jira tickets right from Chat and Spaces, see previews of their tickets and track active issues. That is pretty much a capability that users of Slack and Microsoft Teams already have access to, so in many ways, Google is simply filling a gap in its tool chest here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modern work requires people to switch contexts and tools faster than ever before,&#8221; said Joff Redfern, chief product officer, Atlassian. &#8220;We believe an open ecosystem and tight integrations among the tools that users rely on every day is vital to their success. Since 2017, our Trello integration with Gmail has been installed by more than 7 million people. Today, we are excited to build on the partnership between Atlassian and Google to propel work collaboration further with the integration of Jira with Google Chat and Spaces.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/google-closes-2-6b-looker-acquisition/">acquired</a> the business intelligence service <a href="https://looker.com/">Looker</a> for $2.6 billion and Salesforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/salesforce-closes-15-7b-tableau-deal/">picked up</a> <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> for $15.7 billion. But today, the two competitors are growing closer together thanks to a new integration between the two. Specifically, Tableau users will soon be able to access Looker&#8217;s semantic layer, while Google&#8217;s Looker users will soon be able to use Tableau&#8217;s visualization layer on top of the Looker platform.</p>
<p>This may seem like an unlikely partnership at first, but in a way, this allows both services to play to their strengths. Tableau&#8217;s advanced visualization capabilities have always been a draw for its users, but unlike Looker, it was born on the desktop and despite all of the company&#8217;s efforts, that desktop/cloud split is still somewhat apparent in its products. Looker, on the other hand, was born in the cloud, but it&#8217;s also very much a product for the more technical user who can write SQL while Tableau&#8217;s focus is more on enabling any business user to analyze data. That, in many ways, is also why both were a good match for their respective acquirers at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that everyone who is solving for simplicity and working with data is a partner of Google,&#8221; said Gerrit Kazmaier, Google&#8217;s VP &amp; GM for Databases, Analytics &amp; Looker, &#8220;We also work With Databricks. Ultimately, everyone is benefiting if we&#8217;re solving the right problems overall. And if companies like Tableau &#8212; a great partner of Google&#8217;s &#8212; are also interested in making working with data more simple, it&#8217;s a really good basis for collaboration.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216112" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He noted that Looker&#8217;s semantic model brings a lot of flexibility to the table, while Tableau offers its users a lot of tools to democratize data and around data visualization and storytelling. It&#8217;s maybe no surprise then that the two companies already share a large number of customers. &#8220;We thought, how much would it help our customers if they just could use Tableau against LookerML? Meaning they would not be required to copy and again, get into all of this complexity. And on the other side, we thought on the Looker side, how much you know, would it actually help Looker customers, if they could just connect Tableau to it? And we thought, actually, it would help a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kazmaier argues that in the end, what counts is the customer experience and how a service can create value for a customer. &#8220;I think every company who starts making it about themselves is, is going to face hard times,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its Cloud Next event, Google today announced the launch of <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a> on Google Cloud as a fully managed service. With this, the popular open-source data processing engine will become a premium offering on Google Cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this innovation, Spark finally arrives in the cloud-native world,&#8221; said Gerrit Kazmaier, Google&#8217;s VP &amp; GM for Database, Data Analytics &amp; Looker. &#8220;It allows data engineers and data scientists to work with Spark without worrying about cluster end configurations. We also integrated it into all of our data services. So you can launch it directly from BigQuery, from Vertex AI, from Dataplex. It makes using Spark so easy that it allows our customers to use the frameworks and the toolkits that they&#8217;re familiar with &#8212; they love the data science experience, and they can now consume it in a cloud-native way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google argues that this is the &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 300;">world’s first autoscaling and serverless Spark service for the Google Cloud data platform.&#8221; But it&#8217;s worth noting that, given its popularity, there are plenty of other companies that will run and manage Spark for their customers. Spark is also at the center of Databricks&#8217; platform, which is maybe no surprise, given that the well-funded startup was founded by the creators of Spark.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216086" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You may also wonder: doesn&#8217;t Google Cloud already offer a managed Spark service as part of Dataproc (that is, of course, if you&#8217;re one of the five people who is capable of remembering every service that Google, Amazon and Microsoft now offer in their clouds&#8230;)?</p>
<p>These are different services, targeting different customers, though, Kazmaier told me. If you already have Spark, Hadoop or maybe MapReduce, Presto and other systems up and running, then the idea here is that Dataproc will give you all of these, but as a managed service. But for Kazmaier, the focus of what he&#8217;s building out around Google Cloud&#8217;s data services is all about simplicity and especially about making life easier for companies that are just getting started in their data journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re building a data team &#8212; and you hire one data engineer and one data scientist? Do what you really want to get started by saying: &#8216;I&#8217;ll now build a storage system. I&#8217;ll build up a metadata system from the ground up.&#8217; Of course not, but this is literally what you are forced to do today,&#8221; he said. &#8221; Now with Spark serverless, you just say &#8216;go.'&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bondvet.com/">Bond Vet</a>, the NY-based veterinary care clinic, has announced the close of a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus.</p>
<p>The veterinary startup raised $17 million toward the end of 2020, explaining that they&#8217;re modeled after CityMD for humans. The company currently offers services in New York City and Long Island, New York.</p>
<p>The idea is that Bond Vet can fill the gap between vet ERs and the veterinary equivalent of a primary care physician. There is no membership required to bring your pet to Bond Vet, with walk-ins or appointments available via the website or mobile app. Bond Vet also offers urgent care and primary care for pets, which includes vaccinations, check-ups, preventative medicine, etc.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216610" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I am a puppy mom as of May 2021 and have been going to Bond Vet exclusively since my little dude came on the scene. I&#8217;m paying the bills, too. Bond Vet isn&#8217;t giving me or my pup special treatment.</p>
<h3>The pros:</h3>
<p>Bond Vet offers telehealth appointments. These aren&#8217;t <em>always</em> useful as our pets can&#8217;t explain their own symptoms, so unless the issue is incredibly obvious, it&#8217;s probably best to bring your furry friend into a clinic. When it is an obvious issue, being able to diagnose and treat an issue from the safety and comfort of your home, without having to cart your pet around, is wonderful.</p>
<p>Bond Vet tracks everything in a mobile app. You can look at the notes from your pet&#8217;s last appointment on the app, or download and print their entire medical history, proof of vaccinations, etc.</p>
<p>Bond Vet is pretty damn affordable, and the model makes pricing pretty straightforward, which isn&#8217;t necessarily common in the vet or human health care worlds. Vaccinations, for example, are $55 for cats and dogs. A telehealth appointment is $50.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has has an on-site pharmacy, and they&#8217;re pretty good about turning around medication quickly. They&#8217;ll even ship you medication if you&#8217;re not in town and have been given an Rx via telehealth.</p>
<p>Bond Vet is designed specifically to be a vet&#8217;s office. There is a treat station, and separated chairs in the waiting area to make sure sick pets aren&#8217;t over stimulated by the other animals in the room.</p>
<h3>A few small cons:</h3>
<p>Bond Vet&#8217;s model is very akin to CityMD, which means that your pet is unlikely to see the same vet or nurse exclusively. In other words, it can be hard to build a relationship with your pet&#8217;s primary doctor, as they don&#8217;t really have one.</p>
<p>Bond was <em>very</em> slow to allow pet parents back into the clinic alongside their fur-babies during the pandemic. While stores all around their Cobble Hill location were back open for business, with both masked and unmasked patrons wandering around, pet parents had to stay outside while their pets were treated. It was very recent that Bond started allowing pet parents back into the clinic, and even then, not into the exam rooms with their pets.</p>
<p>I fully understand and appreciate the need to provide safe spaces for workers during the pandemic. But as a new mom to a little puppy, this policy of being outside until the end of July was somewhat bothersome considering that my pet has no agency or representation if I&#8217;m not around. I&#8217;m sure the nice folks at Bond would never do anything untoward with my little guy, but I still feel uncomfortable sending him somewhere to get pricked or prodded without me. And it was especially terrible sending him to get his vaccinations without even being in the building.</p>
<p>At times, and not all the time, Bond can feel a bit like a volume play. When I first got my puppy, I had a million questions about what was best for him, from his bath time routine to his diet to the best treats and bones for teething. We&#8217;ve been to Bond at least half a dozen times, if not more, and it&#8217;s about 50/50 when it comes to whether a nurse, vet tech or doctor has the time to really sit down and answer all your questions.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;ve been happy with my choice to use Bond Vet. And it would seem I&#8217;m not alone. The startup has treated more than 40,000 pets in the NYC area.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what cofounder and CEO Mo Punjani had to say in a prepared statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The increase in pet ownership, accelerated by the rise of adoptions and need for care during the pandemic has demonstrated an enormous opportunity to improve veterinary services, especially in urgent and emergent cases for pets. Bond Vet meets the demand for a high-quality, convenient experience for pet care, supported by our best-in-class technology and standards for medical excellence. The new partnership with Warburg Pincus and the continuing support of our initial capital provider Talisman Capital, will help accelerate our growth and enable us to provide the best experience for our pets, pet parents and our veterinarians in New York and beyond.</p></blockquote>
<p>The new funding will be used to expand the Bond Vet footprint, invest in equipment, training, culture and technology.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today at Google Cloud Next, the company&#8217;s annual customer conference, Google announced a broad portfolio of hybrid cloud services designed to deliver computing at the edge of Google&#8217;s network of data centers, in a partner facility or in a customer&#8217;s private data center &#8212; all managed by Anthos, the company&#8217;s cloud native management console. There&#8217;s [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today at <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next">Google Cloud Next</a>, the company&#8217;s annual customer conference, Google announced a broad portfolio of hybrid cloud services designed to deliver computing at the edge of Google&#8217;s network of data centers, in a partner facility or in a customer&#8217;s private data center &#8212; all managed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/google-clouds-fully-managed-anthos-is-now-generally-available-for-aws/">Anthos</a>, the company&#8217;s cloud native management console.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to unpack here, but Sachin Gupta, Google&#8217;s GM and VP of Product for IaaS, says the strategy behind the announcement was to bring customers along who might have specialized workloads that aren&#8217;t necessarily well suited to the public cloud &#8212; a need that he says they were continually hearing about from potential customers.</p>
<p>That means providing them with some reasonable alternatives. &#8220;What we find is that there are various factors that prevent customers from moving to the public cloud right away,&#8221; Gupta said. For instance, they might have low latency requirements or large amounts of data that they need to process and moving this data to the public cloud and back again may not be efficient. They also may have security, privacy, data residency or other compliance requirements.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215647" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>All of this led Google to design a set of solutions that work in a variety of situations that might not involve the pure public cloud. A solution could be installed on the edge in one of Google&#8217;s worldwide data centers, in a partner data center like a telco or a colo facility like Equinix, or as part of a managed server inside a company&#8217;s own data center.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YgAPnnGDPv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/embed/#?secret=YgAPnnGDPv" data-secret="YgAPnnGDPv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With that latter component, it&#8217;s important to note that these are servers from partner companies like Dell and HPE, as opposed to a server manufactured and managed by Google as Amazon does <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/aws-outposts-begins-to-take-shape-to-bring-the-cloud-into-the-data-center/">with its Outposts product</a>. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that these machines won&#8217;t be connected directly to the Google cloud in any way, but Google will manage all of the software and provide a way for IT to manage cloud and on-prem resources in a single way. More on that in a moment.</p>
<p>The goal with a hosted solution is a consistent and modern approach to computing using either containers and Kubernetes or virtual machines. Google provides updates via a secure download site and customers can check these themselves or let a third party vendor handle all of that for them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The glue here that really holds this approach together is Anthos, the control software the company introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/googles-anthos-hybrid-cloud-platform-is-coming-to-aws-and-azure/">a couple of years ago</a>. With Anthos, customers can control and manage software wherever it lives, whether that&#8217;s on premise, in a data center or on public clouds, even from competitors like Microsoft and Amazon.</p>

<p>The whole approach signals that Google is attempting to carve out its own share of the cloud by taking advantage of a hybrid market opening. While this is an area that both Microsoft and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">IBM</a> are also trying to exploit, taking this comprehensive platform approach while using Anthos to stitch everything together could give Google some traction, especially in companies that have specific requirements that prevent them from moving certain workloads to the cloud.</p>
<p>Google reached 10% market share in the cloud infrastructure market for the first time in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/cloud-infrastructure-market-kept-growing-in-q2-reaching-42b/">the most recent quarterly report</a> from August with a brisk growth rate of 54%, showing that they are starting to gain a bit of momentum, even though they remain far behind Amazon with 33% and Microsoft with 20% market share.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google first revealed BigQuery Omni, its Anthos-based multi-cloud data analytics solution, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/google-clouds-new-bigquery-omni-will-let-developers-query-data-in-gcp-aws-and-azure/">last summer</a>. Today, at its annual Cloud Next event, the company announced that BigQuery Omni is generally available. What makes Omni different from similar services is that it allows its users to use the standard BigQuery interface they know to query data that sits on other clouds, including Microsoft&#8217;s Azure and AWS &#8212; all without having to move copies of their data between these clouds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone knows a data silo is bad, but the reality is that right now, we are building data silos, just in different clouds,&#8221; Gerrit Kazmaier, Google&#8217;s VP &amp; GM for Databases, Analytics &amp; Looker, told me. &#8220;There is a new generation of data silos and we recognize that most of the companies in the world live in a multi-cloud reality, and with BigQuery Omni, we basically give them the possibility to do analytics across them &#8212; cross-cloud analytics, which I think is the ultimate in simplicity, because you don&#8217;t need to think anymore about where do I move my data and all of the repetition and redundancy in governing it. The single pane of glass and that single processing framework &#8212; it&#8217;s a feat of engineering that the team basically took BigQuery and brought many parts of it to other clouds.&#8221;</p>

<p>A number of Google Cloud customers are already making good use of these capabilities. Kazmaier noted that Johnson &amp; Johnson, for example, uses it to combine its data in Google Cloud with S3 data on AWS, while Electronic Arts uses it to combine advertising data with in-game purchases.</p>
<p>Talking about data silos, Google also today noted that Dataplex, a tool that allows enterprises to manage, monitor and govern their data across data lakes and warehouses, will also be generally available later this year. It is currently in preview.</p>
<p>Like so many of Google Cloud&#8217;s other announcements today, both of these services recognize that virtually every enterprise now operates in a multi-cloud environment &#8212; and almost by default, that means that a lot of valuable data is spread across systems. Using multiple systems to manage this data is cumbersome and error-prone, but most importantly, it&#8217;s hard (and often expensive) to combine all of this data in a single system. Google&#8217;s approach here is to just bring all of its own services to these various clouds and then manage them from GCP. That&#8217;s the approach it took with Anthos to manage Kubernetes clusters and, unsurprisingly, that now also allow it to run some core GCP services outside of its own cloud, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Cloud today announced a new (and free) feature that will provide its users with custom <a href="https://cloud.google.com/carbon-footprint">carbon footprint reports</a> that detail the carbon emissions their cloud usage generates.</p>
<p>Google Cloud itself has long said that it wants to run 100% on carbon-free energy by 2030. It&#8217;s already matching its energy usage with renewable energy purchases. But it&#8217;s not just Google Cloud, virtually every enterprise today is looking to see how it can reach its emission targets, too. Quantifying the role of cloud computing in this is notoriously difficult, though, so the idea here is to make it easier for businesses to report the environmental impact of their cloud usage, both internally and externally.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216442" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216442" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216442" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-3.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2216442" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216432" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Customers can leverage this data for reporting as well as internal audits and carbon reduction efforts. Build in collaboration with customers like HSBC, L&#8217;Oreal and Atos, our carbon footprint reporting introduces a new level of transparency to support customers in meeting their climate goals,&#8221; said Jenn Bennett, who leads Google Cloud&#8217;s data and technology strategy for sustainability in the <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/octo-google-clouds-two-way-innovation-street/">Office of the CTO</a>. &#8220;Customers can monitor their cloud emissions over time by project, by product and by region, empowering IT teams and developers with metrics that help them reduce their carbon footprint. Digital infrastructure emissions are really just one part of their environmental footprint, but accounting for carbon emissions is necessary to measure progress against the carbon reduction targets that they all have.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216453" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216453" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2216453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-1.gif" alt="" width="600" height="375" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2216453" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>As Bennett noted, once a company has accurate reporting in place, providing recommendations for how to reduce their climate impact is a natural next step. Specifically, this means adding carbon estimates to Google Cloud&#8217;s Unattended Project Recommender, which helps customers reduce their number of idling resources, and adding a sustainability impact category to its Active Assist Recommender.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">KixCare, a Canadian pediatric <a href="https://www.kixcare.com/">virtual healthcare platform</a>, announced that it has raised $2 million in seed funding. Esplanade Ventures, Canada’s leading digital health venture capital firm, led the funding round, with participation from Horizon Capital and angel investors.</p>
<p>The platform connects families and their children with pediatric telehealth services and aims to enable equitable access to quality care for all Canadian children. KixCare’s team of pediatric care experts includes pediatricians, psychologists, behavioral therapists, dietitians, concussion specialists and more. The company currently offers services in the province of Ontario and is looking to expand across Canada.</p>
<p>“The funding has enabled us to grow our presence here in Ontario and we’ll be launching next in Quebec by the end of the year,” said KixCare CEO Daniel Warner in an interview with TechCrunch. “The funding will be used to grow our team, improve the digital experience and grow our network of healthcare providers, including pediatricians.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Warner noted that KixCare believes that the current model of children’s healthcare often fails to meet the needs of both families and providers. The team believes that existing traditional and digital healthcare options often fail to provide accessible, online pediatric care from experts.</p>
<p>Through KixCare, families and their children are able to access primary and comprehensive care for things like mental health and concessions, along with sleep, diet and lactation concerns. KixCare’s pediatric experts are available outside traditional clinic hours by appointment or within the hour for urgent situations.</p>
<p>“KixCare provides a simple accessible solution for many of the challenges that are present in children’s healthcare today. We’re so excited to be the first ones to launch the pediatric-specific virtual care service. Our social mission is to help all 10 million Canadian families equitably and to be there for them and their little ones through their healthcare journey,” Warner stated.</p>
<p>“The time is right to introduce a new pillar into the pediatric care space. We want to have children and their families turn to KixCare for problems big or small, many of which can be resolved virtually. Especially with the pandemic, where have parents turned to for quality healthcare for their children? If it’s a primary care concern or mental health concern, where do you turn? The answer is now KixCare.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When asked about how KixCare differs from numerous other virtual healthcare platforms, Warner said that KixCare is the only platform that is focused exclusively on pediatric health. He also noted that some other platforms have an out-of-pocket charge or require users to go through insurance, but that KixCare allows families to access the service for free through their provincial health cards.</p>
<p>In terms of the future, Warner said KixCare is looking to add more services and diagnostic tools, as the company aims to ensure that it can build an immersive and quality experience that meets the needs of children.</p>
<p>Additionally, Dr. Janaki Vallipuram, one of KixCare’s healthcare providers, told TechCrunch in an email that “the platform is needed now more than ever &#8211; when timely access to primary care is difficult due to the pandemic and emergency departments are seeing higher numbers of pediatric visits that do not necessarily need to be there.</p>
<p>“However, I believe that Kixcare has a role beyond just this pandemic and can continue to be a great addition to our existing healthcare model. I am thrilled to be part of a platform that is so impactful, and to be working with a team that has a great vision.”</p>
<p>KixCare was founded by a team of healthcare veterans, including Dr. Sheldon Elman, a family physician with over 45 years of experience in healthcare and who is also the founder and chairman of Persistence Capital Partners and Esplanade Ventures. Dr. Elman is joined by Dr. Harley Eisman, the chief medical officer of KixCare and the medical director of pediatric emergency services at Montreal Children’s Hospital with over 25 years of experience as a physician.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MX Player, the popular on-demand video streaming service, has passed 1 billion downloads, joining a very small but high-profile list of apps globally to achieve this milestone. The firm, owned by Indian conglomerate Times Internet, is the first from the world&#8217;s second largest market to make it to the group.</p>
<p>The app, which began its journey as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/times-internet-buys-mx-player-for-140m/">a local video playback player</a>, has grown immensely in the past two years as the startup populated the platform with thousands of local and international movies and shows and several original titles, it said, and also as people found themselves locked in their homes with newfound time because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>MX Players &#8212; which offers an ad-supported free app or those without ads for just $2.6 a year &#8212; has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/indias-mx-player-expands-to-us-uk-and-other-markets-in-international-push/">expanded to several international markets</a> including Bangladesh, Middle East, Southeast Asia, U.S. and the UK. (India is its most popular market.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216588" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.mxplayer.in">MX Player</a>&#8216;s page on the Google Play Store now <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad">reflects the 1 billion installs figure</a>, though the startup &#8212; whose vast majority of users are on Android &#8212; added that it also sees very considerable large volumes of downloads on several third-party stores. (It did not share figures for other stores.)</p>
<p>“We focused on two simple things: get the right content for the audience we have and get the product right for our users,” said Karan Bedi, chief executive of MX Player, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Bedi said the startup has made fast inroads in the market in part because very few players are producing content for the masses. Bedi, who previously ran Eros Now’s India business, pointed to the disconnect between the players and the audiences they are going after even as everyone appears to claim that they are attempting to win the entire country.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216612" style="width: 920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216612" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2216612 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg" alt="" width="910" height="1280" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg 910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg?resize=213,300 213w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg?resize=768,1080 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg?resize=483,680 483w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216612" class="wp-caption-text">Karan Bedi (Image credits: Times Internet)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When you look at the landscape, we have the broadcast players who are putting their broadcast content on OTT with some small investment in producing original shows. Then we have the international firms &#8212; Netflix and Amazon &#8212; that are focusing on the top 5% of the masses,” he said.</p>
<p>“If you look at the content we are going after, it’s very relatable to the broader audience,” he said.</p>
<p>Some of the original web shows MX Player has produced or exclusively licensed include Hello Mini, a thriller and romance story, Aashram, which is also in thriller and crime genres, and Flames, a teenage romance story. Citing an internal survey MX Player conducted with its users, Bedi said shows such as the &#8220;Indian Matchmaking,&#8221; which made a lot of buzz among Netflix users in India, didn&#8217;t find resonance with MX Player audience.</p>
<p>MX Player, which also operates the popular short-video app MX TakaTak, has also emerged as one of the most aggressive firms to innovate and adapt on product innovation. Its app also has in-app integration with music service Gaana, also owned by Times Internet, as well as offers several mini-games.</p>
<p>The app was the first among any popular video services to deploy support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versatile_Video_Coding">H.266 video codec</a>. The move has allowed the firm to reduce the amount of data users consume while streaming videos by more than half &#8212; while also improving the overall video quality.</p>
<p>Improvements like this are even more significant for firms such as MX Player, Bedi said, because of the audience it is serving. &#8220;For example, we have had clear measurement on the link between latency and engagement. The lower the latency, and we&#8217;re talking about seconds here, we have seen seven to eight percent bump in engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>India is one of the world&#8217;s fastest growing entertainment markets. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney&#8217;s Hotstar, and dozens of other international services are competing to win users in the country, which has over 700 million of them online.</p>
<p>According to research firm Sensor Tower, there are fewer than 20 apps (not including those from Google that ship pre-installed on Android devices) that have been downloaded or installed a billion times. The firm confirmed to TechCrunch in August that no other Indian app was even close to hitting the milestone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a <a href="https://aibusiness.com/author.asp?section_id=789&amp;doc_id=769626" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global semiconductor shortage</a>, an upstart in the world of AI chips is announcing a big round of funding to meet a boom in demand for its technology. <a href="https://hailo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hailo</a>, which makes edge-device chips customized to work with AI workloads &#8212; typical implementations include smart cities, retail environments, industrial settings and next-generation automotive systems &#8212; has raised $136 million in a Series C round of funding, one of the biggest to date in the AI chip market. We&#8217;ve confirmed with sources close to Hailo that the investment values it at around $1 billion.</p>
<p class="p1">Poalim Equity and Gil Agmon co-led the round, with participation also from previous backers Hailo Chairman Zohar Zisapel, ABB Technology Ventures (ATV), Latitude Ventures, OurCrowd; and new investors Carasso Motors, Comasco, Shlomo Group, Talcar Corporation Ltd., and Automotive Equipment (AEV). The company has now raised some $224 million to date.</p>
<p>This latest round comes about 18 months after Hailo&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/hailo-raises-60m-series-b-for-its-ai-chips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B of $60 million</a>, and about a year after the release of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/hailo-challenges-intel-and-google-with-its-new-ai-modules-for-edge-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s most recent AI modules</a> based on its Hailo 8 chip, intended to compete against the likes of Intel and Nvidia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216569" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Orr Danon, the co-founder and CEO, said in an interview that in the interim the company has been seeing a huge surge of interest in the market &#8212; in the last quarter alone, he said Hailo doubled the number of projects it&#8217;s working on to 100 &#8212; so this latest round is about scaling to meet that demand, but also to continue customizing how and where its processors can be used.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are now in the market with the Hailo 8, and people are very excited because of its efficiency,&#8221; he said. One unique aspect of Hailo&#8217;s edge chips is that they are designed to adapt to existing resources to work with custom neural networks, so not only are they fast but need less energy to run than the equivalent amount of processing power that you might otherwise need in a data center computer to run a similar task. &#8220;However, we want to expand our offering. It&#8217;s not a one size fits all, so we are also investing in software.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">The funding is coming on the heels of a complicated year in the world of chips, where the pandemic has alternative driven strong demand in some areas (for example in consumer environments, where users have been kickstarting the renewal cycle for better devices at a time when other activity has been limited); big drops in activity among others (eg, ambitious projects in areas like autonomous vehicles); and a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/were-in-a-hurry-a-new-ceo-scrambles-to-cope-with-a-global-chip-crisis-11633701630?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major slowdown</a> in production overall. For a company working in edge devices as Hailo is, that presents an opportunity to make the case for more efficient and cost effective systems, helped by the fact that it is able to integrate with users&#8217; own neural networks and preferred development frameworks such TensorFlow or ONNX.</p>
<p>Danon said that while Hailo has seen a softening in demand in some segments &#8212; for example, automotive &#8212; the diversity of its business has meant that demand overall has continued to rise. Even automotive is coming back after a particularly frothy period and some fallout as a result. So, for example, while the number of projects focused on fully-autonomous vehicles may have gone down, there are still a number of efforts working on semi-autonomous systems, which he said still translate into business for Hailo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Companies are now starting to look for realistic deployments, and facing real challenges,&#8221; he said. &#8221; Okay, maybe we do not need our self-driving cars to drive on the Autobahn, but we still need to learn new tasks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside this, he said the company is seeing a lot of strong interest from industrial customers, those in the retail industry (where edge devices are used for computer vision applications, such as those you might have in a security system, or in an automated check-out service, or for analytics), and in smart cities, where transportation will also continue to be a major driver of business. It&#8217;s for the opportunity ahead as much as for the current business that investors are backing the company.</p>
<p>“In the coming years, AI will become the defining feature for creating new business value and reshaping user experience as we know it. The ability to bring AI-based features to market will increasingly be the deciding factor over whether companies succeed or fail,” said Mooly Eden, who recently left Intel, where he worked for nearly 40 years and was most recently president of its operations in Israel, and is now on the board of Hailo. “Hailo’s innovative and hyper-efficient processor architecture addresses the growing demand for a new kind of chip to handle these new types of workloads, challenging traditional computing solutions.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211012005509/en/Rocket-Lab-Acquires-Space-Software-Company-Advanced-Solutions-Inc">acquiring</a> a Colorado-based space software company called Advanced Solutions, Inc (ASI) for $40 million, with as much as $5.5 million in additional performance-based earnouts also available based on the company&#8217;s 2021 calendar year performance. ASI&#8217;s expertise lies in flight software for spacecraft, including guidance, navigation and control (GNC) offerings, as well as mission simulation and test software. It&#8217;s meant to help Rocket Lab build out its Space Systems division and round out its efforts to become a true &#8216;end-to-end&#8217; space company.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab&#8217;s primary business since founding has been launch, where its own expertise in building and flying its Electron light lift rockets has given it a unique position in the emerging commercial launch market. The company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/rocket-lab-to-acquire-satellite-hardware-maker-sinclair-interplanetary/">acquired Sinclair Interplanetary last year</a>, which added key capabilities in terms of developing and producing spacecraft hardware components. ASI&#8217;s more than 20 years of experience in the field of space software, which has been used for multiple orbital and interplanetary missions, help Rocket Lab bolster that aspect of the service offerings it can make available to customers in terms of not only launching missions, but also planning, testing and operating them as well.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, the ASI team will remain in Colorado and continue to be run by the firm&#8217;s founder and CEO Jon Cuseo, and it will maintain its relationships with existing customers. This also allows Rocket Lab to set up shop and grow its team in the Colorado area, which is a hotbed of both public and private space industry activity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216587" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has invested in Bangalore-based Open, becoming the latest high-profile investor to back a neobanking platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://open.money">Open</a> said on Tuesday it has raised $100 million in a Series C financing round. Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek led the round, and Google and Japan&#8217;s SBI Investment (not to be confused with SoftBank or India&#8217;s SBI bank) as well as existing investors Tiger Global and 3one4 Capital participated in it.</p>
<p>The new round, which brings the four-year-old startup’s all-time raise to $137 million, values Open at $500 million, according to a source familiar with the matter. TechCrunch reported in June that Open was in talks with Temasek and Google among others to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/temasek-and-general-atlantic-in-talks-to-back-indian-neobank-open/">raise $100 million</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216570" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Another round is already in the works and investors such as Visa are likely to join, another source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Open <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/indias-open-neo-bank-raises-30-million-to-help-businesses-automate-their-finances/">operates a neo-bank</a> that offers small and medium-sized businesses as well as enterprises nearly all the features of the bank with additional tools to serve the needs of a business. Millions of small and medium sized businesses in India struggle with maintaining multiple bank accounts, bookkeeping of their daily spending, and bandying out payments to employees.</p>
<p>The startup, which has partnerships with over a dozen top banks in India, says more than 2 million businesses are using its platform.</p>
<p>In recent quarters, Open has expanded its offerings. The startup now provides its neobanking technology to banks in a white-label licensing arrangement, who then sell it to their customers, said Anish Achuthan, founder and chief executive of Open, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are helping banks build their own new-age digital banking platforms,” he said. The startup is now also helping other fintech startups to build their embedded finance or other fintech solutions, he said.</p>
<p>“We realized that we have the infrastructure required to help other fintech businesses build their own card issuance and other digital bank services,” he said. Open calls this part of its business offering Zwitch.</p>

Data: RBI, Jefferies. Image credits: Jefferies</p></div></p>
<p>The growth of Open in recent years, which has led to several other startups expand to and innovate in this category, has dramatically changed the relationship between banks and fintechs. Just a few years ago, most banks in India were skeptical of neobanks and it was very difficult to persuade any of them for a partnership, fintech founders have told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neobanks are gaining prominence as platforms to digitise banking or bank-like services for millennials and SMEs. Top-4 global neobanks are worth $100 billion and Indian fintechs have made a start through likes of Open, RazorpayX, Fi, and Jupiter,” wrote analysts at Jefferies in a report last month.</p>
<p>“In fact, many Indian fintechs plan to expand from 1-2 platforms now to neobank over 3-5 years. Incumbent banks/NBFCs are partnering with them. Monetisation is some time away,” they added.</p>
<p>That last part is still a big question for the industry. At a virtual conference last year organized by Razorpay, Pine Labs chief executive Amrish Rau jokingly commented that between him and CRED founder Kunal Shah, they have backed every neobanking startup in the country in the hopes that these firms will figure out a way to make money in this category someday.</p>
<p>“The challenge here [for neobanks aimed at millennials] is that payment fees are negligible in India, BNPL is still small and mostly gets non-prime clients. Quality of relationship and leveraging of partnerships for cross-sell will drive success. On the other hand, SME-focussed neobanks are building engagement with business- clients through their ability to provide solutions like automated invoicing, collections/payments, accounting, inventory and sales mgt., taxes and in some cases interest on current deposits as well (banks can&#8217;t pay interest). This may help to ramp- up and upfront their monetisation prospects,” Jefferies analysts wrote.</p>
<p>Open, which employs about 500 people, said that it plans to deploy the capital to broaden its offerings and also expand to international markets such as Southeast Asia, Europe, and the U.S. The startup will begin its expansion with the Southeast Asian market, said Achuthan. “We have already partnered with one bank in Vietnam and one in the Philippines,” he said. “There the entry point is the enterprise business.”</p>
<p>The startup is also eyeing strategic merger and acquisitions opportunities in India and other markets and is looking to hire more talent, he said.</p>
<p>“The team at Open have combined deep domain expertise and product-focused rigor to deploy a full-stack solution that places SMEs at the center of a universe of innovation. This platform has set the standard for business banking and will take this full stack approach into new adjacencies and geographies. We are excited to continue our partnership as Open scales into a global fintech innovation engine,” said Pranav Pai, Founding Partner and CIO at 3one4 Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>Open is the latest of a series of investments by Google in India in the past one year. The company, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">committed to invest $10 billion in the next couple of years</a>, has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">backed Indian startups Glance and DailyHunt</a>. YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/youtube-acquires-indian-social-commerce-startup-simsim/">acquired social commerce startup SimSim</a> in July this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/2150-launches-with-281m-fund-to-reduce-the-carbon-footprint-of-the-worlds-growing-cities/">in February</a> new European VC <a href="http://2150.vc">2150</a> launched the first $240 million close of its fund to back technologies reducing carbon emissions via the medium of cities, which pump out CO2 at a prodigious rate as they develop and grow.</p>
<p>This ‘Urban Sustainability Technology Fund’, as it’s dubbed, is now announcing the final close of its fund at $312 million, showing that LPs have an increasing appetite for this subject. Plus, the fund says it was 33% oversubscribed.</p>
<p>The new investors including Credit Suisse and a client advised by AIMS Imprint of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the Norwegian sovereign climate investment company, Nysnø as well as the BMW Foundation and Woven Capital, the investment arm of Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Group.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216503" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Key to all this is 2150’s obsession with the built environment because the equation is simple: countries are not going to stop developing cities, even with the Climate Crisis now going at full throttle. So developing technologies that will mitigate or even draw down the resulting CO2 emissions, is key.</p>
<p>Thus, 2150 has made several investments since launching, in startups like CarbonCure Technologies, which lowers the CO2 footprint of concrete. It is these kinds of investments that have led the fund to claim that the total footprint of real estate developed, built, or managed by its investor base has more than tripled to 430 million square feet or 25 times the size of Canary Wharf in London.</p>
<p>Other investments include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/tracking-co2-emissions-for-supply-chains-leads-normative-to-a-e10m-fund-raise/">Normative</a>, which Tracks the full carbon footprint of supply chains and which this month raised €10 million in a round led partly by 2150.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VOp9MlN1fP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/tracking-co2-emissions-for-supply-chains-leads-normative-to-a-e10m-fund-raise/">Tracking CO2 emissions for supply chains leads Normative to a €10M fund raise</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tracking CO2 emissions for supply chains leads Normative to a €10M fund raise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/tracking-co2-emissions-for-supply-chains-leads-normative-to-a-e10m-fund-raise/embed/#?secret=VOp9MlN1fP" data-secret="VOp9MlN1fP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Another 2150 company is Aeroseal (which produces a gum that seals air ducts and building envelopes thereby significantly increases their energy efficiency), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/nodes-links-raises-11m-to-maybe-save-billions-on-the-big-projects-the-world-needs-now/">Nodes &amp; Links</a> (which has a software platform to make infrastructure projects run to time, saving energy) which raised an $11 million Series A. They&#8217;ve also invested into <a href="https://www.ampd.energy/">Ampd Energy</a> which is a company that can decarbonize construction sites by powering cranes with a battery driven generator.</p>
<p>2150 claims this portfolio to date could mitigate over 1.6 Gigatonnes of CO2, or more than the annual emissions from Germany, UK, France combined. To put that in context, we are emitting 51 Gigatonnes of CO2 annually, so we need to save 18 to 32GT annually if we are to avoid 1.5 Degrees warming.</p>
<p>The theory is that if 2150 or any other number of VCs can scale their investments to achieve these kinds of numbers, then we may have enough moonshot projects to be able to alleviate the worst effects of Climate Change. Of course, that is not a given but it might just be possible.</p>
<p>If that’s the case then thinkers like George Monbiot may have to revise their theory that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/29/green-growth-economic-activity-environment">Green Growth doesn’t exist</a>.<br />
 <br />
Christian Jølck, Partner and co-founder at 2150, said: “At 2150 we want to become a significant contributor to reaching The Paris Agreement and focus on the urban environment, which represents 70% of GHG emissions. We seek not only to be an investor, but also a facilitator of urban transformation through our platform with strategic investors.”</p>
<p>Over a call, 2150 Partner Christian Hernandez said about the raise: “We were targeting 200 million Euros which was already ambitious, and then, things took off in a good way. We raised one of the largest climate tech funds in Europe. And it came from, big money, like, Credit Suisse clients of Goldman Sachs, and some of the world&#8217;s largest sovereign funds.”</p>
<p>What does he think is attracting these large LPs?</p>
<p>“One is a platform that could absorb an institutional-sized check. And the fact that we are focused on this built world which is a vertical, but it&#8217;s a massive vertical. And as one LP said to me ‘You know we&#8217;ve done our energy funds, we&#8217;ve done our Foodtech funds we&#8217;ve been looking for an institutional-grade built-world Fund,” he said.</p>
<p>Hernandez added that the fund is now looking at heating and cooling: “Everybody focuses on heating but cooling consumes more energy and it&#8217;s going to grow as more people around the world need to stay cool just to survive, not to just to stay comfortable. We&#8217;re also looking at waste, both how to minimise waste but also how to decompose it. And, and we&#8217;re looking at new materials: how can you use nature or synthetic biology or other technologies to actually create more sustainable materials.”</p>
<p>He also made the point that Carbon Offsetting isn’t a solution right now as the price fluctuates wildly and is still fairly opaque. It, therefore, makes sense to tackle the CO2 problem not with offsetting but with the built environment.</p>
<p>The context of this 2150 raise is that climate is gradually out-pacing VC investment, even into AI. Despite representing 6% of the venture capital market, the amount invested in climate tech startups increased from $418m in 2013 to $16.3bn in 2019, according to a report from PwC last year. This was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/new-report-finds-vc-investment-into-climatetech-growing-five-times-faster-than-overall-vc/">three times the rate of increase</a> in investment in artificial intelligence over the same period.</p>
<p>Hernandez is also keen to ingrain the climate values into company and team behavior: “We do our own carbon accounting for the fund itself, we offset our own carbon footprint. We each have made individual commitments of what actions we&#8217;re going to take. Mine is to eat less meat, so I&#8217;m pretty much down to like once a week now &#8211; I can&#8217;t have a steak dinner anymore, my body&#8217;s not used to it. How were trying to take micro-actions as well as macro actions with the fund &#8211; I think both need to exist to be part of the culture of the team.”</p>
<p>2150 also announced that it had qualified for a Diversity VC ranking of ‘Level One’, the highest: “We are already a diverse team, and that&#8217;s going to continue, and it&#8217;s very much part of the type of team we want to build. So we&#8217;ll have some news later in the year of how we&#8217;re building out the team.”</p>
<p>2150 is anchored by Northern European real estate private equity platform NREP as well as anchored by Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker, Novo Holdings, and Denmark’s Green Future Fund in February of this year. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virtual became the norm for physical gatherings at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, and now, as many jet back into in-person meetings, some believe that the online version, at least in some form, is here to stay &#8212; sometimes for the better, but sometimes for the worse. Today, a startup called <a href="https://hubilo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubilo</a> that&#8217;s building what it believes is a more engaging take on the medium, is announcing a big funding round to double down on its ambitions. The startup has raised $125 million that it will use to continue expanding its platform and the company.</p>
<p>Alkeon Capital led the round, with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Balderton Capital. This Series B is a huge financial leap for Hubilo. Prior to this, the company &#8212; headquartered in San Francisco, but grown out of India &#8212; had raised just $28 million in six years (with $23.5 million of that raised in a Series A only <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/hubilo-raises-ps17m-to-redefine-the-future-of-events-893451967.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven months ago</a>, also during the pandemic). It is not disclosing valuation.</p>
<p>Virtual events &#8212; be they large conferences, company meetings, one-on-one or small group conversations, or dinner parties and quiz nights &#8212; have been a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/video-conferencing-market-size-to-reach-9-95-billion-by-2028--remote-working-policies-adopted-due-to-the-covid-pandemic-to-act-as-key-driver-grand-view-research-inc-301308774.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge business in this period of Covid-19</a>, where they became a key way for people to connect when in-person meetings were impossible. In working world, they became a significant cornerstone for communication, with businesses sinking some <a href="https://insights.eventscouncil.org/Full-Article/ArtMID/398/ArticleID/1445/2018-Global-Economic-Significance-of-Business-Events">one trillion dollars</a> of direct spending on events, according to Guru Chahal, the partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners who invests in Hubilo. &#8220;These changes are permanent,&#8221; he added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216280" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Videoconferencing brands like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/zoom-looks-beyond-video-conferencing-as-triple-digit-2020-growth-begins-to-slow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoom</a>; those focused on virtual events like <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210805005315/en/Hopin-Raises-450-Million-to-Accelerate-Platform-Expansion-and-Continue-to-Build-the-Future-of-Experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopin</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/touchcast-raises-55m-to-grow-its-ar-based-virtual-event-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TouchCast</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/bizzabo-raises-138m-for-a-platform-that-helps-you-build-and-run-virtual-conferences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bizzabo</a>; and those building tech to improve how videoconferencing can be used like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/engageli-nabs-33m-more-for-its-collaborative-video-based-teaching-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engageli</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/mmhmm-raises-100m-which-is-a-fun-thing-to-say-to-people-who-dont-follow-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mmhmm</a> all saw their stars rise. Even those you might not associate with virtual events but are aiming to do more in the space <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/linkedin-is-testing-a-new-paid-ticketed-events-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like LinkedIn</a> are now getting in on the act.</p>
<p>Hubilo has been among them. The company now has more than 800 customers, big names like Walmart, Blackboard, the United Nations, Roche Pharma, AB inBev, Verizon, Facebook and TikTok. Yes, that&#8217;s right. A communications giant, &#8216;the&#8217; social network and a massively popular video app sensation are all customers of this particular video product that has built and squared away another kind of engaging video experience.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s particular sweet spot has been helping these organizations plan and run internal and external meetings and events, whether they are private meetings for a few colleagues or external conferences for thousands, giving them the tools to create a customized design and architecture to the event (important when you have multiple tracks) and to tailor a wide set of interactive features to connect with those &#8220;visiting&#8221; the events, and for those visitors to connect with each other. And to do this easily and regularly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little like a Wix or WordPress for virtual events. Which is interesting because WordPress is also one of its customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s an epic pivot for a startup that was, in early 2020, staring into a deadpool. Founded originally to build engagement apps for in-person events, Hubilo really went to town on that concept as a boostrapped startup, with a dashboard that gave exhibition organizers more than 50 different engagement features such as leaderboards, quizzes, collaboration tools, messaging, &#8220;matchmaking&#8221; for networking and more. It was being used by events that had up to 10,000 attendees, where organizers leaned on these to keep people from being bored.</p>
<p>That business, however, completely dried up when people stopped going to such gatherings.</p>
<p>So in February 2020, Vaibhav Jain, the CEO and founder, went for the Hail Mary option. He gave his team just a small amount of time &#8212; 26 days &#8212; to try to come up with a new direction for the company, ideally one that didn&#8217;t require massive capital investment, since that was exactly what it didn&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>The solution was the first version of the Hubilo that you see today. Ironically, having so little cash on hand and a very short time frame to work in made the team very resourceful: the engagement tools that it had already built for physical experiences became the centerpiece of how Hubilo would build its own take on videoconferencing.</p>
<p>Jain told me in an interview that these are some of the features that he believes helps set Hubilo&#8217;s own contribution to the world of video meetings apart from the rest of the pack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have strong engagement features built in the cloud, with a gamification model and analytics to give users insights about how sessions are being watched, we can give visitors certifications to watch a particular session [but not another],&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have gone deep into it. Exhibitors also get, basically, a mini CRM to build leads, their own set of leads, out of an event.&#8221; Organizers can also integrate with lots of other non-mini CRMs like Marketo, Salesforce and Hubspot to supercharge how they, and their interact with people and how people interact with each other, within their virtual events.</p>
<p>All of Hubilo&#8217;s initial focus on in-person events was not for naught, however. Now with many people shifting back into the office, back into lunch meetings, back into conferences in faraway cities and the rest, the company is building out a bigger &#8220;<a href="https://hubilo.com/hybrid-event-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hybrid</a>&#8221; set of features, which bring a lot of its earlier learnings back into the mix.</p>
<p>These now sit alongside the virtual tools to create both more dynamic in-person experiences, as well as a complementary virtual component for those who are not physically there. These include not just video streams of stages, but separate communication tools for those in both &#8220;places&#8221; to converge; virtual and on-stage conference tracks alongside each other, and more.</p>
<p>The opportunities for serving the market in a firmly hybrid environment with a platform that gives organizers a new kind of dynamic control over the experience is reminiscent of the technology that helped push the web into the busy and much-used platform that it is today: there are tools being put into the hands of publishers (in this case event organizers) helps to spur the next stages of what gets created and used. That, along with the strong list of customers, helped propel this round of funding, which Jain told me was oversubscribed.</p>
<p>“We believe strongly that the global distributed workforce is a megatrend that will impact all of us in the future. It is clear that the way we collaborate and connect will need to be rearchitected in order for any global player to succeed,” said Abhi Arun, Managing Partner at Alkeon Capital, in a statement. “In Hubilo, we saw a powerful technology capable of connecting the offline and online worlds, a strong CEO, and an amazing market opportunity that gave us the confidence to invest.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Depression and anxiety were taking a serious toll on peoples&#8217; well-being even before COVID-19, and the pandemic prompted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more interest (and venture capital) </a>in mental health startups. While many of the highest profile mental health startups, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calm</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/headspace-and-ginger-are-merging-to-form-headspace-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Headspace Health</a>, are based in the United States, more attention is also being paid to emotional wellness around the world. In Southeast Asia, for example, a <a href="https://biospectrumasia.com/opinion/30/18823/changing-face-of-mental-health-assistance-in-asia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing list of startups</a> is increasing access to mental healthcare and support. One of them, <a href="https://www.thoughtfull.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThoughtFull</a>, announced today it has raised $1.1 million USD in seed funding, which it says one of the largest seed rounds raised by a digital mental health startup in Southeast Asia so far.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, ThoughtFull’s ThoughtFullChat app connects users to mental health professionals for coaching sessions or therapy, and also has self-guided tools. The startup’s app for mental health professionals, called ThoughtFullCare Pro, enables them to manage and scale their online practices. ThoughtFullChat is available for download through the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/thoughtfullchat-mental-health/id1511373922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=world.thoughtfull.user" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>, or through insurers and employee benefit programs.</p>
<p>Investors in its seed round include The Hive SEA, Boston-based Flybridge and Vulpes Investment Management, along with family offices and angel investors in the Asia Pacific region.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216559" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before launching ThoughtFull, founder and chief executive officer Joan Low was an investment banker, including six years at J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong. Low told TechCrunch in an email that she felt compelled to leave finance after observing how difficult it was to access mental healthcare in Southeast Asia, compared to “the breakneck speed of digital mental health innovations happening places such as the U.S. and Europe where I have spent time living, working and studying.”</p>
<p>ThoughtFull’s main operating markets are Singapore and Malaysia, but it now has users in 43 countries. Its app, which launched in 2020, is available in five languages: English, Bahasa Malaysia, Bahasa Indonesia, Mandarin and Cantonese, along with coaches who are also fluent in Tamil, Thai, Vietnamese and Tagalog.</p>
<p>Low said ThoughtFull works closely with local healthcare systems to ensure that its services are tailored to each market. For example, it will partner with The Hive Southeast Asia and Penjana Capital, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance, to digitize the country’s mental health ecosystem after the pandemic made access to care, including in-person consultations, more difficult.</p>
<p>“Healthcare systems are inherently complex given the various stakeholders, structures and outcomes that are involved. That said, healthcare in Asia is particularly intricate because of the diversity in not just culture, but also systems—from care delivery to payor and research models,” said Low. “This is why you see less of the foreign players coming into Asian healthcare in a big way as barriers to entry are high.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

Low said ThoughtFull differentiates from other mental health startups by focusing on end-to-end services, giving its users personalized preventative and curative options and creating “an entirely closed feedback loop for better quality mental healthcare delivery.”</p>
<p>ThoughtFull’s seed round will be used for product development, including deep tech developments and clinical research.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fount.co/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fount</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a robo-advisor startup in South Korea, has raised a $33.4 million Series C round to beef up its machine learning-based platform development and hire staff. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p>The latest round was led by Hana Financial Investment, along with Nice Investment. Returning backers Smilegate Investment, KT Investment, Shinhan Capital and Korea Development Bank also participated.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Series C brings its total funding to about $58.5 million, and the company’s valuation is now estimated at $209 billion, CEO Youngbeen Kim told TechCrunch. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215994" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company will continue to invest in its technology development for the next three years, about an additional $85 million (100 billion won), Kim added.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Founded in November 2015 by Kim, Fount launched its first beta robo-advisor service in February 2016. The following month, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jim-rogers-6">Jim Rogers</a>, an advisor of Fount, invested in the company. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After gaining regulatory approvals for advising investment in November 2017, Fount launched its mobile app in June 2018. </span></p>
<p>The pandemic spurred the trend that people set up an emergency fund or create an investment portfolio to grow their wealth and save for retirement through contactless investment services such as robo-advisers. South Korea&#8217;s three robo-adviser startups, including Fount, exceeded a total of $1 billion in assets under management in January 2021, up 402.9% year on year, based on a local media <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210117000248">report</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fount surpassed $730 million assets under management as of March 2021. As per its press release, its core market is people aged 20-49, including about 66.8% of millennials. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its AI-powered platform invests on users’ behalf by using algorithms and data for people who know they need to invest money to grow their wealth but don’t know much about investing. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fount’s AI-based BlueWhale product analyzes more than 52,000 cases of global economic data and market indices and automatically proposes a customized and diversified portfolio that it can later rebalance as necessary. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company offers its robo-advisor service to approximately 20 South Korea-based B2B clients, including the lead investor Hana Financial investment, Samsung Life Insurance, MetLife and Hyundai Motor Securities. The company is in talks with additional financial companies for having partnerships. It also claims that it has 260,000 registered users as of June 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Global robo-advisors assets under management are projected to increase to $2.8 trillion in 2025 from $1.37 trillion in 2021, based on its statement citing <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/fintech/digital-investment/robo-advisors/worldwide?currency=usd">Statista report</a>. South Korean robo-advisors’ assets under management are expected to grow up to $25 billion in 2025 from $8.36 billion in 2021. </span></p>
<p>When asked about overseas expansions, Kim said it focuses on the home market now and does not have a concrete plan for global penetration.</p>
