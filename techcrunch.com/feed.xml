										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many things have accelerated in the world of fintech over the past year, not the least of which is the trend of digital banks aimed at specific communities in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few months alone, a number of neobanks targeting the Black and Latinx communities have emerged. Most recently, we covered </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/first-boulevard-raises-5m-for-its-digital-bank-aimed-at-black-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the $5 million raise </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of one such bank &#8212; First Boulevard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Cheese announced the launch of its digital banking platform that is aimed at primarily serving the Asian-American community. Co-founder and CEO Ken Lian came to the United States from China in 2008 to attend college. In the years after his move, Lian said he paid thousands of dollars in bank fees and got rejected “multiple times” for basic bank accounts, despite having a FICO score over 800.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those experiences led him to come up with the concept behind Cheese, which he said will offer its banking services via a multi-language platform. The one-year-old startup also has a social component, giving customers a way to support Asian-American businesses and organizations. Lian is no stranger to the world of entrepreneurship, having also founded Moolah Science, a startup that helped consumers find out if online stores owed them a refund that got acquired by a Fortune 500 company in 2019.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lian founded Cheese along with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhen Wang and Qingyi Li</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under the premise that Asian-Americans are often subject to discrimination and “an unequal playing field” in America despite being among the <a href="https://prosperitynow.org/blog/racial-wealth-snapshot-asian-americans">most educated</a> in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand Asian users much better than anybody else because we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the user,” Lian told TechCrunch. “[Traditional] banking didn’t understand me or my culture or my lifestyle or what matters to me. Our needs are different.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of challenger banks also never focused on Asian communities and immigrants,” he added. “We want to provide a great product to welcome these people to the U.S. and make it easy for them to bank.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, Cheese has raised a total of $3.6 million in funding from investors such as iFly.vc; Amplify; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Nash, former CEO of </span><a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wealthfront</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff and VC firms Wedbush Ventures, Idealab and Operate Venture Studio.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The startup has also partnered with actor </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jfwong?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jimmy Wong</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an advocate for Asian rights. He will serve as Cheese’s chief community ambassador.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheese’s platform provides a debit Mastercard (issued by Coastal Community Bank), which is available to those with no credit history. (If this sounds familiar, it’s a similar offering as that of TomoCredit, a startup that recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tomocredit-raises-7m-to-help-people-with-cash-but-little-to-no-credit-history/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $7 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to scale its debit card product for those with little or no credit history.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheese cardholders can use the virtual cards instantly through their mobile wallets, the company said. Other features include offering advance pay up to two days early with direct deposit, a 3% deposit bonus for referring friends, 0.3% annual percentage yield (APY) and up to 10% cash back on purchases at more than10,000 merchants. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanshen/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Han Shen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founding partner of iFly, believes Cheese can help the underbanked community in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t necessarily get the same kind of service or product for their banking needs and they face all kinds of pain points,” he wrote. “Cheese has a list of products they want to develop for that type of customer&#8230;We know there is a product market fit based on our research and we know this is a strong team.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment marks iFly’s first in the consumer fintech space in which it acted as a lead investor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were already determined to invest on the mission side. They wanted to make things easier and better for the underbanked, including immigrants,” Shen continued. “People deserve a better service. In Cheese’s case, the question is not whether or not to provide it, the question is about how to do it right to address their pain points.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with its launch, Cheese has pledged $100,000 to the Cheese Giveback Fund, 100% of which will be donated to nonprofits and community service programs in support of Asian neighborhoods and businesses impacted by violence and economic hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Growth for Facebook is coming from the developing world, and so the social network today made another key move to cater better to consumers in those countries. After nearly three years in the planning, Facebook is taking the plunge today and officially launching <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.lite&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Lite</a>, a less data- and storage-intensive Android-only version of one of its popular photo and video app, which will take up just 2MB on a phone and is going live in 170 countries, with a focus on emerging markets, today.</p>
<p>Instagram Lite is <a href="https://tech.fb.com/instagram-lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching</a> with all the basic bells and whistles around editing, sharing and viewing photos and videos, as well as the ability to add stickers, create and view Stories, IGTV and the Explore discovery and recommendation algorithms. And given the launch across 170 countries, it&#8217;s coming with specific language support to be usable in those markets.</p>
<p>But to whittle down the experience from the 30MB that full-fat Instagram takes up on iOS and Android devices (and countless MB of mobile data usage), it&#8217;s launching without some things, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Namely, the developers have left out many graphics; they haven&#8217;t included advertising; and it&#8217;s missing some key features like dark mode, Shopping, and end-to-end encryption. (Notably, encryption was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messenger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> being worked on for the main app in 2019, but it has yet to launch). Nor are there iOS or feature phone versions of the app in the works.</p>
<p>Facebook said that some of that list &#8212; such as dark mode, and (of course) adverts &#8212; will be added in future updates.</p>
<p>Instagram Lite has been teased out in different forms by Facebook <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/instagram-lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2018</a>, and it&#8217;s hitting what has proven to be a receptive market for the social media giant. Tzach Hadar, Tel Aviv-based director of product management for all of Facebook&#8217;s Lite apps &#8212; which also include versions of Facebook and Messenger, also built in Tel Aviv &#8212; said this week that <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.lite&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Lite</a> now has more than 200 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just a fraction of the <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/FB-Earnings-Presentation-Q4-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions that use Facebook itself</a>, but represents a key way of targeting those newer to Facebook or those who might not otherwise be using the app because of financial or bandwidth constraints.</p>
<p>But although Instagram is wildly popular and would have been an obvious candidate for the Lite treatment years ago, and Instagram Lite was one of the most requested items from users in developing markets, it has proven to be trickier beast.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not just because the app focuses on images and videos, which by their nature use up more bandwidth and data; but because over the years Instagram has become increasingly laden with features: those aimed at enhancing the user experience; those aimed at competing better with other apps (hello, Stories); and those to extend monetization opportunities for Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instagram offered another kind of unique challenge for us to deliver under the same constraints the same experience,&#8221; said Nick Brown, a product manager based out of New York (the app was co-developed across Facebook&#8217;s Tel Aviv and NYC offices and &#8212; presumably, given the year we&#8217;ve had &#8212; across many Facebook employees&#8217; homes). &#8220;The philosophy is really that we want to bring all of Instagram to these users.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123482" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123482" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123482" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg 3242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=2048,1364 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123482" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Indeed, as with other Lite versions of apps like Facebook and Messenger, Instagram Lite is geared towards consumers in emerging economies, where smartphones are most likely to be Android-based and less likely to be top-of-the-range devices; consumers are more likely to be more price- and bandwidth-sensitive when it comes to using mobile data; and a substantial proportion are still only now getting to grips with being online.</p>
<p>Facebook notes <a href="https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that show 65% of emerging market populations are online versus 90% in North America, which is one reason why the company focuses so squarely on serving those users: they represent growth at a time when growth has slowed down, or become significantly more competitive against newer entrants, in its more mature markets like the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>However, building for the demands of developing markets can often, by their nature, run counter to the concept of building in ever more features as you might otherwise see with highly competitive consumer apps.</p>
<p>The Instagram Lite app had some fits and starts over the years, with the first version, built on React Native, launching in a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/instagram-lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited release back in 2018</a>, taking up a mere 573kb of space on a device. It also came without a lot of features, but Instagram itself had less features, too. While it was never explained why, that version was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/instagram-lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quietly pulled last year</a>, and then shortly after a newer version was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-launches-new-instagram-lite-app-in-india-global-rollout-to-follow-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched again in December in a limited test</a>. Debuted first in India, a key market for the company, Instagram Lite launched there with support for Bangla, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s that last test that has turned into the official Instagram Lite app. Interestingly, it turns out that in the process, the whole app was rebuilt, moving it away from Facebook&#8217;s own React Native framework and building it instead on an internal framework called Bloks (not to be confused with <a href="http://bloks.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloks</a>), heavy lifting a lot of the basic workings from Messenger and Facebook&#8217;s Lite versions. I&#8217;ve asked for more detail about this, and I wonder if it&#8217;s related to <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2020/03/02/data-infrastructure/messenger/">LightSpeed</a>, which was a development shift that saw a lighter and new version of Messenger get released last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bloks is a framework that is much more performant and has more features and capabilities, and this new Instagram light application is built upon it,&#8221; said Hadar. &#8220;So it&#8217;s like a new app altogether.&#8221; It&#8217;s not clear what exactly happened behind the scenes leading to the previous app getting pulled, but it seems that in any case the foundations now give the company more room for expanding the service (even while bumping up the app size from under 600kb to 2MB).</p>
<p>That fact might matter less to users, but does point to some notable trends at the company itself and how it&#8217;s approaching tech in the future, and viewing feature parity between full and Lite versions of its flagship apps.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the second fund for the nine-year-old Mauritius-headquartered investment firm. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has secured a first close led by <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/region__ext_content/IFC_External_Corporate_Site/Sub-Saharan+Africa">International Finance Corporation</a> (IFC) with participation from the <a href="https://we-fi.org/">Women’s Finance Initiative</a> (WeFi)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US investor Tim Draper via his VC fund, Draper Associates and Visa Forsten, co-founder of Tencent-owned Supercell, are other notable investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with TechCrunch, Alliy said the firm has invested in seven startups already with the first close, which indicates effort on their part that would help close the rest of the fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We raised from some angel investors, high net worth individuals, so when we the official fund launched, we rolled these select companies into the fund,&#8221; Alliy said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you can show that you already have investments you&#8217;ve made with your own money, it&#8217;s easier to raise from institutional investors, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we&#8217;re on that path</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These seven startups cut across the firm&#8217;s focus areas, including fintech, edtech, logistics and e-commerce, SaaS, healthtech, and agritech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disclosed investments include South African agritech Aerobotics and car subscription FlexClub, Ethiopian healthtech Orbit Health and Kenyan-based Safigen, Moringa School and Ando Foods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm has a presence in Kenya, South African and Tanzania, but its core markets remain Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The managing partner says Savannah is big on startups that can scale across regions in Africa &#8212; Rwanda, Ethiopia, Uganda in East Africa; Ivory Coast and Ghana in West Africa; and globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is typical of some of the startups in its portfolio &#8212; Aerobotics recently expanded to the US, Sendy is an established East African player, and FlexClub operates in Mexico</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know it might sound cliche, but we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want founders in our portfolio to think big enough, and we will help them get there,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm has doubled the ticket size from its first fund to $50,000 to $1 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund plans to invest as low as $50,000 at the pre-seed, but typical first check sizes will be between $150,000 to 250,000. Follow up rounds that will likely involve larger amounts will depend on the firm&#8217;s position as a lead investor or not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Savannah Fund&#8217;s portfolio raised $118 million across Series A, B and C, with some operating in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. With this new fund, Alliy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said the firm is looking to perform better this year and increase its portfolio from 30 to 50 in the foreseeable future. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm also acknowledges the role its backer &#8212; WeFi &#8212; will be playing in increasing these numbers, especially those led by female founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Entrepreneurs in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EIRs), especially female founders, are a key part of our investment strategy as we have seen with the success of Moringa School, Safigen and Sendy &#8211; all 3 of which have women founders/CEOs who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked with Savannah as EIRs, Associates &amp; Interns</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re proud to partner with WeFi to further expand and encourage female founders on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even during a pandemic, we held 3 internships in 2020, some virtual and some in-person in Kenya and Tanzania,&#8221; the statement read</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Lead investor IFC confirmed the news with TechCrunch. According to its statement, the World Bank Group member invested $3 million while We-Fi cut a $500,000 check for the fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early-stage funding is vital to enable more of Africa&#8217;s emerging and growing tech founders to grow their business and fuel the transformation of Africa&#8217;s internet economy. By partnering with Savannah Fund, we can help more entrepreneurs to access funding,&#8221; said Kevin Njiraini, IFC regional director for Southern Africa and Nigeria.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Miami-based cybersecurity startup Lumu today announced the closing of its $7.5 million Series A. The round was co-led by SoftBank Group Corp.’s SB Opportunity Fund and Panoramic Ventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://lumu.io/">Lumu</a>, co-founded and headed by Colombian native Ricardo Villadiego, offers a cloud-based service that helps companies continually scan and react to data compromises in real time. The company collects and standardizes metadata from across the network, including DNS queries, network traffic, access logs from perimeter proxies, firewalls and spam box filters, then applies AI to correlate threat intelligence from these disparate data sources to isolate confirmed points of compromise.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123377" style="width: 402px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123377" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2123377" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png" alt="" width="392" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png 961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png?resize=122,150 122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png?resize=243,300 243w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png?resize=768,948 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png?resize=551,680 551w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123377" class="wp-caption-text">Lumu CEO Ricardo Villadiego. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lumu</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Villadiego described it in lay terms: “If you’re speaking with a bad guy, there’s no good that’s going to come from that. So we apply the same idea with cybersecurity. If your phone or your laptop is talking to an adversary, you don’t really need to understand what the conversation is about,” he said. What you do need to do, he says, is shut it down and prevent it from happening again.</p>
<p>He explained that Lumu not only helps companies prevent breaches but also allows them to automate their responses.</p>
<p>Lumu launched in February 2020 at the RSA cybersecurity conference in San Francisco, and already has 1,300 enterprise customers and targets small to large corporations. In just over 12 months, the company said it has analyzed more than 55 billion metadata records and detected more than 11 million adversarial contacts.</p>
<p>Villadiego was born and raised in the colonial port town of Cartagena, Colombia. With a degree in electrical engineering, he found his passion for cybersecurity while working at Unisys, which, through its cybersecurity excellence program, is how he ended up in the United States.</p>
<p>During his time at Unisys — and later at IBM — he said he was exposed to merger and acquisition deals, motivating him to start his own business. He founded his first cybersecurity company, Easy Solutions, in Miami in 2009, focused on preventing fraud. Easy Solutions caught the eye of tech heavyweight — and Miami local — Manny Medina of the eponymous Medina Capital, who invested in the company&#8217;s first round.</p>
<p>“I told him we were looking to raise $5 million and he said, &#8216;I’m in, but it has to be $10 million,&#8217;” Villadiego told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The two eventually agreed on $11 million, and about a decade later Medina’s own company — Cyxtera — bought Easy Solutions for an undisclosed sum. Cyxtera announced last month that it’s going public at a $3.4 billion valuation through a merger with a SPAC.</p>
<p>Villadiego said Lumu, which has 35 full-time employees, will use the funds to fuel growth in the United States.</p>
<p>“In the U.S., I understand all the issues that we have — especially with diversity — but if you work hard, you have the chance to change your story,&#8221; said Villadiego. &#8220;At the end of the day, you have to build a business. The hardest part for any entrepreneur is getting access to capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>With funding help from SoftBank&#8217;s Opportunity Fund, which helps Black, Latinx and Native American founders and entrepreneurs in the U.S., Villadiego said he can focus entirely on the work.</p>
<p>“Once you have access to SoftBank, you sort of forget about the money part, because you know you’ll have access to capital to build your company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now your focus can be on execution &#8212; to make sure you’re solving the problem.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.aquasec.com/">Aqua Security</a>, a Boston- and Tel Aviv-based security startup that focuses squarely on securing cloud-native services, today announced that it has raised a $135 million Series E funding round at a $1 billion valuation. The round was led by ION Crossover Partners. Existing investors M12 Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Insight Partners, TLV Partners, Greenspring Associates and Acrew Capital also participated. In total, Aqua Security has now raised $265 million since it was founded in 2015.</p>
<p>The company was one of the earliest to focus on securing container deployments. And while many of its competitors were acquired over the years, Aqua remains independent and is now likely on a path to an IPO. When it launched, the industry focus was still very much on Docker and Docker containers. To the detriment of Docker, that quickly shifted to Kubernetes, which is now the de facto standard. But enterprises are also now looking at serverless and other new technologies on top of this new stack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enterprises that five years ago were experimenting with different types of technologies are now facing a completely different technology stack, a completely different ecosystem and a completely new set of security requirements,&#8221; Aqua CEO Dror Davidoff told me. And with these new security requirements came a plethora of startups, all focusing on specific parts of the stack.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2123366" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123366" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2123366" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="286" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png 862w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?resize=150,143 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?resize=300,286 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?resize=768,732 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?resize=680,648 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123366" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aqua Security</p></div></p>
<p>What set Aqua apart, Dror argues, is that it managed to 1) become the best solution for container security and 2) realized that to succeed in the long run, it had to become a platform that would secure the entire cloud-native environment. About two years ago, the company made this switch from a product to a platform, as Davidoff describes it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a spree of acquisitions by CheckPoint and Palo Alto [Networks] and Trend [Micro],&#8221; Davidoff said. &#8220;They all started to acquire pieces and tried to build a more complete offering. The big advantage for Aqua was that we had everything natively built on one platform. [&#8230;] Five years later, everyone is talking about cloud-native security. No one says &#8216;container security&#8217; or &#8216;serverless security&#8217; anymore. And Aqua is practically the broadest cloud-native security [platform].&#8221;</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of Aqua&#8217;s strategy is that it continues to bet <a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity">on open source</a>, too. Trivy, its open-source vulnerability scanner, is the default scanner for GitLab&#8217;s Harbor Registry and the CNCF&#8217;s Artifact Hub, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are probably the best security open-source player there is because not only do we secure <em>from</em> vulnerable open source, we are also very active in the open-source community,&#8221; Davidoff said (with maybe a bit of hyperbole). &#8220;We provide tools to the community that are open source. To keep evolving, we have a whole open-source team. It&#8217;s part of the philosophy here that we want to be part of the community and it really helps us to understand it better and provide the right tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2020, Aqua, which mostly focuses on mid-size and larger companies, doubled the number of paying customers and it now has more than half a dozen customers with an ARR of over $1 million each.</p>
<p>Davidoff tells me the company wasn&#8217;t actively looking for new funding. Its last funding round came together only a year ago, after all. But the team decided that it wanted to be able to double down on its current strategy and raise sooner than originally planned. ION had been interested in working with Aqua for a while, Davidoff told me, and while the company received other offers, the team decided to go ahead with ION as the lead investor (with all of Aqua&#8217;s existing investors also participating in this round).</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to grow from a product perspective, we want to grow from a go-to-market [perspective] and expand our geographical coverage &#8212; and we also want to be a little more acquisitive. That&#8217;s another direction we&#8217;re looking at because now we have the platform that allows us to do that. [&#8230;] I feel we can take the company to great heights. That&#8217;s the plan. The market opportunity allows us to dream big.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sources say Web Summit, the giant tech conference company which specialized in very large gatherings in cities like Lisbon, is poised to spin out its Hopin-like proprietary conference software as an independent startup. Although it’s put out a statement today that it will be <em>licensing</em> its software to the United Nations Development Programme, I&#8217;ve spoken to well-placed sources who say the platform will be spun out as a separate company and will raise venture funding, the context being that similar virtual conference platforms have already achieved million and billion-dollar valuations. A spokesperson denied the claim.</p>
<p>The software &#8211; which was first showcased at Collision in June 2020 and played host to 104,000 attendees at Web Summit in December 2020 &#8211; was initially designed to complement networking at physical events, but was flipped to work online after international travel was restricted for business and companies worldwide as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The United Nations Development Programme will be the first customer to run Web Summit’s conference software for its event – Istanbul Innovation Days, March 23-25.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paddy Cosgrave, co-founder and CEO of Web Summit said: “We’ve agreed to run an event in March for the UNDP on our platform. We couldn’t imagine having a better first customer. It’s been a long journey, and we’ve taken it slow, perfecting the software over years. We’re in no rush for new customers, and we will take our time. In 2022, we hope to partner with other great events.” Speaking to TechCrunch, he denied the platform was to be spun-out.</p>
<p>However, our sources say investors are circling around the software platform in the light of the recent valuations of the likes of Zoom and Hopin, with the latter recently achieving a valuation of between $5 billion and $6 billion after its recent  $400 million Series C.</p>
<p>The potential move come by Web Summit comes at an interesting time for the virtual events space.</p>
<p>Although Hopin’s valuation has soared, Zoom&#8217;s valuation has been called “<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408992-zoom-is-clear-sell">impossible to justify</a>”. And the huge growth of Microsoft Teams could hurt Zoom&#8217;s business as well.</p>
<p>That said, specialized virtual conference software is doing well, as we’ve seen with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/spatial-raises-14m-more-for-a-holographic-3d-workspace-app-a-vr-ar-version-of-zoom-or-hangouts/">recent $14m funding of Spatial</a> and others.</p>
<p>Web Summit says will return to an in-person conference in November 2021, in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remix, the startup that developed mapping software used by cities for transportation planning and street design, was born out of a hackathon during a Code for America fellowship. Nearly seven years later, the San Francisco-based startup is being acquired by Via for $100 million in cash and equity.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Remix will become a subsidiary of Via, an arrangement that will let the startup maintain its independent brand. Remix&#8217;s 65 employees and two of its co-founders — CEO Tiffany Chu and CTO </span>Dan Getelman — will stay on.</p>
<p>The acquisition adds yet another service to Via&#8217;s ever-expanding business as well as customer base of more than 350 local governments in 22 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Remix&#8217;s strength is in planning, while Via brings expertise in software and operations, Chu said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;By having those two strengths come together, we can be much stronger as an end-to-end solution — from the initial genesis of this idea around transportation planning and carrying that through to operations — in a way that we, individually, would not have been able to achieve otherwise,&#8221; Chu said.</p>

<p>Via started as a on-demand shuttle operator in 2012. The company, which last year hit a $2.25 billion valuation after raising $400 million in a Series E round, has evolved from its initial consumer-facing focus.</p>
<p>Today, Via&#8217;s core business is its software and operations platform, which is <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">used by cities and transportation authorities to plan, schedule and deploy their own on-demand and fixed route transit, paratransit and school buses. Via has 200 partners in 24 countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Via is backed by Exor, the Agnelli family holding company that owns stakes in PartnerRe, Ferrari and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles as well as Macquarie Capital, Mori Building, Shell 83North, Broadscale Group, Ervington Investments, Hearst Ventures, Planven Ventures, Pitango and RiverPark Ventures.</span></p>
<h2>Accidental founders</h2>
<p>Remix&#8217;s Silicon Valley-esque origin story was driven by some unlikely entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Chu had been a user experience designer at Zipcar when she moved to San Francisco to complete a one-year fellowship with Code for America. In the middle of the fellowship, Chu along her eventual co-founders Getelman, Sam Hashemi and Danny Whalen were working on a hackathon project that to help citizens of San Francisco suggest better transit routes to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency.</p>
<p>The transportation planning tool was shared on Twitter and it went viral. Within two weeks, 30,000 maps had been created.</p>
<p>&#8220;It became this funny, unexpected armchair transportation planning tool that people explored online,&#8221; Chu recalled. But it wasn&#8217;t just the local citizenry who took notice. About 200 urban planners reached out, asking the team to build extra features that could be used by agencies for their own transportation planning projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was kind of a mind blowing moment for us when we realized the project that was supposed to be a grassroots kind of civic project actually had implications around solving real needs and problems in transportation,&#8221; Chu said.</p>
<p>Remix was founded shortly after and the company&#8217;s founders applied and were accepted into Y Combinator. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/remix-picks-up-15-million-to-help-cities-make-better-decisions-around-transit/">went on to raise</a> a total of $27 million in investments from Y Combinator, Sequoia and Energy Impact Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://fleex.com">Fleex</a>, a French startup that was formally named Flexlab. The company wants to make it easier to give some cash to your employees so that they can spend it on a desk, an external monitor, some computer peripherals, a nice chair, etc. Essentially, Fleex wants to make it easier to turn remote work into work.</p>
<p>If you work for a big company and have the ability to work from home, chances are your employer has sent you an email saying that you can request an external monitor or an office chair to make work easier during the pandemic. And if you work for a small company, it probably depends on your employer.</p>
<p>Either way, some IT and facility departments now have to deal with a huge inventory of devices and furniture that is spread around everyone’s homes. Setting up policies, ordering portals and inventory can be quite difficult as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fleex basically wants to help you with that situation. The company lets you allocate a monthly budget for your employees. People can then choose to spend that budget on several products and services.</p>
<p>The startup works directly with suppliers to put together a product catalog. For now, Fleex is starting with IT supplies and furniture.</p>
<p>Fleex then buys supplies for you and sends stuff to your home — it takes care of the full lifecycle of the products. When an employee leaves the company, they have to send equipment back to Fleex.</p>
<p>As you can see, Fleex has a different business model compared to your average software startup. The company has to allocate some capital to buy desks, chairs, screens, printers, etc. It has to figure out whether employees efficiently spend their budget or if they leave some money sitting on their Fleex account.</p>
<p>It has to find out whether products can last for a while before they have to be decommissioned. In other words, it’s going to take a bit of time to figure out the unit economics behind Fleex.</p>
<p>The company is just getting started and is working with a few companies to try out its offering. So far, Swile, Back Market and Shine have been using Fleex. They allocate a monthly budget of €55 per employee on average.</p>
<p>Fleex has raised a $2 million seed round (€1.7 million) and has joined <a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a>, a European startup studio focused on software-as-a-service companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is beginning to assemble the iPhone 12 in India as it ramps up its production capacity in the world&#8217;s second largest smartphone market. Foxconn, a contract manufacturing partner of Apple, is assembling the iPhone 12 model &#8212; though currently no other iPhone 12 model &#8212; Pro and Pro Max, and Mini &#8212; in the country.</p>
<p>The move underscores how India is emerging as a big production hub for global smartphone makers. Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and OnePlus have been assembling their smartphone models in India for more than half a decade and have increased their production capacities in recent years.</p>
<p>To attract global giants, New Delhi has been offering tax benefits to firms that locally produce in India and in recent quarters has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/01/apples-partners-and-samsung-apply-for-indias-local-smartphone-production-program/">significantly increased the perks</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are optimistic and looking forward to building a strong ecosystem across the value chain and integrating with the global value chains, thereby strengthening electronics manufacturing ecosystem in the country,&#8221; said India&#8217;s IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad last year.</p>
<p>Apple began locally assembling select iPhone models in India in 2017 &#8212; beginning with the iPhone SE &#8212; though for the initial years the company&#8217;s contract partners locally produced only older iPhone models in the country.</p>
<p>Analysts have estimated that Apple, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/apple-launches-its-online-store-in-india/">launched its online store in India last year</a> and is working to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/apple-to-begin-online-sales-in-india-this-year-open-first-retail-store-in-2021/">set up its first physical retail store in the country this year</a>, plans to move between seven to 10% of its iPhone production to India as it looks to cut reliance on China. TechCrunch understands the figure is &#8220;wild speculation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The iPhone maker suffered a setback in India late last year after a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/19/apple-puts-contract-partner-wistron-on-probation-after-violence-at-india-plant/">violent protest broke at a facility in Wistron</a>, one of its key manufacturing partners of Apple, near Bangalore last year. But the Taiwanese firm appears to have resolved the issues. It said last month that it was rehiring workers and will soon be resuming production at its facility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple is dedicated to making the best products and services in the world to delight our customers. We are proud to be starting production of iPhone 12 in India for our local customers,&#8221; said an Apple spokesperson in India in a statement.</p>
<p>Apple assumes just 2% of the Indian smartphone market, but it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-india-q4-2020/">grown in recent quarters.</a> Apple shipped more than 1.5 million iPhone units in India in the quarter that ended in December, up 100% year-on-year, making this its best quarter in the world’s largest smartphone market to date, according to research firms Counterpoint and CyberMedia Research.</p>
<p>Unlike several foreign firms that offer their products and services at low prices in India, Apple has focused entirely on a small fraction of the population that can afford to pay big bucks, said Jayanth Kolla, chief analyst at Convergence Catalyst. And while it took several years, Apple has carved out a slice of the market that is growing, he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The team behind <a href="https://www.songclip.com/">Songclip</a> thinks that social media could use more music.</p>
<p>Yes, music is a big part of the experience on a handful of apps like TikTok and Triller, but Songclip co-founder and COO John vanSuchtelen told me, &#8220;That is not the end of how music is going to be a feature, that is a beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;In the next nine to 12 months &#8230; just like you never have a phone without a camera, you&#8217;re not going to have an app without music clips as a feature when you make videos.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s what vanSuchtelen and his co-founder and CEO Andy Blacker are hoping to enable with Songclip, which announced today that it has raised $11 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The startup has created an API that, when integrated with other apps (current integrations include photo- and video-editing app PicsArt) allows users to search for and share music. VanSuchtelen said that like Giphy, Songclip plans to popularize a new media format — the short audio clip — and make it accessible across a wide range of services.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;VSCO acquires mobile app Trash to expand into AI-powered video editing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/vsco-acquires-mobile-app-trash-to-expand-into-a-i-powered-video-editing/embed/#?secret=EN6EHthkFW" data-secret="EN6EHthkFW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;If I were to say, &#8216;I’m going to send you a four-minute song,&#8217; it’s just not going to work that way, that&#8217;s not how we communicate anymore,&#8221; vanSuchtelen said. &#8220;How do you take the music and turn it into the bite that you want to use in a social context?&#8221;</p>
<p>To do this, Blacker said Songclip doesn&#8217;t just license music, it also does its own tagging and clipping, while offering tools for music labels to protect their intellectual property and providing data on how people are interacting with the music. And unlike Giphy, Songclip isn&#8217;t looking to build a consumer brand.</p>
<p>All of this involves a combination of human editors and technology. Blacker said the human element is key to understanding the nuances of songs and their association, like the fact that Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#8217;s &#8220;Bridge Over Troubled Water&#8221; isn&#8217;t really about bridges or water, or that Katrina and the Waves&#8217; &#8220;Walking on Sunshine&#8221; is a happy song even though it doesn&#8217;t have the word &#8220;happy&#8221; in it.</p>
<p>Songclip has now raised a total of $23 million. The new round was led by Gregg Smith of Evolution VC Partners. The Kraft Group, Michael Rubin, Raised in Space, Gaingels and ​Forefront Venture Partners​ also participated, as did industry executives Jason Flom and Steve Greenberg and the band AJR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zego.com/">Zego</a>, the insurtech that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/18/zego/">got its start</a> by offering flexible motorbike insurance for gig economy workers but has since expanded with a range of tech-enabled commercial motor insurance products, has raised $150 million.</p>
<p>Leading the London-based company&#8217;s C round &#8212; giving it a $1.1 billion valuation and a unicorn status &#8212; is DST Global. Other new backers include General Catalyst, whose founder and MD, Joel Cutler, joins Zego’s board.</p>
<p>Notably, I&#8217;m told all existing investors followed on, including Wise&#8217;s Taavet Hinrikus, who is also on the Zego board, and Target Global, Balderton Capital and Latitude. Zego has now raised more than $200 million since launching in 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The insurance company says it will use the funding to &#8220;rapidly expand across Europe and beyond&#8221;. It will also double its workforce, which currently stands at 265 employees, to over 500 employees by the end of 2021, and continue to invest in technology. Late last year, Zeho <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/zegocover-acquires-drivit--a89f37c6">acquired</a> telematics company Drivit.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;The rise of the gig economy helps London-based insurtech Zego to raise $42M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/the-rise-of-the-gig-economy-helps-london-based-insurtech-zego-to-raise-42m/embed/#?secret=rXcez4biSZ" data-secret="rXcez4biSZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Zego offers commercial motor insurance for businesses, from self-employed drivers and riders to fleets of vehicles, spanning pay-as-you-go insurance to annual policies. It combines tech with multiple data sources to offer insurance products that it claims save time and are more cost-effective. It earned its own insurance license in 2019, enabling it to build and sell its own policies, in addition to working alongside other insurers.</p>
<p>Technical/data integrations include those with companies in the ride-hailing space, such as Uber, Ola and Bolt, and in the delivery space, such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat. More recently, Zego has become a key partner in the U.K.’s burgeoning e-scooter rental market, partnering with companies like Tier, Voi and Dott.</p>
<p>Next up, the insurtech is betting big on offering insurance for fleets. &#8220;Over the past couple of years, Zego’s focus on powering opportunities for businesses has expanded to include not just self-employed drivers and riders, but also entire fleets of vehicles,&#8221; Sten Saar, CEO and co-founder of Zego, tells me, noting that 80% of new vehicles are now sold to commercial customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been both a natural progression for the company, with the only real difference being distribution, as well as a focused effort, as Zego aims to capitalise on an ever-growing market currently underserved by the insurance sector&#8221;.</p>
<p>To date, Zego has provided more than 17 million insurance policies and covered more than 200,000 vehicles in five countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;While most traditional insurers price their insurance products based purely on factors such as age and vehicle type, and while others may use telematics-based driver behaviour data too, Zego is able to price policies based not only on traditional factors, but also driver behaviour data and working habits data,&#8221; adds Saar.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, overall, the information Zego can collect amounts to five times more data per vehicle than competitors, or 50 data points per second. This means that we have a much more comprehensive understanding of risk than competitors, enabling us to provide best-value insurance coverage, from policies ranging from one hour to one year&#8221;.</p>
<p>Cue statement from Tom Stafford, managing partner of DST Global: “The shift to digital is occurring across multiple industry categories and is increasingly occurring in the insurance industry. We are excited to partner with Sten and the team at Zego as they leverage internet, technology, telematics and data-driven decisions to provide the best insurance products at the best pricing for their customers.”</p>

<p>The new raise fast-follows a $108M top up to Jobandtalent&#8217;s Series C round, which we reported on back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/jobandtalent-tops-up-with-108m-for-its-workforce-as-a-service-platform/">January</a>. In total, the company has raised a total of €310M (just under $370M) since being founded back in 2009.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today Jobandtalent is also announcing a ~$100M (€83M) in debt financing from BlackRock.</p>
<p>The startup tells us the mix of debt and equity will help it step on the gas and accelerate growth of its marketplace faster than if it took in less capital at this point, as well as enabling it to plough more resource into its product and tech development.</p>
<p>On the tech side its platform uses learning algorithms to match temps with jobs &#8212; speeding the hiring process up. It also offers a CRM for employers which bakes in analytics for tracking workforce performance in real time &#8212; which it says can help them monitor workplace satisfaction, reduce attrition and track metrics such as absences and late arrivals.</p>
<p>For temps there&#8217;s the promise of steadier and easy to obtain shift work &#8212; as Jobandtalent streamlines job application admin and payroll into a one-stop shop, and it suggests its marketplace/workforce-as-a-service model can provide temps with continuous employment (i.e. through consecutive temp roles).</p>
<p>Its marketing also talks in terms of offering these workers a level of job security and benefits typically associated with full time employment &#8212; such as pensions, sick and holiday pay, health insurance (in some markets) and training courses.</p>
<p>With the new Series D funds in the bank Jobandtalent is preparing to enter the U.S. market &#8220;in the next year&#8221;, per co-CEO and co-founder, Juan Urdiales &#8212; expanding out from the eight markets it&#8217;s currently operating in (namely: Spain, the UK, Germany, France, Sweden, Mexico, Colombia, and Portugal).</p>
<p>He confirms it&#8217;s also now eyeing entering two more markets in Europe: Italy and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not yet seeing any competitor operating in the US at large scale and in multiple states in the verticals where we operate (e-commerce, logistics, etc). This is one of the reasons why we believe that we have a great opportunity there,&#8221; Urdiales tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. can be a very difficult market to break into. However, we are starting to see more and more European companies going to the U.S. and being successful (Spotify, Klarna, Adyen, etc),&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that in our case, after having operated our model in Europe with high standards on labour rights and complex regulatory environments, we are in a great position to launch our platform in the US and offer a great value proposition to workers and employers there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jobandtalent&#8217;s platform will offer temps equivalent perks and benefits in the U.S. as it offers elsewhere, per Urdiales.</p>
<p>&#8220;The perks and benefits offered into our marketplace meet the same principles everywhere, all of them aim to bring to the workers a similar status as a permanent worker, with the same type of benefits and perks,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;There are some adaptations in every country to do this, and it would be the same with the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past year Jobandtalent says that more than 80,000 workers have used its marketplace to find temporary roles (its website says it has 10M+ registered users) &#8212; while more than 850 companies, including the likes of XPO, Ceva Logistics, eBay, Ocado, Sainsbury’s, Bayer and Santander, have used its platform to locate temp workers.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s revenue run rate has grown from €5M in 2016 to €500M in 2020 &#8212; which it says has resulted in a positive EBITDA. It also touts a growth rate of over 100% year on year.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Yanni Pipilis, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said: &#8220;Jobandtalent is addressing a crucial challenge facing the modern workforce &#8212; how to balance flexibility with high quality, reliable job opportunities. The company has developed a data-driven platform that has a track record of providing high fulfilment and low attrition staffing for businesses with temporary roles to fill, while securing income stability and benefits for workers. We are incredibly excited to partner with Juan, Felipe and the team on the next phase of the company’s growth.”</p>
<p>Asked about its decision to take funding from SoftBank for the Series D &#8212; and whether it was largely about the scale the investor could offer or whether Jobandtalent also sees potential synergies with other SoftBank portfolio companies (in sectors like logistics) &#8212; Urdiales also tells us: &#8220;We believe the Vision Fund team can add a lot of value to the company in this new stage of our growth as they have a lot of experience with companies of our size. We can learn a lot from the companies and management teams that they have invested in over the past few years. They have an entrepreneurial mindset and a clear vision on how technology and AI is going to disrupt many industries, and we share the same vision around our category.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>This report was updated with a correction: The Series D round was funded entirely by SoftBank; Jobandtalent&#8217;s previous investors did not participate in this round as we originally stated</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.beyondmeat.com/">Beyond Meat</a> shares soared today on the heels of an announcement that Walmart is beefing up its relationship with the purveyor of meatless protein patties, sausages, and balls.</p>
<p>900 stores will now be stocking Beyond Meat&#8217;s hot Italian sausages and its party packs of beefless burgers &#8212; those grilling delectations for the omnivores, vegetarians and vegans who no longer want to ask &#8220;Where&#8217;s the beef?&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond Meat&#8217;s increased distribution at Walmart stores is the second jump in production over the past year and part of the company&#8217;s efforts to lock down the market for plant-based meat substitutes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s foods are now sold in over 28,000 stores, and it&#8217;s also pulling ahead in the food service industry, where it recently announced deals with Yum Brands and McDonalds.</p>
<p>Shares of the company&#8217;s stock ended the day up 3.16% or $4.28 as investors ate up the news.</p>

<p>“We are thrilled by the continued growth with Walmart and the opportunity to offer Walmart customers increased accessibility to a larger selection of our delicious and better-for-you plant-based products,” said Chuck Muth, Chief Growth Officer, Beyond Meat. “As more households continue to buy our products and buy them more frequently, we’re excited to satisfy the growing demand through increased product offerings and distribution.”</p>
<p>The partnership with Walmart, which dates back to 2015 is significant, but not nearly as attention grabbing as the company&#8217;s elaboration on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/beyond-meat-shares-rise-on-news-that-it-collaborated-with-mcdonalds-on-the-mcplant-options/">recent agreements with McDonalds</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/beyond-meat-shares-soar-after-inking-deal-with-taco-bell-on-new-menu-items/">Yum!

<p>In late February, Beyond Meat opened up about its deals with Yum! Brands and McDonald&#8217;s that would see the company work to co-create plant-based protein menu items for KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell along with the famous golden arches fo McDonald&#8217;s.</p>
<p>That details of the agreement withYum! included the expansion of testing the company&#8217;s Beyond Fried Chicken in other U.S. cities with KFC. And the launch of the Beyond Italian Sausage Pizza and the Great Beyond Pizza nationwide, becoming the first national pizza chain to introduce a plant-based meat pizza coast-to-coast, the company&#8217;s said in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>The McDonald&#8217;s announcement fleshed out the meatless details of a partnership that was previously announced when the fast food giant unveiled its McPlant sandwich &#8212; a kind of face plant for Beyond given that it couldn&#8217;t confirm the details of the agreement at the time.</p>
<p>Now, other plant-based menu items &#8212; including options for chicken, pork, and egg products, have been unveiled as part of the broader McPlant platform, the companies said in February.</p>
<p>“Our new McPlant platform is all about giving customers more choices when they visit McDonald’s,” said Francesca DeBiase, McDonald’s Executive Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, said at the time. “We’re excited to work with Beyond Meat to drive innovation in this space, and entering into this strategic agreement is an important step on our journey to bring delicious, high quality, plant-based menu items to our customers.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy year for the branding geniuses at Beyond Meat, who also inked a deal with Pepsi to develop protein enhanced snacks and beverages under the tragically named PLANeT Partnership.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.trufan.io">Trufan</a>, a startup selling tools helping marketers analyze their social followings and collect audience data, announced today that it has raised a $2.3 million seed round.</p>
<p>Despite raising a relatively small amount of funding ($4.1 million total), Trufan has already made two notable acquisitions. First, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/trufan-acquires-socialrank/">acquired the SocialRank product and business</a> in 2019, allowing it to offer capabilities like showing brands their most valuable social media followers. Then last year, it <a href="https://betakit.com/trufan-acquires-kelowna-based-playr-gg/">acquired Playr.gg</a>, which marketers use to run giveaways that consumers enter by providing information such as their email addresses.</p>
<p>Across its products, Trufan says it has more than 10,000 free users and more than 600 paying customers, including Netflix, NBA, NFL, Sony Music and United Talent Agency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Next up, the startup plans to integrate the two main products and launch a consolidated, privacy-compliant customer data and audience engagement platform with new branding and pricing. Co-founder and CEO Swish Goswami told me that the platform should be particularly attractive as regulators introduce new privacy regulations, Apple and Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/google-renounces-ad-tracking/">add new restrictions to ad targeting</a> based on third-party data and as consumers become more sensitive to how their data is used.</p>

<p>&#8220;People do not want to be tracked anonymously,&#8221; Goswami said. &#8220;People do not want their data taken away, but most of those people are attracted to the idea of data sharing if they get something in exchange.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that it&#8217;s particularly important for brands to build up first-party customer data given the limitations of social networks: &#8220;You can have 50 million followers, but every time you post you don’t reach 50 million people.&#8221; If you&#8217;ve got 50 million email or phone numbers, on the other hand, you might actually reach most of those inboxes or phones.</p>

		As a partner in FrontlineX, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennanpodonnell">Brennan O' Donnell</a> is focused on helping growth stages companies expand into Europe. Previously, he spent nearly a decade at Google, where he held multiple go-to-market leadership roles in the U.S. and EMEA, building teams across both the Cloud and Ads businesses.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In 2008, I was moving to London as the global financial crisis slammed the brakes on growth for millions of businesses.</p>
<p>Five years earlier, I had been sent to Dublin from headquarters in Mountain View to help manage Google’s European expansion, and despite our incredible growth, the macroeconomic situation put us in an immediate defensive posture and led us to throttle back our ambitious plans.</p>
<p>Nearly one year ago, faced with the uncertainty of a global pandemic, companies across the world again moved into triage mode. Employees were laid off, budgets were slashed and growth opportunities were pushed down the priority list.</p>
<p>However, as we enter the spring of 2021, the world is a dramatically different place. Tech stocks are stronger than ever amid record-setting IPOs, vaccines are here and revenue growth is again a top priority for B2B SaaS startups.</p>
<p>There are ultimately three ways to drive growth in a technology startup: extend your product offering, move into new segments or expand into new markets. Developing new products or moving into new segments may seem like a more comfortable path, but scaling a high-performing business into new markets represents massive financial upside, particularly when well-executed.</p>
<p>Look at some of the top-performing SaaS businesses of the past few years — 31% of Zoom’s revenue comes from outside the U.S. International revenue is 38% for Slack, 39% for Asana and 48% for Dropbox. If your company survived the past year, now is the time to shift from defense to offense and prioritize international expansion.</p>
<h2><strong>Your best growth lever is Europe</strong></h2>
<p>At $27.5 trillion, EMEA represents 38% of the world’s GDP and is the largest addressable market outside of America. Europe is the world’s second-largest B2B software market, and for more than two decades has been the location of choice when U.S. companies look beyond their own borders. With the democratization of software distribution, it’s now common for companies to discover 10-12% of their business comes from Europe organically.</p>
<p>By IPO, however, these same companies average 30% of their revenue from Europe. What changes, and how do you capitalize on this massive growth opportunity in a cost-effective way? High-performing companies are making the investment today and prioritizing European expansion despite the lingering challenges of the past year.</p>
<p>For example, Figma, one of the most exciting companies of the past several years, announced its new EMEA headquarters in September. *Clearbanc expanded into Europe in Q4 and will be investing £500m into UK startups over the next year. Nearly all growth-stage CEOs made the decision to postpone international expansion plans over the past 12 months, and for many, “testing remotely” has been an effective tactic — but it’s only a temporary solution.</p>
<p>The best CEOs are globally ambitious, and they know that unlocking Europe’s growth potential remains a critical step on the road to IPO.</p>
<h2><strong>Expand the moment you’re ready</strong></h2>
<p>After months of focusing on survival, it’s not always easy to recognize the right time to invest in growth. However, the key indicators that the time is right to expand into Europe are easy to identify.</p>
<p>First, your customer and revenue growth have stabilized and are accelerating again.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.passioncapital.com/">Passion Capital</a>, one of the UK’s first early-stage VCs, is to <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/passioncapital/coming-soon">crowd-fund</a> the final stage of its latest £45 million fund ($62.5m), Passion Capital Fund III. TechCrunch understands this is the first time retail investors have been invited to become LPs in a VC fund, at least in Europe.</p>
<p>Passion says it will use the <a href="http://Seedrs.com">Seedrs</a> platform, which is normally used by startups themselves for crowd-equity funding campaigns. The move is a highly unusual one for a VC, where LPs are normally drawn from Pension funds and family offices, rather than the ‘person on the street’.</p>
<p>Seedrs was previously used by the <a href="http://Seedcamp.com">Seedcamp</a> venture accelerator in the UK to allow its founders to participate in a fund-raise, but this was allocated privately. What’s different about Passion’s move is that almost anyone will be able to become an LP in their new fund, albeit even a very small one.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A £350,000 allocation will be made available to the public. The offer may well prove tantalizing to retail investors as their single investment would be applied across a range of startups rather than through the direct single company investment traditionally made via Seedrs.</p>
<p>Any investors who self-certifies as &#8216;high net worth&#8217; or &#8216;sophisticated&#8217; will be able to invest in the fund. Passion Capital’s portfolio of 83 tech investments is worth an estimated £5 billion and includes Monzo, GoCardless, Butternut Box, Adzuna, and Marshmallow. </p>
<p>Passion says it has already made 11 new investments from Fund III, which investors via the Seedrs platform will automatically become a part of, with a further 15-20 new investments planned.</p>
<p>Eileen Burbidge, Passion Capital partner said in a statement: “Investment into a private venture fund is usually reserved for institutions. We are throwing our doors open to a much wider range of investors in this unique collaboration with Seedrs as we look to diversify our investor base and increase access for investors who might be interested in partnering with us.”</p>
<p>Jeff Kelisky, CEO at Seedrs, added: “This is a very innovative collaboration for both the venture capital and the equity crowdfunding space… It presents our community with another avenue to participate in SME equity finance that delivers additional investment opportunities and the potential for exceptional returns, beyond the direct investment campaigns we also run.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me in an interview, Burbidge added: “We’d been seeing what&#8217;s been happening in the States, with <a href="https://angel.co/blog/rolling-venture-fund-launch">Angellist Rolling Funds</a> and then the SEC expanding the definition of qualified investors, and, basically, this democratization of retail investors finally getting access to venture funds and to GPs. It’s, kind’ve, breaking down these age-old dynamics of where institutional investors pick and choose these age-old fund managers, and the whole notion that venture has been this elite, inaccessible asset class for retail investors.”</p>
<p>Burbidge said she talked to Angellist about doing something similar in Europe and realized it wasn’t legally possible right now, so she asked Seedrs, who confirmed they could do it.</p>
<p>“We closed the fund first in August 2019, it was 25 million, then August 2020 with another 20, so 45 million, which is the same size as our second fund. And during the pandemic.” But, she says, after dealing with their LPs, they eventually found they had a £350,000 allocation left over, so this became the germination of the crowdfunding idea.</p>
<p>“I thought, we&#8217;ve got 350,000 left, why don&#8217;t we crowd-fund it. This whole movement of letting retail investors get access to venture funds and invest &#8211; to get that exposure to a whole portfolio- I just think is a really good thing. I think it&#8217;s great for everyone involved. Obviously, as long as they&#8217;re educated and they know that capital is at risk and it&#8217;s not pensioners putting their last savings in, and those usual kinds of warnings about crowdfunding. But I love the idea of people getting exposure to tech, and not having to do £150,000 as a minimum check.”</p>
<p>Although Burbidge declined to comment further on the subject, there is of course the implication that this allocation could be increased, if the crowd-funding takes off.</p>
<p>She added: “There&#8217;s not a retail investor in the world who wouldn&#8217;t want access to the latest Sequoia fund, or the Accel fund right or Andreessen Horowitz funds… we think it&#8217;s great to give retail investors exposure to a portfolio. I think it&#8217;d be great if more funds did it.”</p>
<p>Burbidge believes actions like Passion&#8217;s will &#8220;increase the diversity of the LP base. It increases inclusion and gives people more access. It just creates more participation and breaks down the old barriers. We&#8217;ll have the Seedrs platform for Q and A’s. It is going to be up to us how much we want to engage with that community, the same as Monzo does with its crowdfunded investors. Monzo holds a public event every year for all of its crowdfund investors. I would love to do an event… it&#8217;d be great to meet people who have invested in this fashion.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While its website shows an active presence in 11 African countries, Flutterwave CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gbagboola">Olugbenga Agboola</a>, also known as GB, told TechCrunch the company is live in 20 African countries with an infrastructure reach in over 33 countries on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year was a pivotal one for the five-year-old company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its second investment came </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in time before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Africa, negatively impacting some businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but not payments companies like</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Flutterwave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agboola says his company grew more than 100% in revenue within the past year due to the pandemic without giving specifics on numbers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also contributed to its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 226% from 2018.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, this growth resulted from an increase in activities in &#8220;COVID beneficiary sectors&#8221; &#8212; a term used by Flutterwave to describe sectors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">positively</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">impacted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the pandemic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They include streaming, gaming, remittance and e-commerce, among others. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agboola adds that the company plans to ride on these sectors&#8217; growth and continue in that trajectory</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, Flutterwave&#8217;s response in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/african-fintech-firm-flutterwave-launches-sme-e-commerce-portal/">introducing the Flutterwave Store</a> for merchants during pandemic-induced lockdowns was instrumental as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product, which went live across 15 African countries, helps over 20,000 merchants to create storefronts and sell their products online</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave wants to become a global payments company, and the Series C investment helps to reach that goal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company says it plans to use the funds to speed up customer acquisition in its present markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also improve existing product offerings like Barter, where it has over 500,000 users, and introduce new offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such is Flutterwave Mobile, which in the founder&#8217;s words &#8220;will turn merchants&#8217; mobile devices into a point of sale, allowing them to accept payments and make sales</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Agboola gives credit to the company&#8217;s more than 300 staff, investors, customers and regulatory bodies like the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for creating the backbone for Flutterwave&#8217;s success</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some, it would come off as strange that the CEO mentioned the last stakeholder given the unfavourable and questionable regulations it has recently placed on fintechs in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Agboola thinks the reverse is the case. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He makes a bold statement by saying that under the current CBN governor&#8217;s administration, the Central Bank has shown a consistent regulatory framework that has allowed fintechs like Flutterwave to thrive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Flutterwave, for instance, launched when the governor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got our license and scaled our business because of a favourable regime that allowed it to be possible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many trailblazing innovations that we don&#8217;t talk about a lot about Nigeria, like the <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/out/2017/bpsd/circular%20on%20the%20regulatory%20framework%20for%20bvn%20%20watchlist%20for%20nigerian%20financial%20system.pdf">BVN</a> and the <a href="https://nibss-plc.com.ng/news/4t1s8n9vwysfmyymska7y6g9ca">NIP</a> system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> been at the forefront of payments innovation for over a decade, and it was all possible because of the forward-looking CBN policies,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>On exits, acquisitions and the billion-dollar club</h2>
<p>One fintech company that has unquestionably championed payments in this time frame is Interswitch. The payments giant is currently worth $1 billion after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment/">Visa acquired a 20% stake</a> in 2019, and Flutterwave joins the company <span style="font-weight: 400;">as the only fintechs in Nigeria to have reached that valuation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This number increases to four in Africa when including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> traded African e-commerce company Jumia and Egyptian payments company Fawry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave&#8217;s $170 million mammoth raise and its billion-dollar valuation represent a landmark achievement for the African startup scene</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the aforementioned companies&#8217; valuations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be disputed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are question marks on whether some are startups and whether others are African companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interswitch, for instance, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2002, which doesn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make it a startup despite still being private</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fawry </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2007, but didn&#8217;t become a billion-dollar company until 2020, a year after going public</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia, albeit public, reached unicorn status as a private company in 2016; however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are varying opinions as to whether it is an African company or not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the others, Flutterwave checks all the boxes of what a billion-dollar African startup should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ideally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look like &#8212; founded by Africans in Africa while reaching a $1 billion valuation in fewer than 10 years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most stakeholders in Africa&#8217;s tech ecosystem knew this would happen, but the timing expected was later rather than sooner</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After raising $35 million in a Series B in 2020, who would have thought Flutterwave was going to raise almost five times that amount the following round and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be valued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at more than $1 billion the next year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, these numbers rarely matter to Agboola, as I ask him what he thinks of Flutterwave&#8217;s new growth metric</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll say valuation is both art and science. At some point, we were also the most valuable African company at YC, but it&#8217;s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a metric we&#8217;re focused on at Flutterwave because they move up and down,&#8221; he smiles. &#8220;Our key metrics have always been revenue, customer growth and retention.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said, but as the company continues to grow, questions around profitability and exit will become more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">frequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paystack, another Nigerian payments company that is often compared to Flutterwave, got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Stripe for more than $200 million last year</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, there were also rumours of Flutterwave taking the same route, but this Series C raise suggests that the company is not looking to exit at the moment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if the YC-backed company indeed does, it might be through an IPO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Like every other startup, we&#8217;re thinking about ways to create exit tools for our investors. So, a listing is very much in our plans, but for now, we&#8217;re focused on giving the best value to our customers,&#8221; Agboola said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the course of the company&#8217;s journey to this point, it has remained big on partnerships. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Flutterwave <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/flutterwave-and-visa-launch-african-consumer-payment-service-getbarter/">partnered with Visa</a> to launch Barter and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/flutterwave-and-alipay-partner-on-payments-between-africa-and-china/#:~:text=San%20Francisco%20and%20Lagos%2Dbased,payments%20between%20Africa%20and%20China.&amp;text=%E2%80%9CThere's%20a%20lot%20of%20trade,to%20accept%20Chinese%20customer%20payments.%E2%80%9D">Alipay to offer digital payments</a> between Africa and China</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then last year, the company announced a </span><a href="https://www.worldpay.com/global-selector"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnership with Worldpay FIS </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for payments in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Flutterwave has done this with bigger establishments, Agboola says the company will be looking to do the same with smaller companies, opening the doors to potential acquisitions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in payments in partnership as you have to partner to scale. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if in the course of making partnerships and scaling and we identify promising companies with a similar ethos and have our vision in mind, that is in making Africa a country, an acquisition isn&#8217;t off the table,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After capturing much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Agboola says Flutterwave&#8217;s next plan is to go live in North Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There, it will likely face competition from a local leader, Fawry, but that doesn&#8217;t matter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The African fintech market is large enough to accommodate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s one reason why it has also been a popular bet with investors. The sector, which is both local and international investors&#8217; top destination, attracted between 25% to 31% of the total VC funding last year from varying sources</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But from the information on their websites, this is the first time Flutterwave&#8217;s lead investors &#8212;  Avenir Growth Capital and Tiger Global &#8212; are backing an African fintech startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the former, Flutterwave represents the first African startup in its portfolio, but Tiger Global </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have invested in Nigerian media company iROKOtv and South African e-commerce company, Takealot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via their partners &#8212; Jamie Reynolds of Avenir Growth Capital and Scott Shleifer of Tiger Global, both firms said they&#8217;re backing Flutterwave on its quest to build a global and world-class payments company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking into the future, Agboola insists that the company&#8217;s focus remains to support its 290,000 merchants and help them build global businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We look forward to increasing our investments across the continent and deepening the impact our platform has on lives and livelihoods as we take more businesses in Africa to the world, and at the same time continue to bring more of the world to Africa,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with a more spacious cockpit, more storage and some upgraded cupholders, Audi has packed in some serious new tech into its upcoming all-electric Q4 e-tron compact crossover, including an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">augmented reality head-up display (HUD) that’s reactive enough to accurately stick to a driver’s real environment. </span></p>
<p>Audi revealed Tuesday the interior of the Q4 e-tron, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/audis-new-2022-e-tron-gt-is-a-real-electric-performance-sedan-not-just-another-electrified-crossover/">fifth electric vehicle in its lineup</a> and part of the German automaker&#8217;s plan to launch more than 30 EVs and plug-in hybrids by 2025. The Q4 e-tron has been expected for some time; it was first revealed as a concept at the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show.</p>
<p>The exterior of the production version of the Q4 is still camouflaged, but we know its dimensions. The takeaway: An electric vehicle that fits in the larger compact SUV segment with a short overhang and wheelbase of 9.1 feet — a combination that gives it a rather stout look. However, that allows for an interior of 6 feet in length, the kind of space found in a large full-size class SUV.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The underlying architecture of the vehicle is based on its parent company VW&#8217;s modular electric drive toolkit chassis, or MEB platform. This flexible modular system, first introduced by VW in 2016, was developed to make it more efficient and cost-effective to produce a variety of EVs. It has also given designers more room to play with thanks to the flat floor. And they took advantage of that space, popping in a center console with two cup holders, a 4.4-liter stowage compartment with a cover, two (or four as an option) USB-C sockets and the Audi phone box (which charges wirelessly and boosts your phone&#8217;s signal) upon request.</p>

<p>The real story here is the tech — and most notably an option to add an AR-enabled windshield. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The AR windshield provides a wider field of view and more accurate and dynamic animations versus a standard windshield HUD. The Q4 e-tron will break down important displayed information via two sections: one for status and one for AR. The former, appearing about 3 meters ahead of the driver, will display the driving speed, traffic signs, the assist system and navigation symbols as static displays. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the AR section, the driver will perceive the floating symbols to be about 10 meters away. That&#8217;ll display information like lane departure warnings that superimpose a red line on the real-life lane marking and a colored stripe over an active car driving in front when in adaptive cruise control.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Head-up displays aren&#8217;t new,&#8221; states Audi. &#8220;This just takes the field of vision farther out so it enables more active use.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AR will also display navigation information. Audi calls the turning arrows “drones,” probably because the arrows fly ahead when driving straight and then disappear, reappearing before the next point of action. When the driver approaches an intersection, the drone announces the turn before steering the driver onto the road with precision.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123277" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123277" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2123277" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg 3508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123277" class="wp-caption-text">Head-up-Display. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Audi</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the software side of things, the Q4 e-tron’s processing unit, called the AR Creator, picks up raw data from the car’s front camera, radar sensor and GPS navigation to render display symbols at a rate of 60 frames per second and adapt them to the surrounding environment. The quality of these displays, shown via a bit of advanced smoke and mirrors on what Audi calls the EV&#8217;s &#8220;picture generation unit (PGU)&#8221; — basically, a lot of mirrors — will obviously be key to how well it works in real life. With only simulations to show for it currently, it’s not clear how well Audi will pull this off. A wider frame with dynamic symbols must deliver on its promise to show up “just as clearly as their real-life environment” otherwise they’ll become a hindrance to the driver, and if they don&#8217;t pull off the depth effect exactly, they could even cause driver discomfort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Q4 e-tron also features updated natural-language voice control, activated by saying “Hey Audi.” The new car will also ditch physical buttons on the steering wheel in favor of touch-sensitive ones. But with a haptic feedback loop, it’ll still feel somewhat like you’re pressing a button. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://insideevs.com/news/465756/2020-audi-etron-electric-car-sales/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 3% of the company’s sales in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or 47,000 vehicles, were the electric e-tron SUV and the e-tron Sportback, a number that will surely increase as the company continues to roll out luxury EVs. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mobilecoin.com/">MobileCoin</a>, a cryptocurrency that has received technical guidance from Moxie Marlinspike, the creator of private messaging app Signal, has raised $11.35 million in fresh venture funding across two rounds from Future Ventures and General Catalyst.</p>
<p>The round, shared with us by a source familiar with the company, seems to suggest the cryptocurrency is one step closer to its possible use on the Signal platform, where it does not appear to be available currently.</p>
<p>We were unable to reach Marlinspike today. MobileCoin founder Joshua Goldbard, who lists himself as &#8220;janitor&#8221; of MobileCoin on LinkedIn, declined to answer questions this afternoon after being reached on Signal. Investors pointed us back to the company when asked about how MobileCoin compares to other crypto-related outfits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was back in 2017 that Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/">first profiled</a> MobileCoin, describing it as on a mission to overcome many of the early, and in some cases, lingering, challenges with cryptocurrencies, including that they&#8217;re too complicated for most people and merchants to use, they aren&#8217;t adequately scalable and transaction times take too long.</p>
<p>For example, Dapper Labs, the company behind the ventures CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot, developed its own blockchain and &#8220;Flow&#8221; token last year owing to scalability issues it encountered with Ethereum, as well as its interest in developing a platform that was more &#8220;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/the-team-behind-cryptokitties-is-one-step-closer-to-leaving-ethereum">consumer oriented</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time, Wired noted that while it &#8220;may feel like the last thing the world needs is yet another cryptocurrency&#8221; &#8212; there are now <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/">more than 4,000</a> of them in digital circulation &#8212;  Marlinspike&#8217;s track record with Signal &#8220;makes this a project worth watching.&#8221;</p>
<p>Based on its website, MobileCoin&#8217;s ambition appears to be focused around privacy-protecting payments made through &#8220;near instantaneous transactions&#8221; over one&#8217;s phone, even while the risks involved in storing cryptocurrency on a phone include potentially losing that value if the phone is left unlocked or the radio on the phone is hacked or if, say, iOS itself is hacked. (It happens, despite the robust permissions system that iOS uses to grant apps access to particular services and information.)</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;PayPal to acquire cryptocurrency security startup Curv&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/paypal-to-acquire-cryptocurrency-custody-startup-curv/embed/#?secret=pLtS6cy5dR" data-secret="pLtS6cy5dR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>According to the site, one feature of MobileCoin is that it allows users to &#8220;securely recover&#8221; their wallet if they lose their phone, though it isn&#8217;t immediately clear how without trusting a provider with private keys, which MobileCoin says isn&#8217;t necessary. (More on this soon, presumably.)</p>
<p>If MobileCoin becomes a de facto way to transact over Signal &#8212; Goldbard and Marlinspike told Wired they envisioned it first as an integration in chat apps like Signal or WhatsApp &#8212; its reach could potentially be massive.</p>
<p>Though Signal doesn&#8217;t disclose how many users are on the platform, an estimated <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/signal-statistics/">40 million people</a> now use its encrypted messaging app, which saw a surge in downloads earlier this year, in the waning days of the Trump presidency. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">According to Sensor Tower, which provides mobile app analytics, Signal was downloaded 17.8 million times during the week of January 5, compared to the 50,000 downloads per day it typically sees.</span></p>
<p>Still, if heavy use over Signal is how MobileCoin aims to gain value, the currency &#8212; which became <a href="https://ftx.com/trade/MOB/USD">available</a> to purchase on the exchange FTX after launching on the platform in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/mobilecoin-mainnet-launch-ftx-trading">early December</a> &#8212; would seemingly have an upward battle.</p>
<p>While Marlinspike&#8217;s early involvement is a definite plus, cryptocurrencies and messaging apps haven&#8217;t historically mixed well together, owing to regulators. Kik Messenger, the mobile messaging app founded by a group of University of Waterloo students in 2009, created a digital currency called Kin for its users to spend inside the platform. The project ultimately led to a years-long battle with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission that nearly decimated the company, though it&#8217;s currently mounting a comeback.</p>
<p>(In fairness to MobileCoin, which has turned to venture capitalists, Kik tried raising money from Kin through an initial coin offering or ICO, a relatively untested and unregulated type of funding mechanism at the time.)</p>
<p>Telegram, a much bigger messaging app than Signal &#8212; it had an estimated 400 million users as of last April &#8212; similarly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256407/telegram-cryptocurrency-shutdown-sec-gram">abandoned plans</a> to offer its own decentralized cryptocurrency to anyone with a smartphone after years of battling with the SEC. Like Kik, part of Telegram&#8217;s drama dated to early sales of its tokens through ICOs.</p>
<p>Even Facebook, despite scaling back more ambitious plans around a new cryptocurrency and resolving instead to launch a single digital coin backed by the dollar, hasn&#8217;t launched anything yet, though it&#8217;s expected soon.</p>
<div id="node-0" class="article-pharagraph">
<p class="text">Possibly, MobileCoin simply plans to operate outside of the U.S. Indeed, in December, according to a public post on Medium, the MobileCoin Foundation <a href="https://mobilecoinfoundation.medium.com/mobilecoin-main-net-8e355d82c726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote </a>that the project is not available to U.S. users or “persons or entities in other prohibited jurisdictions.”</p>
<p>Either way, the new round is not, notably, MobileCoin&#8217;s first outside round. In May 2018, it disclosed in an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739466/000173946618000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filing</a> that it had raised a $29.7 million from investors. Reportedly, Binance Labs, the venture arm of the cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance, <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/binance-labs-leads-30-million-fundraising-mobilecoin/">led that financing</a>.</p>
