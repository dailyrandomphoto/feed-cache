<p>The company has already declined to comment, and the sources cautioned the effort was still early and could change.However, Instagram leader Adam Mosseri said in December that his social network was &#8220;actively exploring&#8221; NFTs.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.workplace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workplace</a>, the app owned and originally built by Facebook (now Meta) as a version of the social network for enterprise employees to communicate with each other, has signed up upwards of 7 million users, finding traction in particular among multinational organizations with a mix of front-line, deskless and desk-based workers, as a way for management to stay connected to all of them, and for those employees to chat about work with each other. Now, it is gearing up to add in more functionality to enhance that usefulness: Workplace will soon be adding in an integration with <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp</a>, the popular messaging app with billions of users and also owned by Meta, so that Workplace customers can cross-post announcements and share other data with employees using the messaging app.</p>
<p>WhatsApp functionality is expected to go live sometime later this year. It sounds like messaging communication will be part of that initial launch, but the company is also working on ways of integrating other kinds of Workplace and productivity functionality into WhatsApp, such as integrating Shift Cover &#8212; a way for shift workers to swap shifts with each other other and keep managers and their planning systems in the loop, which was initially launched on Workplace back in <a href="https://en-gb.workplace.com/resources/news-updates/november-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Ujjwal Singh, the head of Workplace, would not be specific about the exact timing, explaining that there are still &#8220;working through the details&#8221; of how it will function, with some decisions still being made, the focus being how best to leverage what is in its DNA a consumer app as an enterprise service.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259947" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is something we&#8217;d been working on for a while,&#8221; he said in an interview, noting that even though the two have been a part of the same stable under Facebook, the different business announcements that WhatsApp has been making, for example <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-doubles-down-on-business-tools-with-whatsapp-api-updates-login-connect-for-messenger-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding the WhatsApp API</a> last year, needed to be in place first. It&#8217;s also been working with customers to build the feature. &#8220;We want to be careful about what goes out to a consumer app. We wanted to do this in a way that was safe for companies to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move to bring more business usage to WhatsApp and more functionality into Workplace are both a long time coming but fit with the broader strategies for both products, and with Meta&#8217;s strategy as a whole.</p>
<p>On the Meta front, the company has been on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messenger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">years-long mission</a> to bring its various apps closer together both as customer-facing services and at the back end. That strategy has included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrating Messenger with Instagram&#8217;s messaging feature</a> so that consumers could communicate across the apps; and it&#8217;s also had a business/commercial focus, giving companies that use WhatsApp for Business the ability to initiate contacts on, say, Facebook, and <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/how-to-message-a-business-on-whatsapp-from-their-facebook-shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue conversations more directly over WhatsApp</a>. Those efforts have not been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/02/facebook-warned-over-privacy-risks-of-merging-messaging-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncontroversial</a>, although gradually they have been rolled out nevertheless.</p>
<p>This brings not just more activity to the different platforms, but creates more reasons to sway businesses to advertise, use premium products like WhatsApp for Business, and generally carry out more commercial activities across Meta. They are also potentially building out a bigger use case for Meta as more than just a consumer product that is based around advertising across its apps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Workplace started out in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/10/facebook-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early days</a> as essentially Facebook&#8217;s answer to the rise of Slack: why let an upstart eat our enterprise lunch, the thinking went, when so many people are already using Facebook for non-work interactions (and some work ones), and our own employees have proven that it&#8217;s possible to use Facebook for work chit-chat and planning?</p>
<p>Longer term, it seems that this original thesis didn&#8217;t quite carry out as Facebook had thought it would: initially it brought in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/06/facebook-workplace-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of integrations</a>, similar to those you might find on Slack, to position Workplace as a useful productivity hub, and to that it added a lot of native functionality around collaboration and communication for knowledge workers. But more recently, it seems to have shifted focus somewhat.</p>
<p>First of all, products like Slack and Teams from Microsoft continued to stick around and grow their reputations &#8212; a shift that Workplace has followed by working more closely with those platforms. (Most recently, with a <a href="https://www.workplace.com/blog/workplace-and-microsoft-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teams integration</a> for video and other features.) Second of all, it&#8217;s found a new wave of users among those who are &#8220;deskless&#8221;, front-line and other customer-facing workers who are not sitting at computers all day, but on the go, with mobile phones being their primary way of interacting with their managers, colleagues and organizations overall.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;A lot of frontline workers outside the US are using consumer tools like WhatsApp to get work done,&#8221; Singh said. &#8220;We have data that says using WhatsApp for shift management is just part of it. The data shows that frontline workers feel disconnected from executives making decisions, and so that is the key point of this integration.&#8221; He&#8217;s referring here to new research the company is also releasing today that supports how Workplace is developing. If found that ju</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">st over half (54%) of frontline workers said they felt connected to their organization’s HQ &#8212; one reason why it sees an opportunity to build out Workplace, and WhatsApp as a way to bridge that gap. </span></p>
<p>Longer term, this WhatsApp integration, and the wider shift that the company is making to serve deskless workers, are positioning Workplace among a new wave of apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/blink-a-productivity-app-aimed-at-frontline-workers-raises-20m-at-a-100m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blink</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/yoobic-raises-50m-for-its-chat-and-communications-app-app-aimed-at-frontline-and-service-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoobic</a> targeting front-line employees and their specific requirements and functions in the workplace. It will be interesting to see whether Facebook chooses to remain a simple messaging and communications tool in that mix or whether it starts to build more features to cater specifically to those users. It&#8217;s a crowded field, with others also vying for customers in this space including When I Work — which last year raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/when-i-work-an-messaging-app-that-lets-shift-based-teams-schedule-work-and-more-raises-200m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/homebase-raises-71m-for-a-team-management-platform-aimed-at-smbs-and-their-hourly-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebase</a>, which raised $71 million; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/workiz-locks-in-13m-for-productivity-tools-aimed-at-home-services-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workiz</a>, which focuses on home services pros; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/workwhile-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WorkWhile</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/crew-a-workplace-and-slack-messaging-rival-for-shift-workers-raises-35m-adds-enterprise-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crew</a> (which <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-acquires-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Square acquired</a> last year); and <a href="https://www.justworkshours.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justworks</a> (which in September 2021 filed to go public).</p>

<p>To help companies do this more effectively, <a href="https://diversio.com/">Diversio</a> is using artificial intelligence technology, data analytics and knowledgeable subject matter experts to find where the company’s process is breaking down and create a comprehensive action plan to get it back on track.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $6.5 million in Series A funding from a group of investors including First Round Capital, Golden Ventures and Chandaria Family Holdings.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259673" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Laura McGee, co-founder and CEO, started the company in 2018 after doing diversity and inclusion consulting for corporate clients and the government that led her to do a lot of CEO roundtables. She kept hearing from them that while diversity was well understood, they didn’t know how to do it.</p>
<p>“We said, ‘we hear you,’ but there were no metrics or accountability, and those were the kinds of tools that will help us set targets and then actually drive change,” McGee told TechCrunch. “From our perspective, this is a software solution. This has got to be something that companies use on an ongoing basis, is tied to business records and ultimately provides evidence-based recommendations.”</p>
<p>Diversio’s software takes in survey data from employees and uses natural language processing algorithms to analyze the data. From that feedback, Diversio can identify specific problems that are preventing diverse employees from doing their best work. Then the company matches those pain points to action items pulled from a recommendation engine of 1,600 validated programs and policies from around the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series A is the company’s first institutional funding after raising $60,000 from angel investors and bootstrapping the company. In fact, fundraising for this particular business case was a challenge until she met Meka Asonye, partner at First Round. The questions in 2018 were around if companies would spend money in this area, McGee said.</p>
<p>Then in 2020, the world changed, particularly surrounding the death of George Floyd. That, and for a variety of reasons, diversity and inclusion were recognized as a critical business — and rightly so, McGee explained.</p>
<p>“Customers are expecting companies to take action, and investors are starting to ask questions when they allocate capital,” she added. “And then equally the risk is becoming ever greater. If as a company you undergo a scandal, there is really nothing that can bring you down faster.”</p>
<p>Since launching in 2018, Diversio has grown 300% year over year. Over the past 12 months, the company doubled its customers and is now working with about 400 customers, many that have come through working with investors across their portfolios, McGee said.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to invest in its team. The company currently has 35 employees, and McGee’s plan is to double that by the end of the year, especially in the company’s new offices in London and New York. It will also work on product development, including more targeted and customized data analysis and the recommendation engine.</p>

<p>Next up, McGee expects to grow the company’s international footprint in Europe and the U.K. and grow more in North America. Diversio is also working on getting additional partnerships.</p>
<p>“The 30% Club is one example, and investors are another,” McGee added. “Our vision is establishing a set of inclusion metrics that are widely adopted and creating a platform and a system that allows companies to really learn from one another in order to refine the recommendation.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, First Round’s Asonye said when talking to Diversio customers, they would tell him that they know they have a diversity and inclusion problem and didn’t know where to start, but having a platform like Diversio helped them not only measure, but then act, was a differentiator from other companies in the market.</p>
<p>And at a time when a lot of companies are raising money because it is a convenient time in the market, or they are raising money because they have to, it was “impressive” to see the way Diversio was able grow to the size and scope it did and to get to the number of customers essentially as a bootstrapped company, he added.</p>
<p>“One of the other really interesting things about the business is that this is a problem that hits medium companies, small companies and big companies, and despite the fact that you would think somebody would have this figured out, that&#8217;s not the case,” Asonye added. “They have the high-growth tech companies that go from 50 to 200 and start asking if they should be thinking about values.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A cyberattack targeting a contractor working for the International Committee of the Red Cross has spilled confidential data on more than 500,000 &#8220;highly vulnerable&#8221; people, many of whom have been separated from their families due to conflict, migration and disaster.</p>
<p>The Red Cross did not name the contractor, based in Switzerland, which it uses to store data nor say what led to the security incident, but said that the data comes from at least 60 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies.</p>
<p>In a statement, the international organization pleaded with the attackers not to publicly share or leak the information given the sensitivity of the data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259963" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Your actions could potentially cause yet more harm and pain to those who have already endured untold suffering. The real people, the real families behind the information you now have are among the world&#8217;s least powerful. Please do the right thing. Do not share, sell, leak or otherwise use this data,&#8221; read <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/sophisticated-cyber-attack-targets-red-cross-red-crescent-data-500000-people">the statement</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of the breach, the organization shut down its Restoring Family Links program, which aims to reunite family members separated by conflict or disaster.</p>
<p>International human rights groups and disaster relief agencies are an increasing target for hackers. Last year the United Nations had its <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/09/09/united-nations-hackers/">network breached</a> by unknown cyberattackers, and Microsoft revealed that the U.S. Agency for International Development <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/us/politics/russia-hack-usaid.html">was targeted</a> to launch malicious emails to thousands of targets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Customer service is making and breaking companies over the past two years as shopping moved online and consumers wanted more out of the traditional service companies were offering.</p>
<p><a href="https://zingtree.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zingtree</a> provides interactive contact center software that guides agents to the next best action so that they can cater to even the most discerning customer.</p>
<p>To continue developing its product, the company raised $15 million in Series A funding. Conductive Ventures led the round and was joined by Storm Ventures, Madrona and angel investors like Hilarie Koplow-McAdams. Existing investors participating in the round included Rally Ventures, Parade Ventures and Vitalize Ventures. The new investment brings the company’s total funding to $18.5 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Zingtree was founded in 2014 to make business information actionable for teams so that agents could quickly make decisions during complex service calls. Users leverage no-code “decision trees” to create detailed agent scripts, guide customers to solve their own issues and manage their internal processes at scale. As a result, agents are able to improve their average handling time, resolution and consumer satisfaction, Juan Jaysingh, CEO of Zingtree told TechCrunch via email.</p>
<p>“Unlike our competitors, business users can build and maintain Zingtree agent scripts without any IT or engineering development resources, and we have ready-built integrations for CRM systems so agents work out of one place, and our interface is so easy to use for agents that it requires little to no training,” Jaysingh added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Alpha Edison leads customer service platform Thankful’s $12M round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/alpha-edison-leads-customer-service-platform-thankfuls-12m-round/embed/#?secret=4zGgLBT3IO" data-secret="4zGgLBT3IO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company is the latest in the customer service sector to attract venture capital. For example, in the past few months, we’ve seen companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/alpha-edison-leads-customer-service-platform-thankfuls-12m-round/">Thankful</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/sanas-aims-to-convert-one-accent-to-another-in-real-time-for-smoother-customer-service-calls/">Sanas</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/zendesk-acquires-ai-automation-startup-cleverly-to-advance-customer-service/">Zendesk</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/level-ai-lands-13m-series-a-to-build-conversational-intelligence-for-customer-service/">Level AI</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/goodcall-picks-up-4m-yelp-partnership-to-answer-merchant-inbound-calls/">Goodcall</a> announce similar news.</p>
<p>Several drivers affected business and customer care processes over the past two years. For example, employee shortages due to COVID cases rising and “The Great Resignation.” Contact center agents now working at home could no longer rely on in-person subject matter experts, managers or experienced peers.</p>
<p>Jaysingh explained that the global pandemic, in particular, has put more onus on companies to improve their customer service capabilities. They are having to manage customers that become frustrated quickly and will leave a brand or enterprise quickly if they don’t get high-quality service at speed.</p>
<p>“This is negatively impacting companies’ revenues if they don’t solve for providing consistent high-quality service to their customers,” he added. “Not only has the pandemic accelerated remote-first culture, it is now seen as a competitive edge to acquire top-notch global talent.”</p>
<p>Zingtree’s enterprise annual recurring revenue grew three times in 2021 after growing two times in 2020. The company “is in striking distance” of profitability, but decided to prioritize growth in taking the latest capital raise, Jaysingh said. It was bootstrapped for six years before taking its first institutional seed funding in 2020 to scale the business.</p>
<p>It is working with more than 600 customers in 50 countries to make more than 15 million human decisions every month. Among the list are consumer brands and enterprise customers like SharkNinja, Groupon, Getty Images, Ricoh, Fossil and Experian.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Though Jaysingh did not give a specific valuation, he did say the new funding round was almost a five-time lift from the previous round a year ago.</p>
<p>He expects to invest heavily in building the Zingtree ,team with plans to double headcount across all departments. It has 46 employees currently after having 10 employees at the end of 2020. The new funding will enable the company to get to 70 by the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>The company will also deploy funds in product development to add enhancements like artificial intelligence and machine learning and data insight solutions and features, as well as build integrations and partnerships with even more contact center core technologies, like current partner Talkdesk.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Carey Lai, founder and managing director of Conductive Ventures, is joining Zingtree’s board of directors, along with Vikram Verma, former CEO of contact center communication platform 8&#215;8.</p>
<p>Lai told TechCrunch via email that Zingtree’s no-code solution was a differentiator from competitors due to its ease of use, while also offering sophisticated features and functionalities. He also was impressed by the company’s early customer traction in attracting top-tier customers and its experienced management team.</p>
<p>“Interesting companies are built when you combine the market opportunity paired with the experience, commitment and vision of the executive leadership team,” he added. “Zingtree is helping enterprises deliver on the promise of great customer support. Over the past seven years, businesses have repeatedly come to Zingtree to help their employees make better and faster decisions daily while still being able to follow standard operating procedures. That&#8217;s a game-changer for contact centers and support teams with complex products, strict compliance and the need to scale.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://codesee.io">CodeSee</a> is an aptly named startup, one that is building a set of tools to help developers understand how all the parts of a code base fit together. Today, the company announced a $7 million secondary seed on top of the $3 million it received in 2020. The round was led by new investors Wellington Access Ventures, Plexo Capital and Menlo Ventures along with several industry angels who had participated in the first seed investment.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder Shanea Leven says that her company is solving a problem of understanding the entire code base, something that every developer struggles with, no matter their level of experience, especially when they encounter a new code base.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always this feeling of dread and anxiety of just how overwhelming this is going to be, and how long is this going to take me before I can actually feel confident that I can make a meaningful contribution to this codebase,&#8221; she said, adding &#8220;No matter how experienced you are. You hit that moment, and you hit it all the time because the code base is actually changing from under you every day.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259946" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Leven says that the company has continued to grow and develop since we last spoke at the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/codesee-launches-oss-port-open-source-project-to-help-developers-visualize-code-base/">their open source OSS Port</a> project last September, and that they are getting closer to releasing a paid version of the product, which is being tested with companies now.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IIscuzlogR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/codesee-launches-oss-port-open-source-project-to-help-developers-visualize-code-base/">CodeSee launches OSS Port open source project to help developers visualize code base</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;CodeSee launches OSS Port open source project to help developers visualize code base&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/codesee-launches-oss-port-open-source-project-to-help-developers-visualize-code-base/embed/#?secret=IIscuzlogR" data-secret="IIscuzlogR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We are getting much closer to [completing] a teams and enterprise offering, which is what we are currently working on right now,&#8221; she said. They are also working on a new tool called Review Maps, which makes it easier to visualize changes to the code base in GitHub. Instead of an alphabetical list of the changed files, which doesn&#8217;t actually help understand how the files changed or how they relate to the whole, they get a map of the changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;So when you go to make your meaningful contribution, like you&#8217;re going to go write your first pull request, which is your first code change, we can visualize your change in the context of the rest of your codebase.&#8221; This becomes even more crucial in large, complex projects where hundreds of changes are being pushed a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gets really daunting when you see a code review that has 600 files changed&#8230;and so what most people do when your code review gets that that big is they just don&#8217;t review it. But with us you can, since now you can see your changes. You can zoom out to see the bigger picture. You can kind of see what kind of impact overall your change is going to have to the code base. And that is making developers really happy,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company currently has 13 employees with plans to add 5 or 6 more this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneur John Roa believes in the value of privacy. After selling his design consultancy, ÄKTA, to Salesforce in 2015, he decided to spend a few years “off the grid” on an island in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, he’s back in New York City, launching <a href="https://www.caden.io/">Caden</a>, a startup that allows consumers to share their data with companies and get paid for it in return. Roa wrote the business plan in the form of a thesis on the future of data privacy while he was working at Salesforce, right before he began his sabbatical, he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he first wrote the business plan, it was “purely speculative,” Roa said. He anticipated that regulation would present challenges for companies in storing third-party, or passively collected, data, and envisioned a long-term shift to a “privacy-first” world where users own their personal data and have full control and consent over its use. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259844" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caden, which just came out of stealth mode with a $3.4 million pre-seed round, is Roa’s attempt towards building this world. Jerry Yang, cofounder of TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company, Yahoo!, participated in the round alongside Starwood Capital’s Barry Sternlicht, former Citigroup CTO Don Callahan, and other angel investors, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259849" style="width: 408px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259849" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2259849" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="398" height="265" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg 5252w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259849" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Caden founder John Roa<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Caden</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company calls itself a “zero-party” data platform, which means users share data with brands only on a voluntary basis. One of its core products is an encrypted “on-device vault” where a user can store their personal data and see insights drawn from it – a feature Roa compared to Spotify’s “Year in Review” but spanning a broader set of preferences and behaviors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caden’s second core product is an API called Link, which allows users to connect to accounts like their e-mail or bank and extract their data to store in the vault. Once it’s in the vault, the user can then opt to give permission to specific companies they trust to use the data, and can revoke or alter the permissions at any time because users ultimately own their data stored with Caden, Roa said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roa’s team started working on the technology nine months ago, and plans to bring its beta mobile application to market in the next six months. It will allow users to immediately begin receiving compensation for their data, Roa said, likening the app to a savings account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of US states have either passed or are considering legislation similar to the </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a state law enacted in 2018 that gives consumers the right to opt out of allowing companies to sell their personal information. Although companies have collected third-party data about their users for years, Roa said regulation is turning third-party data collection into “more of a liability than an asset” for companies because of onerous audit and compliance requirements. Zero-party data, he added, is more accurate and robust because it comes directly from the user.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caden hopes to attract consumer brands first because they have the most to gain through better access to data, investor Jerry Yang told TechCrunch in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you think about how much effort and resources are required to collect and store data, infer insights, protect it, buy third-party data, and keep it all current, Caden is creating a platform solution that allows many companies to tap into without doing it themselves. Beyond the first phase, I’m confident that Caden can also go beyond consumer companies,” Yang wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caden isn’t the first company to make a foray into this space. Datacoup tried it back in 2012 with its platform that allowed users to sell their data directly to companies, and </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-andrew-yangs-plan-to-pay-you-for-your-data-doesnt-add-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ended up shutting down in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because users were only making paltry sums of money. Consumer data is difficult to value, and companies are incentivized to find ways to pay as little as possible for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roa believes Caden will be able to surmount these challenges by providing a superior user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While brands are not generally eager to give users their data back, Roa said, &#8220;now, they legally have to, but they don&#8217;t have to make it easy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What Caden and others are doing is devising ways to make that a much more streamlined process that is completely user-driven, so we don&#8217;t actually need the third-party companies to elicit that action back,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also wants to unlock intangible value for consumers through better brand experiences, not just direct payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If by using Caden your life just becomes a little more enjoyable, things are catered to you, and you&#8217;re being spoken to – it&#8217;s those value points that we&#8217;re focused on. And this is where a lot of our contemporaries have struggled,” Roa said.</span></p>

It will offer brands consumers &#8220;know and love,&#8221; according to Amazon, and an app will let you choose an item, size and color and send it directly to a fitting room or pickup counter. The first store is coming to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23676409011" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">The Americana at Brand</a> in Los Angeles sometime &#8220;later this year,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Amazon said it will offer &#8220;hundreds of brands&#8221; chosen by fashion creators and &#8220;feedback provided by millions of customers shopping on Amazon.com.&#8221; It didn&#8217;t specify which, but its online store currently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/luxury/page/AFE3EE04-D5A9-4B33-868A-630812FC42CC?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ref_=sv__2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">carries</a> products from designers like Oscar de la Renta, Altuzarra and La Perla. However, many luxury and high-end brands have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-25-amazon-fashion.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">resisted</a> listing goods online with Amazon.</p>

<p>The stores will offer double the number of styles of traditional stores, while not forcing customers to search manually for the right size or color. Instead, if you see a clothing item you like, you can scan its QR code using the Amazon Shopping App to see sizes, colors, customer ratings and other details. You can then send it to the fitting room or directly to the pickup counter if you don&#8217;t need to try it on. As you might expect, it also uses an AI-powered algorithm to recommend more products based on what you&#8217;ve already picked.</p>
<p>You can open the fitting room door using the app, with all the items you&#8217;ve picked inside. Each one offers a touchscreen that lets you continue shopping and request new items to try on without having to leave. They&#8217;ll then arrive in &#8220;minutes&#8221; thanks to tech that Amazon also uses in its fulfillment centers.</p>
<p>You can feel free to buy items online that you found in the store, with the same prices in both places. Items can be returned in store, and any item you&#8217;ve scanned will be saved in the shopping app so you can revisit it later.</p>
<p>Amazon has already opened a number of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fresh-woodland-hills-la-open-to-public-200248518.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Fresh grocery stores</a>, along with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-02-amazon-books-seattle.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">book stores</a> and even a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-hair-salon-ar-color-bar-121013314.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">hair salon</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, a fintech unicorn known for its APIs that connect consumer bank accounts to financial applications, announced today that it is buying <a href="https://cognitohq.com/">Cognito</a>. The price is around $250 million, paid in a blend of cash and stock TechCrunch understands, though we couldn&#8217;t suss out the exact mix of each.</p>
<p>The deal highlights where Plaid is heading in its post-Visa form. Recall that the company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/">previously intended</a> to sell itself to the consumer credit giant before the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">deal ran into a regulatory wall</a>; since then Plaid has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/plaid-raises-425m-series-d-from-altimeter-as-it-charts-a-post-visa-future/">raised capital and expanded its valuation</a> by a factor of around four.</p>
<p>Cognito is an interesting buy for Plaid, offering verification services for the fintech world, which is distinct from what its acquirer is best known for. In practice, Cognito offers ID verification, along with help with thorny issues like know your customer (KYC) rules, and anti-money laundering requirements.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259799" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If you deal with money in motion, there&#8217;s work to do behind the scenes to ensure that your service is not facilitating nefarious activity, for example. (Unless, naturally, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/outrageous-hsbc-settlement-proves-the-drug-war-is-a-joke-230696/">your company is named HSBC</a>.) By buying Cognito &#8212; the acquiring entity is bringing aboard all of the smaller firm&#8217;s staff, including its three co-founders &#8212; Plaid is layering more services atop its core remit of consumer bank account connections via developer hooks.</p>
<p>Plaid&#8217;s API work puts it in between consumers, and a host of financial applications and services. That&#8217;s a lucrative, important, and I would add sticky place to be &#8212; all good things for a business. But why merely shuttle data back and forth, when it is possible to do more?</p>
<p>Recall that Plaid bought another startup called Flannel last year, in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/plaid-moves-further-payments-march-acquihire-flannel-fintech-2021-6">what Insider described</a> as a push into the payments world; the company, flush with external cash and with equity worth north of $13 billion to use in deals, is adding to its roster of services that it can offer customers.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Plaid CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/zachperret">Zach Perret</a> and Cognito CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/alain">Alain Meier</a> (previously of <a href="https://t.co/IIZsk7uhZZ">Bloom</a>) about the transaction. Meier said that the talks started off as a chat about a partnership that evolved into a sale; per Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cognito-5ed4">data indicates that</a> Cognito raised single-digit millions while independent, meaning that its exit price was likely attractive to its investors and staff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For Plaid the deal makes sense from a number of angles. First, the issue of verifying users for fintech applications is, per Meier, an &#8220;extremely complex problem.&#8221; That means that Plaid can get past building all of what Cognito has thus far with its checkbook. And with Plaid customers asking for ways to more quickly onboard users per Perret, Plaid knew that it had customer demand for what the smaller company had built; buying Cognito means that Plaid can instantly layer on another service to its already growing customer base.</p>
<p>From that perspective, the deal is something akin to Microsoft acquiring an enterprise software company, knowing that it can sell its product via existing channels and customer relationships. By selling to Plaid, Cognito can likely scale its in-market footprint far more quickly than it could have by itself. Plaid, the company shared with TechCrunch via email, has around 5,500 customers today, a rich vein for Cognito to mine now under the larger company&#8217;s aegis.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Perret about where Plaid is heading from a product perspective. Our hunch, given the Cognito deal, was that it intends to build an ever-wider cadre of services that customers of its core product can add as they will to their existing contracts. As Cognito will be priced as an add-on, our thesis felt directionally correct.</p>
<p>The CEO noted that Plaid had launched a product called &#8220;Signal&#8221; <a href="https://plaid.com/blog/highlights-from-day-1-at-plaid-forum/">recently</a>, aimed at helping reduce fraud as an example of what the company has been working on in recent quarters. Plaid has also built a <a href="https://my.plaid.com/">consumer portal</a> where end-users can check their various connection points.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s illustrative. Plaid&#8217;s work to build more services atop its core product &#8212; which feels very similar to the product work that <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe has done</a> on top and adjacent to its payments nucleus &#8212; doesn&#8217;t appear to be merely a push to better support business customers. It has a consumer play in the mix as well. I would add at this juncture that the company remains, in our view, a firmly B2B company today.</p>
<p>Still, you can imagine what could be coming in the future. If consumers use Plaid as the de facto way to connect to the larger web of fintech and finservices products, and the company provides a central hub, or source of truth, it could build relationships with myriad individuals. That would give it sway on both ends of the fintech-user relationship, a powerful place to sit.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping that Plaid dreams big and uses its relationships on both sides of the app-user coin to do lots. Like, say, reinvent credit scoring. That would be a net-good for individuals everywhere.</p>
<p>Regardless, the Cognito deal is not the final acquisition that we anticipate from Plaid before its eventual public offering. More when we have it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By adding some electrodes and some electronics to your earbuds, <a href="https://www.wisear.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisear</a> can make your music experience a lot more hands-free than before. Bite down on your own teeth twice to pause a track, or three times to skip to the next tune &#8212; without making a noise, hand gesture or much visible movement at all, the technology enables you to interact with your music players or AR/VR headsets without needing to nudge any switches. The founders are envisioning that this is particularly helpful in scenarios where you have your hands full, or if it&#8217;s too loud for typical voice commands.</p>
<p>The company today revealed that it raised a total of €2 million (around $2.5 million), with a goal of licencing its technology to existing headset and headphone manufacturers. The round was led by Paris Business Angels and Kima Ventures, with the support of BPI France.</p>
<p>Wisear showed me its neural interface: By using the aforementioned electrodes to record the brain and facial activity, its patent-pending AI technology transforms these signals into controls that let the user take actions. The company is pretty skeptical of its competitors, and suggests that other &#8220;control by thought&#8221; startups are trying to pull the proverbial wool over our eyes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258236" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Anyone that tells you today that they&#8217;re doing thought control or mind control, or whatsoever, are basically twisting the truth for you,&#8221; explains Yacine Achiakh, co-founder at Wisear, &#8220;If they really have something, then honestly take all your money and give it to them, because it will revolutionize everything. It was quite frustrating for us: We realized people that were saying mind control either had a demo that would work in a very specific setup, when there is no noise around; people are not moving; it&#8217;s sunny outside; and it&#8217;s the right temperature.&#8221;</p>
<p>To overcome the &#8220;it works in the lab&#8221; syndrome, the company went back to the drawing board, and created a new set of tech with off-the-shelf components. The idea is to build a prototype of the technology that works well enough to show it off, and then licence the tech to headphone and AR/VR headset manufacturers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that the hardest part in trying to do anything brain based was actually generalizing it across users and making it work in any environment. We took a step back and we decided that the neural interface would first be based on muscle and eye activity. The main controls we have are based on jaw activity,&#8221; says Achiakh &#8220;We have sensors on the earpiece that can capture your jaw muscle movement, and transform it into controls. You don&#8217;t need to make any noise whatsoever. And our goal for 2022 is to have two controls: double and triple clench of the jaw. The goal is to scale this to 12 controls in the next three years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s founder showed off the company&#8217;s tech on a video call last week, and it was, in a word, impressive. The headphones were not confused by noises, movement or anything else the Achiakh did while speaking with me. When biting down on his own teeth &#8212; jaw clenching, you might call it &#8212; the audio player paused and resumed the demo music.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The tech isn&#8217;t quite ready for prime time yet, but the success rate is rather high.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are building the first technology that really works for everyone. At our booth at CES, we managed to have the demo work for around 80% of people who tried it &#8212; and we are working to improve that further,&#8221; says Achiakh. &#8220;We are building the only neural interface that can work today. Muscular activity is the real new interface that you can build in 2022.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.greenlabs.co.kr/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Greenlabs</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a South Korean agtech startup, announced this week it has closed a $140 million Series C led by <a href="http://www.brvcap.com/">BRV Capital Management</a>, with participation from <a href="http://www.skylakeincuvest.com/kor/index.php">Skylake Incuvest</a> and <a href="https://www.sksquare.com/eng/index.do">SK Square</a>.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup plans to use the Series C, which brings its total raised to $170 million to date, to expedite its global expansion, make acquisitions and increase its headcount, Charlie Sanghoon Shin, co-founder and CEO of Greenlabs, told TechCrunch. Greenlabs’ pre-money valuation was around $700 million, according to a source familiar with the situation. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Greenlabs, founded in 2017 by Scott Sungwoo Choi, Shin and Luke Donghyun Ahn, wants to digitize the entire value chain of agriculture space from crop production to distribution with a mission to address the global food supply problem in a sustainable way.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259908" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Greenlabs empowers farmers to have better control over their fresh produce and helps enterprises customers have reliable sourcing channels. The startup offers services including “Farm Morning,” an app that aggregates reliable data using AI, giving more than 500,000 farmers insight into crop lifecycle, and “Sinsun Market,” a B2B fresh produce marketplace for over 10,000 enterprise buyers, the company said. It also built smart farming software and hardware for farmers. Smart farming refers to managing farms using technologies like internet of things, robotics and artificial intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Seoul-based firm has expanded to China and Vietnam with its smart farm technologies since 2021. It also plans to </span>penetrate to other overseas countries this year by forming strategic partnerships with local agtech and foodtech players, which play similar strategies to Greenlabs, Shin said. Also, the startup is open for collaboration to speed up the process of resolving the global food supply problems, Shin added.</p>
<p>Its comparable peers include <a href="https://www.fbn.com/">Farmers Business Network</a>, Climate Corporation,<a href="https://www.indigoag.com/"> Indigo Ag</a> and <a href="https://www.ninjacart.in/">Ninjacart</a> in the global market, the company said.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Greenlabs currently has 320 employees, Shin noted. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Greenlabs has quickly realized the digital agriculture through Farm Morning and Sinsun Market services in Korea, and we are all well poised to become a unicorn within five years since the foundation. We hope to contribute to resolving the global food supply system issues with other like-minded players,” Shin said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moroccan B2B e-commerce and retail startup <a href="https://chari.co/">Chari</a> confirmed to TechCrunch that it has secured a bridge round at a $100 million valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bridge round welcomed new investors Khwarizmi Ventures, Air Angels and Afri Mobility, the venture capital arm of AKWA Group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They join existing investors (Y Combinator, Rocket Internet, Global Founders Capital, Plug n Play, Orange Ventures, Harvard University Management Company, Village Capital and P1 Ventures) who invested in Chari&#8217;s $5 million seed round last October <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/chari-a-moroccan-startup-digitizing-mom-and-pop-stores-raises-5m-at-70m-valuation/">at $70 million</a>. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259818" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many startups playing in the B2B e-commerce space across the continent, Chari digitizes the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fragmented FMCG sector in Morocco and Tunisia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chari operates as a mobile app, allowing small retailers in these two countries to order products from partnering FMCG multinationals and local manufacturers and get items in less than 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last October, the YC-backed company</span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2021/morocco-ecommerce-startup-chari-ma-acquires-mobile-credit-book-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired Moroccan ledger book Karny.ma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Khatabook-esque platform provides credit and bookkeeping services to about 50,000 merchants. It allows these merchants to handle the credit they give to their clients.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chari, a Moroccan startup digitizing mom and pop stores, raises $5M at $70M valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/chari-a-moroccan-startup-digitizing-mom-and-pop-stores-raises-5m-at-70m-valuation/embed/#?secret=n35vW2ZAws" data-secret="n35vW2ZAws" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://karny.ma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karny</a> acquisition and bridge round fits into Chari&#8217;s strategy to provide payment facilities. It puts the company in a sweet position to offer financial services, particularly buy now, pay later, to its retailers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chari will use the money of this bridge round to test the BNPL services with its existing customers. Upon successful results, Chari will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a local credit company to enable shop owners to lend money to their end-users and further grow their business,&#8221; said chief executive</span><a href="https://ma.linkedin.com/in/belkhayat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ismael Belkhayat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karny gives Chari valuable data on the loans provided by grocery stores to their customers and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows Chari to credit-assess the unbanked shop owners, determining the most applicable payment terms to give each</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in essence, Karny data allows Chari to find out about the items sold by the shop owners to their end clients and the amount lent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Through its internal closed-loop digital wallet, Chari will now offer payment terms and BNPL options to some of its shop owners based on their date of registration, order frequency, average basket order and amount of money lent to their end consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belkhayat, who founded the company with </span><a href="https://ma.linkedin.com/in/sophia-alj-40333960" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophia Alj</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> said Chari has selected a few shop owners to test run this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Based on the four criteria, merchants can</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have a negative balance on their digital wallets; the ceiling is between -$100 to -$500 and no more than 30 days without charge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once it gets operations right in Morocco, Chari plans to expand this BNPL service to Tunisia and other French-speaking countries in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BNPL services are starting to experience strong growth in Africa due to the rapid penetration of e-commerce and the effects of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several BNPL services cater to consumers, such as Nigeria&#8217;s Carbon Zero, South Africa&#8217;s Payflex (</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/zip-acquisition-of-payflex-means-africa-is-ripe-for-bnpl-disruption/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently acquired by Australian BNPL Zip</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and Kenya&#8217;s LipaLater (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/kenyan-bnpl-startup-lipa-later-eyes-more-african-markets-after-raising-12-million/">recently raised $12 million</a> in equity and debt). Others serve businesses like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/tradedepot-raises-110m-from-ifc-novastar-to-extend-bnpl-service-to-merchants-across-africa/">TradeDepot</a>, a Nigerian company similar to Chari, while some make infrastructural plays like Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/nigerias-thankucash-secures-5-3m-to-build-infrastructure-for-cashback-deals-and-bnpl-services/">ThankUCash</a>.</span></p>
<p>Usually, companies raise debt financing for their BNPL initiatives; most of the players, as mentioned above, have done so. But Chari opted not to. According to <span style="font-weight: 400;">Belkhayat,</span> the reason was that the debt venture funds Chari was in talks with wanted to charge the company as high as 15% in interest rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since this is just a pilot, I prefer to raise the money at a high valuation from funds that could help me with my strategy. I get a little diluted, but in exchange, I get a lot of help from experienced founders,&#8221; he said, explaining Chari&#8217;s high valuation at seed level and why it only raised equity. &#8220;Once the pilot succeeds, I will need much more funding for my working capital requirement and will raise debt instead of diluting equity.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mention-me.com/">Mention Me</a>, a platform to generate customer referrals, has raised a $25m Series B round, led by London’s Octopus Ventures. Eight Roads Ventures, the lead investor from the prior round, a $7 million Series A in a 2018, also participated.<br />
 <br />
The London-based startup helps businesses turn referrals into a channel for acquiring customers, while also gathering data for other marketing activities.<br />
 <br />
Mention Me now plans to expand into the US, and develop its product offering.</p>
<p>Customers include Puma, Pret a Manger, InsurTech Bought By Many, Bloom &amp; Wild and ASOS.</p>
<p>Its competitors include Friendbuy (raised $1.8M), Talkable (raised $4.2M), Extole (raised $28.7M) and Yotpo (raised $436M).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259753" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Andy Cockburn, CEO and Co-Founder of Mention Me said: “With third-party data disappearing, paid social delivering diminishing returns and consumers increasingly overwhelmed by endless brand advertising, our technology puts advocacy at the heart of marketing to reconnect marketers and consumers. The most successful brands are realizing how this can drive growth, increasing customer acquisition and returns across the marketing activity spectrum.”</p>
<p>Octopus Ventures Principal Uthish Ranjan, who will join Mention Me’s board, commented: “Mention Me’s pioneering approach to customer advocacy and impressive growth trajectory is creating a new strategic channel of marketing technology. We believe the team is well-positioned to accelerate its growth in the changing world of marketing, and we look forward to supporting its international expansion.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://terraquantum.swiss/">Terra Quantum</a>, a Zurich, Switzerland-based startup that aims to build a Quantum-as-a-Service platform (including, eventually, its own proprietary quantum hardware), today announced that it has raised a $60 million Series A round led by <a href="https://www.lakestar.com/">Lakestar</a>, which also backed the company&#8217;s 2019 seed round. The additional investors in this round prefer to remain anonymous. According to Terra, they include two of the largest and globally renowned German family offices and one of the most influential cryptocurrency investors globally.</p>
<p>The idea behind Terra Quantum is to build a new end-to-end quantum platform. With its own quantum chips still a couple of years out, this currently means the company focuses on offering a library of quantum algorithms to its customers and quantum security tools, including a quantum key distribution service.</p>
<p>As for its own hardware, the company tells me that it is &#8220;very interested in superconducting qubits.&#8221; It currently offers its users access to simulated virtual qubits and is able to support workloads on any of the currently available hardware platforms, no matter the topology or architecture.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Series A funding round enables us to drive forward our leading position in the field of quantum computing as we have evolved from a DeepTech start-up into a global quantum business,&#8221; said Markus Pflitsch, founder and CEO of Terra Quantum. &#8220;I am extremely proud of our recent milestones having launched the first hybrid quantum cloud data center (QMware) and a super-secure global quantum protocol based on quantum key distribution (QKD), and grateful for the support of all of our partners who have and will support us on our path.&#8221;</p>
<p>Terra Quantum currently counts a number of DAX40 companies in the automotive and biotech industry among its clients.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to expand its R&amp;D capabilities (something it&#8217;ll need if it wants to build its own quantum hardware) and extend its Quantum-as-a-Service offering (for which it&#8217;ll need that hardware).</p>
<p>“We strongly believe in partnering with exceptional technology founders. We have trusted the incredible potential of Terra Quantum&#8217;s quantum technology from day one,&#8221; said Lakestar partner and CTO Stephen Nundy. &#8220;Terra Quantum has consistently proven its leading role in driving the second quantum revolution. Its pioneering quantum applications have tremendous potential, for example to solve the imminent quantum cryptography challenges. We are incredibly excited to further support Terra Quantum in its continued growth on a global scale.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in March Vienna-based <a href="http://PlanRadar.com">PlanRadar</a> snapped up a €30 million Series A to digitize construction and real estate. The Austrian startup &#8211; a platform for documentation and communication in construction and real estate projects &#8211; is continuing its funding roll with a $70 million fundraising round co-led by Insight Partners and Quadrille Capital.</p>
<p>The round also drew participation from existing investors including Headline, Berliner Volksbank Ventures, aws Gründerfonds, and Cavalry Ventures, plus new investors Proptech1, Russmedia and GR Capital. </p>
<p>To add context to that, this is a significant raise for an Austrian company and PlanRadar claims it’s the third-largest Series B in Austrian history to date. I&#8217;ve detailed previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/vienna/">detailed</a> how Austria is one of the newer, emerging tech hubs in Europe in one of my European city surveys.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258086" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>PlanRadar now plans new offices in the US, Australia, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The company will also boost R&amp;D investment and hopes to double its global headcount over the coming 12 months.</p>
<p>Since launching in Vienna, Austria, in 2013, PlanRadar says it has grown revenues by over 250% and more than doubled its customer base to 14,500 customers in over 60 countries. It has launched 10 new markets across Europe and Russia since 2020, with offices in Vienna, London, Amsterdam, Moscow, Paris, Madrid, Milan, Zagreb, Warsaw, and Bucharest.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Imam, PlanRadar Co-Founder and Co-CEO said: “We’re on a mission to make construction and building operations easier to manage, and we’ve proven there’s a huge global appetite for our technology.”</p>
<p>Thomas Krane, Principal at Insight Partners said: “The PropTech sector is poised for enormous growth, and PlanRadar is bringing the global construction and real estate industry into the digital future.” </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Competitors to PlanRadar include Bluebeam Revu, Autodesk Construction Cloud, Procore, and IBM&#8217;s TRIRIGA.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">M2P Fintech, a payments infrastructure startup that has established market dominance in India, has raised $56 million in a new financing round, less than three months after closing its previous funding, as it works to deepen its footprints in several international geographies.</p>
<p>Insight Partners, the New York-based private equity and venture capital firm, led the Chennai-headquartered startup&#8217;s Series C financing round. MUFG Innovation Partners, part of the giant Japanese bank, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-in-talks-to-back-indian-fintech-yap/">existing investors Tiger Global and Better Capital</a> also participated in the ongoing round.</p>
<p>The new round, which moves <a href="http://m2pfintech.com">M2P</a>&#8216;s all-time raise to $107 million, has seen the startup nearly double its valuation to about $605 million in a span of just three months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259886" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>M2P Fintech, founded by two Visa alums, has two core offerings. It helps banks and other financial institutions that have the regulatory licenses but need help with tech to launch banking services.</p>
<p>“We also help them upgrade their tech stack. There’s a movement underway as banks are transitioning from being capex-heavy product implementation model to opex, SaaS-kind of model,” said Madhusudanan R, co-founder and chief executive of M2P Fintech, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Scores of tier 1 as well as fast-emerging fintech-friendly banks are customers of M2P Fintech, which is helping them power their new-generation services, he said.</p>
<p>The startup’s second marquee offering is providing the payments layer to hundreds of fintech startups with card offerings (such as Slice and Open) to manage their entire money flow. For instance, if a fintech startup wants to launch a new offering, they may want to work with half a dozen banks. This will require building their own pipelines to tap the banks&#8217; APIs. They can instead work with M2P Fintech, which already has the railroads in place.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

(Image credits: M2P Fintech)</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;M2P is India’s leading fintech infrastructure-as-a-service company – they knit together the broadest set of banking and fintech relationships in the market and have built powerful products delivered as an API with a strong commitment to customer delight,&#8221; said Nikhil Sachdev, Managing Director at Insight Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p>“M2P’s stellar founding team and rapid growth have established the company as a clear market-leader that is transforming financial innovation in the region. We’re excited to partner with Madhu and team as they continue to scale up.”</p>
<p>The startup, which largely bootstrapped its growth for nearly five years, today operates in nearly two-dozen markets in Asia and North Africa. Madhusudanan said the startup is planning to expand its presence in those markets, expand to some new ones, and port many of the product features that are popular in India.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a very micro-level, a lot of fintech action that is happening in India is getting replicated in other markets,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also eyeing some acquisition opportunities to fuel inorganic growth in adjacent categories. The startup, which last year acquired two startups, is currently eyeing acquiring over half a dozen more, he said.</p>
<p>M2P Fintech is at a unique position currently. It faces little to no competition and is a direct beneficiary of the increasingly fierce battle among fintech startups as most of them are its customers. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There are firms with similar offerings as M2P such as Marqeta, which went public last year and quickly assumed a market cap of over $16 billion, in the U.S. But most of these firms &#8212; and there aren&#8217;t many &#8212; have yet to expand into Asian nations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Madhusudanan said he hopes that more players will emerge in India and other Asia markets in the next few years. &#8220;I think there is easily room for three to four, billion dollar companies in the space,&#8221; he said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wandercraft was founded in 2012, with the vision of improving mobility of wheelchair users. The company’s solution comes by way of exoskeletons, which can offer wearers the ability to walk with robotic assistance. In 2019, the Parisian firm launched Atalante, a self-balancing exoskeleton with 12 degrees of freedom that relies on walking on algorithms to determine a user’s gait.</p>
<p>Today, the firm announced that it has closed a $45 million Series C, which more than doubles the $30.5 million the company has raised to-date. The round was led by Quadrant Management, a U.S.-based firm, along with existing investor Bpifrance. Quadrant’s participation is particularly noteworthy here, as it finds the company expanding Atalante’s reach beyond Europe, into the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are super excited to have attracted world-class investors from the USA and Europe to advance the development program of the company,&#8221; the company’s CEO Matthieu Masselin said in a release. &#8220;With the support of patients, medical professionals and the DeepTech community, Wandercraft’s team has created a unique technology that improves rehabilitation care and will soon enable people in wheelchairs to regain autonomy and improve their everyday health.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259112" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company will be entering a crowded market as it takes on the U.S., which is home to a number of prominent exoskeleton companies, like ReWalk Robotics, Ekso, SuitX and Sarcos, which have thus far raised a ton of money and announced some high-profile partnerships. One of the things that sets the company apart, however, is a fairly single-minded focus on user mobility, where much of the competition also focuses on things like labor and or a military audience.</p>
<p>That means, in, part, partnering with hospitals and other healthcare providers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://luko.eu">Luko</a> is acquiring German startup <a href="https://www.coya.com">Coya</a> in order to grow its European presence and get an insurance license from German regulator. While Luko isn’t disclosing terms of the deal, the company says it’s a 100% share deal, which means that Coya investors are now Luko investors. Those investors include Valar Ventures, Headline and Roland Berger’s family office.</p>
<p>Luko started as a home insurance company for both homeowners and renters. It’s a big market as you have to prove that your home is insured when you rent or buy a home in France. Since then, the company has expanded with new insurance products and services.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional insurance companies, Luko has chosen a direct-to-customer model. People sign up on Luko’s website or in the company’s app directly.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259591" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After that, Luko tries to be as efficient as possible. You can chat with the company in the app directly. When the insurance pays you back, it tries to send you the money as quickly as possible. For instance, you can receive money instantly on a <a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> account.</p>
<p>When it comes to transparency, Luko takes a 30% cut on monthly payments. Everything else is pooled together to pay compensation. If there’s money left at the end of the year, you can choose to donate your portion of what’s left of the 70% share.</p>
<p>And the startup has been quite successful. It has attracted 220,000 customers — in particular, the customer base has doubled between November 2020 and November 2021. Luko started accepting clients in Spain a few months ago as well.</p>
<p>Coya, on the other hand, offers various insurance products for the German market. Insurance products include home content, private liability, dog liability and bike insurance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Following today’s acquisition, Coya is going to be called Luko Insurance AG. Coya’s 80,000 clients are joining Luko’s customer base, which means that Luko now has 300,000 clients in total.</p>
<p>More importantly, Coya has obtained an insurance license in Germany. Luko is going to leverage that license across all its markets thanks to European passporting rules. This way, Luko controls a bigger chunk of the insurance stack.</p>
<p>Up next, Luko has ambitious goals as it plans to build a European leader in the insurtech startup space. The company plans to hire 100 new employees this year alone. By 2023, the startup wants to reach one million customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.staffany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StaffAny</a>, a management platform for SMEs with shift workers, has raised a $3.4 million Series A led by GGV Capital. The round included participation from East Ventures, FreakOut Shinsei Fund, Far East Ventures, Farquhar Venture Capital and angel investors including Allen Shim, former CFO of Slack. The round will be used to expand into more markets and develop new features for StaffAny’s platform, which currently operates in seven countries, including Singapore, where it is based, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It brings the startup’s total raised to $4.2 million.</p>
<p>Co-founder Janson Seah told TechCrunch that StaffAny is used by businesses with more than 30 employees, and serves clients ranging from single outlets to chains with more than 1,000 employees. “Whilst we serve smaller businesses perfectly, there is much larger value for SMEs with aspirations to scale where labor processes need to be optimized with data and visibility,” he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259878" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before onboarding to the platform, a lot of StaffAny’s clients, who are primarily in the F&amp;B or retail sectors, were using spreadsheets, punch cards or apps that do not sync rosters, pay slips and leave management the way StaffAny does. The software also provides both management and workers with the ability to communicate in real-time.</p>

<p>Its features include an online rostering schedule that enables managers to view staff schedules across different outlets and forecast where workers might be needed and labor costs for the next week. Empty shifts are automatically scheduled and staffers are immediately notified about changes to their hours or additional shift requests. They can clock in and out through StaffAny using their smartphones, replacing punch-in cards or manual sign-ins, and adjustments to payroll are made automatically if their hours change. Both staff and management can see timesheets, so errors can be spotted. This means less disputes over pay slips.</p>
<p>StaffAny’s other features includes ones to handle leave requests and track employee work performance in case of auditing.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SaaS Labs has raised $42 million in a new financing round, less than three months after closing its previous funding, and acquired two startups as it looks to aggressively grow its automation platform that serves sales and support teams at small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital India led SaaS Labs’ Series B round. Base 10 Partners and Eight Roads Ventures, two existing backers, as well as entrepreneurs Anand Chandrasekaran, Allison Pickens, Michael Stoppelman, and Amit Agarwal participated in the round. The new funding follows California and Noida-headquartered startup&#8217;s $18 million Series A raise in October.</p>
<p>For big businesses and enterprises, scores of tools exist to bring more efficiency in their sales and support operations. But the same isn’t true of small and medium-sized businesses. That was the learning Gaurav Sharma walked away with at his previous venture, called HelloSociety, in the US. (The firm was acquired by The New York Times.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259866" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“SMBs are very underloved and underserved if you look at the software offerings they have at their fingertips,” he told TechCrunch in an interview. Enterprises, in comparison, “have access to awesome tools to improve the productivity of their agents,” he said.</p>
<p>For the last six years, <a href="https://www.saaslabs.co">SaaS Labs</a> has been building AI-powered tools that are “equally powerful” to empower sales and support teams at smaller firms. These offerings are no-code solutions, removing the need of having an IT team to deploy it.</p>
<p>“These tools are also very affordable and integrate seamlessly with other business stacks and on-premise hardware solutions that small businesses rely on,” he said.</p>
<p>The challenge over 15 million sales and support agents face today is that they have to manually update their call logs and CRM tools that are not designed to offer real-time updates to their managers. This creates a gap in their communication channels, where no intervention can happen in real-time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“Chaos starts happening when you’ve a five-person team that is doing customer communication. So these teams can use our offering called JustCall.io, for instance, which integrates with over 100 other business tools. JustCall, which has a database of over 100 million calls to work through, uses machine learning to access the quality of the calls and whether the playbook or workflow is being followed. Managers then can only looks at the calls that have been poorly graded instead of trying to sift through every call,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup has amassed over 6,000 customers globally. It typically sees a small business join the platform by paying as little as $25 a month and overtime happily move to paying tens of thousands of dollars annually as their businesses grow.</p>
<p>Over 70% of these customers are based in the U.S. today, and 10% in the UK. Some of its customers include Grab, GoStudent, and HelloFresh.</p>
<p>The startup, which has been profitable for years, said it grew its revenue by 2.5 times last year.</p>
<p>On Thursday, it also announced two acquisitions – Poland-based CallPage, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/callpage-lets-you-call-your-website-visitors/">callback automation tool for sales teams</a> to connect with their leads instantly, and France-based Atolia, a productivity and collaboration tool. (Their teams will join Saas Labs as full-time employees.) Sharma said these acquisitions are helping SaaS Labs broaden its product offerings and also deepen its footprints in various markets.</p>
<p>A portion of the new funds will be deployed to acquire many more startups, said Sharma.</p>
<p>“While we are well-capitalized, this round gives us the firepower needed to double down on what&#8217;s working, hire great talent globally, launch innovative products, focus on brand marketing and get aggressive with strategic M&amp;As. As SMBs continue to adopt software to modernize different functions like sales, support, and marketing, etc. within their business, we are confident that SaaS Labs will be able to capture that opportunity and grow 30x in the coming 5-7 years.”</p>
<p>He is looking to take SaaS Labs public within the next four to five years, he said.</p>
<p>“SaaS Labs is building a multi-channel customer communication platform for small and medium businesses. Through a suite of products, it offers an experience that marries the efficiency of digital and the intimacy of offline communication channels,” said Tejashwi Sharma, MD at Sequoia Capital India, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Its flagship product JustCall, for example, has been able to drive deep impact. Customers, on average, reported time savings of 12 hours a week per agent on manual tasks while customer satisfaction improved by 30%. Sequoia Capital India is thrilled to partner with Gaurav and the team as they build the future of customer communication,” he added.</p>
