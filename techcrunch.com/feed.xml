										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bird is rolling out a next-generation scooter with a bigger, longer-range battery and a diagnostic monitoring system to New York and Berlin this summer, as the micromobility startup seeks out ways to improve its margins and ultimately become profitable.</p>
<p>The Bird Three, which is already available in Tel Aviv, is designed to last longer and require less maintenance as well as improve comfort and safety for customers, according to the company. The launch comes just a week after Bird announced a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Switchback II. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">regulatory filings</a> that accompanied the announcementÂ demonstrated just how difficult it is to turn a profit given the unit economics of shared scooters.</p>
<p>The cost of building and servicing vehicles is one of the biggest barriers to profitability, which explains why Bird has invested in developing a scooter with a longer-lasting vehicle and battery as well as the software needed to monitor the device&#8217;s health.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bird writes its own proprietary operating system, called Bird OS, as well as its motor controller IoT system, according to Scott Rushforth, Bird&#8217;s chief vehicle officer. The self-diagnostics system allows the battery to communicate with the backend and internally within the connected vehicle network. That means if, for example, the machine gets too warm, it&#8217;ll send the server an alert and will also automatically correct itself by riding at a slower speed to keep cool.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s tons of health monitoring and data that comes off the battery,&#8221; Rushforth told TechCrunch. &#8220;Every individual cell is monitored. There&#8217;s probably about 75 different diagnostics that we track within the battery system itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Superpedestrian, which recently lost a bid for New York City&#8217;s first e-scooter pilot to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/bird-lime-and-veoride-selected-for-nyc-e-scooter-pilot/">Bird, Lime and Veo</a>, has touted its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/superpedestrian-positions-itself-as-the-go-to-partner-for-cities-with-new-e-scooter-safety-upgrades/">self-diagnostics software and in-house written OS</a> as one of its USPs for years. The company boasts that its LINK scooters, which are powered by its Vehicle Intelligent Safety (VIS) system, run 1,000 vehicle health checks every second a ride is taking place, checking for things like battery cell temperature imbalances, water penetration and brake issues.</p>
<p>Bird&#8217;s batteries are encased in &#8220;hermetically sealed, tamper-proof, industry-leading IP68-rated protection to keep [them] safe from dust, water and theft,&#8221; according to the company, which also claims the battery on the Bird Three is the largest in the industry at 1kWh capacity. Superpedestrian, a company that shares Bird&#8217;s aversion to swappable batteries, has just about the same battery capacity at .986kWh, according to a spokesperson for the company. Lime, Bird&#8217;s biggest competitor, has gone the small, swappable battery route, and thus its battery capacity is .460kWh, according to a Lime spokesperson.</p>
<p>Lime and other companies that use swappable batteries argue this strategy generates less emissions because the scooters can be serviced by gig economy workers on ebikes. Scooters have traditionally been rounded up, charged and then redistributed to public streets by gig economy workers driving around in gas-powered vans.</p>
<p>With its latest scooter, Bird is doubling down on the big, static battery strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The battery is so big that we don&#8217;t really need to charge it very often, and it can go 15,000 to 20,000 miles before it has any type of serviceability event,&#8221; said Rushforth, who noted in major markets, Bird&#8217;s scooters are being charged roughly once a week. &#8220;We spend less time charging, less time rebalancing, less time going out and having to do maintenance and chase these vehicles around, which means we&#8217;re actually using less cars than you would generally when you have swappable batteries and have to go out all the time to swap them.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far it&#8217;s not clear which strategy is the most eco-friendly, but a sustainable scooter isn&#8217;t all about the battery. Rushforth says the Bird Three is designed to last 24 to 36 months on the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to make the most green vehicle in the world, and to accomplish that, the system needs to be extremely durable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As long as the vehicles last longer, we need less vehicles overall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because Bird Three is built on the same platform as Bird Two, many of the parts are the same which makes it easier to reduce, reuse and recycle at the end of the vehicle&#8217;s life. Once a battery reaches the end of its life, Bird turns to partners like ITAP to be responsibly recycled.</p>
<p>Other updates on the Bird Three revolve around comfortability and safety, including a new braking system with front and rear brakes and an automatic emergency braking that detects a fault in the mechanical braking system and digitally stops the vehicle using the motor.</p>
<p>Rushforth also noted that the vehicle ergonomics feel sturdier, with a longer wheelbase, wider handlebars and antimicrobial grips. The Bird Three has a new headlight and taillight that are globally certified so they can be used in places like Germany where scooters have more stringent requirements. Just in time for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/bird-to-spend-150-million-on-european-expansion-plan/">Bird to expand outward into Europe</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to buy a house in a competitive market is perhaps one of the most stressful things an adult can go through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competing with a bunch of people all putting offers on a house that fly off the market in a matter of days is not fun. One startup that is trying to give home buyers a competitive edge by giving them a way to offer all cash on a home has just raised a boatload of money to help it keep growing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin-based <a href="http://www.homeward.com">Homeward</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which aims to help people buy homes faster, announced t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">oday it has raised $136 million in a Series B funding round led by Norwest Venture Partners at a valuation âjust north of $800 million.â The company has also secured $235 million in debt.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blackstone, Breyer Capital and existing backers Adams Street, Javelin and LiveOak Venture Partners also participated in the equity financing, which brings Homewardâs total equity raised since inception to $160 million.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homewardâs model seems to be appealing to both home buyers (including first time ones) and agents alike, with lots of growth occurring since May 2020 when it raised $105 million in debt and equity. The company declined to reveal hard revenue figures but noted that its GMV (gross merchandise value) run rate is up over 600%+ year over year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, as of March, Homeward says it had experienced a 5x increase in the volume of homes transacted and 9x year over growth in the number of new customers. Plus, Itâs hired 161 employees since January alone, and currently has a headcount of 203, up from about 33 at this time last year.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Tim Heyl founded the real estate startup in late 2018 on the premise that in most cases, sellers prefer to receive all cash offers because they are more likely to close. Loans can fall through, but cash is cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heyl started the company after having worked in the industry for the previous decade, first as a broker then as the owner of a title company. During that time, he saw firsthand many of the problems in the industry. And one conundrum he frequently ran into was people not wanting to make an offer on a home without knowing for sure their current house would sell in a certain amount of time. This is a dilemma many are facing during the COVID-19 pandemic as demand outweighs supply in many major U.S. cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThe pandemic has greatly increased demand for our product,â Heyl told TechCrunch. âItâs a historic sellerâs market with unprecedented demand from buyers and the lowest inventory levels in decades.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to âdouble downâ on its offering, scale up to meet &#8220;outsized demandâ and open additional markets. Currently, Homeward operates in Texas, Colorado and Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âRight now, we have a waiting list in every market across the country, so this growth capital will enable us to meet that demand,â Heyl said. Its ultimate goal is to open its offering to agents nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeward also plans to double the size of its title and mortgage teams in the latter half of the year so it can offer its clients and partner agents âa single streamlined experience.â Itâs also planning to integrate its consumer and internal software systems for approvals, offers and closing âso everyone can be on a single platform and we can eliminate confusion and waste,â Heyl added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how does it work exactly? Homeward will make an all-cash offer on behalf of a customer wanting to buy a house. Meanwhile, that customer can hire an agent (from brokerages such as Redfin or Keller Williams) to list their home with less pressure to sell it in a certain amount of time or at a discounted price. Once Homeward buys a home, it will lease the property back to its customer until they sell their house, get a mortgage, and can buy the property back from Homeward, plus a 2 percent to 3 percent convenience fee. During the process, Homeward offers a predetermined guaranteed price for its customerâs home with the promise that if itâs unable to sell the house for at least that amount, itâll buy the house from them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heyl believes Homewardâs âalternative iBuyerâ model is a better deal for customers since it doesnât purchase a customerâs old home for below market value. The company also works with agents, and not against them, he said. For example, its offerings are available to any agent, but the company âstrategicallyâ partners with top brokerages and teams, providing them with what it describes as âdedicated support, white-label branding, and digital marketing tools to help them stand out from the crowd and attract more clients.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âMost alternatives to traditional real estate minimize or replace the agent,â Heyl said. âBut we are agents ourselves, and weâve built this for agents.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeward is profitable on a per unit basis if you count transaction revenue minus costs to acquire and complete each transaction, according to Heyl. However, it is not yet profitable on a net income basis.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvp.com/team/jeff-crowe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Crowe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, managing partner at Norwest Venture Partners, will join Homewardâs board as part of the funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âHomeward is innovating at the intersection of real estate and fintech â thatâs the next frontier,â he said. âH</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">omewardâs cash offer addresses real problems for homebuyers in all market conditions, and the team has identified a winning strategy by partnering with agents and their clients.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital describes Homeward as one of Austin&#8217;s most innovative companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are inspired by the company&#8217;s mission to build home finance solutions to overcome the limitations of the traditional mortgage and we are proud to support them as they continue to scale rapidly and efficiently,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The digital health space continues cooking on gas: Berlin-based <a href="https://ada.com">Ada Health</a> has closed a $90M Series B round of funding led by Leaps by Bayer, the impact investment arm of the German multinational pharma giant, Bayer AG. Other investors in the round include Samsung Catalyst Fund, Vitruvian Partners, Inteligo Bank, F4 and Mutschler Ventures.</p>
<p>The startup last raised around four years&#8217; ago, reporting a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/berlins-ada-health-raises-47m-to-become-the-alexa-of-healthcare/">$47M Series A round in 2017</a>. But don&#8217;t be fooled by the low lettering of these rounds: Ada Health has been working on its symptom assessment tech for around a decade at this point &#8212; relying, in the first several years of its mission, on private funding from high net worth individuals in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tiFJws9lRy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/move-slow-and-dont-break-things-how-to-build-an-ai-driven-startup/">Ada Health built an AI-driven startup by moving slowly and not breaking things</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ada Health built an AI-driven startup by moving slowly and not breaking things&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/move-slow-and-dont-break-things-how-to-build-an-ai-driven-startup/embed/#?secret=tiFJws9lRy" data-secret="tiFJws9lRy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Initially it was also focused on building a decision support tool for doctors before pivoting to directly addressing patients via an AI-driven symptom assessment app.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not alone in offering this type of tool. Others in the space include Babylon, Buoy, K Health, Mediktor, Symptomate, WebMD and Your.MD &#8212; but Ada claims its app is the most used and highest rated by users. It can also point to a <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/12/e040269">peer reviewed study</a> it led, which was published in the BMJ, and compared the condition coverage, accuracy and safety of eight competitors. The study found its app led the pack on all fronts.</p>
<p>One reason for that edge is that Ada Health&#8217;s medical knowledge base covers around 30,000 ICD-10 codes (aka the alphanumeric codes used by doctors to represent different diagnoses) at this point &#8212; which co-founder and CEO, Daniel Nathrath, tells us is &#8220;by far the largest coverage of any of the systems in this space&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Ada Health app, which launched in late 2016 &#8212; and remains free to use &#8212; has been downloaded by more than 11 million people across 150 countries so far. Users have completed some 23M assessments using the tool which he likens to having &#8220;24/7 access to your trusted family doctor&#8221;.</p>
<p>Currently, the app has support for 10 languages. But the goal with the funding is to push for truly massive scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is to help as many people as possible get better access to healthcare around the world,&#8221; Nathrath tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Our ambition is, in a few years, that a billion people instead of 11M people will be using out technology. In order to get there we think that working with the right investors can help us accelerate that growth path and give more people the benefit of our technology faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With 11M app downloads I believe we are the most used AI symptom assessment technology that I know of in the world,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;We are also the most rated and reviewed app in the medical category of the App Store and Google Play Store ever &#8212; after, what, just four years. With about 300,000 ratings and reviews, most of them five-star. So&#8230; we have gained some users but we think it&#8217;s just the beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Digital health &#8212; with all the things you see going on &#8212; is at an inflection point where it&#8217;s being realized not only by the users who have already been using our technology but also by health systems, governments, and payers, insurers, and life sciences companies &#8212; I think everyone has realized digital health is here to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as putting its symptom assessment app directly in the hands of patients, Ada Health offers a suite of enterprise solutions where partners pay it to be able to embed and deeply integrate its triage technology into their websites and digital services. That means they can use it to offer an entry point for their users &#8212; to help direct them to the correct service and provide administrative support by arming clinicians with health information provided by patient via the Ada interface (and the AI&#8217;s own assessment) ahead of the appointment.</p>
<p>One publicly disclosed customer for Ada&#8217;s enterprise offering is Sutter Health, in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have integrated Ada into their own homepage and into their app so people can use it as a digital front door to the entire service of Sutter,&#8221; says Nathrath, explaining that the difference vs the version of the app that patients can download is &#8220;people don&#8217;t just get generic advice&#8221;. &#8220;It&#8217;s fully integrated. So if it says &#8212; for instance &#8212; you need to go to the emergency room&#8230; then you can go straight into appointment booking.</p>
<p>&#8220;And not only that; when you book the appointment the outcome of the Ada pre-assessment can then be shared with the health professional who will then look at you so the doctor doesn&#8217;t start from a blank sheet of paper but is already pre-briefed and gets decision support in terms of &#8216;this is constellation of symptoms the patient is reporting&#8217; and &#8216;based on that these could be the most likely diagnosis and these should be the tests, examinations or investigations I should consider next to get to the confirmed diagnosis&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The added advantage for Ada&#8217;s enterprise partners is that patient data arrives with the doctor that sees them already structured so &#8212; after a few confirmations &#8212; they can easily import it into their documentation, saying precious minutes per patient, per Nathrath. &#8220;[If] you save a few minutes with each patient that means you have more time for the patients who really need you and not the patients who maybe has a cold and shows up in the emergency room, which unfortunately is a reality,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>With this enterprise strand of its business Ada is continuing to provide support for doctors. Nathrath suggests its patient-facing app is also being used for some informal decision support for doctors too.</p>
<p>More and more doctors are using the app &#8220;together with their patients&#8221;, he tells us, or else recommending it to their patients &#8212;Â  asking them &#8220;so what did Ada say?&#8221;.</p>
<p>The role of AI in healthcare will be a core one, Nathrath predicts &#8212; given that demand for healthcare professionals is always going to outstrip supply.</p>
<p>He argues that&#8217;s true even with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kry-closes-312m-series-d-after-use-of-its-telehealth-tools-surged-100-yoy/">rising use of telehealth platforms</a> which can certainly make more efficient use of doctors&#8217; time.</p>
<p>Ada did, at one point, offer a telehealth service itself &#8212; before deciding to fully focus its efforts on AI &#8212; so its approach now is to partner and integrate with other healthcare and health data providers throughout the care ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think there&#8217;s a place for telehealth, obviously. It adds convenience. During the pandemic I guess it had a special role where for many it was almost the only way to interact with a doctor,&#8221; he says. &#8220;So we do see a place for telehealth but we also see an issue with telehealth in that it doesn&#8217;t address the structural issue in healthcare &#8212; that simply there aren&#8217;t enough doctors to serve the entire population of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building Ada as a multi-sided platform,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be computing different sources of input data &#8212; which is sensor data, wearables data, lab data, genetic testing data &#8212; that&#8217;s on the input side &#8212; and then on the more downstream, on the next step after Ada, we can partner with any telehealth company in the world. And we&#8217;re seeing enormous interest from literally all corners of the world where telehealth companies approach us. And insurance companies and governments &#8212; where they say yes there is a use-case for telehealth but we basically need something before that, that filters people to the right next step.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever that right next step is in a patient&#8217;s care journey, &#8220;Ada is like the gatekeeper at the beginning of the journey that then sends you on your way,&#8221; is how Nathrath puts it.</p>
<p>The overarching vision is that Ada becomes not just an app in your pocket but an omnipresent &#8220;personal health companion&#8221; &#8212; or what it describes as &#8220;a personal operating system for health&#8221; &#8212; which is powerful enough to deliver preventative healthcare by being able to aggregate all sorts of data and spot health issues sooner so as to enable earlier and less costly interventions.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re building is really much more than a symptom assessment technology,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Where you would also take into account lab results which can now be done much more direct to consumer than was previously possible, sensors and wearables data &#8212; and you probably say that Samsung is one of our investors but we&#8217;re obviously talking to all the large players in the space about this; how we can integrate that data best &#8212; and all the way to genetic testing and even the full genome sequence.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you take all these different sources of health information and compute them against each other on a continuous basis you&#8217;ll have something like an early warning system for your health &#8212; which, again, from a population health and system level perspective should be desirable for anyone who&#8217;s in charge of providing healthcare or paying for healthcare because you can catch the problem when it&#8217;s still a Â£100 problem and not yet a Â£100,000 a year problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that ambition it&#8217;s interesting that big pharma is investing in Ada. (And its PR notes that it&#8217;s also in talks with Bayer on a potential strategic partnership.) But Nathrath suggests that the industry is well aware of the shifts being driven by digital health &#8212; and keen to avoid its own &#8216;Kodak moment&#8217;, i.e. by not adapting to the coming changes in a timely enough manner.</p>
<p>If AI-powered health interventions end up being so successful that they can shrink drug bills through earlier intervention and more preventative care then it makes good business sense for big pharma to be plugged into the cutting edge of digital health.</p>
<p>At the same time this type of tech might end up driving demand for medicines &#8212; exactly because of its scalability and because it can present a higher dimension view of more people&#8217;s health &#8212; meaning there&#8217;s more opportunity for increased prescription. So there&#8217;s not really a downside for pharma to get involved here.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really excited about the possibilities we can find by working together [with pharmaceutical companies] to really deliver a better healthcare experience to patients,&#8221; says Nathrath.Â &#8220;If you look at Bayer they have a consumer health business, they also have a pharmaceutical business and if you look at the cases within Ada if you look at the top ten most common ones it&#8217;s very comparable to what a GP would see all the time and a lot of those basically can end up in the recommendation towards healthcare where oftentimes an over the counter drug will be enough to address the issue. One area where Bayer has a lot of offerings, of course. But then their spectrum goes all the way towards rare diseases &#8212; where we&#8217;re also particularly strong. Where they have some drugs that help patients with very rare conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are also potentially major research riches to be derived from the health data generated via Ada&#8217;s app which could also be interesting to pharma companies doing drug discovery.</p>
<p>Although Nathrath emphasizes that app users&#8217; data is never used for research purpose without explicit consent from the individual (as is required under Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Act).</p>
<p>But he also notes that Ada is able to do some interesting studies based on aggregated user data, too &#8212; giving an example of how it looked at kids mental health during COVID-19 lockdowns, comparing areas where schools had been shut vs those where they had remained open. &#8220;You could really compare what happened in different countries,&#8221; he says, noting that rates of depression in kids in Germany where schools and pre-schools were closed went up by over 100%, whereas in Switzerland where schools remained opened throughout there was no rise and even a slight improvement in children&#8217;s mental health.</p>
<p>In another example, involving aggregated data from usage of the app in US, he says it was able to show that it could have spotted a measles epidemic via the cases in the app slightly sooner than the CDC&#8217;s official announcement of an epidemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about the potential of that, in terms of spotting outbreaks earlier, that can be quite significant,&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think there&#8217;s really a long list of ways we can work together [with researchers, policymakers and pharma companies] for the benefit of patients,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;The mission of all the people I spoke to at Bayer was really similar to ours &#8212; which is to help people, basically&#8230; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re really happy to work with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the funding in a statement, Dr. JÃ¼rgen Eckhardt, head of Leaps by Bayer, added: âInvesting in breakthrough technologies that drive digital change in healthcare is one of the strategic imperatives for Leaps by Bayer and for the entire field of healthcare. Adaâs truly transformative technology, combining powerful artificial intelligence with an emphasis on medical rigor and high levels of clinical accuracy will lead the way in helping more patients and consumers in achieving better health outcomes sooner by intervening earlier in their healthcare journey.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.wayflyer.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayflyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a revenue-based financing platform for e-commerce merchants, has raised $76 million in a Series A funding round led by Left Lane Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âPartnersâ of DST Global, QED Investors, Speedinvest</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and Zinal Growth &#8212; the family office of Guillaume Pousaz (founder of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Checkout.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; also put money in the round. The raise comes just after Wayflyer raised $100 million in debt funding to support its cash advance product, and 14 months after the Dublin, Ireland-based startup launched its first product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an e-commerce boom fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, Wayflyer is the latest in a group of startups focused on the space that has attracted investor interest as of late. The company aims to help e-commerce merchants âunlock growthâ by giving them access to working capital (from $10,000 up to $20 million) so they can improve cash flow and drive sales. For example, more cash can help these merchants do things like buy more inventory in bulk so they can meet customer demand and save money.Â </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a nutshell, Wayflyer uses analytics and sends merchants cash to make inventory purchases or investments in their business. Those merchants then repay Wayflyer using a percentage of their revenue until the money is paid back (plus a fee charged for the cash advance). So essentially, the merchants are using their revenue to get financing, hence the term revenue-based financing. The advantage, Wayflyer says, is that companies make repayments as a percentage of their sales. So if they have a slow month, they will pay back less. So, there&#8217;s more flexibility involved than with other mechanisms such as traditional bank loans.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/embed/#?secret=LJjuSbMyrh" data-secret="LJjuSbMyrh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder Aidan Corbett believes that in a crowded space, Wayflyerâs use of big data gives it an edge over competitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corbett and former VC Jack Pierse spun Wayflyer out of a marketing analytics company that Corbett had also started, called Conjura, in September 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âJack came to me and said, âYou should stop using our marketing analytics engine to do these big enterprise SaaS solutions, and instead use them to underwrite e-commerce businesses for short-term finance,â â Corbett recalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so he did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWe just had our heads down and started repurposing the platform for it to be an underwriting platform,â Corbett said. It launched in April 2020, doing about $600,000 in advances at the time. In March of 2021, Wayflyer did about $36 million in advances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âSo, it&#8217;s been a pretty aggressive kind of growth,â Corbett said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past six months alone, the company has seen its business grow 290% as it has deployed over $150 million of funding across 10 markets with a focus on the U.S., the United Kingdom and Australia. About 75% of its customers are U.S. based.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayflyer plans to use its new capital toward product development and global expansion with the goal of entering âmultipleâ new markets in the coming months. The company recently opened a sales office in Atlanta, and also has locations inÂ the U.K., the Netherlands and Spain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Corbett, the companyâs offering is more compelling than buy now, pay later solutions for consumers for example, in that it is funding the merchant directly and able to add services on top of that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThere&#8217;s a lot more opportunity for companies like ourselves to differentiate because essentially, we focus on the merchants. And when we underwrite the merchant by getting data from the merchant, there&#8217;s a lot of additional services that you can put in on top,â Corbett explained. âWhereas with buy now, pay later, you get information on the consumer, and there&#8217;s not as much room to add additional services on top.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a business requests an advance and either is not approved for one, or doesnât choose to take it, Wayflyerâs analytics platform is free to anybody who signs up to help them optimize their marketing spend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThis is a critical driver of value for e-commerce businesses. If you can&#8217;t acquire customers at a reasonable price, you&#8217;re not going to be around very long. And a lot of early-stage e-commerce businesses struggle with that,â Corbett said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also can pair up a merchant with a marketing analytics &#8220;specialistâ to analyze its marketing performance or an inventory &#8220;specialist&#8221; to look at the current terms and price a business is getting from a supplier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âOur focus from the very beginning is really supporting the merchants, not just providing them with working capital,â Corbett said.Â Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way the company claims to be different is in how it deploys funds. As mentioned above, merchants can pay the money back at varied terms, depending on how sales are going. The company makes money by charging a principal on advances, and then a âremittance rateâ on revenues until the total amount is paid back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWe tend to be more flexible than competition in this way,â Corbett said. âAlso, some competitors will pay invoices on merchantsâ behalf or give them a pre-charged card to use on advertising spend,â Corbett said. âWe always give cash into a merchantâs account.âÂ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayflyer recently inked an agreement with <a href="https://www.wayflyer.com/blog">Adobe Commerce</a>, a partnership it said would provide a new channel to further amplify its growth with the goal of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding 8,000 e-commerce businesses in the first year of the partnership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Left Lane Capital Partner </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Ahrens said that his firm was impressed by Wayflyerâs ânuanced understanding of what will drive value for their clients.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThe teamâs focus, specialization, and deep analytical expertise within the e-commerce market also drives superior underwriting,â he told TechCrunch. âTheir explosive growth has not come about by taking on undue risk. We are big believers that their underwriting will only improve with scale, and that Wayflyer will be able to compound its competitive advantages over time.â</span></p>
<p>As mentioned, this is an increasingly crowded space. Earlier this month, Settle announced it had raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by Kleiner Perkins to give e-commerce and consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies access to non-dilutive capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter called the recent visit by police to its Indian offices a form of intimidation and said it was concerned by some of the requirements in New Delhiâs new IT rules.</p>
<p>Speaking for the first time since a special squad of Delhi police <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">made a surprise visit to two of its offices</a> on Monday, Twitter said it is âconcerned by recent events regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve.â</p>
<p>The company also said that it joins many organizations in India and around the world that have âconcerns with regards to the use of intimidation tactics by the police in response to enforcement of our global Terms of Service, as well as with core elements of the new IT Rules.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson added: âWe plan to advocate for changes to elements of these regulations that inhibit free, open public conversation. We will continue our constructive dialogue with the Indian Government and believe it is critical to adopt a collaborative approach. It is the collective responsibility of elected officials, industry, and civil society to safeguard the interests of the public.â</p>
<p>Tension between American tech giants Twitter and Facebook and the Indian government has been brewing for months. Twitter faced heat from politicians after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">refused to block accounts</a> that criticised New Delhiâs reforms and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>India is one of the largest markets for American tech firms that poured billions of dollars in the South Asian nation in the past decade to get more people connected to the web. According to Indian government estimates, Twitter has 175 million users in India, while WhatsApp has amassed over 530 million users.</p>
<p>Their tension escalated Wednesday after WhatsApp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatsapp-sues-india-government/">sued the Indian government</a> in a court in Delhi over the new IT rules that it said would compromise usersâ privacy and give New Delhi the power to conduct mass surveillance.</p>
<p>India announced the new IT rules in February and gave firms three months to comply. The deadline expired this week, and on Wednesday the Ministry of Electronics and IT <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/india-asks-social-media-firms-if-they-have-complied-with-the-new-regulations/">asked social media firms for an update on their compliant status</a>, TechCrunch first reported.</p>
<p>Twitter said Thursday that the new IT rulesâ requirements to make a compliance officer criminally liable for content on the platform, proactive monitoring, and blanket authority to seek information about users represented a dangerous overreach that was inconsistent with open and democratic principles.</p>
<p>The microblogging platform also requested New Delhi to consider granting a minimum of 3 months extension to comply with the new IT rules and publish Standard Operating Protocols on aspects of compliance of public consultation.</p>
<p>Twitter said it was recently served with another non-compliance notice in India and withheld a portion of the content identified in the notice under. The content identified in the notice, Twitter said, was originally reported in the blocking orders since February 2021.</p>
<p>It said in recent months it has been compelled to withhold content in response to a non-compliance notice. Not doing so, it said, poses penal consequences with many risks for Twitter employees.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the company is committed to complying with the new IT rules. &#8220;It&#8217;s obviously early days and our local teams are very engaged. You know we comply with local laws and we will approach it with the same framework,&#8221; he said in a briefing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We engage and explain to everyone the importance of information, promoting free flow of information, but we do want to respect legislative processes in democratic countries. We are committed to complying,&#8221; he said, adding that the company will highlight any requests it complies with in its transparency reports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vidya Madhavan always wanted to be in business. Growing up in India, she thought she might be in the business of running a factory, given the power and influence of outfits like Tata Group, the Indian multinational conglomerate.</p>
<p>She certainly had an affinity for school, graduating at the top of her high school class, nabbing a mechanical engineering degree in India and more recently landing at Stanford&#8217;s business school. Except that instead of create the more traditional business she once had in mind, Madhavan found herself tinkering with an entirely different idea: a matchmaking app called <a href="https://www.schmoozedating.com/">Schmooze</a> that combines machine learning and memes to connect people based on what Madhavan calls a humor algorithm.</p>
<p>The idea dates back several years when, as an analyst with McKinsey in India who was debating whether or not to attend grad school in California, Madhavan cold-emailed 10 people on LinkedIn who she could see attended U.S. business schools and hoped might be helpful. Only one of them replied, but over the next couple of days, she says, &#8220;we exchanged, like, 200 emails, all of them fundamentally jokes.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reader, she is now married to that person. Indeed, she says it&#8217;s because she believes their shared sense of humor brought them together that she began tinkering with the idea of Schmooze, initially as a way to foster new friendships. It was when she saw the way things were trending &#8211;people were really looking for a love match &#8212; that she refocused the idea as a dating app for Gen Z users who already communicate largely with memes.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FvrIfdjerY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/snack-a-tinder-meets-tiktok-dating-app-opens-to-gen-z-investors/">Snack, a &#8216;Tinder meets TikTok&#8217; dating app, opens to Gen Z investors</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Snack, a &#8216;Tinder meets TikTok&#8217; dating app, opens to Gen Z investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/snack-a-tinder-meets-tiktok-dating-app-opens-to-gen-z-investors/embed/#?secret=FvrIfdjerY" data-secret="FvrIfdjerY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It has been taking off since, says Madhavan. Though it hasn&#8217;t yet spread Facebook-like across college campuses, a beta test in late summer with 200 Stanford students has since led to more than 10,000 downloads around the country, where people are swiping right &#8212; or left &#8212; to more than 5,000 memes that are culled entirely by still-in-beta Schmooze (until it&#8217;s big enough to deal with content moderation).</p>
<p>Currently about 200 memes are added each day, while others are deleted. &#8220;No one cares about the U.S. elections anymore,&#8221; Madhavan notes.</p>
<p>Using tagging and machine learning, combined with the bios that users create for themselves, Schmooze gets to work. Some users might show a predilection for particular topics, for example, like physics or finance. Some who say they&#8217;re interested in entrepreneurship might reveal an even stronger passion for music through their choices. There are similar divides when it comes to dark humor, and people who really love puns &#8212; and those who hate them.</p>
<p>Whether the algorithm truly works will take time, and lasting unions, to know. Madhavan says that 90,000 matches have been made to date, but naturally, a far smaller number have moved from matched to in-app messaging.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ERZ4l4H38j"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes/">Jigsaw scores $3.7M to slow down your dating swipes</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jigsaw scores $3.7M to slow down your dating swipes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes/embed/#?secret=ERZ4l4H38j" data-secret="ERZ4l4H38j" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Schmooze has plenty of competition in the meantime, both from traditional dating services and newer dating apps and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/style/marriage-pact-college-stanford.html">questionnaires</a> that look to pair people based on share interests rather than that use looks as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes/">starting point</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also easy to imagine more meme-based dating apps suddenly springing into existence, particularly given today&#8217;s go-go market. (Crazier things have happened.)</p>
<p>Still, Schmooze appears to hold promise. It recently closed on $270,000 in seed funding from Ulu Ventures and others to tinker with its product. The company has been finding success reaching its audience on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/foryou?is_from_webapp=v1&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;item_id=6960701703775669509#/@exactlyliketheothergirls/video/6960701703775669509">TikTok</a>. There is also a lot of money to be made in the world of online dating, as industry watchers see <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bumbles-14-bln-date-blackstone-backed-dating-app-soars-market-debut-2021-02-11/">over</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/match-group-seeks-expansion-beyond-dating-with-1point7-billion-acquisition-cfo.html">over</a> again.</p>
<p>As for Madhaven, she is in love, to her own surprise, with her startup. Partly because of her formative years and partly because she never dated online before meeting her husband through LinkedIn, she says with a laugh of Schmooze: &#8220;It&#8217;s unexpected, in many many ways.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Can an app improve your romantic relationships? The founders behind <a href="https://www.getpaired.com">Paired</a>, a &#8220;relationship care&#8221; app for couples, believe it can. And since launching in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/paired/">October</a>, with $1M to kick things off, they&#8217;ve convinced 5,000+ coupled-up others to try their custom blend of partner quizzes, &#8220;relationship satisfaction&#8221; tracking, and audio tips from experts &#8212; to try to feel closer to their S.O.</p>
<p>Paired is now gunning for serious growth: It&#8217;s announcing $3.6M in seed funding today, led by Eka Ventures with participation from existing investors including Taavet Hinrikus (Wise, formerly TransferWise), Harold Primat (investor and former professional racing driver), and the co-founders of Runtastic.</p>
<p>As part of the seed funding, Camilla Dolan of Eka Ventures will join the board alongside the appâs co-founders Kevin Shanahan and Diego LÃ³pez (who previously worked together at language learning app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/11/memrise-raises-15-5m-as-its-ai-based-language-learning-app-passes-35m-users/">Memrise</a>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paired says its goal for the new funding is to grow its user-base from 5,000+ to 100k over the next 18 months.</p>

<p>All sorts of audio-led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/quilt-an-audio-social-network-focused-on-self-care-raises-3-5-million-in-seed/">wellness &#8216;self-care&#8217; apps</a> have been bubbling up in recent years &#8212; offering individuals app-wrapped help with stuff like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/20/audible-gets-guided-meditation-and-workouts-courtesy-of-aaptiv/">meditation</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/22/simple-habit-is-an-app-to-squeeze-mindfulness-into-your-busy-day/">mindfulness</a>; targeted motivation to combat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/02/shine-brings-its-female-focused-self-care-app-to-android/">anxiety</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/endel-series-a/">stress</a>; orÂ dishing up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/lover-sex-help/">sex tips</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/emjoy-picks-up-3m-to-get-more-women-tuned-into-sexual-self-care/">sexual self awareness</a>.</p>
<p>Paired fits within that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/self-care-apps-are-booming/">broader trend</a>, albeit with a more explicit nudge to extend the self-care phenomenon to a unit of two romantically connected people.</p>
<p>As it looks for growth, the UK-based startup says it will continue to target the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, which are its main markets at this point. &#8220;We expect the growth to continue to come from here over the next 12 months,&#8221; says Shanahan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building out our product team &#8212; hiring engineers, a product manager, a data scientist &#8212; to begin offering more varied and personalised relationship conversations for our users,&#8221; he goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personalisation is a particular focus as every relationship is different and the app will begin to understand what your interests are, what stage you&#8217;re in, what would be most useful for you to discuss, etc. We&#8217;re also growing our content, working with new experts to cover more relationship topics and marketing the app via influencers, partnerships, and other channels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who are Paired&#8217;s early adopters? Currently, the average user is a straight, early 30s Millennial who&#8217;s been in their current relationship for two-three years, according to Shanahan. (He says around 5% of users are LGBTQ+.)</p>
<p>But he also claims Paired has a wide mix of users, adding: &#8220;We have couples who have been together for 6 months and those who have been together for 10+ years, so it&#8217;s a wide spectrum.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says the split of women and men using the app is &#8220;fairly even&#8221; but avoids specifying exactly how usage splits on gender lines.</p>
<p>The app can be used by only one half of a couple &#8212; for solo relationship support/self-care, if preferred &#8212; but users have the option to pair with their partner to swap answers to relationship questions in order to encourage discussion. And that&#8217;s where Paired can offer the most personalized experience to users, by opening up a dedicated &#8216;relationship&#8217; discussion channel between the couple. (Paired does not obviously cater to open/polyamorous couples &#8212; but presumably could be used as a discussion tool for the primary partners.)</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2156320,2156321,2156322,2156324,2156325,2156327,2156329"]</p>
<p>The idea isn&#8217;t to replace couples therapy, per Shanahan. Rather Paired wants to create a whole new intermediating layer &#8212; based on the notion that communication problems in a relationship can be tackled earlier (and more easily) if you stick a piece of software between you which nudges both halves of the relationship to notice and address potential disconnect.</p>
<p>&#8220;If couples therapy is a dentist for your relationship, then we would be a toothbrush,&#8221; is how Shanahan puts it when asked if the idea is to replace couples therapy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a toothbrush is not a substitute for the dentist, we arenât trying to replace couples therapy. Our goal is to promote healthy relationship behaviours between couples and believe our audience will eventually grow to become the majority of couples,&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p>He points to a study Paired commissioned from the Open University and University of Brighton &#8212; which he says showed that couples who used the app over the course of three months saw on average a 36% increase in their &#8220;relationship satisfaction&#8221;. (Albeit quantifying such a subjective measure as a percentile increase may not appeal to every romantic person&#8217;s tastes.)</p>
<p>Shanahan says Paired wants to offer ongoing support, too &#8212; rather than (the opposite scenario) of its users arriving at such a point of mutual understanding they could feel they don&#8217;t never need to take another partner quiz to understand what their life partner is thinking/feeling.</p>
<p>Its philosophy is, no matter how thoughtful you get vis-a-vis your S.O., there&#8217;s always more to learn and thus you always need to keep working on &#8216;relationship care&#8217;. It is of course a very convenient philosophy for a subscription app.</p>
<p>&#8220;You probably wouldn&#8217;t say success when you&#8217;re fit is to stop going to the gym,&#8221; says Shanahan. &#8220;Or when your teeth are healthy to stop brushing your teeth. Similarly we want Paired to be a tool to help keep your relationship in a good place, so success for us is keeping your relationship satisfaction high over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what have the founders learned about their own relationships from using Paired?</p>
<p>Shanahan confirms that he and his partner have been using the app &#8220;a ton (and not just for testing)&#8221;, adding: &#8220;I&#8217;ve personally learnt that there is always more to discover about your partner and itâs a fun journey. Also that discussing issues when they are small is useful so they don&#8217;t become big later down the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diego LÃ³pez, Paired&#8217;s other co-founder and CTO, tells us that the daily questions posed by the app have &#8220;helped my partner and I fight lockdown monotony&#8221;. &#8220;Thereâs been many occasions where we give the same answer to a question. Itâs a great feeling to know that we understand each other and a reminder of the things we have in common,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting on Paired&#8217;s seed round in a statement, Camilla Dolan from Eka Ventures, said: âDespite relationship health being such an important and truly global part of our lives there is not currently an accessible and affordable way of supporting it &#8212; <span class="il">Paired</span> has set out to change that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We love Kevin &amp; Diego&#8217;s vision to bring happiness and health to relationships and be the global category leader for relationship management. What really got us excited though was the <span class="il">Paired</span> user stories and the level of change that <span class="il">Paired</span> is already having on their early users.â</p>
<p dir="ltr">In another supporting statement, existing investor Taavet Hinrikus, co-founder of Wise, added: âKevin and the <span class="il">Paired</span> team have a vision for improving the relationships of hundreds of millions of couples. Building and strengthening relationships is something we all need help with from time to time, but lots of people feel unsure of where to turn for help. The rapid uptake from paid subscribers since their October launch makes me confident that it can become the global, digital platform for relationships.â</p>
<p>Paired&#8217;s app (available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/id1469609343?ls=1">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getpaired.app">Google Play</a>) is free to download &#8212; but a monthly or yearly subscription is required to access the full range of content and support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://agicap.com/en/">Agicap</a> has raised a new $100 million funding round led by Greenoaks. With todayâs funding round, the company has reached a valuation of more than $500 million (â¬415 million). Agicap is building a service that lets you track your cash flow in real time, build reports and get forecasts.</p>
<p>In addition to Greenoaks, existing investors BlackFin Capital Partners and Partech are also participating in the round. It represents a big jump from last yearâs $18 million Series A round.</p>
<p>The basic premise of Agicap is quite simple. Many small companies rely on Microsoft Excel to figure out their cash position every week or every month. Instead of exporting .csv files from your bank accounts, you can connect your bank accounts to Agicap for real-time monitoring. Similarly, Agicap has developed integrations with accounting software and invoicing tools.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When you want to see how youâre doing when it comes to cash, you can connect to your Agicap account just like youâd connect to a web analytics service. Agicap tries to break down how much youâre spending by category and branch. After that, you can run projections and make decisions based on forecasts.</p>
<p>Designed specifically for small and medium companies, Agicap has managed to convince 3,500 companies to use its service. They pay a monthly subscription fee. Clients include Cityscoot, Meero, Merci Handy, Ornikar and Blend Burger.</p>
<p>Agicap is currently live in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. France still generates 50% of the companyâs revenue but other markets are growing rapidly.</p>
<p>âThis Series B comes at a key moment in our development,â co-founder and CEO SÃ©bastien Beyet said in a statement. âIt demonstrates our will to make Agicap the European leader in our market and will allow us to further accelerate our international presence, launching in 10 new countries in the coming months.â</p>
<p>Following todayâs funding round, the company has some ambitious expansion plans. The companyâs team has already grown from 30 employees to 200 employees over the last 12 months. Now, it plans to build a team of 1,000 employees within the next couple of years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ford is increasing its investment in its electric vehicle future to $30 billion by 2025, up from a previous spend of $22 billion by 2023. The company announced the fresh cashflow into its EV and battery development strategy, dubbed Ford+, during an investor day on Tuesday.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it expects 40% of its global vehicle volume to be fully electric by 2030. </span><a href="https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/2021/04/01/Q1-Ford-sales-2021.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ford sold 6,614 Mustang Mach-Es in the U.S. in Q1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and since it unveiled its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">F-150 Lightning last week</a>, the company says it has already amassed 70,000 customer reservations.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ford+ plan reveals the new path automakers will have to take if they want to keep up with an EV future. Historically, China, Japan and Korea have owned much of the worldâs battery manufacturing, but as major OEMs begin building electric cars, the demand is far outstripping supply, forcing car manufacturers to invest their own resources into development. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/gms-second-2-3b-battery-plant-with-lg-chem-to-open-in-late-2023/">General Motors is building a battery factory with LG in Ohio</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/ford-bmw-lead-solid-powers-130m-series-b-round/">BMW joined Ford to invest in solid state battery startup Solid Power</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This investment âunderscores our belief that production-feasible solid state batteries are within reach in this decade,â said Hau Thai-Tang, Fordâs chief product platform and operations officer, during the investor day. âSolid Powerâs sulphide-based solid electrolyte and silicon-based anode chemistry delivers impressive battery improvements in performance, including increased range, lower cost, more vehicle interior space and better value and greater safety for our customers.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solid state battery manufacturing process doesnât differ too much from the existing lithium ion battery process, so Ford will be able to reuse about 70% of its manufacturing lines and capital investment, according to Thai-Tang.Â </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âOur ultimate goal is to deliver a holistic ecosystem including services that should allow us to achieve higher profitability over time with BEVs than we do today with ICE vehicles,â said Thai-Tang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ion Boost +âs unique cell pouch format is not only ideal for powering Fordâs larger vehicles, but it could also help the company reduce battery costs 40% by mid-decade, the company says.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThe cell chemistry, coupled with Ford&#8217;s proprietary battery control algorithm featuring high accuracy sensing technology, delivers higher efficiency and range for customers,â said Thai-Tang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For commercial vehicles, Ford is working on a battery cell made with lithium ion phosphate chemistry, which itâs calling the Ion Boost Pro, which it says is cheaper and better for duty cycles that require less range.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eight months after Lucid Motors showed off the final version of its all-electric Air sedan, the company has finally revealed the in-cabin tech â from the curved 34-inch display and second touchscreen to the underlying software, integrated apps and Amazon Alexa voice assistant â that drivers and passengers will use once the automaker begins deliveries of the vehicle in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>The aim of the company&#8217;s branded Lucid User Experience, or Lucid UX, is to include all the tech that customers might want in a vehicle priced between $80,000 and $169,000 without adding clutter and confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really tried to follow a strong principle of ease-of-use and a short learning curve, for it to have quick responses and an overall feeling of elegance,&#8221; Derek Jenkins, Lucid&#8217;s head of design said in a recent interview. &#8220;I kind of wanted to move away from it being overly technical or sci-fi looking or spreadsheet-like and really move towards something that was more fitting with the brand and our design ethos.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The interior isn&#8217;t as stark as a Tesla Model 3 or Tesla Model Y, nor as jam-packed as some of the German luxury vehicles. Jenkins and his team have tried to hit the Goldilocks&#8217;s equivalent the perfect bowl of tech porridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the beginning of the project I always used to tell the team, &#8216;Listen I want my mom to be able to get in this car and figure it out the first time,&#8217; &#8221; Jenkins said. &#8220;She should be able to know instinctively probably the light switch and the door locks are on the left side because that&#8217;s where they always are and not have to dig through that stuff. Or that the climate controls are probably on the lower screen because that&#8217;s where it often is and traditionally has been. I just felt like it should have intuitiveness and a degree of simplicity, while still having impressive features and having a system that can grow.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The hardware</h2>
<p>The curved 34-inch 5K display called the glass cockpit floats slightly above the dashboard and is the most visible hardware in the vehicle, although is not the only component worth mentioning. It is actually three separate displays housed under a single plate of glass, a technique that Mercedes-Benz has used in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mercedes-unveils-hyperscreen-a-curved-56-inch-screen-for-its-flagship-eqs-electric-vehicle/">56-inch hyperscreen</a>. On the far left is a touchscreen where Lucid has placed the most important, or core, vehicle controls, such as window defrosters, lighting and wiper settings.</p>
<p>The middle screen is the instrument cluster, which is where the driver will see the speed and remaining battery range displayed. The right side of the instrument cluster is a widget that can display a variety of information, depending on the user, including navigation or what music is playing. The instrument cluster is also where the driver will see whether the advanced driver assistance system is activated.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mercedes unveils Hyperscreen, a curved 56-inch screen for its flagship EQS electric vehicle&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mercedes-unveils-hyperscreen-a-curved-56-inch-screen-for-its-flagship-eqs-electric-vehicle/embed/#?secret=XhQG5cREIh" data-secret="XhQG5cREIh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To the right of the steering wheel is another touch display that Lucid is calling the home screen. It&#8217;s here that navigation, media and communications will be located.</p>
<p>Moving down and to the center console area is another curved screen that Lucid has dubbed the &#8220;pilot panel,&#8221; which displays climate controls and seat functions, including a massage feature, along with all the other vehicle settings. The driver or passenger can swipe menus from the home screen down to the pilot panel to display in-depth controls for music or navigation. And if the driver doesn&#8217;t want that additional touchscreen, the pilot panel can be retracted, opening access to a storage space behind it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that analog switches are still within the vehicle in three areas: the doors, the steering wheel and a slice of space between the pilot panel and the upper home screen. Alongside the doors, the driver or passengers will find the window switches and interior door latches. Right above the center console display are four physical buttons that lets the driver or passenger control climate temperature and fan speed.</p>

<p>On the steering wheel is a touch bar and two toggles. These buttons can be used to launch the Alexa voice assistant and turn on and off the advanced driver assistance functions, as well as adjust the following distance in cruise control and volume.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did a lot of research through this discussion of analog interaction such as physical buttons and digital interaction on a touchscreen,&#8221; Jenkins said. &#8220;What we found was there was some key functionality that people still wanted to have physical interaction with.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vehicle is also loaded with 32 sensors, including a single lidar that is located just below the nose blade on the exterior of the vehicle. Below that is a lower air intake and then a forward-facing radar. Other radar sensors are located on the exterior corners. There are exterior cameras, as well, in the nose and header area behind the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>Inside the vehicle, and tucked right below the instrument cluster, is a camera that faces the driver. This camera is part of the driver-monitoring system, which is meant to ensure the operator is paying attention when the advanced driver assistance system is engaged.</p>
<p>Two other hardware items worth noting are the 21-speaker surround sound system from Dolby Atmos and a small vintage (and Miata-esque) detail with the air vents. Lucid wanted the Air to have physical air vents that a person could touch and move &#8212; unlike the Tesla Model 3, which requires the user to move the direction of the air flow through the digital touchscreen. But Lucid didn&#8217;t want the bulk of a vent in the chiclet-style design, which has an additional side tab to turn on or off the air flow.</p>
<p>The solution is a slimmed-down air vent with a single round dial right in the middle. That dial can be grabbed and moved to shift air flow. It also can be turned to shut off the air to a particular vent.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a breakthrough for us,&#8221; Jenkins said laughing, &#8220;which isn&#8217;t a breakthrough because that was super common in the 60s and 70s in cars.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The software</h2>
<p>Behind all of the physical touchscreens and sensors is the software that delivers functions and services.</p>
<p>Lucid started with the open-source Android Automotive operating system and built out the apps and other features from there. Android Automotive OS is modeled after Google&#8217;s Android open-source mobile operating system that runs on Linux. Google has offered an open-source version of this OS to automakers for some time. In recent years, automakers have worked with Google to natively build in an Android OS that is embedded with all the Google apps and services such as Google Assistant, Google Maps and the Google Play Store. Lucid did not take the Google services platform route.</p>
<p>From here, Lucid worked with various third-party apps and integrated them into the infotainment system, a list that currently includesÂ iHeartRadio, TuneIn, Pocket Casts, Dolby Atmos, Tidal and Spotify.</p>

<p>Lucid has also decided to make Alexa the default and primary integrated voice control system. Lucid Air will also come with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay â apps that run on the userâs phone and wirelessly communicate with the vehicleâs infotainment system. This means the driver, or passenger, can access Google Assistant and Siri through these apps, they just won&#8217;t be able to control the vehicle functions like climate.</p>
<p>The vehicle will also have integrated mobile and Wi-Fi connectivity, which will allow Lucid to update the software of the vehicle wirelessly. The over-the-air update capability lets the company add new apps and services.</p>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>Jenkins said they&#8217;re already looking at bringing more content to the infotainment system, including gaming and video streaming, which would only be accessible when the vehicle is parked.</p>
<p>The Lucid design team is also examining other more hardware-based additions to future model years of the Air, including rear entertainment displays.</p>
<p>&#8220;You probably won&#8217;t see that from us until sometime in 2023,&#8221; Jenkins noted. &#8220;We think that&#8217;s an important thing to bring to the car especially because the rear seat is such a nice place to be.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunchâs biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Wednesday, May 26. Yes, weâre going to get to the huge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/amazon-is-buying-mgm-studios-for-8-45b/">Amazon-MGM deal</a>, but we have to chat about a startup first. Have you heard of Poparazzi? If you have kids you might have &#8212; itâs the latest social phenom. And it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store/">just ran its way up to the top of the App Store</a>. (Too bad itâs not <em>Pup</em>arazzi!)</p>
<p>Yes, I feel old as well. Take a look if you want to know what the kids are up to. Now, the rest of the news. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon snaps up MGM:</strong> The biggest news out today is <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/amazon-is-buying-mgm-studios-for-8-45b/">the giant Amazon-MGM deal worth more than $8 billion</a></strong>. Its studio purchase helps cement Amazon in the mix of tech companies with huge investments in the online video space. Observers believe the e-commerce giant plans to use MGM to bolster its Prime service, making consumers less likely to churn thanks to the inclusion of more services. Which rings hollow to us: Who is going to give up Prime, but be swayed by movies? The connection to shipping speed feels tenuous.</li>
<li><strong>The global fintech boom:</strong> This morning, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/latam-focused-corporate-spend-startup-clara-raises-30m-months-after-its-last-round/">Clara announced a new round</a></strong>, mere months after it raised <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/">its preceding round of capital</a></strong>. The Mexican startup works in the corporate spend market, a startup niche that recently saw a $2.5 billion exit in the United States, and more capital for<strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/"> both Ramp</a></strong> and Brex. Our read here is that many nascent fintech formulas that work in the U.S. are going to have wide remit globally.</li>
<li><strong>IPOs are back:</strong> The recent Flywire IPO pricing (strong) and first-day trading (even stronger) are indicative that <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/flywires-flotation-suggests-the-ipo-slowdown-is-behind-us/">the temporarily slowed public-offering market is <em>back</em></a></strong>. So, Robinhood, letâs go?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>Here are five of the tastiest venture capital rounds that TechCrunch covered, showing off an array of niches and round sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/uks-paysend-raises-125m-at-a-700m-valuation-to-expand-its-all-in-one-payments-platform/"><strong>UKâs Paysend raises $125M for mobile B2B payments</strong></a><strong>:</strong> You are excused for wondering if every fintech round these days involves both companies and payments. I feel the same way. But what matters in the case of Paysend is that its model to provide SMB online payment services is happening from a post-Brexit U.K. Not even a tectonic decoupling can stop U.K. fintech, it seems.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/yalo-raises-50m-to-build-c-commerce-services-for-chat-apps-like-whatsapp/"><strong>Yalo raises $50M for conversational commerce</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Hereâs a tech startup round that typifies the year. Did it raise less than a year ago? Yes. Did the company have funding find it, as opposed to the other way around? Yes. And did COVID accelerate its business? Yes. Yalo is a wager that the way we buy online is changing, a technology story if weâve ever heard of one. And itâs one that venture capitalists are lining up to bet on.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/skiff-encrypted-collaboration-seed/"><strong>Skiff raises $3.7M for encrypted Google Docs</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Thatâs the pitch, per our own Zack Whittaker. Essentially, Skiff mimics the familiar features of Google Docs, but with end-to-end encryption. As a fan of privacy, I dig the project.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/treet-with-2-8-million-in-seed-funding-gets-brands-involved-in-the-resale-market/"><strong>Treet raises $2.8M to help brands resell their own stuff</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The online resale market is huge. ThreadUp is public now, as is Poshmark. But Treet is betting that there is still room in the market for more tech, namely its plan to get brands involved in their own resale market. It isnât the richest startup around, but given the sheer number of brands out there, it has a pretty huge TAM to grow into.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/african-fintech-opay-reportedly-raising-400m-at-a-1-5b-valuation/">African fintech OPay is in the process of raising a huge new round</a>. The investment could help push the continentâs 2021 venture capital totals to new heights, based on data TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/venture-capital-investment-in-africa-predicted-to-reach-a-record-high-this-year/">reported earlier in the week</a>.</p>
<h2>7 questions to ask before relocating your startup to Florida</h2>
<p>Cities like Miami, Pittsburgh and Austin have been drawing talent and wealth from Silicon Valley for years, but the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the trend.</p>
<p>In recent months, many investors and entrepreneurs have noisily departed for Miami, citing the region&#8217;s favorable business climate and quality of life. It&#8217;s always good to consider one&#8217;s options, but before booking a moving van for the Sunshine State â or any emerging tech hub, for that matter â here are some basic questions entrepreneurs should ask themselves.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Weâre not going to touch on the Amazon-MGM deal more here in the Big Tech section, leaving us room for all sorts of other news:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> is looking into allowing users of both the Big Blue App and Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/facebook-and-instagram-will-now-allow-users-to-hide-like-counts-on-posts/">to hide social like counts</a>. Which is great for your mental health, we suspect, if awful for those of us with overdeveloped competitive urges.</li>
<li><strong>Visa</strong> is rebounding from its pre-nuptial breakup with fintech unicorn Plaid by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/visa-takes-a-swipe-in-fintech-builds-new-online-marketplace/">building a vetted list of fintech startups</a> that its friends and other customers may want to leverage. In a sense, itâs a way for startups to get a stamp of approval from Visa, and possibly more clients in the process. Whatâs in it for Visa? More digital payments. Thatâs good for a company that does lots of payments work, we reckon.</li>
<li><strong>GM</strong> and <strong>Lockheed</strong> are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/general-motors-lockheed-martin-to-develop-new-lunar-rover-for-nasa-artemis-missions-to-the-moon/">working on the next American lunar vehicle</a>. It is very, very American to have the progenitors of the consumer Hummer and various weapons of death build our next extraplanetary go-kart. And itâs good that we may go back to the moon? Itâs more than time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To round out the Big Tech section today, <strong>OpenAI</strong> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/openais-100m-startup-fund-will-make-big-early-bets-with-microsoft-as-partner/">out in the market with a $100 million fund</a> to invest in startups. And Microsoft is partnering with the company and putting funds into the capital pool. It feels like ages ago that Microsoft told me that it wasnât getting into the VC game because the returns would not prove material to its asset base. That wasnât the point and the company seems to have figured that out.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reports that OpenAIâs Sam Altman of Y Combinator fame said that the fund âplan[s] to make big early bets on a relatively small number of companies, probably not more than 10.â Something to watch out for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Would you pay for an upgraded Twitter? That&#8217;s a question Twitter will soon answer when it rolls out a new subscription service that will present users with an expanded feature set available only to paid subscribers. This is a different offering than Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">previously announced Super Follow subscription</a> plans, which will allow users to subscribe to individual creators for access to exclusive content. Instead, the new subscription service will target Twitter&#8217;s power users who tweet frequently enough or otherwise engage with the product to the point that they&#8217;d be willing to pay to do even more.</p>
<p>Twitter has already broadly hinted at its forthcoming subscription plans, having told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg in February</a> that it would &#8220;research and experiment&#8221; with ways to diversify its revenue beyond advertising in 2021 and beyond. Twitter ads are 85% of revenue, but Twitter often faces <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-09/twitter-beats-revenue-estimates-warns-of-slowing-user-growth">slowing</a> or <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/twitter-posts-strong-revenue-result-in-q3-as-user-growth-slows/588093/">flat</a> user growth. That has led the company to consider new ways to extract more money from existing users. It told Bloomberg this plan &#8220;may include subscriptions&#8221; and other approaches that gave businesses and users access to &#8220;unique features.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also reiterated its interest in subscription products<a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_downloads/2021/02/Twitter-Analyst-Day-2021-Transcript.pdf"> during its Twitter Analyst Day</a> later that same month, when it said it would &#8220;experiment with subscriptions.&#8221; And its Twitter Investor Relations account <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIR/status/1366821636712722432">tweeted in March</a> that it would &#8220;test subscription products in public.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But so far, the only subscription product Twitter has fully detailed is Super Follow, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">also announced during its Analyst Day event.</a> It had not specifically spelled out what its other subscription tests would look like, nor provided any sense as to when they would arrive beyond tests that would begin rolling out <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIR/status/1366821636712722432">&#8220;over the course of this year</a>.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter&#8217;s &#8216;Super Follow&#8217; creator subscription takes shots at Substack and Patreon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/embed/#?secret=qz3OftytSG" data-secret="qz3OftytSG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>What we know of Twitter&#8217;s efforts on this particular front doesn&#8217;t come from official sources.</p>
<p>Instead, it comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393541248049303555">app researcher Jane Manchun Wong</a>, who earlier this month scooped not only Twitter&#8217;s premium subscription offering itself but also its name and pricing. She found the forthcoming subscription plan, currently dubbed &#8220;Twitter Blue,&#8221; would cost $2.99 per month and would include access to new features like bookmark collections and the Undo Tweets feature that Twitter had previously <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/twitter-might-let-you-undo-tweets-if-you-pay-a-subscription-fee/">confirmed to CNET</a> were being tested.</p>
<p>However, when tech news site <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437690/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets">The Verge</a>Â asked Twitter to comment on Twitter Blue, the company declined.</p>
<p><a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_news/2021/05/JPM-TMC-Conference-2021-Date-Announcement.pdf">This week at</a> J.P. Morgan&#8217;s Global Technology, Media, and Communications conference, Twitter spelled things out a bit more clearly.</p>
<p>Instead of vaguely hinting at forthcoming &#8220;experiments&#8221; or tests that gave &#8220;people and businesses of all sizes access to unique features,&#8221; <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_downloads/2021/02/Twitter-Analyst-Day-2021-Transcript.pdf">as it said before</a> (gotta love that corporate speak!), Twitter CFO Ned Segal told investors its new &#8220;premium service&#8221; would be aimed at people who use Twitter&#8217;s service &#8212; &#8220;and they pay us for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Segal noted this premium offering was one of the two types of subscriptions that Twitter had in the works, the other being Super Follows.</p>
<p>The premium service also sounded less of an &#8220;experiment&#8221; than when Twitter had discussed its plans before. In earlier statements, it had seemed as if Twitter was embarking on some kind of research project to see if there was even any demand for a Twitter premium subscription at all. The wording the company used in the past didn&#8217;t make it clear how seriously this effort was.</p>
<p>Segal said the company would offer more info about Twitter&#8217;s premium service in the coming months. It would test the service to learn more, but then it would &#8220;ultimately roll it out to people around the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s no &#8220;experiment&#8221; &#8212; that&#8217;s a roadmap.</p>
<p>Twitter won&#8217;t replace the core, free product it offers, in case you were concerned. He cleared that up, too. It will provide premium features &#8220;on top of [Twitter&#8217;s] continuous improvement mindset around the free version of the service that everybody will continue to have access to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter shouldn&#8217;t have to tweak the new offering too much, as it&#8217;s already done a lot of pre-launch research on what features users are most interested in, including via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/twitter-survey-reveals-the-subscription-options-its-eyeing-including-an-undo-send-option/">user base surveys back in 2020.</a> Not surprisingly, the Undo Tweet option &#8212; as close as we&#8217;ll ever get to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/twitter-edit-button-jack-dorsey-a9286191.html">an &#8220;edit&#8221; button</a>, was among those features users wanted most.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7j9CsqpV5v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/">MIT professor wants to overhaul &#8216;The Hype Machine&#8217; that powers social media</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MIT professor wants to overhaul &#8216;The Hype Machine&#8217; that powers social media&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/embed/#?secret=7j9CsqpV5v" data-secret="7j9CsqpV5v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Twitter didn&#8217;t really say anything we didn&#8217;t know already, thanks to assumptions, leaks and vague confirmations in the past, it&#8217;s nice to see it spelled out in a more straightforward manner as a forthcoming product meant for users worldwide.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make sure that we have a durable business for our benefit, but also for the benefit of people who use the service,&#8221; Segal said.</p>
<p>The question now remains whether Twitter&#8217;s users will actually subscribe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drug discovery is a large and growing field, encompassing both ambitious startups and billion-dollar Big Pharma incumbents. <a href="https://www.enginebio.com/">Engine Biosciences</a> is one of the former, a Singaporean outfit with an expert founding crew and a different approach to the business of finding new therapeutics, and it just raised $43 million to keep growing.</p>
<p>Digital drug discovery in general means large-scale analysis of biological data like genes, gene expression, protein structures, binding sites, things like that. Where it has hit a wall in the past is not on the digital side, where any number of likely molecules or processes can be generated, but on the next step, when those notions need to be tested in vitro. So a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/daphne-koller-digital-biology-is-an-incredible-place-to-be-right-now/">new crop of biotech companies</a> have worked to integrate these aspects.</p>
<p>Engine does so with a pair of tools it has dubbed NetMAPPR and CombiGEM. NetMAPPR is a huge sort of search engine for genes and gene interactions, taking special note of &#8220;errors&#8221; that could provide a foothold for a molecule or treatment. CombiGEM is like a mass genetic testing process that can look into thousands of gene combinations and edits on diseased cells simultaneously, providing quick experimental confirmation of the targets and effects proposed by the digital side. The company is focused on anti-cancer drugs but is looking into other fields as they become viable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The focus on gene interactions sets their approach apart, said co-founder and CEO Jeffrey Lu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gene interactions are relevant to all diseases, and in cancers, where we focus, a proven approach for effective precision medicines,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;For example, there are four approved drugs targeting the PARP enzyme in the context of mutation in the BRCA gene that is changing cancer treatment for millions of people. The fundamental principle of this precision medicine is based on understanding the gene interaction between BRCA and PARP.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/engine-biosciences-raises-10-million-in-southeast-asias-largest-institutional-seed-round/"> raised a $10 million seed in 2018</a>Â and has been doing its thing ever since â but it needs more money if it&#8217;s going to bring some of these things to market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already have chemical compounds directed toward the novel biology we have uncovered,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;These are effectively prototype drugs, which are showing anti-cancer effects in diseased cells. We need to refine and optimize these prototypes to a suitable candidate to enter the clinic for testing in humans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now they&#8217;re working with other companies to do the next step up from automated testing, which is to say animal testing, to clear the way for human trials.</p>
<p>The CombiGEM experiments â hundreds of thousands of them â produce a large amount of data as well, and they&#8217;re sharing and collaborating on that front with several medical centers throughout Asia. &#8220;We have built what we believe to be the largest data compendium related to gene interactions in the context of cancer disease relevance,&#8221; said Lu, adding that this is crucial to the success of the machine learning algorithms they employ to predict biological processes.</p>
<p>The $43 million round was led by Polaris Partners, with participation by newcomers Invus and a long list of existing investors. The money will go toward the requisite testing and paperwork involved in bringing a new drug to market based on promising leads.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have small molecule compounds for our lead cancer programs with data from in vitro (in cancer cells) experiments. We are refining the chemistry and expanding studies this year,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;Next year, we anticipate having our first drug candidate enter the late preclinical phase of development and regulatory work for an IND (investigational new drug) filing with the FDA, and starting the clinical trials in 2023.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a long road to human trials, let alone widespread use, but that&#8217;s the risk any drug discovery startup takes. The carrot dangling in front of them is not just the possibility of a product that could generate billions in income, but perhaps save the lives of countless cancer patients awaiting novel therapies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla has installed its 200,000th Powerwall, the company&#8217;s home battery storage product, the company said <a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1397651493755498499">in a tweet</a> on Wednesday. Tesla&#8217;s CFO Zachary Kirkhorn told investors during a first-quarter earnings call in April that Tesla is continuing to work through a &#8220;multi-quarter backlog on Powerwall,&#8221; suggesting that the volume of installations will continue to soar in coming months.</p>
<p>During that earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/tesla-wants-to-make-every-home-a-distributed-power-plant/">said the company will no longer sell</a> its Solar Roof panel product without a Powerwall. He said widespread installation of solar panels plus home battery packs (Tesla built, of course) would turn every home into a distributed power plant.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Every solar Powerwall installation that the house or apartment or whatever the case may be, will be its own utility,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And so even if all the lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power. So that gives people energy security. And we can also, in working with the utilities, use the Powerwalls to stabilize the overall grid.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>He noted the unprecedented winter storm in Texas in February, which, combined with record-breaking demand for electricity, left millions without power in freezing temperatures. He suggested that under that scenario, utilities could work with customers who have Powerwalls to release stored electricity back on the grid to meet that demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;So if the grid needs more power, we can actually then with the consent, obviously, of the homeowner and the partnership with the utility, we can then actually release power on to the grid to take care of peak power demand,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Tesla hit the 100,000 milestone for Powerwall installations in April 2020, five years after it debuted the first-generation Powerwall. That means that sales numbers that took the company five years to achieve were doubled in a single year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["The deck has to show that you're solving an important problem, that you've got the path to an important solution, that there is a big market opportunity, and that your team is positioned to execute."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In just a few short years, Vise has gone from launching on the Disrupt Battlefield stage to unicorn. Co-founders Samir Vasavada and Runik Mehrotra met Sequoia&#8217;s Shaun Maguire at an afterparty at the event, and Maguire ended up leading a seed and Series A round while Sequoia led the Series B. Last week, Vise raised its Series C of $65 million and was officially valued at $1 billion post-money.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			A good pitch deck is short and simple, and covers the key points in less than 12 words a slide.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We sat down with Vasavada and Maguire to talk about the early fundraising process for Vise, specifically the seed round, and get a look at the startup&#8217;s first pitch deck. We discussed what Vasavada has learned about delivering a good fundraising pitch, and what stood out about the pitch and the product for Maguire.</p>
<h2>Simplicity is key</h2>
<p>Vasavada says he&#8217;s made dozens of pitch decks since starting Vise and that this early deck was not his best because it was trying to do too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;A good pitch deck is short and simple, and covers the key points in less than 12 words a slide,&#8221; said Vasavada, adding that many founders think they need to show investors every part of their business.</p>
<p>&#8220;The deck has to show that you&#8217;re solving an important problem, that you&#8217;ve got the path to an important solution, that there is a big market opportunity, and that your team is positioned to execute,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those are the only four things that matter. Everything else can be discussed in the Q&amp;A.&#8221;</p>
<p>The goal of a pitch meeting is not to get the &#8220;yes&#8221; instantly, and satisfy every curiosity, but rather to give the investor something to think about and a reason to want another conversation.</p>
<p>Vasavada explained to the audience that this early seed deck certainly went into too much detail and was too text-heavy. (You can check out the full deck below.)</p>
<h2>Why will this product be successful right now?</h2>
<p>Beyond the problem, solution, market and team, there is an additional X factor that makes a difference in pitching for fundraising.</p>
<p>Timing can make or break a startup. Incredible ideas, ones that have gone on to be some of the biggest businesses in the world, have fizzled out and died for being too early.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If Instagram&#8217;s photo tagging feature was spun out into its own app, you&#8217;d have the viral sensation <a href="https://www.poparazzi.xyz/">Poparazzi</a>, now the No. 1 app on the App Store. The new social networking app, from the same folks behind <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ttyl-inc">TTYL</a> and others, lets you create a social profile that only your friends can post photos to &#8212; in other words, making your friends your own &#8220;paparazzi.&#8221; To its credit, the new app has perfectly executed on a series of choices designed to fuel day-one growth &#8212; from its prelaunch TikTok hype cycle to drive App Store preorders to its postlaunch social buzz, including favorable tweets by its backers. But the app has also traded user privacy in some cases to amplify network effects in its bid for the Top Charts, which is a risky move in terms of its long-term staying power.</p>
<p>The company positions Poparazzi as a sort of anti-Instagram, rebelling against today&#8217;s social feeds filled with edited photos, too many selfies and &#8220;seemingly effortless perfection.&#8221; People&#8217;s real lives are made up of many unperfect moments that are worthy of being captured and shared, too, <a href="https://medium.com/poparazzi/the-anti-selfie-selfie-club-ad1ce447ac91">a company blog post explains</a>.</p>
<p>This manifesto hits the right notes at the right time. User demand for less performative social media has been steadily growing for years &#8212; particularly as younger, Gen Z users wake up to the manipulations by tech giants. We&#8217;ve already seen a number of startups try to siphon users away from Instagram using similar rallying cries, including<a href="https://www.minutiae-app.org/"> Minutiae</a>,<a href="https://vero.co/"> Vero</a>,<a href="https://www.dayflashapp.com/"> Dayflash</a>,<a href="http://hipstamatic.com/oggl/"> Oggl</a> and, more recently, the once-buzzy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">Dispo</a> and the under-the-radar <a href="https://www.theherdapp.com/">Herd</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even Facebook has woken up to consumer demand on this front, with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/instagrams-new-test-lets-you-choose-if-you-want-to-hide-likes-facebook-test-to-follow/">plan to roll out new features</a> that allow Facebook and Instagram users to remove the Like counts from their posts and their feeds.</p>
<p>Poparazzi hasn&#8217;t necessarily innovated in terms of its core idea &#8212; after all, tagging users in photos has existed for years. In fact, it was one of the first viral effects <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/22/facebook-photos-pulls-away-from-the-pack/">introduced by Facebook</a> in its earlier days.</p>
<p>Instead, Poparazzi hit the top of the charts by carefully executing on growth strategies that ensured a rocket ship-style launch.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>The company began gathering prelaunch buzz by driving demand <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@poparazziapp?">via TikTok</a> &#8212; a platform that&#8217;s already helped mint App Store hits like the<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/8/22272980/high-heels-tiktok-ios-app-store-free-game"> mobile game High Heels</a>. TikTok&#8217;s powers are still often underestimated, even though its potential to send apps up the Top Charts have successfully boosted downloads for a number of mobile businesses, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/capcut-bytedance-tiktok/">TikTok sister app CapCut</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/shein-overtakes-amazon/">e-commerce app Shein</a>, for example.</p>
<p>And Poparazzi didn&#8217;t just build demand on TikTok &#8212; it actually captured it by pointing users to its App Store preorders page via the link in its bio. By the time launch day rolled around, it had<a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorVO/status/1397035371884539906"> a gaggle ofÂ Gen Z users</a> ready and willing to give Poparazzi a try.</p>

<p>The app launches with a clever onboarding screen that uses haptics to buzz and vibrate your phone while the intro video plays. This is unusual enough that users will talk and post about how cool it was &#8212; another potential means of generating organic growth through word-of-mouth.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>After getting you riled up with excitement, Poparazzi eases you into its bigger data grab.</p>
<p>First, it signs up and authenticates users through a phone number. Despite Appleâs App Store policy, which requires it, there is no privacy-focused option to use &#8220;Sign In with Apple,&#8221; which allows users to protect their identity. That would have limited Poparazziâs growth potential versus its phone number and address book access approach.</p>
<p>It then presents you with a screen where it asks for permission to access your Camera (an obvious necessity) and Contacts (wait, all of them?), and permission to send you Notifications. This is where things start to get more dicey. The app, like <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22332182/clubhouse-privacy-contacts-invites-update">Clubhouse once did</a>, demands a full address book upload. This is unnecessary in terms of an app&#8217;s usability, as there are plenty of other ways to add friends on social media &#8212; like by scanning each other&#8217;s QR code, typing in a username directly or performing a search.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>But gaining access to someone&#8217;s full Contacts database lets Poparazzi skip having to build out features for the privacy-minded. It can simply match your stored phone numbers with those it has on file from user signups and create an instant friend graph.</p>
<p>As you complete each permission, Poparazzi rewards you with green checkmarks. In fact, even if you deny the permission being asked, the green check appears. This may confuse users as to whether they&#8217;ve accidently given the app access.</p>

<p>While you can &#8220;deny&#8221; the Address Book upload &#8212; a request met with a <em>tsk tsk</em> of a pop-up message &#8212; <em>Poparazzi literally only works with friends,</em> it warns you &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">you can&#8217;t avoid being found by other Poparazzi users who have your phone number stored in their phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">When users sign up, the app matches their address book to the phone number it has on file and then &#8212; boom! &#8212; new users are instantly following the existing users. And if any other friends have signed up before you, they&#8217;ll be following you as soon as you log in the first time.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In other words, there&#8217;s no manual curation of a &#8220;friend graph&#8221; here. The expectation is that your address book <em>is</em> your friend graph, and Poparazzi is just duplicating it.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn&#8217;t always an accurate presentation of reality.</p>
<p>Many younger people, and particularly women, have the phone numbers of abusers, stalkers and exes stored in their phone&#8217;s Contacts. By doing so, they can leverage the phone&#8217;s built-in tools to block the unwanted calls and texts from that person. But because Poparazzi automatically matches people by phone number, abusers could gain immediate access to the user profiles of the people theyâre trying to harass or hurt.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="s6VciWL9Ag"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/instagrams-new-test-lets-you-choose-if-you-want-to-hide-likes-facebook-test-to-follow/">Instagram&#8217;s new test lets you choose if you want to hide &#8216;Likes,&#8217; Facebook test to follow</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Sure, this is an edge case. But it&#8217;s a nontrivial one.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a well-documented problem, too &#8212; and <a href="https://www.crazyintherain.com/intruder-alert-the-clubhouse-app-is-a-stalkers-dream-and-your-worst-nightmare/">one that had plagued</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClubhouseApp/comments/kz7s8r/my_cyber_stalker_has_followed_me_on_clubhouse/">Clubhouse</a>, which similarly required full address book uploads during its early growth phase.Â Itâs a terrible strategy to become the norm, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse-buzz-is-already-fading-but-andreessen-horowitz-isnt-put-off.html">and one that</a> <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90632460/as-clubhouse-downloads-plummet-clones-hope-they-can-convince-users-that-audio-is-the-future">does not appear</a> to have created a lasting near-term lock-in for Clubhouse. It&#8217;s also not a new tactic. Mobile social network Path tried address book uploads nearly a decade ago and almost everyone at the time agreed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/07/path-uploads-your-iphones-address-book-to-their-servers-without-a-peep/">this was not a good idea.</a></p>
<p>As carefully designed as Poparazzi is &#8212; (it&#8217;s even got a blue icon &#8212;<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/175428#:~:text=Blue%3A%20Cool%20blue%20is%20perceived,message%20of%20stability%20inspires%20trust."> a color that denotes trustworthiness</a>!) &#8212; it&#8217;s likely the company intentionally chose the trade-off. It&#8217;s forgoing some aspects of user privacy and safety in favor of the network effects that come from having an instant friend graph.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; Chase Stubblefield <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f6f4.png" alt="ð´" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@chasestubb) <a href="https://twitter.com/chasestubb/status/1397106165780078592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The rest of the app then pushes you to grow that friend graph further and engage with other users. Your profile will remain bare unless you can convince someone to upload photos of you. A SnapKit integration lets you beg for photo tags over on Snapchat. And if you can&#8217;t get enough of your friends to tag you in photos, then you may find yourself drawn to the setting &#8220;Allow Pops from Everyone,&#8221; instead of just &#8220;People You Approve.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no world in which letting &#8220;everyone&#8221; upload photos to a social media profile doesn&#8217;t invite abuse at some point, but Poparazzi is clearly hedging its bets here. It likely knows it won&#8217;t have to deal with the fallout of these choices until further down the road &#8212; after it&#8217;s filled out its network with millions of disgruntled Instagram users, that is.</p>
<p>Dozens of other growth hacks are spread throughout the app, too, from <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorVO/status/1397035390419181568">multiple pushes to invite friends</a> scattered throughout the app to a very Snapchatt-y <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorVO/status/1397035422899834880?s=20">&#8220;Top Poparazzi&#8221; section</a> that will incentivize best friends to keep up their posting streaks.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a clever bag of tricks. And though the app does not offer comments or followers counts, it isn&#8217;t being much of an &#8220;anti-Instagram&#8221; when it comes to chasing clout. The posts &#8212; which can turn into looping GIFs if you snap a few in a row &#8212; may be more &#8220;authentic&#8221; and unedited than those on Instagram; but Poparazzi users react to posts with a range of emojis and how many reactions a post receives is shown publicly.</p>
<p>For beta testers featured on the explore page, reactions can be in the hundreds or thousands &#8212; effectively establishing a bar for Pop influence.</p>
<p>Finally, users you follow have permission to post photos, but if you <em>unfollow</em> them &#8212; a sure sign that you no longer want them to be in your poparazzi squad &#8212; they can still post to your profile. As it turns out, your squad is managed under a separate setting under &#8220;Allow Pops From.&#8221; That could lead to trouble. At the very least, it would be nice to see the app asking users if they also want to remove the unfollowed account&#8217;s permission to post to your profile at the time of the unfollow.</p>
<p>Overall, the app can be fun &#8212; especially if you&#8217;re in the young, carefree demographic it caters to. ItsÂ friend-centric and ironically anti-glam stance is promising as well. But additional privacy controls and the ability to join the service in a way that offers far more granular control of your friend graph in order to boost anti-abuse protections would be welcome additions.<span class="c-message__edited_label" dir="ltr" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Â </span></p>
<p>TechCrunch tried to reach Poparazzi&#8217;s team to gain their perspective on the app&#8217;s design and growth strategy, but did not hear back. (We understand they&#8217;re heads down for the time being.) We understand, per SignalFire&#8217;s <a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/poparazzi-photo-app-blows-up-by-banning">Josh Constine</a>Â and our own confirmation, that Floodgate has invested in the startup, as has former TechCrunch co-editor Alexia Bonatsos&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/former-journo-alexia-bonatsos-takes-the-wraps-off-her-new-venture-fund-dream-machine/">Dream Machine</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1396962529968988162?s=20">Weekend Fund</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If it seems like everyone you know is moving to Florida these days, there is evidence to back that up. Recent data from LinkedIn <a href="https://www.axios.com/florida-migration-gains-pandemic-4ade6fc2-1b5f-4a56-b126-ef53cd65b841.html">published in Axios</a> put Tampa Bay, Jacksonville and the Miami-Fort Lauderdale metro areas among the top 10 U.S. cities seeing in-migration.</p>
<p>When I relocated from Chicago to Tampa in early 2018, I found myself in a city that countered the stereotypes Iâd heard about the state. Since then, Iâve come to appreciate the advantages that came with building my organization in Florida, and Iâm often asked how I made the call.</p>
<p>To help you weigh the benefits of relocating your startup to Florida, here are some FAQs Iâve encountered. And if the Sunshine State isnât on your startupâs shortlist, donât hesitate to apply these answers to a different destination.</p>
<h2>1. What are your companyâs needs?</h2>
<p>While you may have personal reasons for wanting to relocate to a new state, itâs a good idea to map out your companyâs needs as you think through this decision.</p>
<p>Does a move bring you closer to a great pool of talent? Are you looking for a headquarters near a specific material resource or type of infrastructure? Do you need to be local to a target customer base or community?</p>
<p>For example, Florida is a terrific location for companies that stand to benefit from the presence of retired military talent and the prevalence of military bases, which creates a strong market for certain types of tech innovation, including cybersecurity and aviation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If youâre a startup leader who is looking to land in a place with a strong, welcoming network, take the time to reach out to local community leaders and other founders like you.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Whatever it is you need to fuel your companyâs growth, listing out your companyâs requirements will make it easier to compare your needs with what your potential destination has to offer.</p>
<h2>2. Which community do you want to be a part of?</h2>
<p>If you havenât found the tech community youâre looking for in your current location, pause to articulate what qualities youâre looking for. With this in mind, you can begin to establish the kinds of local connections youâre hoping to grow before you make any big moves.</p>
<p>I moved to Florida to participate in the diverse tech communities in Tampa and Miami, and I knew I was headed to the right place because I tested the waters before jumping in. As a relative newcomer myself, Iâve found the landscape in Florida to be more open and accessible than in other more established startup hubs, but donât take my word for it.</p>
<p>If youâre a startup leader who is looking to land in a place with a strong, welcoming network, take the time to reach out to local community leaders and other founders like you. Whether that means sending a tweet to the mayor of Miami or connecting to local startup hubs, these interactions will give you a good sense of the local culture.</p>
<p>Because so many people are migrating down to Florida, weâve put together a database of recent transplants to make it even easier to connect new residents to the existing tech community.</p>
<h2>3. What are the potential benefits of moving your company to Florida?</h2>
<p>When I think about what brought me to Florida and why I see other entrepreneurs headed this way, three big things come to mind:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OpenAI is launching a $100 million startup fund, which it calls the <a href="https://openai.com/fund/">OpenAI Startup Fund</a>, through which it and its partners will invest in early-stage AI companies tackling major problems (and productivity). Among those partners and investors in the fund is Microsoft, at whose Build conference OpenAI founder Sam Altman announced the news.</p>
<p>In a prerecorded video, Altman explained that &#8220;this is not a typical corporate venture fund. We plan to make big early bets on a relatively small number of companies, probably not more than 10.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear exactly how the $100 million will be divided or disbursed, or on what timeline, or whether this is part of a longer program. But it seems to be a limited fund, not just the 2021 round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Altman did say that they will be looking for companies that are taking on serious issues, like healthcare, climate change and education, where AI-powered applications or approaches could &#8220;benefit all of humanity,&#8221; in keeping with OpenAI&#8217;s mission statement. But it would also consider productivity improvements as well, presumably like the GPT-3-powered natural language coding Microsoft showed off yesterday.</p>

<p>&#8220;We know it&#8217;s you, the developers, who can use powerful tools like GPT-3 to create ambitious applications that will leave a positive mark on the world,&#8221; said Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott in the company&#8217;s stream. &#8220;Microsoft is thrilled to be able to support this fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies selected for funding will receive early access to new OpenAI systems and Azure resources from Microsoft, which hopefully would allow them to spring fully formed and ready to scale from the program. OpenAI would not elaborate on the equity agreement, expectations for startups, other partners or any further details. It&#8217;s entirely possible that the $100 million figure is the only thing they&#8217;ve actually settled on.</p>
<p>The minimal application process suggests they expect a large number of submissions, but if you want to throw your company into the mix, start prepping your elevator pitch. Part of the application is a one-minute video (take note that &#8220;demos, music and effects are not necessary&#8221;) that the selection team (the makeup of which OpenAI did not detail) will no doubt watch if a company makes it through the first round of winnowing. Hope you haven&#8217;t dismantled that Zoom background just yet.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong> I do recruitment for tech startups. With a surge of VC investing, many startups are urgently hiring. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Which visas offer the quickest options for international talent? Are there any unique strategies that you would recommend we explore?</strong></p>
<p><strong>â Maverick in Milpitas</strong></p>
<p>Dear Maverick,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out with your questions! Weâre seeing the same urgent hiring demand from startups. In my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/sophie-alcorn/">columns</a>, youâll find a lot of materials to support you regarding the most common options. However, in a recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/072-special-visas-for-talent-from-specific-countries/">podcast episode</a>, I discussed a handful of very specialized â and rarely used â temporary work visas that in most situations offer an expedited way to bring international talent to the United States to live and work. The eligibility requirements for these work visas are very specific, but if any prospective candidates qualify, these visas are great, quick options for the startups you work with.</p>
<p>The quickest option for employers is to hire international talent already in the U.S. because many consulates still remain closed to routine visa processing due to the pandemic. Whatâs more, travel restrictions have been imposed on India and remain in place for Brazil, the U.K., Ireland, 26 other countries in Europe, China and Iran. However, there are some exceptions in the national interest. As always, I recommend consulting with an experienced immigration attorney.</p>
<p>Here are a few uncommon visas and strategies that can offer quick options for startups to recruit international talent:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch Disrupt has always been opportunity central, but thatâs never been truer than this year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">Disrupt 2021</a> (September 21-23) â especially for early-stage founders who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">exhibit in Startup Alley</a>.</p>
<p>Hereâs why. Using Hopin â our virtual platform â <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/">Startup Alley exhibitors</a> can schedule and host interactive product demos via livestream. Every exhibiting startup receives a company listing â a virtual booth as it were â where you can include a product walk-through video complete with links to your website and social media accounts. But wait, it gets better.</p>
<p>Take advantage of the interactive, livestream capability and share your screen, host a live demo or a product tutorial â you can even moderate the chat area. Put on your entrepreneurial thinking cap and get creative. Why not use the livestream to host your own Q&amp;A session?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Before Disrupt even begins, you can combine the power of CrunchMatch, our AI-powered networking platform, and your access to the Disrupt attendee list. Schedule a demo to take place during Disrupt, reach out to your targeted audience using CrunchMatch, and line up those RSVPs in advance.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to establish yourself as a subject matter expert â this is a great way to tap into a hot tech topic, invite interested parties and get the conversation rolling. Whether you want to pitch, educate, sell or inspire, Startup Alley is the place and the platform to get the job done.</p>
<p>What else comes with exhibiting in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/"> Startup Alley</a>? Weâre so glad you asked.</p>
<p>The founders of every exhibiting startup get two minutes to pitch to TechCrunch staff live in a breakout session â in front of thousands of Disrupt attendees across the globe. Itâs not just great practice. Youâll receive invaluable feedback to hone your pitch to prime fundraising perfection.</p>
<p>You might get tapped for a Startup Alley Crawl interview. Weâre hosting a one-hour crawl for each business category. TC editors will choose several startups in each category and interview them live on the Disrupt stage.</p>
<p>Donât forget about the Startup Battlefield Wild Card. Every year, TC editors select two outstanding startups from all the exhibitors. Those Wild Cards get to compete in the epic Startup Battlefield.</p>
<p>One last massive opportunity. All early-stages founders who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy a Startup Alley Pass</a> before <strong>before Friday, June 4 at 11:59 pm (PDT)</strong> are eligible for Startup Alley+. This is a curated, VIP experience designed to offer more growth opportunities. It kicks off in July and by the time Disrupt rolls around in September, you may well be an unstoppable force. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/heres-all-the-biz-dev-support-startup-alley-founders-get-at-tc-disrupt-2021/">Read the details here</a>, and if you want a shot to be one of up to 50 chosen founders, you gotta beat the deadline.</p>
<p>Get creative, take advantage of opportunity central and exhibit in Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>. We canât wait to see what youâve got!</p>
