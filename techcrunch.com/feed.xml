										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building and sustaining a startup is as challenging as it is fulfilling. Doing it during a global pandemic takes unprecedented (oy, there’s that word again) ingenuity, support and expert insight. You’ll find all of that and more at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TC Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23.</p>
<p><strong>A shut-the-front-door moment:</strong> Want to access all the expert advice, networking, community connection and potential growth opportunities for less than $100? Heck yeah. You have just two left weeks to score the super early-bird price. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">Buy your pass to Disrupt 2021</a> before the deadline expires on <strong>May 13, 11:59 pm (PST)</strong>.</p>
<p>Every <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TC Disrupt</a> features one-on-one interviews, presentations and breakout sessions with tech titans, fascinating founders, top-tier VCs and countless other subject-matter experts spanning the tech ecosystem. We’re building a righteous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#eb919231-f3e4-4def-8dd0-afb0bc7c9c6e">roster of speakers</a>, and we’ll be announcing them in the coming weeks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s one example we can share today. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/discover-how-duolingo-started-with-ceo-luis-von-ahn-at-disrupt-2021/">Luis von Ahn</a> co-founded Duolingo, a gamified language-learning app used by hundreds of millions around the world. And get this — von Ahn debuted Duolingo on the Disrupt stage nine years ago. He might have a few helpful hints, amirite?</p>
<p>Show of hands — who can’t wait for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a>? If you think you have what it takes to win this famously epic global pitch competition, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">apply right here</a>. Take your shot and you might just walk away with $100,000. Every competing team benefits from intense media and investor exposure. Not ready to throw down? That’s cool — you can learn a lot just by watching the pitches and hearing the questions posed by leading VC judges.</p>
<p>Speaking of Startup Battlefield judges. So far, we’ve tapped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/sydney-thomas-is-coming-to-judge-startups-at-disrupt/">Sydney Thomas</a> (Precursor Ventures), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/alexa-von-tobel-will-join-disrupt-2021-as-a-startup-battlefield-judge/">Alexa von Tobel</a> (Inspired Capital) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/gv-partner-terri-burns-is-joining-us-to-judge-the-startup-battlefield/">Terri Burns</a> (GV) — with more to come. These folks know their stuff, so get ready to impress the best.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about Startup Alley. We’ve supercharged the exposure opportunities for exhibitors in our virtual expo, including a chance to participate in Startup Alley+ — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">read about the new Startup Alley benefits</a> and opportunities.

<p>Why should you attend Disrupt? Rachael Wilcox, a creative producer at Volvo Cars, tells us why she keeps coming back.</p>
<blockquote><p>I love Disrupt because it features incredible companies. My work exposes me to lots of companies all over the world but, inevitably, I run across startups at Disrupt I haven&#8217;t heard of yet. It&#8217;s always fascinating to explore opportunities and find ways to work together.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TC Disrupt 2021</a> takes place on September 21-23. Come find the inspiration, opportunities and expert information you need to drive your business forward. And you’ll find it for less than $100 — if you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy your pass</a> before <strong>May 13, 11:59 pm (PST)</strong>.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>This morning was a notable one in the life of TechCrunch the publication, as our parent company&#8217;s parent company <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-media-be-acquired-apollo-funds">decided to sell</a> our parent company to a different parent company. And now we&#8217;re to have to get new corporate IDs, again, as it appears that our new parent company&#8217;s parent company wants to rebrand our parent company. As Yahoo.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, a bunch of other stuff happened as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flywire, a Boston-based payments company <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001580560/000119312521146481/d469729ds1.htm">filed to go public</a>. More on the site about this shortly.</li>
<li>Earnings this week are coming from Uber and Lyft and PayPal and Square and more.</li>
<li>Dell is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/dell-dumps-another-big-asset-moving-boomi-to-francisco-partners-and-tpg-for-4b/">offloading Boomi</a> to private equity as it wants to de-lever. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/">Again</a>.</li>
<li>Cloud market share numbers <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-market-Q121">are out</a>, but what matters is that the growth of the cloud market helps explain the growth that we&#8217;re seeing in the startup game. (Our own Ron Miller dug into some rival cloud metrics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/cloud-infrastructure-market-keeps-rolling-in-q1-with-almost-40b-in-revenue/">here</a>.)</li>
<li>The Chinese government&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/china-says-33-apps-break-rules-in-gathering-personal-information">crackdown</a> on its tech giants continues. And <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-halves-its-ant-group-valuation-after-beijings-clampdown-11620036004">it&#8217;s impacting valuations</a>.</li>
<li>And Wealthsimple raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/wealthsimple-raises-610m-at-a-4b-valuation/">an epic CAD$750 million round</a>, while Ohio-based Path Robotics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/path-robotics-raises-56m-series-b-for-automated-welding/">just raised a $56 million Series B</a>. Super cool.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse, the voice-based networking app that&#8217;s now being knocked off by every major tech platform, is bringing its service to Android. The company announced during its weekly Townhall event that its Android version has entered beta testing with a handful of non-employees who will provide the company with early feedback ahead of a public launch.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.notion.so/Release-Notes-acfb2f5d56cf4718b6486f5f670db6ad">release notes</a>, Clubhouse referred to this test as involving a &#8220;rough beta version&#8221; that&#8217;s in the process of being rolled out to a group of &#8220;friendly testers.&#8221; That means there&#8217;s not a way for the broader public to sign up for the Android app just yet.</p>
<p>The lack of an Android client combined with its invite system initially gave Clubhouse an aura of exclusivity. You had to know someone to get in, and then you would need an iOS device to participate. But the delay to provide access to Android users also gave larger competitors time to catch up with Clubhouse and court users who were being left behind. One of the largest of the rivals, Facebook, recently challenged Clubhouse across all its platforms and services, in fact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">a full audio strategy</a> that included a range of new products, from short-form audio snippets to a direct Clubhouse clone that works across Facebook and Messenger. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/instagram-live-takes-on-clubhouse-with-options-to-mute-and-turn-off-the-video/">announced</a> a way for Instagram Live users to turn off their video and mute their mics, similar to Clubhouse. Even Facebook&#8217;s R&amp;D division <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/facebook-tests-hotline-a-qa-product-thats-a-mashup-of-clubhouse-and-instagram-live/">tested a Clubhouse alternative, Hotline</a>, which offers a sort of mashup between the popular audio app and Instagram Live, with more of a Q&amp;A focus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Twitter is continuing to expand its audio rooms feature, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">Twitter Spaces</a>, and there are Clubhouse alternatives from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/spotify-ceo-says-live-audio-content-is-the-next-stories/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/19/telegram-voice-features-ios-update/">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/social-networking-app-for-women-peanut-adds-live-audio-rooms/">others</a>, in the works, too.</p>
<p>For Clubhouse, that means the time has come to push for growth &#8212; especially as there are already some signs its initial hype is wearing off. According to app store intelligence firm Apptopia, Clubhouse has seen an estimated 13.5 million downloads on iOS to date, but the number of daily downloads has been falling, mirroring a decline in the number of daily active users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146751" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146751" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146751" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="126" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg 2047w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=150,28 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=300,56 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=768,142 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=680,126 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=1536,284 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=50,9 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146751" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apptopia</p></div></p>
<p>Apptopia&#8217;s data shows that Clubhouse&#8217;s daily active users are down 68% from a high in February 2021, though that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that Clubhouse is over &#8212; it&#8217;s just becoming less of a daily habit. However, if the company is able to build out its creator community and establish a number of popular shows, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">which it&#8217;s aiming to do via its accelerator,</a> it could still see users tuning in on a weekly and monthly basis. And those sessions would be longer in comparison with some other social apps, as Clubhouse users often tune into shows that run over an hour &#8212; even leaving the app open as they do other tasks.</p>
<p>Plus, Clubhouse is taking aim at the challenges around re-engaging people whose usage may have dwindled in recent days. Also during its Townhall, the company announced it would introduce a bell icon for events that will allow users to be notified about the events they&#8217;ve RSVP&#8217;d to. This will be important for creators who are advertising their events, as well.</p>
<p>Clubhouse didn&#8217;t give a specific timeframe as to when its Android app would reach more testers or the wider public, only noting that it&#8217;s looking forward to welcoming more Android users in the &#8220;coming weeks.&#8221; In March, Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/clubhouse-says-its-android-launch-will-take-a-couple-of-months/">had said the Android launch</a> would take a couple of months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the real world &#8211; the world on which the global economy runs &#8211; we don’t expose every aspect of our financial activity in public. We want to be able to select which parties can access our financial data and under what circumstances &#8211; for example, our credit history or bank transactions. The problem with the blockchain world is that this financial privacy doesn’t really exist. This has led to pretty bad abuses, such as the practice of front-running’ where a nefarious person can take advantage of you immediately after seeing your transaction on a public blockchain. What’s required is a real infrastructure improvement to this problem, for, without it, the Crypto ‘Shangri-la’ of ‘DeFi’ (decentralized finance) will never have a hope of taking off.</p>
<p>It’s therefore significant that some well-known organizations in the realm of blockchain financing are investing the equivalent of $11.5 million into SCRT, the native coin of the <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> blockchain. The investment was led by <a href="http://arringtonxrpcapital.com/">Arrington Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.blocktower.com/">Blocktower Capital </a>and also include <a href="https://www.spartangroup.io/">Spartan Group</a>, and <a href="https://skynettrading.com/">Skynet Trading</a>.</p>
<p>Previous investors in in Secret includs <a href="https://outlierventures.io/">Outlier Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.fenbushicapital.vc/">Fenbushi Capital</a>, and <a href="http://hashed.com/">Hashed</a>, as well as <a href="https://secret.foundation/">Secret Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.enigma.co/">Enigma MPC, </a>and node operators such as <a href="https://figment.io/">Figment</a> and <a href="https://staked.us/">Staked</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tor Bair, founder of Secret Foundation said: “The addition of these valuable and experienced partners to the Secret ecosystem marks a significant inflection point for Secret Network as we concentrate on expanding and supporting our fast-growing application layer.”</p>
<p>Secret, which used to be called Enigma before a pivot, claims to have been the first privacy-first smart contract platform. (The first version of this blockchain was called the “Enigma Mainnet,” but this branding was changed to Secret Network via a governance vote in summer 2020).</p>
<p>So far in 2021, the Secret Network ecosystem has launched several native applications, including <a href="https://www.secretswap.io/">SecretSwap</a>, a “front-running resistant”, cross-chain AMM with privacy protections. It is also developing <a href="https://scrt.network/blog/secret-nft-update-reference-implementation-new-tutorial">Secret NFTs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>So why is this at all significant?</strong></p>
<p><strong> Why should we care? </strong>It’s simply because, without privacy, DeFi is highly unlikely to go mainstream.</p>
<p>Without privacy in transactions, the traditional economic system won’t bother taking any notice of crypto and blockchain, outside of noting whether the price of bitcoin goes up or down.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Secret is not the only player tackling this area. It is playing in the same arena as blockchain projects such as Phala (not yet on mainnet, and built on Polkadot), Oasis, and Aleo, which recently just fundraised via Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>What these projects all have in common is this race towards what’s known as the Web3 ‘application privacy’ space. Once again, they are trying to reproduce the kind of financial privacy that we have all come to expect from the traditional financial system, but which remains elusive in the blockchain world.</p>
<p>However, this approach should not be confused with privacy coins like Monero and Zcash. These are coins, and therefore not the same at all as the above-named projects, which are aiming at what’s known as ‘programmable privacy’.</p>
<p>Bair told me: “Transactional privacy [via privacy coins] just means hiding simple aspects of transactions from other parties &#8211; a narrow form of privacy. Smart contract privacy &#8211; what we call ‘programmable privacy’ &#8211; is a much more powerful idea, allowing developers to build complex decentralized and permissionless applications that also protect data privacy, with big consequences for Web3 security and usability. As an analogy &#8211; imagine trying to build a decentralized Facebook. Normal blockchains expose all data by default, a much worse outcome for user privacy and security. Only smart contract privacy allows you to build these types of complex applications without compromising the user experience and threatening their safety.”</p>
<p>Front-running is often described as getting a transaction first in line before a known future transaction occurs. Bair claims Secret protects against this at the protocol level because all interactions with smart contracts are encrypted and cannot be viewed even by the network validators, “so all DeFi applications built on Secret network are front running resistant by default” he told me.</p>
<p>That said, Secret will still have to compete with the myriad privacy projects already on &#8211; for instance &#8211; Ethereum, such as Automata. The Secret Network is a standalone blockchain and would still require a developer community to be successful, versus Ethereum and Polkadot, which technically have a head start, of sorts. But these blockchains are public by default. So Secret’s hyper-focus on the issue of privacy may yet make Secret a major player in this realm.</p>
<p>Bair commented: “Only programmable privacy can give users and developers this level of control in the DeFi world. Without programmable privacy, DeFi will never achieve mass adoption outside of purely speculative activity. Secret Network intends to become the foundation for new types of DeFi applications that better protect users while also allowing traditional institutions to participate securely, with protections for sensitive data. Also, blockchains don’t need thousands of developers to succeed in the short term &#8211; they need the right developers who build the early critical applications.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, Secret has in its favor the fact that due to the whole nature of decentralization of the blockchain space isn’t nearly as much a ‘winner-take-all’ environment as the general Internet has become due to the growth of the large BigTech platforms &#8211; that would be counter to the point of decentralization. As Bair told me: “Secret’s vision is to become a data privacy hub for all public blockchains, collaborating more than competing with networks like Ethereum (to which we already have a live bridge with over $100M in assets locked).”</p>
<p>Secret Network claims it was one of the first blockchains to feature privacy-preserving smart contracts, which it launched on mainnet in September 2020. It says this means all decentralized applications built on Secret Network have data privacy by default. The Secret Network blockchain itself is based on Cosmos SDK / Tendermint, giving it its own independent consensus, on-chain governance, and features like slashing and delegation. It is secured by the native coin Secret (SCRT), which must be staked by network validators and is used for transaction and computation fees as well as governance, said the foundation.</p>
<p>Commenting on the investment, Michael Arrington, founder of Arrington Capital said: “Secret is the first blockchain ecosystem to prioritize privacy. Financial privacy is critical to individual freedom, and Arrington Capital has long been committed to financial privacy and censorship resistance. The rapid expansion of Decentralized Finance makes solutions like Secret Network a timely addition to the DeFi ecosystem.” (Arrington Capital was established by Arrington, who was also previously the founder of TechCrunch, but who has no involvement in the title these days).</p>
<p>Jamie Burke, founder of Outlier Ventures in the UK and a Secret backer, told me: “Privacy will be essential to the security and adoption of Web3, from DeFi to NFTs and beyond. Secret Network brings new and unique privacy functionality to the space, and as a result we believe it will be foundational to the next generation of successful Web3 applications.”</p>
<p>Secret is also getting support from DeFi players such as the <a href="https://sienna.network/">Sienna Network</a>. Monty Munford, Chief Evangelist and Core Contributor to the privacy DeFi company told me: “Of all the networks in all the world, we chose Secret because it was a yes-yes-yes brainer. They understand privacy and we understand DeFi; it’s a match made in heaven.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoomo, the Australian startup with a mission to electrify delivery fleets through e-bike subscriptions, announced a $12 million interim capital raise on Monday.</p>
<p>The company made a name for itself through partnerships with UberEats and DoorDash to help delivery workers access e-bikes through weekly subscriptions at discounted rates. Zoomo then grew to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/with-11-million-in-fresh-capital-bolt-bikes-rebrands-to-zoomo/">offer monthly subscriptions</a> to corporate partners in Australia, the U.S. and London for last mile delivery, with a fleet that has expanded beyond 10,000 units globally.</p>
<p>Now, the startup hopes to expand its service outward towards continental Europe and other states across the U.S. It currently operates in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. Zoomo also wants to build up its consumer model, which mainly serves couriers but is extending to commuters, and will invest in the development of its next generation of vehicle offerings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We initially built our products to service the demands of gig workers in the food delivery industry,&#8221; Mina Nada, Zoomo CEO and co-founder said in a statement. &#8220;Their expectations for quality commercial vehicles, on demand service, flexible financing and tech enabled security features spurred us to innovate. We’re now seeing enterprises and fleet managers benefiting from the platform we have built. Enterprise fleet managers looking for clean and efficient vehicles are choosing us.”</p>

<p>Zoomo&#8217;s focus on e-bikes for food delivery makes it unique in the electric bike rental space. Its business model offers a full-stack e-bike, from the hardware and software to same-day servicing and financing options, which especially helps big business partners deploy and manage large fleets of vehicles at scale. It&#8217;s a tall order, and Zoomo&#8217;s strategy could be leading a new trend in micromobility of being a one-stop-shop that promises quick scalability.</p>
<p>German mobility software provider <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/wunder-mobilitys-new-lending-business-helps-micromobility-startups-finance-fleets/">Wunder Mobility recently announced</a> its efforts to offer a souped up e-moped that&#8217;s been co-designed with Chinese consumer manufacturer Yadea for the dockless sharing market. It also launched a new subsidiary to finance the vehicles, along with its software, to shared micromobility providers. Wunder Mobility plans to offer e-scooters and e-bikes for financing in the future, but it doesn&#8217;t design its own vehicles or sell them outright. While the business models and target customers don&#8217;t perfectly align, the blueprint is the same: Corner a market, provide top quality hardware and software and make it as accessible as possible.</p>
<p>Coronavirus spurred a demand for delivery in all industries, and we can see companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/fluid-truck-the-zipcar-of-commercial-trucks-raises-63m-to-take-on-rental-giants/">FluidTruck</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/amazon-begins-testing-its-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-in-san-francisco/">Rivian</a> stepping up to the plate to meet the needs of eco-conscious e-commerce giants with their electric delivery vans. The online food delivery industry is no different with a market that&#8217;s expected to reach <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/27/2217586/0/en/Online-Food-Delivery-Services-Global-Market-Report-2021-COVID-19-Growth-And-Change-To-2030.html">$192.16 billion in 2025</a> at a compound annual growth rate of 11%. But for delivery within cities, e-bikes offer a smarter solution for meeting climate change goals while dodging traffic congestion.</p>
<p>Zoomo&#8217;s custom designed bikes can bear more than 200 kilograms of load via various cargo options, according to a Zoomo spokesperson. For enterprise customers, like health food company Cornucopia, e-cargo delivery vehicles like a Trailer Trike or a Covered Trike are used to deliver goods sustainably. Gorillas, an on-demand grocery delivery company, and Just Eat Takeaway, acquirer of Grubhub and Seamless, are also clients of Zoomo&#8217;s.</p>
<p>“At Just Eat Takeaway.com, we want to build a sustainable future for food delivery, and are committed to doing our bit to help keep carbon emissions to a minimum, as well as providing an efficient customer experience from order to delivery,&#8221; said a Just Eat Takeaway spokesperson in a statement. &#8220;E-Vehicles are an integral part of the Scoober model and we are pleased to work in cooperation with Zoomo.”</p>
<p>Zoomo&#8217;s newest funding round, led by Australian VC AirTree, follows an $11 million Series A raised in August 2020, with support in both rounds from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Maniv Mobility and Contrarian Ventures. Withrop Square and Wisdom VC, mobility and clean tech-focused investors, also joined this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is known for its pitch-offs. We&#8217;ve had them in cities all over the world, and heard from hundreds of startups who have shared the story of their company on our stages.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to be bringing the pitch-off to Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>Anyone in the audience on an episode of Extra Crunch Live can virtually &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to be selected to pitch in front of the audience and get feedback from our all-star guests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On ECL, pitch-off startups will have two minutes to tell us about their company. This is the equivalent of an elevator pitch — imagine running into a VC or potential customer at a tech conference like Disrupt or bumping into them at a park. As such, no visual aids are allowed, including decks, videos, demoes, etc.</p>
<p>Essentially, what can you convey with your words, in a short time frame, to get people to both understand your startup and be excited about it?</p>
<p>This is a critical skill, and we&#8217;re creating the space for founders to practice and improve.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m amped to have Firstmark&#8217;s Rick Heitzmann and Orchard founder Court Cunningham as guests on Extra Crunch Live on May 5. This founder/investor duo know exactly what it takes to deliver a great pitch.

You have just <strong>four days left</strong> to save $100 to our June 9 deep-dive exploration into the current and future state of mobility and transportation.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=4daysebcountdown&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=eb4days&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your pass to TC Sessions Mobility 2021</a> before the price increase goes into effect on <strong>Thursday, May 6 at 11:59 pm (PT).</strong></p>
<p>The event is virtual (thanks a bunch, you nasty pandemic), but the information you’ll glean and the worldwide connections you’ll make are very real. The global nature of the opportunities waiting for you to find is a big democratizing benefit of going virtual.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The day comes jam-packed with presentations, one-on-one interviews and breakout sessions with the top founders, investors and makers in mobility. Don’t stress about missing out over a schedule conflict — your pass includes access to video-on-demand once the event ends.</p>
<p>Here’s what Rachael Wilcox, a creative producer at Volvo Cars, told us about her experience at TC Sessions: Mobility 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was impressed with the virtual platform. It was easy to navigate and a great format for asking questions. Combining live-stream and VOD options provided schedule flexibility, which let me be more focused and attend more presentations than I could at a live event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at just some of the topics and the people who will cover them. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=4daysebcountdown&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=eb4days&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check out the agenda here</a> and plan your strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Will Venture Capital Drive the Future of Mobility?</strong> Clara Brenner, Quin Garcia and Rachel Holt will discuss how the pandemic changed their investment strategies, the hottest sectors within the mobility industry, the rise of SPACs as a financial instrument and where they plan to put their capital in 2021 and beyond.</li>
<li><strong>Equity, Accessibility and Cities:</strong> Can mobility be accessible, equitable and remain profitable? We have brought together community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer Tamika L. Butler; Remix by Via co-founder and CEO Tiffany Chu and Revel co-founder and CEO Frank Reig to discuss how (and if) shared mobility can provide equity in cities, while still remaining a viable and even profitable business. The trio will also dig into the challenges facing cities and how policy may affect startups.</li>
<li><strong>EV Founders in Focus:</strong> We sit down with the founders poised to take advantage of the rise in electric vehicle sales. This time, we will chat with Kameale Terry, co-founder and CEO of ChargerHelp! a startup that enables on-demand repair of electric vehicle charging stations.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s widely known that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/dells-debt-hangover-from-67b-emc-deal-could-put-vmware-stock-in-play/">Dell has a debt problem</a> left over from its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/67-billion-dell-emc-deal-becomes-official-today/">massive acquisition of EMC</a> in 2016, and it seems to be moving this year to eliminate part of it in multi-billion chunks. The first step <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/">was spinning out VMware</a> as a separate company last month, a move expected to net close to $10 billion.</p>
<p>The second, long expected, finally dropped last night when the company announced it was selling Boomi to a couple of private equity firms for $4 billion. Francisco Partners is joining forces with TPG to make the deal to buy the integration platform.</p>
<p>Boomi is not unlike Mulesoft, a company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/">Salesforce purchased in 2018 for $6.5 billion</a>, although a bit longer in tooth. They both help companies with integration problems by creating connections between disparate systems. With so many pieces in place from various acquisitions over the years, it seems like a highly useful asset for Dell to help pull these pieces together and make them work, but the cash is trumping that need.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Providing integration services is a growing requirement as companies look for ways to make better use of data locked in siloed systems. Boomi could help and that&#8217;s one of the primary reasons for the acquisition, according to Francisco executives.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to integrate and connect data and workflows across any combination of applications or domains is a critical business capability, and we strongly believe that Boomi is well positioned to help companies of all sizes turn data into their most valuable asset,&#8221; Francisco CEO Dipanjan Deb and partner Brian Decker said in a statement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Dell is spinning out VMware in a deal expected to generate over $9B for the company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/embed/#?secret=nY35pcMla8" data-secret="nY35pcMla8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As you would expect, Boomi&#8217;s CEO Chris McNabb put a positive spin on the deal about how his new bosses were going to fuel growth for his company. &#8220;By partnering with two tier-one investment firms like Francisco Partners and TPG, we can accelerate our ability for our customers to use data to drive competitive advantage. In this next phase of growth, Boomi will be in a position of strength to further advance our innovation and market trajectory while delivering even more value to our customers,&#8221; McNabb said in a statement.</p>
<p>All of this may have some truth to it, but the company goes from being part of a large amorphous corporation to getting absorbed in the machinery of two private equity firms. What happens next is hard to say.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2000, and sold to Dell in 2010. Today, it has 15,000 customer, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/dell-spent-67b-buying-emc-more-than-3-years-later-was-it-worth-the-debt/">Dell&#8217;s debt has been well documented,</a> and when you string together a couple of multi-billion deals as Dell has recently, pretty soon you&#8217;re talking real money. While the company has not stated it will explicitly use the proceeds of this deal to pay off debt as it did with the VMware announcement, it stands to reason that this will be the case.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close later this year, although it will have to pass the typical regulatory scrutiny prior to that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote work is no longer a new topic, as much of the world has now been doing it for a year or more because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies &#8212; big and small &#8212; have had to react in myriad ways. Many of the initial challenges have focused on workflow, productivity and the like. But one aspect of the whole remote work shift that is not getting as much attention is the culture angle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 100% remote startup that was tackling the issue way before COVID-19 was even around is now seeing a big surge in demand for its offering that aims to help companies address the “people” challenge of remote work. It started its life with the name Icebreaker to reflect the aim of “breaking the ice” with people with whom you work.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We designed the initial version of our product as a way to connect people who’d never met, kind of virtual speed dating,” says co-founder and CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry Rosenstein. “But we realized that people were using it for far more than that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So over time, its offering has evolved to include a bigger goal of helping people get together beyond an initial encounter –– hence its new name: <a href="https://gatheround.com">Gatheround</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For remote companies, a big challenge or problem that is now bordering on a crisis is how to build connection, trust and empathy between people that aren’t sharing a physical space,” says co-founder and COO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lisa Conn.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “There’s no five-minute conversations after meetings, no shared meals, no cafeterias &#8212; this is where connection organically builds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations should be concerned, Gatheround maintains, that as we move more remote, that work will become more transactional and people will become more isolated. They can&#8217;t ignore that humans are largely social creatures, Conn said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup aims to bring people together online through real-time events such as a range of chats, videos and one-on-one and group conversations. The startup also provides templates to facilitate cultural rituals and learning &amp; development (L&amp;D) activities, such as all-hands meetings and workshops on diversity, equity and inclusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatheround’s video conversations aim to be a refreshing complement to Slack conversations, which despite serving the function of communication, still don’t bring users face-to-face.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146442" style="width: 624px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146442" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2146442" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="614" height="385" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146442" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gatheround</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, Gatheround has quietly built up an impressive customer base, including 28 Fortune 500s, 11 of the 15 biggest U.S. tech companies, 26 of the top 30 universities and more than 700 educational institutions. Specifically, those users include Asana, Coinbase, Fiverr, Westfield and DigitalOcean. Universities, academic centers and nonprofits, including Georgetown&#8217;s Institute of Politics and Public Service and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, are also customers. To date, Gatheround has had about 260,000 users hold 570,000 conversations on its SaaS-based, video platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All its growth so far has been organic, mostly referrals and word of mouth. Now, armed with $3.5 million in seed funding that builds upon a previous $500,000 raised, Gatheround is ready to aggressively go to market and build upon the momentum it’s seeing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture firms Homebrew and Bloomberg Beta co-led the company’s latest raise, which included participation from angel investors such as Stripe COO Claire Hughes Johnson, Meetup co-founder Scott Heiferman, Li Jin and Lenny Rachitsky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founders Rosenstein, Conn and Alexander McCormmach describe themselves as “experienced community builders,” having previously worked on President Obama’s campaigns as well as at companies like Facebook, Change.org and Hustle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio emphasize that Gatheround is also very different from Zoom and video conferencing apps in that its platform gives people prompts and organized ways to get to know and learn about each other as well as the flexibility to customize events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re fundamentally a connection platform, here to help organizations connect their people via real-time events that are not just really fun, but meaningful,” Conn said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebrew Partner Hunter Walk says his firm was attracted t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o the company&#8217;s founder-market fit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re a really interesting combination of founders with all this experience community building on the political activism side, combined with really great product, design and operational skills,” he told TechCrunch. “It was kind of unique that they didn’t come out of an enterprise product background or pure social background.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also drawn to the personalized nature of Gatheround’s platform, considering that it has become clear over the past year that the software powering the future of work “needs emotional intelligence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many companies in 2020 have focused on making remote work more productive. But what people desire more than ever is a way to deeply and meaningfully connect with their colleagues,” Walk said. “Gatheround does that better than any platform out there. I&#8217;ve never seen people come together virtually like they do on Gatheround, asking questions, sharing stories and learning as a group.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Cham, partner at Bloomberg Beta, agrees with Walk that the founding team&#8217;s knowledge of behavioral psychology, group dynamics and community building gives them an edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;More than anything, though, they care about helping the world unite and feel connected, and have spent their entire careers building organizations to make that happen,&#8221; he said in a written statement. &#8220;So it was a no-brainer to back Gatheround, and I can&#8217;t wait to see the impact they have on society.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 14-person team will likely expand with the new capital, which will also go toward helping adding more functionality and details to the Gatheround product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even before the pandemic, remote work was accelerating faster than other forms of work,” Conn said. “Now that’s intensified even more.”</span></p>
<p>Gatheround is not the only company attempting to tackle this space. Ireland-based Workvivo last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/inside-workvivos-plans-to-take-on-microsoft-in-the-employee-experience-space/">raised $16 million</a> and earlier this year, Microsoft  launched Viva, its new “employee experience platform.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following several days of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ef0992ec-1d4f-4030-95a9-d950e47338e1">negotiation</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/02/business/verizon-yahoo-aol-sale.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">rumors</a>, Verizon <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-media-be-acquired-apollo-funds">today announced</a> that it has entered an agreement to sell its media assets to private equity firm Apollo Global Management for $5 billion. Apollo will be paying Verizon  $4.25 billion in cash, along with preferred interests of $750 million, and Verizon will keep 10% of the company.</p>
<p>The new company, when the deal is complete, will be known simply as Yahoo, and it will continue to be led by current CEO, Guru Gowrappan and from what we understand the plan involve pursuing opportunities across content, commerce and betting. The division&#8217;s existing footprint spreads across a variety of internet brands, publishing (including us, TechCrunch) and advertising.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be joining forces with Apollo,” said Gowrappan, CEO, Verizon Media, in a statement. “The past two quarters of double-digit growth have demonstrated our ability to transform our media ecosystem. With Apollo’s sector expertise and strategic insight, Yahoo will be well positioned to capitalize on market opportunities, media and transaction experience and continue to grow our full stack digital advertising platform. This transition will help to accelerate our growth for the long- term success of the company.” (Gowrappan will be getting a cash retention award of $3 million, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/732712/000119312521146756/d312278d8k.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verizon said today</a>, if he stays on for six months after the deal closes.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are thrilled to help unlock the tremendous potential of Yahoo and its unparalleled collection of brands,” said Reed Rayman, private equity partner at Apollo, in the same statement. “We have enormous respect and admiration for the great work and progress that the entire organization has made over the last several years, and we look forward to working with Guru, his talented team, and our partners at Verizon to accelerate Yahoo’s growth in its next chapter.”</p>
<p>Although Verizon is retaining a stake, its divestment signifies a formal retreat for the telecoms giant, away from its expensive effort to take a stronger role in efforts to own, build and monetize content on top of its own and others&#8217; networks.</p>
<p>The news today caps off days, weeks, months and arguably years of speculation about the future of the media business under Verizon. The price Apollo is paying is in line with reports of the deal in recent days, which collectively pegged the deal at around $4-5 billion.</p>
<p>Those figures may sound big, but not when compared to what Verizon originally paid: a combined $9 billion+ respectively first<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/23/verizon-completes-its-acquisition-of-aol-for-4-4b/"> for AOL</a> in 2015 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/13/verizon-closes-4-5b-acquisition-of-yahoo-marissa-mayer-resigns-memo/">then Yahoo</a> in 2017.</p>
<p>The former deal brought AOL and its various media holdings &#8212; including The Huffington Post, TechCrunch, Engadget &#8212; under the VZW umbrella, while the latter added the iconic Yahoo search portal along with a slate of Yahoo services and Tumblr, resulting in a curious mix of newer services skewing to younger audiences mixed with a number of legacy internet properties, plus some experimental efforts thrown into the mix. (And some of those newer efforts are still a part of the process: Verizon notes that Yahoo News is currently the fastest-growing news organization on TikTok.)</p>
<p>After the acquisition, the two companies were merged under the umbrella of a new brand, Oath, part of a bigger strategy that Verizon had to grow a media empire to help it take on online ad giants like Google and Facebook, with the operation run by Tim Armstrong, who had been AOL&#8217;s longtime CEO going into the Verizon acquisition.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it never quite played out as Verizon thought that it would, or at least not as quickly as it had hoped.</p>
<p>Hans Vestberg &#8212; a longtime telecoms executive who first joined Verizon as CTO in 2017 &#8212; became the CEO in June 2018. In doing so, he essentially inherited a digital media business strategy that he had no hand in building.</p>
<p>“Verizon Media has done an incredible job turning the business around over the past two and a half years and the growth potential is enormous,” Vestberg said in a press release. “The next iteration requires full investment and the right resources. During the strategic review process, Apollo delivered the strongest vision and strategy for the next phase of Verizon Media. I have full confidence that Yahoo will take off in its new home.”</p>
<p>Within six months of him taking the top role, Armstrong had left the company (to be succeeded by Guru Gowrappan); and then Verizon <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/12/verizon-takes-massive-billion-write-down-its-media-business/">wrote the value of its media assets down to $4.6 billion</a>, noting at the time that Oath “experienced increased competitive and market pressures throughout 2018 that have resulted in lower-than-expected revenues and earnings.”</p>

<p>And the Oath name was short lived, with Verizon adopting a far more straightforward name, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/oath-officially-becomes-verizon-media-group-on-january-8/">Verizon Media</a>, in January 2019.</p>
<p>Further moves happened in increments. In August 2019, the company sold blogging platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/verizon-is-selling-tumblr-to-wordpress-parent-automattic/">Tumblr to WordPress-owner, Automattic</a>, for what was described then as a &#8220;nominal&#8221; price.</p>
<p>Then late last year, as the media world suffered from lack of ad revenue amid the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/buzzfeed-acquires-huffpost/">Verizon sold off HuffPost to Buzzfeed</a>, coupled with an equity investment into the digital media company and an advertising and syndication deal. And there have been various layoffs to trim the wider media operation.</p>
<p>Since the HuffPost transaction, the rumors swirling around Verizon&#8217;s plans to shed its remaining media assets intensified. (Although, again, there were reports around a possible sale for years before this.)</p>
<p>Yet that isn&#8217;t the full story.</p>
<p>In spite of a rough year for online publishing, Verizon Media began to see a rebound earlier this year, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-reports-strong-start-2021-company-accelerates-5g-growth">marking a 12% year-over-year jump in revenue for Q1</a>. In this morning&#8217;s release, the company cites Yahoo News&#8217; growth on TikTok, staying that platform &#8220;continues to evolve as a key destination for finance and news among Gen Z.&#8221; It was, at very least, some short term good news that may have ultimately better positioned the telecom for a big selloff.</p>
<p>Founded in 1990, Apollo has a wide and diverse range of assets, including the recently purchased Venetian resort in Las Vegas and craft giant, Michael’s. It also has a pretty extensive range of holdings in the telecoms, media and tech sector, including ADT, Coinstar, radio and television conglomerate Cox Media, with some assets going private but then getting spun out as public businesses (Rackspace, another Apollo investment, is one example of that). In other words, precisely what shape a company like Verizon Media would ultimately take as part of the Apollo portfolio is still something of a question mark.</p>
<p>“We are big believers in the growth prospects of Yahoo and the macro tailwinds driving growth in digital media, advertising technology and consumer internet platforms,” Apollo senior partner David Sambur says in the release. “Apollo has a long track record of investing in technology and media companies and we look forward to drawing on that experience to help Yahoo continue to thrive.”</p>
<p>The deal is subject to the standard regulator scrutiny. It&#8217;s expected to close in the second half of the year. LionTree served as lead financial advisor to and will invest alongside the Apollo Funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Columbus, Ohio-based firm Path Robotics today announced the completion of a $56 million Series B. The round, led by Addition (featuring Drive Capital, Basis Set and Lemnos Lab) brings the robotic welding company’s total funding to $71 million.</p>
<p>Adding another piece to the broader automated manufacturing puzzle, the company is focused on robotic welding. The system uses scanning, computer vision and AI to adjust itself to different parts, understanding that sizing parts is a kind of imperfect science. Add to that the additional difficulty of working with highly reflective metals and you’ve got some interesting robotics problems to solve.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rDmmWjKUt6g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Current industrial robotics have very little ability to understand their environment and the task at hand. Most robots merely repeat what they are told and have no ability to improve themselves,” CEO Andrew Lonsberry said in a release tied to the news. Our goal is to change this. The future of manufacturing hinges on highly capable robotics.”</p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s looking to address a shortage in the welding workforce, which the American Welding Society says will experience a shortage of around 400,000 by 2024. The pandemic has also driven a number of companies to look for a more localized solution, apparently somewhat curbing the trend of offshoring the industry has seen in recent decades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has announced a $10 million grant to support emergency response efforts in India and has rolled out its Vaccine Finder tool in the country as the South Asian nation grapples with the latest wave of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The American social network said that it has partnered with a number of organizations including United Way, Swasth, Hemkunt Foundation, I Am Gurgaon, Project Mumbai and US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) to help augment critical medical supplies with over 5,000 oxygen concentrators and other life-saving equipments such as ventilators, BiPAP machines and to increase hospital bed capacity.</p>
<p>Facebook also said it has partnered with the Government of India to roll out a Vaccine Finder tool on the company’s marquee app. The tool, available in 17 languages, is designed to help people identify and spot vaccine centres in their vicinity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week, India opened vaccination to people aged between 18 to 45, though its website quickly crashed and wasn’t immediately accepting appointment requests from most people in that age group.</p>
<p>Also worth checking out: Folks over at <a href="https://www.wifidabba.com/">WiFi Dabba</a>, a Bangalore-based startup that is working to build a low-cost ISP, have also <a href="https://findslot.in/">developed a tool</a> to help people easily find vaccination slots.</p>
<p>A bigger challenge confronting India currently, however, is the <a href="https://twitter.com/adarpoonawalla/status/1389166756871041024">shortage of vaccine</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook said it is also supporting non-government organizations and United Nation agencies in India with ad credits to reach the majority of people on Facebook with Covid-19 vaccine and preventive health information.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company said it is providing health resources to people from UNICEF India about when to seek emergency care and how to manage mild Covid-19 symptoms at home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canadian fintech giant Wealthsimple has raised a new round of $750 million CAD (~$610 million) at a post-money valuation of $5 billion CAD (~$4 billion). The round was led by Meritech and Greylock, and includes funding from Inovia, Sagard, Redpoint, Two Sigma Ventures, TCV as well as individual investors including Drake, Ryan Reynolds and Michael J. Fox (basically, all the most famous Canadians).</p>
<p>Wealthsimple&#8217;s big new raise more than doubles its valuation from its last round, a $114 million CAD (roughly $93 million) funding announced last October, which carried a post-money valuation of $1.5 billion CAD ($~1.22 billion USD). The Toronto-based company has been a leader in the realm of democratizing financial products for consumers, including stock trading, crypto asset sales, and peer-to-peer money transfers.</p>
<p>The company says that it experienced significant growth during the pandemic, which is likely one big reason why its valuation rose so much between its most recent raise and this one. Its commission-free retail investment platform has grown &#8220;rapidly&#8221; over the course of the past 14 months, the company says, and the crypto trading platform which it launched last August has also seen strong uptake given the recent surge in consumer interest in cryptocurrency assets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Late last year, Wealthsimple soft-launched its P2P money transfer app, Wealthsimple Cash, and in March it made it available to all Canadians. The app is very similar in terms of features to Venmo or Square&#8217;s Cash app, but neither of those offerings have been available to Canadians thus far. Wealthsimple&#8217;s app, which is free to use and distinct from its stock trading and crypto platforms, has thus tapped significant pent-up demand in the market and seen rapid uptake rthus far.</p>
<p>With this funding, Wealthsimple plans to &#8220;expand its market position, build out its product suite, and grow its team.&#8221; The company also offers automated savings and investing products (the robo-advisor tools it was originally founded around), as well as tax filing tools, and it has demonstrated a clear appetite and ability to expand its offerings to encompass even more of its customers financials lives when committed with fresh resources to do so.</p>
<p>The company says it has over 1.5 million users, with over $10 billion in assets under management as of the last publicly available numbers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ishangry.com/">Hangry</a>, an Indonesian cloud kitchen startup that wants to become a global food and beverage company, has raised a $13 million Series A. The round was led by returning investor Alpha JWC Ventures, and included participation from Atlas Pacific Capital, Salt Ventures and Heyokha Brothers. It will be used to increase the number of Hangry’s outlets in Indonesia, including launching its first dine-in restaurants, over the next two years before it enters other countries.</p>
<p>Along with a previous round of $3 million from Alpha JWC and Sequoia Capital’s Surge program, Hangry’s Series A brings its total funding to $16 million. It currently operates about 40 cloud kitchens in Greater Jakarta and Bandung, 34 of which launched in 2020. Hangry plans to expand its total outlets to more than 120 this year, including dine-in restaurants.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by Abraham Viktor, Robin Tan and Andreas Resha, Hangry is part of Indonesia’s burgeoning cloud kitchen industry. Tech giants Grab and Gojek both <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Food-Beverage/Southeast-Asia-s-cloud-kitchens-swell-powered-by-Grab-and-Gojek">operate networks of cloud kitchens </a>that are integrated with their food delivery services, while other startups in the space include Everplate and Yummy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>One of the main ways Hangry sets itself apart is by focusing on its own brands, instead of providing kitchen facilities and services to restaurants and other third-party clients. Hangry currently has four brands, including Indonesian chicken dishes (Ayam Koplo) and Japanese food (San Gyu), that cost about 15,000 to 70,000 IDR per portion (or about $1 to $6 USD). Its food can be ordered through Hangry’s own app, plus GrabFood, GoFood and ShopeeFood.</p>
<p>“Given that Hangry has developed an extensive cloud kitchen network across Indonesia, we naturally would have interest from other brands to leverage our networks,” chief executive officer Viktor told TechCrunch. “However, our focus is to grow our brands since our brands are rapidly growing in popularity in Indonesia and require all kitchen resources that they need to realize their full potential.”</p>
<p>Providing food deliveries helped Hangry grow during COVID-19 lockdowns and social distancing, but in order to become a global brand within a decade, it needs to operate in multiple channels, he added.</p>
<p>“We knew that we will one day have to serve customers in all channels, including dine in,” said Viktor. “We started the hard way, doing delivery-first business, where we faced the challenges surrounding making sure our food still tastes good when it reaches customers’ homes. Now we feel ready to serve our customers in our restaurant premises. Our dine-in concept is an expansion of everything we’ve done in delivery channels.”</p>
<p>In a press statement, Alpha JWC Ventures partner Eko Kurniadi said, “In the span of 1.5 years, [Hangry] launched multiple brands across myriad tastes and categories, and almost all of them are amongst the best sellers list with superior ratings in multiple platforms, tangible examples of product-market fit. This is only the beginning and we can already foresee their growth to be a top local F&amp;B brand in the country.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four months after leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/indonesian-robo-advisor-app-bibit-raises-30-million-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/">a $30 million growth round in Bibit</a>, Sequoia Capital India has doubled down on its investment in the Indonesian robo-advisor app. Bibit announced today that the firm led a new $65 million growth round that also included participation from Prosus Ventures, Tencent, Harvard Management Company and returning investors AC Ventures and East Ventures.</p>
<p>This brings Bibit’s total funding to $110 million, including a Series A announced in May 2019. Its latest round will be used on developing and launching new products, hiring and increasing Bibit’s financial education services.</p>

<p>Bibit was launched in 2019 by Stockbit, a stock investing platform and community, and is part of a crop of Indonesian investment apps focused on new investors. Others include SoftBank Ventures-backed Ajaib, Bareksa, Pluang and FUNDtastic. Bibit runs robo-advisor services for mutual funds, investing users’ money based on their risk profiles, and claims that 90% of its users are millennials and first-time investors.</p>
<p>According to Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan), the number of retail investors <a href="https://kr-asia.com/indonesias-millennial-investors-drive-interest-for-new-investment-apps">grew 56% year-over-year in 2020</a>. For mutual funds in particular, Bibit said investors grew 78% year-over-year to 3.2 million, based on data from the Indonesia Stock Exchange and Central Securities Custodian.</p>
<p>Despite the economic impact of COVID-19, interest in stock investing grew as people took advantage of market dips (the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EJKSE/">Jakara Composite Index</a> fell in the first quarter of 2020, but is now recovering steadily). Apps like Bibit and its competitors want to make capital investing more accessible with lower fees and minimum investment amounts than traditional brokerages like Mandiri Sekuritas, which <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/08/27/the-rise-of-the-retail-investor-a-new-force-in-indonesias-pandemic-hit-stock-market.html">also saw an increase</a> in new retail investors and average transaction value last year.</p>

<p>But the <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/02/07/govt-idx-still-hope-to-attract-more-to-invest-in-stock-market.html">percentage of retail investors in Indonesia is still very low</a>, especially compared to markets like Singapore or Malaysia, presenting growth opportunities for investment services.</p>
<p>Apps like Bibit focus on content that helps make capital investing less intimidating to first-time investors. For example, Ajaib also presents its financial educational features as a selling point.</p>
<p>In press statement, Sequoia Capital India vice president Rohit Agarwal said, “Indonesian mutual fund customers have grown almost 10x in the past five years. Savings via mutual funds is the first step towards investing and Bibit has helped millions of consumers start their investing journey in a responsible manner. Sequoia Capital India is excited to double down on the partnership as the company brings the same customer focus to stock investing with Stockbit.”</p>

<p>Clubhouse hosted another excellent conversation between Josh Constine and Facebook&#8217;s audio czar Fidji Simo. The format continues to sparkle, as I was once again forced to choose between MSNBC&#8217;s Rachel Maddow or Lawrence O&#8217;Donnell and just plain audio. JPA won going away. The talk was crisp and the strategies thick with optimism about the creator economy. Monetization, priming the emergent pump, etc. If this were the Gold Rush, it would be blue skies ahead for picks and shovels and pans.</p>
<p>It remains hard to listen to the creator talk. If this is the moment for creators, then what is the moment for us listening? The question is who gets the short end of the crypto stick, a zero sum game where the losers are the equivalent of who buys high and sells low. I guess in the elegant world of startups, being one and not the other nine of ten is worth it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s still damn exciting to see the outcome at a safe distance from ground zero. Once the tech companies run out of slots at the start of the race, there will be plenty of industries waiting for the early smoke to clear. Walmart, table for two? This is not a live audio story but rather a realignment of the media industries around notifications. Let&#8217;s approach the rebuild of the economy and our way of life from the inside out, or backwards in a kind of reverse engineered insight replayed forward like a Beatles guitar solo.</p>
<p>Back before the virus, we thought of life as weekday and weekends, work week or vacation, a series of not-holidays punctuated by long weekends every 6 to 8 weeks or so.We paced ourselves in waves: not liking Mondays to hump days to going to the movies on Friday to watching the political shows on Sunday. Enduring the nightmare that was Trump, sedating us with the binge economy as it surfed the streaming disruption, addicted to our phones and awestruck by the possibilities of the hive mind. Things changed, and then the plague struck.</p>
<p>Now we realized our folly, not in assuming the unassumable but in thinking we had any clue at all of how much time we had to dream about the future. Our belief in technology was still there, but not necessarily how it would work. Saving us was a goal, not a sure thing or even close. We held our breath. And got incredibly lucky. Time inverted itself, and in surviving we found a desperate grace in treasuring our networks of family and friends.</p>
<p>As much as we knew everything was different, we were shocked at how quickly we adapted to the crisis. The rapid deployment of mobile and social technology over the previous couple decades was suddenly ratified, accelerated, and made table stakes. Not surprisingly the tech companies were able to consume the wave; the startup surge was financed by eating its own dog food. Remember Y2K, where it was still not a sure thing there was any real ROI for collaboration, or groupware as it was pigeonholed.</p>
<p>It got a lot harder to say digital collaboration was not realistic. The Cloud made corporate transformation a subscription service going in and pivoting to market fit a viable exit strategy. Startups could scale up without multi-million dollar bets, leaving enterprise incumbents with no choice but to adopt Software As A Service to survive. Consumer laptops, TCPIP, and 2400 baud modems became the platform where continuous innovation found a home, virtualizing the office as a set of familiar services deployed both on desktop and phones.</p>
<p>Notifications became less a source of interruption and more the quickest way to manage the converging streams of work and personal life. These intermittent alerts allowed us to navigate multiple conversations and interactions on an as-needed basis. Collaboration tools orchestrated the abstraction of email with group messaging, video conferencing became a time saver and easy onboarding tool, screen sharing an IT replacement. And all sat on the notification backbone, reducing channel conflict and shifting the social aspects of team engagement to a more personal basis. And then the pandemic happened.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder, the Bowie song asks. Notification etiquette kicks in at daybreak with the overnight roundup, tracks the news throughout while avoiding the repetitive eyeball-baiting of the cable networks, and creates a calendar of things to click on or store for free time or cram for a meeting. No, it&#8217;s not any wonder that audio fits more and more into this work-from-wherever climate shift. Notification chimes differentiate between critical alerts, parkable alerts, and ignorable scroll-offs. Newsletters become havens for binging cached 10 minute reads, managing live audio and recorded podcasts, and a rallying point for influencer analytics. This last one offers value for not just creators but consumers, also known as tippers.</p>
<p>The creator bandwagon sounds promising, but who cares which major platform captures the pole position? I like Clubhouse&#8217;s work in establishing a complementary social cloud via notifications. I like Twitter Spaces as a driver to squeeze a record button into the UI for all, just as Anchor does for podcasting. I like the idea of Facebook sneaking onto the playing field by allowing Instagram to turn off video. Wow, thanks. I love how Josh Constine seems to have landed in just the right place to triangulate his venture casting chops, reportorial finesse, handy summarizing of the calls, and matter-of-fact direct to podcast strategy.</p>
<p>But these early winners in format and style should soon give way to a more constructive dialogue between creators and their listeners. Newsletter platforms seem to have made the case that a few hit writers will pay for developing tools to support subscriptions, distribution, legal services, analytics, and more. I keep wanting to backchannel directly with specific people in the room, but Clubhouse doesn&#8217;t want that to happen natively. We&#8217;re live audio, not chat, they don&#8217;t say but imply. What if listeners could sign up for receiving (and sending) commentary via some form of group @mention. Moderators could tap into that and invite people onstage to engage with speakers. Organic discovery of talent and impact. Sign me up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past five years, the Southeastern region, led by Atlanta, has gone from being &#8220;one of the best kept secrets&#8221; in tech, to a vibrant ecosystem teeming with a herd of the billion dollar tech businesses that are referred to in the investment world as &#8220;unicorns&#8221; (thanks to their supposed rarity).</p>
<p>In those five years venture capital investments surged to $2.1 billion in the region, with $1 billion invested in the last year alone, according to Lisa Calhoun, a partner with the Atlanta based investment firm, <a href="https://valor.vc/">Valor Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s indicative of the entrepreneurial talent coming from the network of private and public schools across the region like Georgia Tech, the University of Alabama, Auburn, the University of Georgia, Vanderbilt, Emory, and the historically black colleges and universities like Morehouse, Spelman, and Xavier. And it&#8217;s also a sign of a reinvestment in local entrepreneurship &#8212; a decades-long campaign to turn Atlanta into the center of a hub-and-spoke network of startup cities that spans Miami to Atlanta, with stops in Birmingham, Nashville, New Orleans,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Atlanta is what a next generation, global, post-Silicon Valley tech hub looks like. Our demographics are ten years ahead of the U.S.&#8217;s transformation into a majority minority society,&#8221; wrote Calhoun in an email. &#8220;With over 40% of the U.S. population in the Southeast, the greatest density of founders and executives of color, rafts of tech companies like AirBnB locating here, and our own legacy of top tech and talent, Atlanta sets the tone for what&#8217;s next. We have the growing, diverse population base all strong founders need to scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done for the region to establish itself as one of the next engines of economic return for the venture capital and investment business, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Southeast is 24% of the US GDP, but only accounts for 7% of the venture investment,&#8221; noted Blake Patton, the founder and general partner of the Atlanta-based investment firm, <a href="https://www.techsquareventures.com/">Tech Square Ventures</a>. &#8220;With the recent momentum in the region, that is changing and investors are taking notice and backing local managers who in turn are investing the region’s best and brightest entrepreneurs.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Internet boom and bust in Atlanta</h2>
<p>In the years after the 1996 Olympics, Atlanta was a high-flying contender for the title of one of the next big startup hubs in the United States.</p>
<p>The Olympics had put the city on the world&#8217;s stage, and seeing the wave of activity, excitement, and investment that came with the advent of internet companies like Virginia&#8217;s America Online, Atlanta&#8217;s city council and mayor were making a push for the city to become a telecom and startup hub in the early days of the first Internet boom.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Something happened in the mid-90s driven by the Olympics where Atlanta hit the map worldwide. It wasn’t just that we were a supply and logistics hub. In the late 90s as the dot-com boom really evolved, things happened underground that aren’t as transparent as they should be. Atlanta Gas Light had the largest dark fiber ring in the country surrounding Atlanta. That was built solely with the olympics in mind. We had Georgia Tech working on the next generation of aerospace, and they added computer engineering,&#8221; said Christy Brown, the founder of the Atlanta based non-profit <a href="https://launchpad2x.org/">Launchpad2X</a> and a serial entrepreneur and executive with deep ties to the Atlanta ecosystem.  </span></p>
<p>Atlanta also had its fair share of early successes &#8212; high flying telecom and networking companies that were critical to the evolution of the first dot com era whose later years were either mired in scandal or who were acquired by much larger entities. These are companies like MCI Worldcom and Airtouch Cellular, which was gobbled up by Singular Wireless and would eventually become part of a restructured AT&amp;T.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There were all kinds of tech things happening in the city. A lot of these founders were getting venture on paper which evolved into the dot-bomb,&#8221; said Brown. &#8220;All of this was happening mid to late nineties, when the dot-bomb happened there was a lot of failure in the Atlanta area.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The implosion of early internet companies that came with the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 reverberated through Atlanta&#8217;s tech ecosystem, erasing the early gains that companies made and setting the stage for a decade-long period of reconstruction punctuated by a few successes from holdouts that managed to make their way through the wreckage.</p>

<h2>Through the lean years</h2>
<p>One of those companies was <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a>. Launched in 2001, in the early aftermath of the bursting of the tech bubble, the privately held email marketing startup was one of a number of projects at Ben Chestnut&#8217;s and Dan Kurzius&#8217; web development firm.</p>
<p>The two men met at Cox Interactive Media to work on an early MP3 product. When that fizzled both men eventually lost their jobs and went into business together. They built MailChimp off of revenue, bootstrapping the business without venture capital in a model that many other tech founders in the area would seek to replicate.</p>
<p>A few years later, in 2003, another entrepreneur named John Marshall began installing internet hotspots at hospitality businesses, eventually expanding his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirWatch">Wandering WiFi</a> service to include monitoring and managing other kinds of network infrastructure. This foray into startup land would eventually create another big Atlanta tech exit in AirWatch.</p>
<p>For the first six years MailChimp remained a side hustle, a product that the two co-founders continued to work on, but didn&#8217;t devote themselves to full time. It wasn&#8217;t until 2007, when the service hit 10,000 users, that the company became the full-time job for both founders.</p>
<p>Their once-scrappy startup turned them into billionaires. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2018/10/08/the-new-atlanta-billionaires-behind-an-unlikely-tech-unicorn/?sh=31a55a7331a2">A 2018 Forbes profile</a> put the company&#8217;s valuation at $4.2 billion on roughly $600 million in revenue.</p>
<p>If there was a starting gun for the Atlanta tech renaissance, it might be 2006, a few years before the global financial crisis and a time when the broader tech industry was finding itself a less financially precarious prospect for investors. Internet Security Systems, an Atlanta area dot-com darling that <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/56921/Security+Stock+IPO+Sizzles+ISS+Group+Jumps+70+Since+Offer.htm">held an initial public offering in the late 90s</a> sold to IBM for $1.3 billion that year.</p>
<p>Tom Noonan and Chris Klaus, the co-founders at Internet Security Systems, had an equally long road. What had started out as a company built when Klaus <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/2208086/life-after-ibm-is-all-green-for-iss-co-founder-tom-noonan.html">lived above Noonan&#8217;s garage in Atlanta in the mid-90s</a>, morphed into a company pulling in $400 million in annual revenue before its acquisition by IBM.</p>
<p>As capital started flowing into Atlanta and the city regained some of its footing in the tech world, founders who had exited their companies began to reinvest money locally. And the city moved to create more events to foster entrepreneurship. 2006 saw the launch of <a href="https://www.ventureatlanta.org/">Venture Atlanta</a>, a conference designed to showcase early talent and startups coming from the region that served as a launchpad for several entrepreneurs that would shape the future of the city&#8217;s technology industry.</p>

<h2>Setting a new scene</h2>
<p>If 2006 was a big year for exits in Atlanta, it also proved to be the year that opened the floodgates on new entrepreneurial activity, which would give rise over the next decade to what&#8217;s now a thriving startup scene, pumping out a record number of billion dollar tech businesses.</p>
<p>It was the year that David Cummings and Adam Blitzer <a href="https://www.salesforceben.com/the-drip/a-brief-history-of-salesforce-marketing-cloud-and-pardot/">founded Pardot</a>, a marketing and sales automation software developer that grew quickly and attracted the attention of big industry players like ExactTarget. It was also the year that Manhattan Associates executive Alan Dabbiere joined Marshall and <a href="http://www.mobilevillage.com/visionaries-airwatch-john-marshall/">Wandering WiFi became AirWatch</a>, a company providing management and security tech for mobile enterprise networks.</p>
<p>Over the next few years MailChimp would become more active; Cloud Sherpas, founded by the entrepreneurs Michael Cohn and Sean O&#8217;Brien (who are now founders of the investment firm <a href="https://overline.vc/">Overline Ventures</a>) would launch and so would companies like the video streaming tech developer, ClearLeap (<a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/clearleap-acquired-by-ibm#:~:text=IBM%20(NYSE%3A%20IBM)%20has,of%20cloud%2Dbased%20video%20services.&amp;text=Prior%20to%20the%20acquisition%2C%20Clearleap,valued%20it%20at%20%24110%20million.">bought by IBM in 2015 and valued at over $110 million</a>); the security company Damballa would launch (<a href="https://www.securityweek.com/damballa-vanishes-fire-sale-core-security">later acquired by Atlanta neighbor Core Security</a>); and the service powering many of the major banks customer rewards programs, <a href="https://www.cardlytics.com/">Cardlytics</a> (now trading on the Nasdaq <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cardlytics+market+cap&amp;rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS896US897&amp;ei=VxxZYNuVLbCb_Qbjj4CYBA&amp;oq=cardlytics+market+cap&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBwgAEEYQ-gE6FAgAELADEIoDELcDENQDEOUCEIsDOgcIABBHELADOgIIADoGCAAQFhAeOgIIJlD8GlicImCaJGgBcAJ4AIABjQGIAfwGkgEDOS4ymAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBArgBAsABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibnefF-8TvAhWwTd8KHeMHAEMQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5">with a $4 billion market cap</a>).</p>
<p>Buoyed by these emerging tech companies, other entrepreneurs would join the fray, with Kabbage (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/amex-acquires-softbank-backed-kabbage-after-tough-2020-for-the-smb-lender/#:~:text=Amex%20acquires%20SoftBank%2Dbacked%20Kabbage%20after%20tough%202020%20for%20the%20SMB%20lender,-Ingrid%20Lunden%40ingridlunden&amp;text=For%20some%20context%2C%20Kabbage%20had,in%202017%2C%20led%20by%20SoftBank.">acquired for $850 million</a>), <a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">a $3 billion business as of this year</a>) and the voice identification technology developer <a href="https://www.pindrop.com/">Pindrop</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/pindrop-raises-90m-to-bring-its-voice-fraud-prevention-to-iot-devices-and-europe/">which raised $90 million back in 2018</a>) emerging onto the scene at around the same time.</p>
<p>These companies set the table for what would become a buffet of startups focused primarily on payments and financial services, cloud-based business solutions, and internet security. Gone were the hardware heavy telecom companies and networking companies like Scientific Atlanta, whose business is compared to Hewlett Packard for having brought a high tech industry to the city in the 1950s &#8212; much like HP did in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new generation of investor was moving into the Atlanta orbit, presaged by the 2006 launch of <a href="https://www.bip-capital.com/">BIP Capital</a> &#8212; an event that also proved meaningful for the city&#8217;s budding entrepreneurs.</p>

<h2>Staking claims for Atlanta&#8217;s future</h2>
<p>The rising tide of entrepreneurs coming out of Atlanta also served to revitalize the city&#8217;s moribund investment community. Hit hard by the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the Atlanta-area firms that managed to survive the crash began to look to later stage businesses and outside of the Atlanta tech ecosystem for startups to back, according to data from CrunchBase and several interviews with investors and founders.</p>
<p><a href="https://noromoseley.com/">Noro-Moseley Partners</a>, for instance, is by far the most active investor hailing from Atlanta. Over it&#8217;s long history the firm has done over 123 deals according to Crunchbase, but in the last five years, data indicates only four investment from the firm were made into Atlanta-based companies.</p>
<p>By contrast, the arrivistes at BIP have been deploying capital and raising successively larger funds since they first came to town. Over the last five years the firm has invested in at least 15 Atlanta-area deals, and now, under the moniker of <a href="https://panoramic.vc/">Panoramic Ventures</a>, the firm is targeting a $300 million early stage fund to invest across the southeast and midwest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditionally, access to capital was challenging for founders in Atlanta and the Southeast. In the past, it was considered a disadvantage for a tech business to be based outside of the traditional innovation hubs [in] Silicon Valley or the Northeast because it was more difficult to secure investment capital. This was because the large funds were located inside the hubs and had plenty of opportunities right on their doorsteps for investment,&#8221; wrote Mark Buffington, the co-founder and chief executive of BIP Capital, in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;While the traditional hubs are still key in terms of aggregate capital, the requirement for startups to also be inside the hubs has changed. Increasingly, venture funds are locating themselves in other areas of the country where innovation is occurring. At the same time, the amount of capital available from local and regional investors is growing, in large part due to the influx of dollars into the private markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another member of the new school of investors that&#8217;s changing Atlanta&#8217;s investment scene is Patton; whose work with <a href="https://www.techsquareventures.com/">Tech Square Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.engage.vc/">Engage</a>, the corporate venture capital investment firm and startup initiative harnessing the power of a number of the biggest companies in Atlanta, also galvanized entrepreneurship and the newfound interest in startup tech companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recent momentum in the region is driven by increased connectivity across the innovation ecosystem and a critical mass of entrepreneurs and talent coming out of the region&#8217;s many successful startups. With corporations focused on digital transformation and innovation, all large companies have to a degree become tech companies and that drives connectivity as talent moves across both startups and tech companies,&#8221; Patton said. &#8220;Perhaps our greatest strength is our diversity and being home to four leading HBCUs, and I hope in the next 5 years the Southeast will emerge as a leader in producing successful startups founded by diverse entrepreneurs and built with diverse teams. It’s not just a moral imperative &#8211; with half the nation’s black population, the Southeast must succeed in engaging under-served entrepreneurs to lead – and you can’t tackle diversity nationally without tackling it in the Southeast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, other ingredients were needed for the resurgence of startup activity in the city. These would be co-workings spaces like David Cummings&#8217; launch of the <a href="https://atlantatechvillage.com/">Atlanta Tech Village</a> in 2012; the continuing relevance of the<a href="https://atdc.org/"> Atlanta Tech Development Center</a>; the Venture Atlanta conference and the co-working space around <a href="https://hypepotamus.com/">Hypepotamus</a> &#8212; which remains the go-to publication for Southern startup activity.</p>
<p>Every entrepreneur and investor mentioned Cummings&#8217; decision to reinvest in the city and launch the Tech Village near Atlanta&#8217;s tony suburb of Buckhead as one of the biggest sparks for the city&#8217;s renewed entrepreneurial fervor. Soon after Cummings sold Pardot he and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidlightburn/">David Lightburn</a> established Atlanta Tech Village as a co-working spot for entrepreneurs. It attracted a number of new startup founders whose businesses would become the next wave of big startups. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">When David Cummings sold Pardot he wanted a place for entrepreneurs to have community,&#8221; said one longtime player in the Atlanta tech community. &#8220;They would do these startup chow down lunches and really support entrepreneurs building businesses.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>And just as key was the longtime hub for Georgia Tech-affiliated startups, the Atlanta Tech Development Center, the entrepreneurs and investors noted. Venture Atlanta had a role to play as well, bringing investors from every corner of the country to the city to showcase top talent. Together with <a href="https://create-x.gatech.edu/">CreateX</a>, and the Venture Atlanta program, the four initiatives and workspaces for early stage entrepreneurs planted a number of seeds that would soon blossom into companies like PartPic, Greenlight (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kids-focused-fintech-greenlight-raises-260m-in-a16z-led-series-d-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-2-3b/">which is now worth $2.3 billion</a>), Kabbage, FullStory and Pindrop.</p>

<h2>A haven for diverse founders and investors</h2>
<p>During those early days of the Atlanta startup ecosystem, there was one spot more welcoming than most for diverse and women-led founders &#8212; the co-working space and offices for Hypepotamus.</p>
<p>Serial entrepreneur Monique Mills was there. So was Jewel Burks Solomon, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/21/how-jewel-burks-solomon-sold-business-to-amazon-and-became-google-exec.html#:~:text=In%20October%2C%202016%2C%20when%20Burks,technology%20became%20as%20Amazon%20PartFinder).">who sold her company, PartPic, to Amazon in 2016</a> and is now the Head of Google for Startups in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;My first office was at Hypepotamus because they offered free space,&#8221; Burks Solomon recalled. &#8220;And at the time I didn’t have much money. Then when I raised some money the next major one was at ATDC &#8212; the state of Georgia’s incubator. They offered subsidized space and they had an entrepreneur in residence and they had a whole program to help Atlanta-based startups with some kind of technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the Hypepotamus space, and subsequent venues like Opportunity Hub and The Gathering Spot that catalyzed the Black entrepreneurial community in Atlanta, according to several founders and investors.</p>
<p>And if the Hypepotamus space, carved out by National Builder Supply, was one of the catalysts, then the angel investor, Mike Ross, was the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike has funded many successful Black-led startups in the Atlanta ecosystem and we wouldn’t be where we are today without him,&#8221; entrepreneur Candace Mitchell Harris <a href="https://urbangeekz.com/2021/02/meet-the-investor-behind-atlantas-most-successful-black-led-tech-startups/">told UrbanGeekz</a> in a recent profile. &#8220;When many have faced the run around of false promises or flat out rejections, Mike confidently put his money in and pushed our founders further.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross, a <a href="https://www.morehouse.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morehouse College alumnus</a>, who made his wealth as a consultant in the construction and contracting industry has backed Black founders and investors including: Luma, Partpic, Monsieur, <a href="https://urbangeekz.com/2020/09/the-first-ever-hbcu-esports-league-kicks-off-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axis Replay</a>, <a href="https://www.myavana.com/">Myavana</a>, <a href="https://urbangeekz.com/2019/04/atlanta-startup-battle-6-0-crowns-two-winners-for-six-figure-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechSquare Labs</a>, <a href="https://urbangeekz.com/2015/02/business-incubator-targets-minority-owned-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Opportunity Hub</a>, and <a href="https://urbangeekz.com/2019/08/atlantas-black-tech-startup-ecosystem-is-gaining-momentum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Gathering Spot</a>.</p>
<p>Investors like Paul Judge and entrepreneurs like Joey Womack, Barry Givens, and Mitchell Harris, all benefited from Ross&#8217; investment largesse.</p>
<p>“Mike was the catalyst for our company’s success as our very first angel investor,” says Mitchell Harris, co-founder and CEO of beauty tech startup Myavana,<a href="https://urbangeekz.com/2021/02/meet-the-investor-behind-atlantas-most-successful-black-led-tech-startups/"> told UrbanGeekz</a>. “I still remember meeting him for the first time at the Black Founders Conference in June 2012, inquisitive and eager to get behind the movement that was beginning in Atlanta in the tech startup scene.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Ross blazed a trail for other investors like the <a href="https://www.fearless.fund/team">Fearless Fund</a>, a group of women investors led by Arian Simone, Ayanna Parsons, and Keshia Knight Pulliam, who launched their first fund in 2019, and Collab Capital, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/collab-capital-launches-with-a-50-million-target-and-a-mission-to-help-black-entrepreneurs/">which launched last year</a> (and is led by Burks Solomon, Justin Dawkins, and Barry Givens) &#8212; close to a decade after Ross first began investing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right now women of color are the most founded but the least funded entrepreneurs,&#8221; Simone said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlanta is a mecca of black entrepreneurship for us to have a venture capital and tech presence here.. I will charge the city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia and the banks that they need to back what we’re doing here.. It is needed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Not only is it needed, but it&#8217;s working. Of the 36 venture capital firms identified as part of TechCrunch&#8217;s research as having a focus on early stage investments in the Atlanta area, 41% met one or more of the following criteria: identification as having a diversity focus across investments, identification as having a diverse fund management team, or both, according to data from Crunchbase.</p>
<p>And through a sample size of 158 startups spanning Pre-Seed, Seed, or Series A in the Atlanta area, which were included in TechCrunch&#8217;s research, 48% met one or more of the following criteria: identification as having a sex-diverse founding team, identification has having a racially-diverse founding team, or both. In many instances, founding teams did not self identify, so the number of diverse founders may be greater than currently documented based on publicly available data.</p>
<p>As UrbanGeekz noted, about 25% of the employees in Atlanta&#8217;s tech industry are black. In San Francisco, by contrast, that figure is 6%.</p>
<div class="freebirdFormviewerViewSubmissionDate">
<p>&#8220;Ten years ago [the Black tech startup ecosystem] was just starting out,&#8221; Ross told UrbanGeekz. &#8220;Now Atlanta is one of the top tech hubs in the country and the ecosystem is probably one of the most diverse.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="freebirdFormviewerViewSubmissionDate">
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>&#8220;I’m really excited about what’s happening now. It’s much more diverse in terms of the people that have the ability to deploy capital. I’m optimistic about what is to come in the tech space,&#8221; said Burks Solomon.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s not alone. New firms like Cohn and O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s Overline Ventures, Panoramic, and <a href="https://www.outlanderlabs.com/">Outlander Labs</a>, the firm launched by the former Los Angeles investors Paige and Leura Craig are all signs of investors&#8217; long-term belief in the health of the Atlanta startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that the Southeast and especially Atlanta has the opportunity to become a key hub for tech startups in the next 5 years. It feels a lot like Los Angeles five years ago. The talent is here but historically the issue has been lack of mentorship, early stage capital, and the later stage capital as they grow and scale,&#8221; wrote Outlander co-founder Leura Craig, in an email. &#8220;However that is all changing given the fact that so many investors are now moving to all parts of the country and are open to investing in areas that they never invested in before. Covid dramatically accelerated the flight from California and New York and the Southeast&#8217;s tech scene is going to be a huge winner as a result of this migration. &#8221;</p>
<p>Major tech companies are also showing their faith in Atlanta&#8217;s startup scene through significant investments into the ecosystem. Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/apple-announces-new-projects-related-to-its-100-million-pledge-for-racial-equity-and-justice/">Apple has committed nearly $100 million to new projects including the Propel Center,</a> a $25 million bid designed to encourage diversity and entrepreneurship at a site to be built near Atlanta&#8217;s Historically Black Colleges and Universities.</p>
<p>It is going to be both a virtual platform and a physical campus in the Atlanta University Center.</p>
<p>Students will be able to follow different educational tracks focused on artificial intelligence, agricultural technologies, social justice, entertainment, app development, augmented reality, design and creative arts and entrepreneurship. This isn’t just a monetary investment for Apple, as employees will help develop curricula and provide mentorship as well. There will be internship opportunities for students.</p>

<p>Apple isn&#8217;t the only big tech company to commit to Atlanta&#8217;s thriving tech community. Facebook is building out a massive, multi-billion dollar extension to data center facilities near the city, and Google committed that the Atlanta area would receive some fo the planned $9 billion investment in job growth across the U.S.</p>
<p>The current growth that Atlanta&#8217;s startup scene is experiencing can serve as a model for other urban areas on the rise. The recipe seems to be a strong technical college, an investment in collaborative startup resources, a network of willing investors to <em>reinvest</em> in the local community, the support of city government through non-profit and promotional activities, and finally an embrace of the diverse history of the city itself. There&#8217;s no need to remake Silicon Valley, but the tools of Silicon Valley can be used to make burgeoning tech communities better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve been hearing how “data is the new oil” <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-should-get-credit-for-the-quote-data-is-the-new-oil">for more than a decade now</a>, and in certain sectors, it’s a maxim that has more than panned out. From marketing and logistics to finance and product, decision-making is now dominated by data at all levels of most big private orgs (and if it isn’t, I’d be getting a résumé put together, stat).</p>
<p>So it might be a something of a surprise to learn that data, which could transform how we respond to the increasingly deadly disasters that regularly plague us, has been all but absent from much of emergency response this past decade. Far from being a geyser of digital oil, disaster response agencies and private organizations alike have for years tried to swell the scope and scale of the data being inputted into disaster response, with relatively meager results.</p>
<p>That’s starting to change though, mostly thanks to the internet of things (IoT), and frontline crisis managers today increasingly have the data they need to make better decisions across the resilience, response, and recovery cycle. The best is yet to come — with drones flying up, simulated visualizations, and artificial intelligence-induced disasters — what we’re seeing today on the frontlines is only the beginning of what could be a revolution in disaster response in the 2020s.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2 id="The long-awaited disaster data deluge has finally arrived">The long-awaited disaster data deluge has finally arrived</h2>
<p>Emergency response is a fight against the fog of war and the dreadful ticking of the clock. In the midst of a wildfire or hurricane, everything can change in a matter of seconds — even milliseconds if you aren’t paying attention. Safe roads ferrying evacuees can suddenly become impassable infernos, evacuation teams can reposition and find themselves spread far too thin, and unforeseen conditions can rapidly metastasize to cover the entire operating environment. An operations center that once had perfect information can quickly find it has no ground truth at all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even getting raw data on what’s happening before and during a disaster can be extraordinarily difficult. When we look at the data revolution in business, part of the early success stems from the fact that companies were always heavily reliant on data to handle their activities. Digitalization was and is the key word: moving from paper to computers in order to transform latent raw data into a form that was machine-readable and therefore analyzable. In business, the last ten years was basically upgrading to version two from version one.</p>
<p>In emergency management however, many agencies are stuck without a version at all. Take a flood — where is the water and where is it going? Up until recently, there was no comprehensive data on where waters rose from and where they sloshed to. When it came to wildfires, there were no administrative datasets on where every tree in the world was located and how prone each is to fire. Even human infrastructure like power lines and cell towers often had little interface with the digital world. They stood there, and if you couldn’t see them, they couldn’t see you.</p>

<p>Models, simulations, predictions, analysis: all of these are useless without raw data, and in the disaster response realm, there was no detailed data to be found.</p>
<p>After years of promising an Internet of Things (IoT) revolution, things are finally internet-izing, with IoT sensors increasingly larding up the American and world landscape. Temperature, atmospheric pressure, water levels, humidity, pollution, power, and other sensors have been widely deployed, emitting constant streams of data back into data warehouses ready for analysis.</p>
<p>Take wildfires in the American West. It wasn’t all that long ago that the U.S. federal government and state firefighting agencies had no knowledge of where a blaze was taking place. Firefighting has been “100 years of tradition unimpeded by progress,” Tom Harbour, head of fire response for a decade at the U.S. Forest Service and now chief fire officer at <a href="https://cornea.is">Cornea</a> put it.</p>
<p>And he’s right. After all, firefighting is a visceral activity — responders can see the fires, even feel the burning heat echoing off of their flesh. Data wasn’t useful, particularly in the West where there are millions of acres of land and large swaths are sparsely populated. Massive conflagrations could be detected by satellites, but smoldering fires in the brush would be entirely invisible to the geospatial authorities. There’s smoke over California — exactly what is a firefighter on the ground supposed to do with such valuable information?</p>
<p>Today after a decade of speculative promise, IoT sensors are starting to clear a huge part of this fog. Aaron Clark-Ginsberg, a social scientist at <a href="https://www.rand.org">RAND Corporation</a> who researches community resilience, said that air quality sensors have become ubiquitous since they are “very cheap [and] pretty easy to use” and can offer very fine-grained understandings of pollution — a key signal, for instance, of wildfires. He pointed to the company <a href="https://www2.purpleair.com">Purple Air</a>, which in addition to making sensors, also produces a popular consumer map of air quality, as indicative of the potential these days for technology.</p>
<p>Maps are the critical intersection for data in disasters. Geospatial information systems (GIS) form the basis for most planning and response teams, and no company has a larger footprint in the sector than privately-held <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/home">Esri</a>. Ryan Lanclos, who leads public safety solutions at the company, pointed to the huge expansion of water sensors as radically changing responses to certain disasters. “Flood sensors are always pulsing,“ he said, and with a “national water model coming out of the federal government ,” researchers can now predict through GIS analysis how a flood will affect different communities with a precision unheard of previously.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146560" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146560" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146560" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="428" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=768,483 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=1536,967 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=2048,1289 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146560" class="wp-caption-text">Digital maps and GIS systems are increasingly vital for disaster planning and response, but paper still remains quite ubiquitous.

<p>Cory Davis, the director of public safety strategy and crisis response at Verizon (which, through our parent company Verizon Media, is TechCrunch’s ultimate owner), said that all of these sensors have transformed how crews work to maintain infrastructure as well. “Think like a utility that is able to put a sensor on a power line — now they have sensors and get out there quicker, resolve it, and get the power back up.”</p>
<p>He noted one major development that has transformed sensors in this space the last few years: battery life. Thanks to continuous improvements in ultra-low-power wireless chips as well as better batteries and energy management systems, sensors can last a <i>really</i> long time in the wilderness without the need for maintenance. “Now we have devices that have ten-year battery lives,” he said. That’s critical, because it can be impossible to connect these sensors to the power grid in frontier areas.</p>
<p>The same line of thinking holds true at T-Mobile as well. When it comes to preventative planning, Jay Naillon, senior director of national technology service operations strategy at the telco, said that “the type of data that is becoming more and more valuable for us is the storm surge data — it can make it easier to know we have the right assets in place.” That data comes from flood sensors that can offer real-time warnings signals to planners across the country.</p>
<p>Telecom interest — and commercial interest in general — has been critical to accelerating the adoption of sensors and other data streams around disasters. While governments may be the logical end user of flood or wildfire data, they aren’t the only ones interested in this visibility. “A lot of consumers of that information are in the private sector,” said Jonathan Sury, project director at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at the Earth Institute at Columbia University. “These new types of risks, like climate change, are going to affect their bottom lines,” and he pointed to bond ratings, insurance underwriting and other areas where commercial interest in sensor data has been profound.</p>
<p>Sensors may not literally be ubiquitous, but they have offered a window into the ambiguity that emergency managers have never had visibility into before.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the extensive datasets around mobile usage that have become ubiquitous throughout much of the world. <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com">Facebook’s Data for Good project</a>, for instance, provides data layers around connectivity — are users connecting from one place and then later connecting from a different location, indicating displacement? That sort of data from the company and telcos themselves can help emergency planners scout out how populations are shifting in real-time.</p>
<h2 id="Data, data, on the wall — how many AIs can they call?">Data, data, on the wall — how many AIs can they call?</h2>
<p>Rivulets of data have now turned into floods of information, but just like floodwaters rising in cities across the world, the data deluge now needs a response all its own. In business, the surfeit of big data has been wrangled with an IT stack from data warehouses all the way to business intelligence tools.</p>
<p>If only data for disasters could be processed so easily. Data relevant for disasters is held by dozens of different organizations spanning the private, public, and non-profit sectors, leading to huge interoperability problems. Even when the data can be harmonized, there are large challenges in summarizing the findings down to an actual decision a frontline responder can use in their work — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">making AI a tough sale still today</a>, particularly outside of planning. As Davis of Verizon put it, “now that they have this plethora of data, a lot of cities and federal agencies are struggling with how to use it.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, standardization is a challenge at all scales. Globally, countries mostly lack interoperability, although standards are improving over time. Amir Elichai, the founder and CEO of 911 call-handling platform <a href="https://carbyne911.com">Carbyne</a>, said that “from a technology standpoint and a standards standpoint, there is a big difference between countries,” noting that protocols from one country often have to be completely rewritten to serve a different market.</p>
<p>Tom Cotter, director of emergency response and preparedness at health care disaster response organization <a href="https://www.projecthope.org">Project HOPE</a>, said that even setting up communications between responders can be challenging in an international environment. “Some countries allow certain platforms but not others, and it is constantly changing,” he said. “I basically have every single technology communication platform you can possibly have in one place.”</p>
<p>One senior federal emergency management official acknowledged that data portability has become increasingly key in procurement contracts for technology, with the government recognizing the need to buy commercially-available software rather than custom-designed software. That message has been picked up by companies like Esri, with Lanclos stating that “part of our core mission is to be open and … create data and to share that openly to the public or securely through open standards.”</p>
<p>For all its downsides though, the lack of interoperability can be ironically helpful for innovation. Elichai said that the “lack of standards is an advantage — you are not buying into a legacy standard,” and in some contexts where standards are lacking, quality protocols can be built with the assumption of a modern data workflow.</p>
<p>Even with interoperability though, the next challenge becomes data sanitation — and disaster data is dirty as … well, something. While sensor streams can be verified and cross-checked with other datasets, in recent years there has been a heavy increase in the quantity of citizen-submitted information that has to be carefully vetted before it is disseminated to first responders or the public.</p>

Image Credits: TONY KARUMBA/AFP via Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Bailey Farren, CEO and co-founder of disaster communications platform <a href="https://perimeterplatform.com">Perimeter</a>, said that “sometimes citizens have the most accurate and real-time information, before first responders show up — we want citizens to share that with …government officials.” The challenge is how to filter the quality goods from the unhelpful or malicious. Raj Kamachee, the CIO of <a href="https://teamrubiconusa.org">Team Rubicon</a>, a non-profit which assembles teams of volunteer military veterans to respond to natural disasters, said that verification is critical, and it’s a key element of the infrastructure he has built at the organization since joining in 2017. “We’ve gotten more people using it so more feedback [and] more data [is] coming through the pipes,” he said. “So creating a self-service, a very collaborative approach.”</p>
<p>With quality and quantity, the AI models should come, right? Well, yes and no.</p>
<p>Sury of Columbia wants to cool down at least some of the hype around AI. “The big caveat with all of these machine learning and big data applications is that they are not a panacea — they are able to process a lot of disparate information, [but] they’re certainly not going to tell us exactly what to do,” he said. “First responders are already processing a lot of information,” and they don’t necessarily need more guidance.</p>
<p>Instead, AI in disasters is increasingly focused on planning and resilience. Sury pointed to <a href="https://oneconcern.com/en/">OneConcern</a>, a resiliency planning platform, as one example of how data and AI can be combined in the disaster planning process. He also pointed to the CDC’s <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html">Social Vulnerability Index</a> and risk tools from FEMA that integrate different data signals into scalar values by emergency planners to optimize their contingency plans.</p>
<p>Yet, almost everyone I talked to was much more hesitant about the power of AI. As I discussed a bit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">in part one of this series regarding the disaster sales cycle</a>, data tools have to be real-time and perfect every time given the lives that are on the line. Kamachee of Team Rubicon noted that when choosing tools, he avoids whiz-bang and instead looks at the pure utility of individual vendors. “We go high tech, but we prepare for low tech,” he said, empathizing that in disaster response, everything must be agile and adaptable to changing circumstances.</p>

<p>Elichai of Carbyne saw this pattern in his sales. There’s a “sensitivity in our market and the reluctance from time to time to adopt” new technologies he said, but acknowledged that “there is no doubt that AI at a certain point will provide benefits.”</p>
<p>Naillon of T-Mobile had similar views from the operator perspective, saying that “I can’t say that we really leverage AI very much” in the company’s disaster planning. Instead of AI as brain, the telecom company simply uses data and forecast modeling to optimally position equipment — no fancy GANs required.</p>
<p>Outside of planning, AI has helped in post-disaster recovery, and specifically around damage assessments. After a crisis transpires, assessments of infrastructure and private property have to be made in order for insurance claims to be filed and for a community to move forward. Art delaCruz, COO and president of Team Rubicon, noted that technology and a flourish of AI has helped significantly around damage assessments. Since his organization often helps rebuild communities in the course of its work, triaging damage is a critical element of its effective response strategy.</p>
<h2 id="There’s a brighter future, other than that brightness from the sun that is going to burn us to a crisp, right?">There’s a brighter future, other than that brightness from the sun that is going to burn us to a crisp, right?</h2>
<p>So AI today is helping a bit with resilience planning and disaster recovery and not so much during emergency response itself, but there is certainly more to come across the entire cycle. Indeed, there is a lot of excitement about the future of drones, which are increasingly being used in the field, but there are concerns long term about whether AI and data will ultimately cause more problems than they solve.</p>
<p>Drones would seem to have an obvious value for disaster response, and indeed, they have been used by teams to get additional aerial footage and context where direct access by responders is limited. Kamachee of Team Rubicon noted that in the Bahamas on a mission, response teams used drones to detect survivors, since major roads were blocked. The drones snapped images that were processed using AI, and helped the team to identify those survivors for evacuation. He described drones and their potential as “sexy; very, very cool.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146562" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146562" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146562" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg 5517w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=1536,1011 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=2048,1348 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146562" class="wp-caption-text">Aerial views from drones can give disaster response teams much better real-time information, particularly in areas where on-the-ground access is limited.

<p>Cotter of Project HOPE similarly noted that faster data processing translates to better responses. “Ultimately speed is what saves lives in these disasters,” he said. We’re “also able to manage more responses remotely [and] don’t have to send as many people downrange,” giving response teams more leverage in resource-constrained environments.</p>
<p>“I see more emergency management agencies using drone technology — search and rescue, aerial photography,” Davis of Verizon said, arguing that operators often have a mentality of “send a machine into a situation first.” He continued, arguing, &#8220;artificial intelligence is going to continue to get better and better and better [and] enable our first responders to respond more effectively, but also more efficiently and safer.”</p>
<p>With data flooding in from sensors and drones and processed and verified better than ever, disaster response can improve, perhaps even better than Mother Nature can galvanize her increasingly deadly whims. Yet, there is one caveat: will the AI algorithms themselves cause new problems in the future?</p>
<p>Clark-Ginsburg of RAND, perhaps supplying that typical RANDian alternatives analysis, said that these solutions can also create problems themselves, “technological risks leading to disaster and the world of technology facilitating disaster.” These systems can break, they can make mistakes, and more ominously — they can be sabotaged to increase chaos and damage.</p>
<p>Bob Kerrey, a co-chair of the 9/11 Commission, former senator and governor of Nebraska, and currently the board chairman of Risk &amp; Return, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/risk-and-return/">a disaster response VC fund and philanthropy I profiled recently</a>, pointed to cybersecurity as increasingly a wild card in many responses. “There wasn’t a concept called zero days — let alone a market for zero days — in 2004 [when the 9/11 Commission was doing its work], and now there is.” With the 9/11 terrorist attacks, “they had to come here, they had to hijack planes … now you don’t need to hijack planes to damage the United States,” noting that hackers “can be sitting with a bunch of other guys in Moscow, in Tehran, in China, or even your mother’s basement.”</p>
<p>Data is a revolution in the making for disaster response, but it may well cause a whole second-order set of problems that didn’t exist before. What is giveth is taketh away. The oil gushes, but then the well suddenly runs dry – or simply catches fire.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week, we welcome guest Hana Mohan to our podcast Found. Hana is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://MagicBell.com">MagicBell</a>, a new startup she created with Josue Montano that just recently graduated from Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter 2021 cohort. MagicBell is a full-featured, plug-and-play notifications inbox aimed at developers who want to build one into their own product, but don&#8217;t want to have to build one themselves from scratch.</p>
<p>Hana&#8217;s experience as an entrepreneur spans multiple companies, including her last one which she grew to significant success in terms of annual revenue. She&#8217;s also a proud transgender woman, who underwent her transition mid-way through her existing history as a founder and entrepreneur. Hana talks to us about the challenges she faced taking on her transition in an industry where the focus is often exclusively on how hard you&#8217;re hustling and what you&#8217;re building next, and about her origin story as a founder coming from an environment where there weren&#8217;t necessarily many examples with similar life experience to look to for inspiration.</p>
<p>During our chat, Hana also shared lots of insight into YC, and what it provides founders, as well as perspective on what it was like going through the program during a global pandemic in a remote context. Finally, she offers some great context on finding your first investors and customers as a distributed team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We loved talking to Hana, and we hope you love the episode. You can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. If you want it in your inbox every Saturday morning, sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. </em><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch isn’t a public-market-focused publication. We care about startups. But public tech companies can, at times, provide interesting insights into how the broader technology market is performing. So we pay what we might call minimum-viable attention to former startups that made it all the way to an IPO.</p>
<p>Then there are the Big Tech companies. In the United States the list is well-known: Facebook, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon. And, in a series of results that could indicate a hot market for startup growth, they had a smashingly good first quarter of 2021. You can read our notes on their results <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/alphabet-microsoft-pinterest-q1/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/todays-big-tech-earnings-in-a-mere-700-words/">here</a>, but that’s just part of the story.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yes, the Big Tech financial results were good &#8212; as they have been for some time &#8212; but lost amid the usual earnings deluge of numbers is how shockingly accretive Big Tech’s recent performances have proven for their valuations.</p>
<p>Microsoft fell as low as the $135 per-share range last March. Today it’s worth $252 and change. Alphabet traded down to around $1,070 per share. Today the search giant is worth $2,410 per share.</p>
<p>The result of the huge share-price appreciation is that Apple is now worth $2.21 trillion, Microsoft $1.88 trillion, Amazon $1.76 trillion, Alphabet $1.60 trillion and Facebook $0.93 trillion. That’s around $8.4 trillion for the five companies.</p>
<p>Back in July of 2017, I <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/techs-5-biggest-players-now-worth-3-trillion/">wrote a piece</a> noting that their aggregate value had reached the $3 trillion mark. That became <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/the-big-5-worth-4-trillion-heading-into-earnings/">$4 trillion in mid-2018</a>. And then in the next three years or so it more than doubled again.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MylesUdland">Myles Udland</a>, a reporter at our sister publication Yahoo Finance, has at least part of the puzzle in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-are-beating-expectations-at-a-record-rate-morning-brief-100229838.html">a piece he wrote this week</a>. Here’s Udland:</p>
<blockquote><p>And while it seems that almost every earnings story has sort of followed this same arc, data also confirms that this is not just our imagination: corporate earnings have never been this far out of line with expectations.</p>
<p>Data out of the team at Refinitiv published Thursday showed the rate at which companies were beating estimates and the magnitude by which they were beating expectations through Thursday morning&#8217;s results were the best on record.</p></blockquote>
<p>So earnings are beating the street’s guesses more frequently, and at a higher differential, than ever? That makes recent stock-market appreciation less worrisome, I suppose. And it helps explain why startups have been able to raise so much capital lately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/inside-the-us-epic-first-quarter-venture-capital-results/">in the United States</a>, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/european-vc-soars-in-q1/">they have in Europe</a>, and why private-market investors are pouring so much capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/fintech-startups-set-vc-records-as-the-2021-fundraising-market-continues-to-impress/">into fintech startups</a>. And it’s probably why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/zomato-juice-indian-unicorns-proposed-ipo-could-drive-regional-startup-liquidity/">Zomato is going public</a> and why we’re <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/optimism-reigns-at-consumer-trading-services-as-fintech-vc-spikes-and-robinhood-ipo-looms/">still waiting for the Robinhood debut</a>.</p>
<p>This is what a market feels like when the underlying businesses are firing on all cylinders, it appears. Just don’t forget that no business cycle is unending, and no boom is forever.</p>
<h2>An insurtech interlude</h2>
<p>Extending The Exchange’s recent reporting regarding fintech funding, and our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money/">roundup from last week of insurtech startup rounds</a>, a few more notes on the latter startup niche, which can be broadly viewed as part of the larger financial technology world.</p>
<p>This time we’ll hear from <a href="https://accel.com/people/john-locke">Accel’s John Locke</a> regarding his investments in The Zebra &#8212; which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/austins-newest-unicorn-insurtech-the-zebra-raises-150m-after-doubling-revenue-in-2020/">raised even more capital</a> &#8212; and the insurtech space more broadly.</p>
<p>Asked why insurtech marketplaces like The Zebra have been able to raise so very much money in the last year, Locke said that it’s a mix of “insurance carriers [&#8230;] finally embracing marketplaces and willing to design integrated consumer experiences with marketplaces,” along with more consumer “comparison shopping” and, finally, growth and revenue quality.</p>
<p>The Zebra, Locke said, is “still growing north of 100% at ~$120M+ revenue run-rate.” That means it can go public whenever it wants.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Insurtech startups are leveraging rapid growth to raise big money&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money/embed/#?secret=6Ig0DxvFvM" data-secret="6Ig0DxvFvM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But on that matter, there has been some weakness in the stock market for some public insurtech companies. Is Locke worried about that? He’s neutral-to-positive, saying that his firm does not “think all the companies in the market will work but still thinks &#8216;insurtechs&#8217; will take market share from incumbents over the next decade.” Fair enough.</p>
<p>And Accel is still considering more deals in the space, as are others. Locke said that the venture market for insurtech investments is “definitely more aggressive” this year than last.</p>
<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p>Closing today, a few notes on things that we didn’t get to that matter:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.productboard.com/">Productboard</a> closed a $72 million Series C. First, that’s a huge round. Second, yes, Tiger did lead the deal. Third, the product management software company has around 4,000 customers today. That’s a lot. Add this company to your two-years-from-now IPO list.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Chinese bike-sharing startup Hello is going public in the United States. We are going to get back to this on Monday, but its F-1 filing is <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841944/000104746921001022/a2243152zf-1.htm">here</a>. The company turned $926.3 million worth of 2020 revenues into $109.6 million in gross profit, and a net loss of $173.7 million in net losses. Yowza.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.darktrace.com/en/">Darktrace</a> went public this week. I know of it because it sponsors <a href="https://www.darktrace.com/en/mclaren/">an F1 team that I adore</a>, but it enters our world today as a recent U.K.-listed company. And after Deliveroo went kersplat, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/darktrace-ipo-dark-stock-skyrockets-43percent-in-london-debut.html">resounding success</a> of the Darktrace listing could make the U.K. a more attractive place to list than it was a week ago.</li>
<li aria-level="1">And, finally, drone delivery is, maybe, coming at last? U.K.-listed venture capital group Draper Esprit led the $25 million round into <a href="https://www.manna.aero/">Manna</a>, which wants to use unmanned drones in Ireland to deliver grub. “Manna sees a huge appetite for a greener, quieter, safer, and faster delivery service,” <a href="https://www.uktech.news/news/london-vc-draper-esprit-invests-in-manna-20210429">UKTN reports</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A long, weird week. Make sure to follow the second denizen of The Exchange’s writing team: <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca?lang=en">Anna Heim</a>. Okay! Chat next week!</p>
