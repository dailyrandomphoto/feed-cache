										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Powerpoint may still dominate the landscape for presentations in many people&#8217;s minds, but some might say that legacy status also makes Microsoft&#8217;s software ripe for disruption. Now, a startup out of Berlin called <a href="https://pitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pitch</a> has just picked up a substantial Series B of $85 million to take it on with what it believes is a more dynamic approach.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Lakestar and Tiger Global, with previous backers Index Ventures and Thrive Capital also participating. We understand from sources close to the company that the valuation is now at $600 million for the Berlin-based startup.</p>
<p>In the words of CEO and co-founder Christian Reber, the ambition is to create the &#8220;YouTube for presentations&#8221; with the ability for people to create, create, collaborate on, and share presentations with each other through an online-based interface.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His interest, meanwhile, in taking on Microsoft has a deeper story to it. As we have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/pitch-a-presentation-startup-from-wunderlists-founders-raises-30m-more-to-take-on-powerpoint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered before</a>, Reber&#8217;s previous startup, the planning startup Wunderlist, was acquired by Microsoft and folded into its productivity suite, only to eventually be killed off, much to Reber&#8217;s disbelief and disappointment.</p>
<p>Not to dwell too much in the past, the funding Pitch has now raised will be used in several areas, including hiring more people and reach. The startup has already seen good progress on the latter front. Pitch is already being used by tens of thousands of teams, it ways, who have created some 125,000 workspaces on the platform. Customers include (ironically) a number of other trailblazers in the world of business productivity: Intercom, Superhuman and Notion are among the list.</p>
<p>The plan will be to work on bringing on more users into its freemium universe, while converting more to its Pitch Pro $10/user/month paid tier, which includes more extensions like unlimited storage, video uploads, version history, and advanced permissioning. Pro already has a &#8220;couple of thousand&#8221; subscribers, Reber said, enough to prove out that &#8220;we definitely see our business model working.&#8221; Pitch is also working on rolling out an enterprise version so that it can sell Pitch into the bigger businesses and deployments that dominate usage of Powerpoint.</p>
<p>And the other way that Pitch plans to bring more people into the fold will be with more functionality. Along with the funding, Pitch is rolling out some new features that will include the beginnings of an ecosystem, where presentation designers and creators will be able to upload both presentation templates, as well as presentations themselves, to help other people get started in creating their own presentations.</p>
<p>The idea here is to celebrate creators, Reber said, but it&#8217;s (at least for now) stopping short of paying them, seeing this more as a way of sharing designs and ideas in a more collaborative exchange with each other. Both, however, seem to me to be ripe opportunities down the line for building a marketplace. Creating a great pitch deck for a startup is great to share as a resource, but if you are also, say, a leadership coach who makes a living out of giving people inspiring direction on how to handle something, a pitch deck with that IP in it perhaps might not be something you&#8217;d always be willing to part with for free. (Reber says his inspiration here was the world of design forums like Dribble where an exchange of ideas has thrived.)</p>
<p>Initially, the user-generated content will be selected by Pitch itself, although the plan over time will be to make it something that will be open to everyone, Reber said.</p>
<p>Another new feature will be presentation analytics. This will not be unlike the kind of data that people currently can apply to, say, email or web traffic to measure what people are clicking on, how long they are spending looking at content, and where they are dropping off. Pitch will apply the same to its presentations &#8212; which are HTML-coded &#8212; so that those who are making them and sending them around can get a better idea of how they are performing, and even begin the process of A-B testing to try out different approaches.</p>
<p>Reber points out that analytics will be opt-in only: if users choose not to share that tracking it won&#8217;t be shared, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a German business, we have a special relationship with data privacy in the greatest sense,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We care deeply about making sure we approach features in a privacy-first way.&#8221; The idea is to make it less like spyware, and more like the kind of analytics one might have on YouTube for videos there.</p>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s adding in more video features to bring in narrative recording and playback. These first will be &#8220;recorded&#8221; around the presentations themselves, but longer term, it&#8217;s likely that the feature will also have a live element, which makes a lot of sense since a lot of presentations have had their most highly trafficked exposure by way of webinars or live presentations (say, around an earnings call), where you might not only have multiple presenters talking along a slide deck, but also people feeding back, asking questions in relation to the presentation and so on.</p>
<p>If this all sounds a little WordPress-like, that&#8217;s not a coincidence. Reber noted that website building is something else that Pitch wants to bring into the platform. &#8220;We are experimenting with that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In my opinion, presentations are collections of information and we want to publish them in various ways. Slides just happens to be one format. But if it&#8217;s all already written in HTML, why not build it also into a site? That will be another feature coming, and something that we will be also using the funding for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed that may not work for deeper content efforts (such as publications like the one you are reading right now) but would be perfectly adequate for, say, basic sites along the kind that are built on sites like Squarespace to lay out some online real estate for a small business. The scope of what you can already do, and what Pitch wants you to do, is precisely what makes this all so interesting to investors, they say.</p>
<p>“The exciting vision that Christian and the team at Pitch have is beyond just being a superior alternative to legacy presentation software,&#8221; said Stephen Nundy, partner at Lakestar, in a statement. &#8220;A reimagining of the entire workflow surrounding presentations is very much overdue, and when coupled with the ability to harness new data and media integrations, Pitch will lead the way in changing how stories are told. I’m very proud to be joining the board of a European company with its sights set on a truly global opportunity.”</p>
<p>“We are incredibly impressed by the quality of Pitch’s offering today and Christian’s vision for the future. Pitch will be a true productivity platform, and we are excited to become investors in this special company,” John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global, added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://maven.com/">Maven</a>, a startup that helps professionals teach cohort-based classes, has raised $20 million in a Series A round led by Andreessen Horowitz. The round places A16z general partner Andrew Chen on Maven’s board &#8211; and is his latest lead check in a creator-focused company, similarly pouring millions into recent rounds for Clubhouse and Substack.</p>
<p>The investment comes seven months after Maven, then nameless, left stealth alongside a $4.3 million round led by First Round Capital, and three months after it raised a $750,000 <a href="https://republic.co/maven">equity crowdfunding round</a>. While the company declined to disclose valuation, we do know that it’s a lot of fast cash earmarked toward fueling the same bet: that the future of cohort-based learning is the future of education.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Udemy and altMBA co-founders return to edtech with a new, stealthy business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/udemy-and-altmba-co-founders-return-to-edtech-with-a-new-stealthy-business/embed/#?secret=ZSU6LUO2hp" data-secret="ZSU6LUO2hp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And if you’re wondering why, I’d tell you it&#8217;s two-fold. First, the startup has an impressive founding team: Udemy co-founder Gagan Biyani, altMBA co-founder Wes Kao, and early Venmo employee and Socratic co-founder Shreyans Bhansali.</p>
<p>Second, Maven has some impressive growth to tout, showing its potential. Maven’s core product right now is a suite of services that makes it easier to run a cohort-based course, while taking a 10% fee &#8211; similar to Substack &#8211; from a professional’s revenue. In three months after its January launch, four Maven courses earned over $100,000. To date, over $1 million worth of courses has been sold on Maven.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Dear Startups: Don’t repaint, reinvent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/startups-dont-repaint-reinvent/embed/#?secret=GfUCXhxILk" data-secret="GfUCXhxILk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With the new capital, Kao tells me that her team is focused on getting instructors to see the value of CBCs. The startup has had over 2,000 people apply to become instructors, and expects to grow from 7 to 100 instructors by end of the year. Some of Maven’s investors, including Sahil Lavingia and Li Jin, are instructors on its platform. Long-term, the startup sees its competitive differentiation as helping experts who aren’t “conventional instructors” start sharing their knowledge.</p>
<p>The co-founder teaches a course to all incoming Maven instructors &#8211; meta, I know &#8211; from deciding to put in a curriculum to understanding course-market fit and building buzz for the course.</p>
<p>While Kao explained that instructors like the idea of turning free advice in modular, revenue-generating classes, she said “monetizing that expertise is often really hard.”</p>
<p>“Traditional platforms—Instagram, TikTok, Twitter—create a division between activities intended to monetize and those meant for community building,” she said. “Meaning, creators give away valuable content, and then monetize via brand partnerships or low-margin merchandise—activities that often detract from community-building.”</p>
<p>The biggest challenge ahead, she thinks, is expanding the mindshare about CBCs for creators. It needs to show the importance of signal in the cacophony of air horns that want creator’s attention.</p>
<p>It’s a problem that Maven is all too familiar with it.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest things we had to untangle early on was the difference between “content” and the Maven offering,” Kao explained. “There’s no shortage of content in our world.” The startup had to spend a good chunk of time figuring out how to create a cohort-based class experience that pairs community and accountability with that content. And it still has ways to go.”</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, it ended up being quite simple. In our view, we’ve reached the Post Content Age,” she said. “In other words: Content is no longer scarce in education. It’s either free or low cost, and it’s abundant.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HP today announced a series of ambitious goals aimed at driving “a more diverse, equitable and inclusive” tech industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tech giant, of course, is not the first company to have made strong claims about its intentions around diversity. As former TC reporter Megan Rose Dickey reported extensively, d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">iversity and inclusion as an idea has been </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/a-glimpse-inside-the-minds-of-techs-dei-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the agenda of tech companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for years now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HP Chief Diversity Officer Lesley Slaton Brown says diversity and inclusion is something that the company has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been focused on since its 1939 inception. Today, HP has roughly 50,000 employees globally with 31% of its leadership roles and 22% of its technical roles currently held by women – numbers that appear to be higher than most </span><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3516012/women-in-tech-statistics-the-hard-truths-of-an-uphill-battle.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">industry averages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to further improve these numbers, HP announced three goals that Slaton Brown says the company is determined to achieve by 2030: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">50/50 gender equality in HP leadership (defined as director level and up); greater than 30% technical women and women in engineering; and meet or exceed labor market representation for racial/ethnic minorities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked with Slaton Brown t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o get more details on the goals themselves, how the company plans to achieve them and what it plans to do to hold itself accountable. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</span></i></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TC:  Tell me more about the genesis of these goals and what HP has done up until now to achieve more equality – whether it be with regard to gender, race or ethnicity – within the company?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaton Brown: It&#8217;s foundationally something that we&#8217;ve always been focused on. We&#8217;re now at a place where I think going into COVID and quarantine last year and the impact that the George Floyd murder had on us as a nation really allowed us to do the double click down into racial equality and the systemic and structural discrimination that exists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From that, we were able to then stand up our </span><a href="https://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-information/about-hp/diversity/racial-equality.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Racial Equality and Social Justice Task Force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of our goals has been to increase the representation of Black and African Americans in particular at HP. And also look at what we would need to do to increase the opportunity of Black and African American suppliers and vendors who work with and partner with HP. And then ultimately, how can we impact the communities locally and nationally – whether it&#8217;s from policy and legislation to working with municipalities in order to provide bias training and things like that. So all of that was stood up, and now a year later, we&#8217;ve made some great progress. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have also launched our Human Rights Initiative. We’re looking at standing up for equal and </span><a href="https://h20195.www2.hp.com/v2/getpdf.aspx/c06637329.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">human rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’re really focused on how we go after </span><a href="https://press.hp.com/us/en/press-releases/2021/hp-inc-announces-ambitious-climate-action-goals.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and human rights.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: It sounds like that you are committing to a variety of things in terms of more balance among leadership and technical talent in terms of gender, for one. So it&#8217;s not just about race. But I’d like to hear more specifics on these particular goals and what you have done historically to work toward greater diversity and inclusion.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaton Brown: When we separated in 2015 from HP Co. We were very intentional about creating a diverse board of directors, first and foremost. And so today when I think about our board composition, we&#8217;re made up of I think it&#8217;s about 45% women, 35% ethnic minorities and over 60% total minorities with just our board of directors alone. We&#8217;re one of the most diverse boards in the tech industry. Now why is that important? The importance of building or standing up a board of directors is because they help with the vision of the company and help guide the strategy for the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was one of the first things we did, and when I came into this role at that time, my goal was to embed diversity, equity and inclusion into everything that we do. </span></p>
<p><strong>TC: How are you holding yourselves accountable?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaton Brown: We&#8217;re really talking about answering all the way up to the board of directors on what we&#8217;re doing – our dashboards, our matrices that we pulled together will go to our board of directors to say, ‘Here&#8217;s what we said we&#8217;re going to do, how are we tracking, and then ultimately what was the impact.’ And so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re building today. I consider that the infrastructure. So from the board of directors down cascading to your executive leadership team, ensuring that we have a strong narrative built.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By having this goal, we can then drive the actions, the programs, and then the implementation through our infrastructure and an ecosystem to achieve those goals. That includes things like working with organizations like the Society of Women Engineers, the Society of Black Engineers and the Society of Asian Engineers. And not only working with them, but building and investing in them so that we build the partnership in order to get to that pipeline.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you be more specific in terms of what you mean by meeting or exceeding labor market representation?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaton Brown: I can see where that would be confusing. First, what it doesn’t mean is trying to match the demographics of the overall population, but rather to the labor market in the tech industry. For example, we&#8217;re at nearly 4% of having African Americans in a leadership position. Our goal is to achieve hiring at or more than 6% by 2025.</span></p>

<p><strong>TC: What if you’re not getting enough women or minorities to apply for these leadership and technical roles? Would you rule out qualified white males, for example?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaton Brown: We are standing up for equal human rights. What we&#8217;re focusing on is also accelerating our gender, racial equality and social justice efforts. Part of that is looking at how do we increase our pipeline? And, how do we increase the talent pool? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would submit there is not a shortage of talent. It’s about how do you get to the talent? It has traditionally been through top tier schools such as Stanford and MIT. But you know what? Smart people and great talent are everywhere. People are sometimes financially challenged and so they may go the community college route, and then they might move into some of the top tier schools. That’s one means in addition to HBCUs (historically Black colleges and universities). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we’ve stood up a </span><a href="https://press.hp.com/us/en/press-releases/2020/hp-deepens-investment-in-HBCUs-launches-distance-learning-challenge.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">very good program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the HBCU space to ensure that students that have not traditionally had the opportunity to compete for certain positions have that opportunity and not only have that opportunity, but have the ability to travel to HP sites to see where they would be likely interning. Our goal is to have a 100% conversion rate in terms of converting interns into full-time hires based off of performance, of course. And so it is a holistic or an end-to-end approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, so now you&#8217;ve made these goals for women and for ethnic minorities and the white guy might say, ‘I&#8217;m left out.’ I think the interesting thing about that is that within the tech industry, the white male is the majority. What we&#8217;re doing at HP is building a powerful culture of inclusion and belonging. So we&#8217;re still getting white guys, but we&#8217;re also getting very talented women, and US ethnic minorities, as well, in addition to veterans and people with disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s about where you go, how you show up as a brand of choice – which is a goal of ours: to be a destination of choice for the underrepresented group – and  then how you welcome them. It’s the attraction, the hiring, the retention, the investment you make in their learning and development, and then in promotion, as well. And so those are some of the things that we&#8217;re doing.</span></p>

<p><strong>TC: What are other ways you are fighting for human rights?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaton Brown: This announcement is around how we&#8217;re doubling down on our workforce, workforce empowerment, and that is about how we do things is just as important as what we do. And that&#8217;s about respecting human rights, and making it a priority. Our commitment to our supply chain workers is to ensure that our vendors are not contributing to the modern day slavery, or bringing in people with degrees and education and then bringing them into a system that charges them charges them ginormous fees and takes their passport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to ensure that we create an environment, and create visibility and a resilient supply chain to ensure that that doesn&#8217;t happen, that we respect human rights, and that our manufacturing suppliers are contributing to that, as well.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC:  In press materials, the company claimed to be the first Fortune 100 tech company to commit to gender parity in leadership.&#8221; Hopefully you&#8217;ll be setting an example and others will follow.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaton Brown: Well, it&#8217;s a huge goal and so some of the strategies and best practices that we&#8217;ve put in place really is not just about bringing women in as a checkbox exercise for us, but to really establish a new standard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal and our vision is to become the most sustainable and just tech company in the world. And so we can&#8217;t just say that we have to do it. And that&#8217;s what I love about the culture of HP – it’s moving from the talk, and really showing the actions in which we&#8217;re going to get to that place of being sustainable and just by 2030.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever been self-employed you know what a pain it is to keep up with the hassles of running a business. From bookkeeping to invoicing to paying taxes &#8212; it’s one big headache.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancers and self-employed people often turn to a number of different solutions to try and address different aspects of running their business. It can be a lot to keep up with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter <a href="https://found.app/">Found</a>. Previously called Indie, the startup was founded by two former Square execs who got firsthand insight into how SMBs paid their employees.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren Myrick joined Square in 2010 and was the second project manager at the company. She helped launch its first POS (point-of-sale) product and its SaaS products. She eventually became GM of its payroll business unit, and that was her first foray into taxes and understanding their implication. Co-founder Connor Dunn ran engineering for Square Payroll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that experience, the pair saw an opportunity to launch a suite of services for self-employed businesses, which have been growing even faster during COVID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started to pay attention to the movement toward self-employment,” Myrick told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2019, the pair interviewed “lots” of self-employed people to better understand their pain points. What they found is that taxes and expense tracking were considered among the more painful and expensive parts of being self-employed. So they formed Found (formerly called Indie) with the goal of creating a “one-stop shop” for business banking, bookkeeping and taxes for self-employed businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the San Francisco-based startup has raised $12.75 million in a round led by Sequoia that also included participation from some angel investors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myrick is no stranger to being self-employed herself, having worked as a public accountant after college. Also, her sister is a self-employed yoga instructor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Found, Myrick’s two previous professional worlds have come together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With my accounting background and what I learned at Square, I had this big aha moment that we could become a ledger for these businesses, and solve their bookkeeping and tax needs through software,” she said. “So that’s what we’ve built.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers can use the platform to do things like deposit business income, obtain a debit card for business purchases and calculate how much they owe in taxes. The platform also offers a feature that sets aside the money for, and facilitates, the quarterly tax payments, for example. It also offers real-time business and tax reports, so when a business owner swipes their card, expenses are reflected in real time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lauren has incredible context and command of the details. She talked about the hoops self-employed people have to jump through to fill out their Schedule Cs; she explained some of the finer points of different tax codes — and we were riveted,” the pair say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin said he was particularly intrigued by the concept of Found because while he was in graduate school he ran a small data analysis business on the side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had to invoice, report on taxes and do my own bookkeeping,” he recalls. “And I kept it together with a spreadsheet. I thought to myself that there should be better tools to do some of this stuff. And that is what Lauren has done with Found.”</span></p>

<p>Pour one out for Internet Explorer, the long-enduring internet browser that&#8217;s been the butt of countless jokes about its speed, reliability, and probably most notable of all, security, which will retire next year after more than 25 years of service.</p>
<p>Microsoft said it <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/05/19/the-future-of-internet-explorer-on-windows-10-is-in-microsoft-edge/">will pull the plug</a> on the browser&#8217;s life support in June 2022, giving its last remaining half a dozen or so users a solid year to transition to Chrome or Firefox — let&#8217;s be honest here — though other respectable browsers are available. There will be some exceptions to the end-of-life plan, such as industrial machines that need the browser to operate.</p>
<p>For years, Microsoft has nudged Internet Explorer users towards its newer Edge browser as a more reliable and secure alternative to the ailing Internet Explorer, often in the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/think-youre-annoying-windows-10-users-are-being-subjected-to-full-screen-ads-for-microsoft-edge">most obnoxious ways possible</a> by splashing on-screen ads the second you flirt with using a rival browser. As the wider web&#8217;s support for Internet Explorer <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-using-internet-explorer-11-time-to-switch-because-soon-your-google-workspace-apps-wont-work/">dwindled</a>, enterprises have also begun phasing out support for the browser.</p>
<p>But in ending support for Internet Explorer, Microsoft is parting ways with one of the most problematic security headaches in its history.</p>
<p>Virtually no other software has been subject to more security bugs than Internet Explorer, in large part due to its longevity. Microsoft has patched Internet Explorer almost every month for the past two decades, trying to stay one step ahead of the hackers who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/microsoft-emergency-patch-windows/">find and exploit vulnerabilities</a> in the browser to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/18/internet-explorer-security-flaw/">drop malware</a> on their victims&#8217; computers. Internet Explorer was hardened over the years, but it lagged behind its competitors, which sped ahead with frequent, almost invisible security updates and tougher sandboxing to prevent malware from running on the user&#8217;s computer.</p>
<p>As much as it&#8217;s easy to hate on Internet Explorer, it&#8217;s been with us for almost three decades since it debuted in Windows 95, and it&#8217;s served us well. For many of us who grew up on the internet in our teens and twenties, Internet Explorer was the first — and really the only — browser we used. Most of us signed up for our first Hotmail email address with Internet Explorer. We learned how to code our MySpace page using that browser, and we downloaded a lot — and I mean a lot — of suspicious-looking, malware-packed &#8220;games&#8221; that slowed the computer down to a crawl but thought nothing of it.</p>
<p>I remember, as a 10-(ish)-year-old child, seeing for the first time the pixelated Internet Explorer icon on that bright, teal wallpapered cathode-ray monitor in a cold attic room in our family home, because, not really knowing what the internet was, I complained to my father: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to just <i>explore</i> the internet. I want to see the whole thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to Internet Explorer, I got to see a large part of it.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The concept has appealed to many. At the time of its $10.2 million Series A last July, <a href="http://privacy.com/">Privacy.com</a> said it had issued 5 million virtual card numbers. Today, that number has more than doubled, to over 10 million, according to CEO and co-founder Bo Jiang.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">“We set out to create the safest and fastest way to pay online. Our mobile app and web browser extension lets you generate a virtual card for every purchase you want to make online,” Jiang explained. “That can be especially convenient for things like managing subscriptions or making sure your kid doesn’t spend $1,000 on Fortnite skins.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the years, the New York-based company realized the value in the technology it had developed to issue the virtual and disposable payment cards. So after beta testing for a year, Privacy.com launched its new Card Issuing API in 2020 to give corporate customers the ability to create payment cards for their customers, optimize back-office operations or simplify disbursements.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Privacy.com, a virtual payment card startup, raises $10.2M in Series A&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/privacy-virtual-payment-card-startup/embed/#?secret=wV0F7dMrJT" data-secret="wV0F7dMrJT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">The early growth of the new card issuing platform, dubbed Lithic, has prompted the startup to shift its business strategy &#8212; and rebrand.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the process of building out its consumer product, Privacy.com ended up building a lot of infrastructure around programmatically creating cards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If you think about the anatomy of credit/debit card transactions there’s a number of modern processors such as Stripe, Adyen, Braintree and Checkout,” Jiang told TechCrunch. “On the flip side, we’re focused on card creation and issuing, and the APIs for actually creating cards. That side has lagged the card acquiring side by five to seven years&#8230;We’ve built a lot to support card creation for ourselves, and realized tons of other developers need this to create cards.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">As part of its new strategy, Privacy.com announced today that it has changed its name to Lithic and raised $43 million in Series B funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners to double down on its card issuing platform and new B2B focus. Index Ventures, Tusk Venture Partners, Rainfall Ventures, Teamworthy Ventures and Walkabout Ventures also participated in the financing, which brings Lithic’s total raised to date to $61 million.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155116" style="width: 525px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155116" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2155116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="515" height="343" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lithic CEO and co-founder Bo Jiang / Lithic</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">Privacy.com, the company’s consumer product, will continue to operate as a separate brand powered by the Lithic card issuing platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Put simply, Lithic was designed to make it simple for developers to programmatically create virtual and physical payment cards. Jiang is encouraged by the platform’s early success, noting that enterprise issuing volumes tripled in the last four months. It competes with the likes of larger fintech players such as Marqeta and Galileo, although Jiang notes that Lithic’s target customer is more of an early-stage startup than a large, established company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Marqeta, for example, goes after enterprise and is less focused on developers and making their infrastructure accessible. And, Galileo too,” he told TechCrunch. “When you compare us to them, because we’re a younger company, we have the benefit of building a much more modern infrastructure. That allows us to bring costs down but also to be more nimble to the needs of startups.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The benefits touted by Lithic’s “self-serve” platform include being able to “instantly” issue a card and “accessible building blocks,” or what the company describes as focused functionality so developers can include only the features they want.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another benefit? An opportunity for a new revenue stream. Developers earn back a percentage of interchange revenue generated by the merchant, according to Lithic. “What we’ve noticed is a lot of folks have really big ambitions to build more of a stack in-house. We offer a path for folks by bringing more of a payments piece of the world that they can build for scale,” he said. “As a result of all these things, we end up not competing head to head with Marqeta, for example, on a ton of deals.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company charges a fee per card for Lithic API customers (it&#8217;s free for Privacy.com). And it makes money on interchange fees with both offerings.</p>

<p dir="ltr">For Charles Birnbaum, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, the shift from B2C to B2B is a smart strategy. He believes Lithic is building a critical piece of the embedded fintech and payments infrastructure stack.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We have been big fans of the Privacy.com team and product since the beginning, but once we started to see such strong organic growth across the fintech landscape for their new card processing developer platform the past year, we just had to find a way to partner with the team for this next phase of growth,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Index Ventures partner Mark Goldberg notes that as every business becomes a fintech, there&#8217;s been an “explosion” in demand for online payments and card issuance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Lithic has stood out to us as being the developer-friendly solution here &#8212; it&#8217;s fast, powerful and insanely easy to get up-and-running,” he said. “We&#8217;ve heard from customers that Lithic can power a launch in the same amount of time it takes an incumbent issuer to return a phone call.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lithic plans to use its new capital to expand the tools and tech it offers to developers to issue and manage virtual cards as well as enhance its Privacy.com offering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok today is <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-tools-to-combat-bullying">introducing</a> a feature that will allow creators to deal with online abuse in an easier way. The company is launching new tools that will allow creators to bulk delete comments and block users, instead of having to moderate comments one-by-one. The update may be somewhat controversial, as it allows creators to curate a persona where the content they&#8217;ve posted is seemingly well-received, when in reality, it had a lot of pushback or correction from the broader TikTok community.</p>
<p>Twitter had faced this same issue in the past, and ultimately split the difference between giving the original poster control over the conversation or ceding that control to the Twitter user base at large. With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/twitter-rolls-out-its-hide-replies-feature-to-all-users-worldwide/">Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;Hidden Replies&#8221; feature</a>, it allow users to tuck all the unhelpful and rude comments behind an extra click &#8212; that way, the replies themselves were not removed entirely, but they weren&#8217;t allowed to derail a conversation.</p>
<p>TikTok, on the other hand, is putting full control in the hands of the creator. That&#8217;s a more Facebook-like approach, where users can delete anything they want from appearing on their own user profile &#8212; including comments on their posts that they don&#8217;t like.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2155095" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155095" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2155095" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155095" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok; image shows the bulk delete tool (why is the user deleting nice comments, though?)</p></div></p>
<p>This may be the right choice for TikTok, since its social network is mainly designed to have conversations through videos. Video formats like duets and stitches allow TikTok users to react and reply to other content on the site, while also creating new content that raises a creator&#8217;s own profile. Some creators use this to their advantage. They single out others who&#8217;ve posted something they disagree with &#8212; often content that toes the line between being a &#8220;bad opinion&#8221; and one that violates rules around misinformation. They then duet or stitch (or<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/tiktok-launches-a-green-screen-duet-feature-tests-dedicated-topics-feeds/"> green screen duet</a>) that content to share their own thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p>However, this process can send a brigade of angry fans over to the other video, where they proceed to troll and harass the original poster. (To what extent that&#8217;s a warranted reaction may depend on your own stance on the post and the politics in question.)</p>
<p>TikTok says such abuse can be &#8220;discouraging.&#8221; It certainly has been for some of TikTok&#8217;s early stars, like Charli D&#8217;Amelio, a teenage girl who somehow rocketed to TikTok stardom, where she now has <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio?lang=en">nearly 116 million followers</a>. D&#8217;Amelio has begun to speak more publicly about the <a href="https://www.insider.com/psychologists-say-social-media-fame-may-harm-child-star-influencers-2020-5">downsides of her online fame</a>, saying she now <a href="https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/a36395497/charli-damelio-says-tiktok-lost-its-joy/">finds it difficult to find enjoyment</a> on TikTok due the mounting criticism she receives there. This includes the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/natashajokic1/charli-damelio-tiktok-passion">abusive remarks she received</a>, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/52442542">body shaming</a>, and dealing with<a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/charli-damelio-says-tiktok-has-become-too-competitive-to-enjoy"> the competitive, dishonest nature of the influencer set,</a> among other things.</p>
<p>The new bulk delete feature doesn&#8217;t solve these problems, but it may allow creators to clean up their comment section and block trolls quickly enough that they can re-establish some semblance of control over their profile.</p>
<p>To use the new feature, users can long-press on a comment or tap the pencil icon in the upper-left corner to open a window of options. From here, they can select up to 100 comments or accounts instead of going one-by-one, making it easier to delete or report multiple comments or block users in bulk.</p>
<p>TikTok says the new feature is rolling out first to Great Britain, South Korea, Spain, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Thailand, and will continue to expand to other markets globally in the weeks to come, including the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GPS is one of those science fiction technologies whose use is effortless for the end user and endlessly challenging for the engineers who design it. It’s now at the heart of modern life: everything from Amazon package deliveries to our cars and trucks to our walks through national parks are centered around a pin on a map that monitors us down to a few meters.</p>
<p>Yet, GPS technology is decades old, and it’s going through a much-needed modernization. The U.S., Europe, China, Japan and others have been installing a new generation of GNSS satellites (GNSS is the generic name for GPS, which is the specific name for the U.S. system) that will offer stronger signals in what is known as the L5 band (1176 MHz). That means more accurate map pinpoints compared to the original generation L1 band satellites, particularly in areas where line-of-sight can be obscured like urban areas. L5 was “designed to meet demanding requirements for safety-of-life transportation and other high-performance applications,” <a href="https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/modernization/civilsignals/">as the U.S. government describes it</a>.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to put satellites into orbit (that’s the easy part!), and another to build power-efficient chips that can scan for these signals and triangulate a coordinate (that’s the hard part!). So far, chipmakers have focused on creating hybrid chips that pull from the L1 and L5 bands simultaneously. For example, Broadcom <a href="https://www.gpsworld.com/broadcoms-second-generation-dual-frequency-gnss-uses-l5-signals/">recently announced the second-generation of its hybrid chip</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://onenav.ai">OneNav</a> has a totally different opinion on product design, and it placed it right in its name. Eschewing the hybrid chip model of mixing old signals with new, it wants one chip monitoring the singular band of L5 signals to drive cost and power savings for devices. One nav to rule them all, as it were.</p>
<p>The company announced today that it has closed a $21 million Series B round led by Karim Faris at GV, which is solely funded by Alphabet. Other investors included Matthew Howard at Norwest and GSR Ventures, which invested in earlier rounds of the company. All together, OneNav has raised $33 million in capital and was founded about two years ago.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Steve Poizner has been in the location business a long time. His previous company, SnapTrack, built out a GPS positioning technology for mobile devices that <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2000/03/02/qualcomm-completes-acquisition-wireless-location-leader-snaptrack">sold to Qualcomm for $1 billion in stock in March 2000</a>, at the height of the dot-com bubble. His co-founder and CTO at OneNav Paul McBurney has similarly spent decades in the GNSS space, most recently at Apple, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155132" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155132" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2155132" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-90802848.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-90802848.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-90802848.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-90802848.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-90802848.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-90802848.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-90802848.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-90802848.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-90802848.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155132" class="wp-caption-text">OneNav CEO and co-founder Steve Poizner, seen here in 2009.

<p>They saw an opportunity to build a new navigation company as L5 band satellites have switched on in recent years. As they looked at the market and the L5 tech, they decided they wanted to go further than other companies by eliminating the legacy tech of older GPS technology and moving entirely into the future. By doing that, its design is “half the size of the old system, but much higher reliability and performance,” Poizner said. “We are aiming to get location technology into a much broader number of products.”</p>
<p>He differentiated between upgrading GPS from upgrading wireless signals. “With these L5 satellites, we don’t need the L1 satellites anymore [but] with 5G, you still need 4G,” he said. L5 band GPS does everything that earlier renditions did, but better, whereas with wireless technologies, they often need to complement each other to offer peak performance.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one caveat here: the L5 signal is still considered &#8220;pre-operational&#8221; by the U.S. government, since the U.S. GPS system only has 16 satellites broadcasting the signal today, and is targeting 24 satellites for full deployment by later in this decade. However, other countries have also deployed L5 GNSS satellites, which means that while it may not be fully operational from the U.S. government&#8217;s perspective, it may well be good enough for consumers.</p>
<p>OneNav’s goal according to Poizner is to be “the Arm of the GNSS space.” What he means is that like Arm, which produces the chip designs for nearly all mobile phones globally, OneNav creates comprehensive designs for L5 band GPS chips that can be integrated as a system-on-chip into the products of other manufacturers so that they can “embed a high-performance location engine based on their silicon.”</p>
<p>The company today also announced that its first design customer will be In-Q-Tel, the U.S. intelligence community’s venture capital and business development organization. Poizner said that through In-Q-Tel, “we now have a development contract with a U.S. government agency.” The company is expecting that its customer evaluation units will be completed by the end of this year with the objective of potentially having OneNav’s technology in end-user devices by late 2022.</p>
<p>Location tracking has become a major area of investment for venture capitalists, with companies working on a variety of technologies outside of GPS to offer additional detail and functionality where GPS falls short. Poizner sees these technologies as ultimately complementary to what he and his team are building at OneNav. “The better the GPS, the less pressure on these augmentation systems,” he said, while acknowledging that, “it is the case though that in certain environments [like downtown Manhattan or underground in a subway], you will never get the GPS to work.”</p>
<p>For Poizner, it’s a bit of a return to entrepreneurship. Prior to starting OneNav, he had been heavily involved in California state politics. Several years after the sale of SnapTrack to Qualcomm, he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the California State Assembly. He later was elected California’s insurance commissioner in 2007 under former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. He ran for governor in 2010, losing in the Republican primary against Meg Whitman, who made her name as the longtime head of eBay. He ran for his former seat of California insurance commissioner in 2018, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-steve-poizner-insurance-commissioner-independent-candidate-20180212-story.html">this time as a political independent</a>, but lost.</p>
<p>OneNav is based in Palo Alto and currently has more than 30 employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Life is complicated and so &#8212; increasingly &#8212; is work-life. That&#8217;s the premise underpinning <a href="https://www.polywork.com">Polywork</a>, a new professional social network founded by Lystable/Kalo founder, Peter Johnson.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s announcing a $3.5 million seed round today, led by by Caffeinated Capital&#8217;s Ray Tonsing (who it notes was the first investor in Clubhouse, Airtable and Brex), with participation from the founders of YouTube (Steve Chen), Twitch (Kevin Lin), PayPal (Max Levchin), VSCO (Joel Flory), Behance (Scott Belsky), and Worklife VC (Brianne Kimmel) &#8212; to name a few of its long list of angels.</p>
<p>As the list illustrates, Johnson, an ex-Googler (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/07/lystable-startup-battlefield/">TC battlefield alum</a>), isn&#8217;t short of contacts to tap up for his new startup &#8212; having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/lystable-takes-10m-top-up-to-tackle-freelancer-payments/">pulled so much VC</a> into Lystable/Kalo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Albeit we&#8217;ve also learned that his earlier startup, which was focused on tools to help companies manage freelancers and gig workers, is no longer active. Kalo/Lystable has hit the deadpool.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re told the founders took the decision to pull the plug after being unable to convince investors to keep supporting the business &#8212; which had, presumably, been severely impacted by the pandemic as companies laid off freelancers.</p>
<p>Although, in parallel, VC investment has been flowing into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/malt-raises-28-6-million-for-its-freelancer-platform/">startups</a> building <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/worksome-pulls-13m-into-its-high-skill-freelancer-talent-platform/">marketplaces</a> to help companies work with external talent (as the remote work boom is clearly driving more flexible ways of working) so it&#8217;s not clear where exactly Kalo went wrong &#8212; perhaps its focus on management tools was simply being overtaken by more fully featured marketplaces which are baking in the kind of admin support its SaaS offered.</p>
<p>Lystable/Kalo had raised close to $30M over its seven year run, per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kalo-hq">Crunchbase</a>, including from some of the same investors putting money into Polywork. Though most of the latter&#8217;s investors aren&#8217;t the same and look to be coming more from the social/entertainment side.</p>
<p>So what is Johnson&#8217;s new startup all about? It&#8217;s still focused on the world of work. It&#8217;s his &#8220;moonshot mission&#8221; &#8212; which, we&#8217;re told, has been fed by learnings gleaned from Lystable about creating a professional network.</p>
<p>But if you take a look at the site it&#8217;s a lot more Twitter in look and feel than LinkedIn. So the social element is really being put front and center here.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155316" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155316" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2155316" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155316" class="wp-caption-text">A Polywork profile (Image credits: Polywork)</p></div></p>
<p>In short, Polywork sums to a Twitter-style social feed where professionals can post updates about what they&#8217;re up to (in work and, if they like, in life too).</p>
<p>Users skills and interests (e.g. &#8220;UX design&#8221;, &#8220;founder&#8221;, &#8220;dinosaur enthusiast&#8221;); personality quirks (&#8220;introvert&#8221;); and achievements (&#8220;life partner&#8221;) &#8212; or indeed the opposite (&#8220;bad golfer&#8221;, &#8220;failure&#8221;) &#8212; can be displayed as custom badges at the top of their profile &#8212; again with the chance to blend personal and professional to offer a fuller portrait of who you are and what you offer.</p>
<p>In the feed itself, individual posts can be given related tags (e.g. &#8220;conducted user research&#8221;, which files under &#8220;UX Design&#8221;) &#8212; to illustrate relevant activity. (Clicking on a specific badge shows the sliced view of that user&#8217;s related tagged content.)</p>
<p>The result is an interface that feels gamified and informal &#8212; where you&#8217;re actively encouraged to inject your own personality &#8212; but which is simultaneously intended for showing off work activity and achievements.</p>
<p>On the professional networking side, the approach allows users to get a quick visual overview of an individual &#8212; perhaps fleshing out some of the dry details they already saw on their LinkedIn account &#8212; and quickly navigate to individual examples of specific activity. Recruiters or others looking for professional ice-breakers will probably relish the chance to find more up-to-date material to work with, ahead of making a cold pitch.</p>
<p>Polywork also lets users send collaboration requests to others on the network &#8212; aka, its version of LinkedIn&#8217;s in-mail. But (thankfully) it looks like users have controls to set whether or not they&#8217;re open to receiving such requests or not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly true that home and work have never been so blended as now, given the pandemic-fuelled remote work boom.</p>
<p>At the same time professionals may well &#8212; out of necessity &#8212; be more focused on the range of skills and interests they have or can acquire, rather than viewing any single job title as defining them, as was true for earlier generations of workers. As the saying goes, there&#8217;s no such thing as a &#8216;job for life&#8217; anymore.</p>
<p>Career paths are complicated, multi-faceted &#8212; and, for some, may be more a tapestry, than a linear trajectory.</p>
<p>Polywork&#8217;s Millennial-friendly premise is thus to offer a place where people can present a more personal and well-rounded flavor of themselves as professionals and individuals &#8212; encompassing not just their skills and work achievements but their passions, quirks and obsessions &#8212; showing off a lot more than feels possible (or sensible) in the staid environs of LinkedIn.</p>
<p>That said, LinkedIn isn&#8217;t the only place for professionals to express themselves of course; People are already doing that all the time over on social media sites like Twitter (or indeed Instagram for more visually minded professions).</p>
<p>Either social network is basically already an informal professional network in its own right &#8212; without the need for badges or labels (hashtags do a fairly decent job).</p>
<p>So while Polywork&#8217;s product design may look inviting, trying to reinvent the networking wheel is undoubtedly a massive challenge.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It&#8217;s not only fighting for attention with boring professional networks like LinkedIn (which everyone loves to hate), it&#8217;s treading directly into highly contested social media territory. Er, good luck with that! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Convincing people to duplicate their social networking activity &#8212; or indeed ditch their existing hard-won social media networks &#8212; looks like a big ask. </span>So the risk is irrelevance, despite a pretty interface. (Sure LinkedIn is boring &#8212; but, guys, the whole point is that it&#8217;s <em>low maintenance</em>&#8230; )</p>
<p>Polywork&#8217;s name and philosophy suggests it might be okay with being added to the existing mix of professional and social networks, i.e. rather than replacing either. But, well, a supplementary professional network sounds like a bit of a sideline.</p>
<p>Polywork launched in April but isn&#8217;t disclosing user numbers yet &#8212; and is currently operating a wait list for sign ups.</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed funding in a statement Caffeinated Capital&#8217;s Tonsing said: “There’s a new generation that wants to work and live on their own terms, not destined for a single track identity. The pandemic accelerated this trend and humans are reevaluating who they are and what&#8217;s most important to them in life. Polywork will usher in and facilitate this permanent shift in human behavior. We&#8217;re excited to partner with Peter again!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holoride, the Audi spinoff that’s creating an in-vehicle XR passenger entertainment experience, is deploying blockchain technology and NFTs as the next stage in its preparation for a 2022 market launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which closed a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/audi-spinoff-holoride-collects-e10m-in-series-a-led-by-terranet-ab/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$12 million Series A in April</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced it would be integrating Elrond blockchain into its tech stack to bring transparency to its ecosystem of car manufacturers and content creators. Holoride hopes to use NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, to incentivize developers into creating more content on holoride’s platform for the promise of more money earned off token purchases, and to attract passengers who want to personalize their in-car experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain&#8230; NFTs&#8230; is holoride just trying to be internet trendy? Maybe, but the blockchain integration at least has been in the works for the past year, says holoride CEO and founder Nils Wollny.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holoride’s immersive in-vehicle media platform doesn’t need blockchain to function. Its passenger experiences sync to the real-time motion and location-based data of the vehicle, so content adjusts to vehicle motion (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/i-used-vr-in-a-car-going-90mph-and-didnt-get-sick/">meaning no motion sickness!</a>). Where blockchain plays a role is to help holoride fairly and transparently distribute content and compensate developers based on user engagement time and value distribution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We said we want to connect all our ecosystem partners in a very fair and transparent manner from the beginning, and blockchain technology delivers exactly on that,” Wollny told TechCrunch. “Every transaction and engagement can be stored in the blockchain. For car manufacturers, they can see how much time was spent with holoride experiences in their cars, and for content creators it’s transparent on how much time was spent with their title they have created for our platform.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFTs are unique digital tokens that have a marked place on the blockchain and cannot be replaced with anything else. Most NFTs are part of Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain, but holoride’s will be supported by Elrond’s blockchain. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Audi spinoff holoride collects $12M in Series A led by Terranet AB&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/audi-spinoff-holoride-collects-e10m-in-series-a-led-by-terranet-ab/embed/#?secret=FuTaFMHued" data-secret="FuTaFMHued" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wollny hopes the enticement of buying or collecting NFTs while immersed in holoride’s experiences will lead to more engagement. He also anticipates the acceleration of what futurists and other tech nerds are calling the &#8216;metaverse&#8217; or the concept of the digital and virtual world increasingly intertwining with physical and augmented reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Need help visualizing how this works while you’re strapped into a headset being driven to your next destination? For holoride, an NFT might start by connecting elements in the virtual world to locations or events in the real world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Imagine people are traveling in their virtual vehicle, maybe it’s a spaceship or a submarine, as their physical body is in a car driving through the real world,” said Wollny. “They might pass by a certain location where a content creator decided to put something passengers can collect on their way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it&#8217;s kind of like Pokémon GO, but you’re sitting in a car with a VR headset on rather than walking around outside holding your phone in front of you and following augmented reality anime pets like a lunatic. And when you catch the Pokémon, it’s unique and yours and no one else can have it unless you decide to trade it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Or maybe the user is really good at a game they’re playing and they earn rewards while playing,” Wollny continued. “You can maybe display them to other users or trade them in the future, bringing the real world and the virtual world closer together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of holoride’s NFTs really depends upon the extent to which passengers find themselves so immersed in their in-car experiences that they seek attachment and personalization in the form of digital tokens. Maybe Wollny has been spending too much time in virtual reality, or maybe he knows something we don’t about our inevitable reliance on extended reality. But as he told TechCrunch, this is only the genesis of the startup’s ecosystem, a step towards making holoride the “transportation company for the metaverse.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last few months, we’ve seen an explosion in funding for consumer banking startups in Latin America, all eager to reinvent traditional banking in the region. However, the business banking space seems like it’s also undergoing some changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Chile-based <a href="https://www.kredito.cl/">Kredito</a> announced a $4 million pre-seed round. The company focuses on generating loans for small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we see is that in our sector people have a bank account but don’t have access to credit,” said Sebastian Robles, co-founder and CEO of Kredito.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robles explained that in Chile, when you open a business bank account, you don’t get a credit or debit card attached to it, so entrepreneurs usually have to use their personal cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ninety percent of our customers don&#8217;t have access to credit with their bank (but they have a bank account) and thanks to the power of AI they can have access to working capital for the first time,” added Robles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using an AI algorithm to underwrite the loans in real time, Kredito does all the heavy lifting and then connects the SMBs with a traditional bank that loans out the money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We use proprietary algorithms and alternative data to evaluate credit risk more inclusively than traditional banks,” the company said in a statement. This approach speeds up the process of getting a loan, which traditionally has taken weeks or months to complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in beta, the company used data from more than 10,000 SMBs to train their AI models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kredito makes money by serving as lead generation for the traditional banks and charging them a small percentage for each loan they bring in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to its loan service, Kredito is also developing a debit card product that will be available in the next couple of months. Like other fintechs in the region, the company’s strategy is to launch individual financial products one at a time without having to apply to be a full bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being a bank is too expensive, so we use pieces of the ecosystem instead,” Robles told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kredito launched in March of this year and today the company has more than 2,000 active SMBs on the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to offering new products, the company is very focused on offering optimal customer service, which is an area that traditional banks are lacking.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To open a bank account for our startup was more painful than raising our angel funds, and despite having $4 million in the bank, I still don’t have a line of credit for Kredito,” Robles said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Salespeople have more tools than ever these days to help them with their work, whether they are tools to source new leads, keep those leads interested or informed about what&#8217;s being sold, to track how the sales process is going, to manage those relationships once they are secured, or accounting tools to manage how and where sales are actually coming in. Today, a startup that&#8217;s built a platform to help manage the data entry that powers all of that is announcing a swift round of funding to build on momentum and interest in its technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dooly.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dooly</a> &#8212; which has built a set of AI-based tools to automate the busywork that goes into updating data in sales software, specifically apps like Salesforce, in order to get the most out of that software &#8212; has closed $80 million in funding. Sources tell us that the money values the Vancouver-based startup at over $300 million.</p>
<p>This is a &#8220;swift&#8221; round in that efforts to raise and close the funding happened quickly, and come not two months after the company had announced a Series A and seed round totaling $20 million. (In fact, we got wind of this round a couple of weeks ago, so arguably it was less than two months since the previous announcement.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest Series B is being led by Spark Capital, with Greenspring, Tiger Global, Lachy Groom, boldstart ventures, BoxGroup and Addition also participating. Several of these are repeat investors.</p>
<p>Investor interest in the company is coming in part because of what Dooly is adding to the bigger mix of sales tools; and in part because of the traction it has already picked up for that.</p>
<p>While there are indeed a number of apps that salespeople can use these days, that has presented something of a predicament for many salespeople: tending to the data in each of these, updating records and helping them tick along, can be a very time-consuming task that takes people away from doing what they do best.</p>
<p>That predicament has perhaps been heightened in the last year, as organizations push for &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; &#8212; investing in newer IT &#8212; to better adapt to workforces that are not in the office all the time, and in many cases haven&#8217;t been in an office together for a year and with some perhaps never to return again. That&#8217;s in many cases translated to using a ton more software to manage those people, what they do, and how they engage with each other when in-person is not an option.</p>
<p>Dooly&#8217;s proposition is that it uses AI tools like natural language processing to let people take notes on meetings and other work which it then intelligently can feed into other applications to let them work as they should.</p>
<p>Kris Hartvigsen, Dooly&#8217;s CEO himself experienced these pain points firsthand as a top salesperson for a number of other companies and this served as his motivation for building Dooly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was born out of pain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When I was in a previous role as a top sales performer, I was constantly in this mode that eroded my time. The headwinds now are for remote working, but not everyone is benefitting from this remote world as much as Zoom is. Some are finding it harder to hit their numbers so you want to spend more time, not less, speaking to customers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">He describes his business as &#8220;the table cloth that goes over the table that no one wants to sit at&#8221; and more seriously, &#8220;a clean overlay to systems&#8221; that is very aware of the challenges salespeople face on a practical, operational level. &#8220;We are always mindful of thinking of workflows that hinder users from peak value mode.&#8221;</p>
<p>The the app, in his words, &#8220;plays nice&#8221; with a <a href="https://www.dooly.ai/product/integrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of services</a> both to ingest information &#8212; these, for example, include tools like Gong that among other things monitor voice-based sales calls to provide real-time feedback and transcripts), as well as those that are used to record what is going on, like Salesforce. It also integrates with Slack and G-Suite and other popular apps.</p>
<p>Then, in addition to being able to use and populate relevant data easily across multiple apps, Dooly also provides some guidance, based on the data it is seeing, to give suggestions on closing deals.</p>
<p>This is music to many salespeople&#8217;s ears, it seems. It now has some 500 businesses as customers, and says the list includes revenue teams at Asana, BigCommerce, Contentful, Figma, Intercom, Lessonly, and Procore, and more.</p>
<p>Up to now, the company has been growing organically, through word-of-mouth &#8212; which is perhaps the best kind of sales pitch and success that any company can hope for. Ironically, now that it&#8217;s model has been well proven out, it will quite possibly be using its own tools to expand its reach even more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<span class="il">Dooly</span> is building one of the most consequential enterprise companies of the next decade,” said Will Reed, a general partner at Spark Capital. “We are thrilled to support <span class="il">Dooly</span> as it continues to power the most forward-thinking revenue teams, and believe it will ultimately define the connected workspace category via its relentless focus on customers and product-led growth.&#8221; Reed is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumers are moving into investing to complement &#8212; or in some cases, offset &#8212; less good returns from things like traditional savings accounts with low interest rates or pensions, and today one of the bigger &#8220;neo-brokers&#8221; in Europe helping to open up that opportunity is announcing a monster round of funding to fuel its growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://traderepublic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trade Republic</a>, which lets people buy and sell shares, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), derivatives and (most recently) cryptocurrency by way of a mobile app that does not charge commissions (but does have a <a href="https://traderepublic.com/en-de/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fee structure for various services</a>), has raised $900 million in a Series C round of funding that values the Berlin startup at $5.3 billion, the startup confirmed.</p>
<p>The round has a very strong bench of investors behind it. It is being led by Sequoia, with new backers TCV and Thrive Capital, as well as previous backers Accel, Founders Fund, Creandum and Project A, also participating. Accel and Founders Fund co-led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/trade-republic-a-german-robinhood-raises-67m-led-by-accel-and-founders-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trade Republic&#8217;s Series B a year ago</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investment catapults the Berlin-based startup into being one of the biggest privately-held fintech businesses in the region, and while Trade Republic is currently only active in Germany, Austria and France, Christian Hecker (who co-founded the company with Marco Cancellieri and Thomas Pischke) said the startup will be using the funds to expand to many more countries (which will include not just sorting out licenses to do so, but implementing larger regional operations, hence the large round of funding).</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our ambition to be present across the entire Eurozone in the next four months,&#8221; he said in an interview with TechCrunch. That might logically start with the biggest markets in the region, which would mean Spain and Italy, followed by Benelux, Ireland, and Finland.</p>
<p>Hecker&#8217;s view is that what Trade Republic provides is a resource that everyone should be able to access. &#8220;It really hurts me to see that the those demographic or macroeconomic factors [that are impacting users in Germany, France and Austria] are basically burning all continental European countries. So I think that&#8217;s really, really important we launch in all of those nations.&#8221; The UK is also on the target list, he noted, but Brexit has definitely thrown a proverbial spanner into the works on sorting that one out.</p>
<p>The turning tides of consumer habits, and economic trends, are indeed playing in favor of apps like Trade Republic that are giving people a crack at investing, an area of financial services that has traditionally been reserved for wealthier individuals with large sums of money and access to brokers to help them manage that.</p>
<p>For more ordinary people in Europe, interest rates have been at an all-time low, making traditional savings a less-compelling way of growing money; and given the rate of inflation, there are concerns that state pensions &#8212; Social Security, as it&#8217;s known in the U.S. &#8212; will not be enough for average consumers to live on in their later years without a supplement, while private pension plans are not widely used to supplement that already.</p>
<p>Enter &#8220;neo-brokers&#8221; who are leveraging the ubiquity of smartphones and mobile apps, and a growing acceptance of carrying out financial services like payments or banking using them, to build a new approach to investing, one that is far more accessible to a wider pool of consumers by splitting the stock investing into increments or making way to invest in funds that are composites of many stocks; or indeed giving users a way of investing into alternative areas like cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Or, as Hecker sums it up: &#8220;We have negative interest rates, and we have inflation, and we have a huge pension gap. All three factors demand that you need to do something for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>This has meant a massive shift in stock trading that has led to the rise of a number of new players.</p>
<p>They include Robinhood in the U.S. (which has tried but has yet to make a move into Europe); eToro, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in March</a> announced it was going public by way of a SPAC valuing it at $10 billion; Bux, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/bux-a-european-robinhood-raises-80m-to-expand-its-neo-broker-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $80 million</a> just last month; and neo-bank Revolut, which also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/revolut-launches-stock-trading-in-limited-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides stock trading services</a>. It is also leading to the growth of completely new approaches to the concept, such as Rally creating a new market for investing in collectibles, and most recently NFTs to turn &#8220;everything&#8221; into an investible asset. Rally too <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210517005143/en/Rally-Raises-30-Million-Series-B-Led-by-Accel-To-Make-Everything-in-the-World-a-Tradable-Asset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $30 million led by Accel this week</a>.</p>
<p>All those trends, and the wider rise of services to let you easily manage trades by smartphone app, has led to a huge boost for Trade Republic. Last year when announcing its Series B, Trade Republic said it had more than €1 billion under management. Now, that figure has ballooned to €6 billion, coming from just 1 million customers in the three markets where the startup is active: Germany, Austria and France.</p>
<p>Doing the math on that, customers on average are putting some €6,000 per account into Trade Republic, although in practice &#8212; and as a mark of the &#8220;democratization&#8221; that the company touts as part of its mass-market appeal &#8212; some are putting significantly less, and some significantly more, than that amount.</p>
<p>Hecker said that some users are earmarking as much as 20-30% of their salaries or savings on a monthly basis, and the idea is not so much about quick returns from quick trades, as it is about people looking longer-term gains.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve never been a trading platform,&#8221; Hecker said, referring to the fact that many people tread their Trade Republic accounts as a savings plan. And for that reason, he wouldn&#8217;t really be drawn out on what kind of returns people could expect from the investments except to say that they are in line with how the general market provides gains, and would depend on what you invest in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what&#8217;s very exciting about being a savings plan is that it&#8217;s not only bound to short term returns,&#8221; he said, noting that a recent customer survey found that 70% of Trade Republic&#8217;s customers &#8220;are not looking for short-term gains, or investing with the sole purpose to benefit from the average buying effect.&#8221; Users, he said, &#8220;believe in trends, like sustainability, or the ability of the U.S. technology industry to really grow for the next 10 to 30 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding and valuation, and the story that the company likes to tell about its potential to help the average consumer have a better financial outcome with what money they have to hand, certainly seem to set up the startup to begin positioning itself as a more permanent part of the financial fabric, although as we have unfortunately seen, that can be a slippery idea not just in the world of financial services, but in the world of startups, too.</p>
<p>This is one reason why the fact that the company has a banking license comes in handy: it means that customers get deposit insurance of up to €100,000 per account (similar to how the FDIC backs banks in the U.S.).</p>
<p>Sequoia has been a strong investor in fintechs, backing the likes of Klarna and Nubank, and this comes as the firm is expanding its reach in the region after opening its first European office, in London.</p>
<p>“The democratization of financial markets will be one of the most important consumer trends of the next decade,&#8221; says Doug Leone, partner at Sequoia, in a statement. &#8220;Trade Republic is on the leading edge of this trend and has attracted an untapped generation of European savers who demand increased financial accessibility. We’re thrilled to partner with Christian, Thomas, Marco and their team as they deliver a product and experience that customers love.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital payments are going mainstream around the world. By the end of 2020, there were more than 300 mobile money providers with over 100,000 active users, according to a <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GSMA_State-of-the-Industry-Report-on-Mobile-Money-2021_Full-report.pdf">report</a> published by GSMA, an industry association for mobile network operators. Altogether, over 300 million mobile money accounts were active every month around the world.</p>
<p>Mobile money providers &#8212; more commonly known as e-wallets &#8212; are used to transfer money, pay and receive payments through mobile phones without the need for a traditional bank. They are useful so long as they enjoy wide adoption and a strong network effect. But even a popular service like Ant Groups&#8217;s Alipay, which has over one billion annual users, is practically unusable outside China due to its low penetration in most countries.</p>
<p>The problem is there is no interoperability between most wallets as there is between traditional banks, suggested Xue Zhixiang, who worked on the basic infrastructure for Alibaba&#8217;s cloud unit and Alipay before starting <a href="https://walletsclub.com/">WalletsClub</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Registered in Hong Kong in 2019 with a small operational team in mainland China, WalletsClub sets its sights on becoming the Visa for digital wallets, making money transfers possible between the world&#8217;s hundreds of electronic money services.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are like a clearinghouse for digital wallets,&#8221; said Xue, the company&#8217;s CEO.</p>
<p>A clearing system is an intermediary for two parties engaged in a financial transaction. It&#8217;s designed to ensure the efficiency and security of a transfer by validating the availability of the funds and logging the transfer between two transacting parties. Payments can be sent and received in real-time using WalletsClub, Xue claimed, and its technology is based on the &#8220;ISO 20022&#8221; standard, a common language for financial institutions to exchange data across the globe.</p>
<p>In other words, WalletsClub is going after the hundreds of e-wallets around the world rather than individual end-users. Its vision is to let people pay with any mobile wallet anywhere as long as the sender&#8217;s service provider or financial institution and the receiver&#8217;s equivalent services are members of WalletsClub, similar to how Visa and Mastercard process credit cards issued by different banks that are in their networks. The company plans to monetize by charging a flat fee per transaction.</p>
<p>By adding interoperability to electronic wallets, even small, regional players can thrive because they gain compatibility wherever a clearing system is in place.</p>
<p>Instead of challenging the traditional financial system, WalletsClub wants to provide a way for unbanked individuals to easily move money around through digital wallets, which are easier to obtain than a bank account. A big demand will come from overseas migrant workers who need to send money back to their home countries, such as the millions of Southeast Asian workers abroad.</p>
<p>WalletsClub is potentially encroaching on the territory of a few players. Expatriate workers sending money home currently revert to longstanding remittance services like Western Union or MoneyGram, which have large networks of &#8220;agent&#8221; locations where users go send or collect money. In 2018, Alipay began allowing users in Hong Kong to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180625005561/en/AlipayHK-and-GCash-Launch-Cross-Border-Remittance-Service-Powered-by-Alipay%E2%80%99s-Blockchain-Technology">send money to GCash accounts</a> in the Philippines, but &#8220;the focus of Ant Group is payments rather than remittance,&#8221; Xue observed.</p>
<p>In 2019, money sent home from diaspora workers became the largest source of external financing in low- and middle-income countries excluding China, <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/money-sent-home-workers-now-largest-source-external-financing-low-and-middle-income">according to World Bank data</a>. The money flows amounted to over $500 billion and surpassed the levels of foreign direct investment in these regions.</p>
<p>The other type of business that a clearinghouse for mobile wallets could threaten is cross-border payment aggregators, which save merchants from having to integrate with various digital payment methods.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge for the nascent startup is to establish trust with clients. At this stage, WalletsClub in talks with electronic money services founded by Chinese entrepreneurs in Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada. Chinese-made wallets are especially plentiful in emerging markets, thanks to these founders&#8217; learning from China&#8217;s fintech boom over the decade. Many of them found it hard to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/">compete with behemoths like Tencent and Ant</a>, let alone <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">China&#8217;s tightening regulations around fintech</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we reach 20 members and have several hundreds of transactions between every pair of members on a daily basis, we are basically profitable,&#8221; said Xue, adding that the goal is to onboard a dozen customers by this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We live in a world where companies have to send out ‘gifts’ to individuals. Chocolate bars. Bottles of wine. You name it. Companies are gifting it. But right now, that operation is buried in a marketing department on a spreadsheet, as is mostly pretty disorganized.</p>
<p>A handful of startups realized it could be done better and at scale, among them Sendoso (which has raised $52.7M) and ReachDesk ($6M).</p>
<p>Joining this clan is a startup with the tortuous name of “&amp;Open” (yes, ‘ampersand open’, pronounced ‘And Open’ for those of you at the back).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Suffice it to say, that despite its name it’s raised $7.2 million to makes it easier for brands to send carefully gifts to customers to boost loyalty and engagement. First Round Capital and LocalGlobe led the Seed round along with participation from angel investors including Andrew Robb (Farfetch), Des Traynor (Intercom) and Liam Casey (PCH). The funds will be used to scale to Europe and the US. Currently &amp;Open claims to deliver more than 3,500 gifts every week.</p>
<p>Dublin-based &amp;Open launched in 2017 and was founded by Ciara Flood, formerly buyer at Net-a-Porter and part of the founding team at Mr Porter, together with her husband Jonathan Legge, and her and brother-in-law, Mark Legge. The brothers previously founded the high-end gift and homeware venture Makers &amp; Brothers.</p>
<p>&amp;Open (please God, take me now&#8230;) counts Airbnb, Spotify, and Peloton among their customers.</p>
<p>Gifting can be powerful. According to one <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-retail-study-shows-marketers-under-leverage-emotional-connection-300720049.html">study</a> which the company cites, customers who feel emotionally connected to a brand have been shown to create a 306% higher lifetime value. This is in stark contrast to existing, traditional Meanwhile, Schemes like corporate gifts, branded merchandise, loyalty programmes, and vouchers <a href="https://go.forrester.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Forrester-Future-of-CX.pdf">don’t work</a>, claims &amp;Open.</p>
<p>Jonathan Legge said: “Customers will choose brands who prioritize care and connection over transactional relationships. A thoughtful gift can make all the difference — both for a customer’s experience and their advocacy and loyalty to a brand.”</p>
<p>Hayley Barna, Partner at First Round Capital, said: “Gone are the days of relying on a points-based loyalty scheme to keep your customers engaged and happy. Brands increasingly need to work harder to retain customers and &amp;Open provides an elegant solution to this conundrum.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cervest.earth/">Cervest</a> &#8211; a startup with a platform that claims to quantify climate risk across multiple decades and threats down to the asset level &#8211; has raised a  $30 million Series A round led by Draper Esprit. Previous investors Astanor Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital (Chris Sacca), and Future Positive Capital also participated in the round, and were joined by new investors UNTITLED, the venture fund of Magnus Rausing, and TIME Ventures, the venture fund of Marc Benioff. Cervest’s total funding now stands at $36.2 million. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/cervest-raises-3-7m-for-earth-science-ai-platform-to-predict-climate-effects/">previously</a> raised $5.2M in 2019.</p>
<p>Cervest’s competitors include Jupiter Intelligence, which has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jupiter-intelligence">raised</a> $35M to Series B level,  but Cervest claims it has a more data + AI approach.</p>
<p>The company will use the new funding to expand in the U.S. and European markets through its freemium model<br />
It’s widely accepted now, with unpredictable weather patterns and clear climate “weirding” that these weather events are of huge risk to trillions of dollars of physical assets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cervest says its &#8220;Climate Intelligence” platform has been built through peer-reviewed research over the five years and combines public and private data sources (i.e. NOAA, ECMWF, CMIP6), machine learning, and statistical science to come up with a view of climate risks to assets.</p>
<p>&#8216;EarthScan&#8217; will be its first product, giving enterprises and governments a view on how flooding, droughts, and extreme temperatures can impact the assets they own or manage,going back 50 years and looking forward 80 years.</p>
<p>Iggy Bassi, Founder and CEO of Cervest said: &#8220;Climate Intelligence is Business Intelligence for managing climate risk. Climate volatility has thrown us into a new era where Climate Intelligence needs to be integrated into all decisions. Organizations that fail to do so risk being blindsided by climate events such as the recent floods and fires in Australia, the droughts in Europe, and the winter freeze in Texas. Much of the spotlight is on decarbonization today. While this is absolutely necessary, it is not sufficient to build asset-level resilience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vinoth Jayakumar, Partner and Fintech Practice Lead at Draper Esprit added: &#8220;Climate Tech has grabbed a lot of attention recently, with good reason… Cervest&#8217;s pioneering approach to quantifying risk, in a way that was never before possible, means we can better understand the economics of the problem and bring real-world market solutions to bear.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buzzy US startup Pipe — which claims to be the “Nasdaq for revenue” — has just raised $250 million at a $2 billion valuation? The secret for the hype? It gives SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront, by &#8220;pairing them with investors on a marketplace that pays a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts&#8221;, as my colleague <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">Mary Ann Azevedo so eloquently put it</a>.</p>
<p>Virtually the same model is about to hit Europe in various guises, and the newest of the crop will be  <a href="https://www.weareuncapped.com/">Uncapped</a>, a London-based startup that plans to extend the model not just to SaaS companies but also to the booming sector of E-commerce.</p>
<p>It’s now raised an $80 million combined funding round of debt and equity to launch a suite of banking services tailored to the needs of this new wave of tech-driven companies. The round was led by Lakestar. Uncapped’s previous investors include All Iron Ventures, White Star Capital, Global Founders Capital, and Mouro Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company plans to use the cash to move into the banking space, with new products and services. Last year, the company began issuing Visa cards.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, Uncapped is positioned as an alternative to traditional debt financing and venture capital, providing companies with growth finance for a flat fee which goes down to 6%, and fast-released capital. Businesses repay the capital as they make revenue. There is no set repayment and no compounding interest, equity, or personal guarantees. There are even no credit checks or business plans required.</p>
<p>Uncapped arrives at an opportune moment. The pandemic has led to an e-commerce boom, but the sector requires much more capital than existing VCs can provide. Legacy banks don’t ‘get&#8217; new entrepreneurs. Neo Banks are trying to provide it, but can still be slow.</p>
<p>Piotr Pisarz, Co-Founder of Uncapped, said: “Digital companies are innovating and evolving faster than ever before, but their legacy banking providers are not keeping up with the pace. We want to help digital entrepreneurs with quick access to funding, insights that help their business grow, rewards they actually care about, and modern integrations that will save them time and money.”</p>
<p>“The reality is that legacy banks don’t really understand the needs of digital entrepreneurs, and their dated infrastructure is not up to the standards required to help their business grow. So it’s no surprise that 82% of business owners say they are unhappy with their bank,” Asher Ismail, Co-Founder of Uncapped, added.</p>
<p>Nicolas Brand, Partner at Lakestar, said: “The composition of our economies is changing, with digital native businesses contributing an ever-increasing share to overall GDP. Uncapped uses real-time data provided by its clients across APIs to offer bespoke credit and other novel banking services.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://whitestarcapital.com/">White Star Capital</a>, better known as a VC which, in its time, has backed the likes of Digg, launchrock, Meero, Summly, and Tier, among others, is moving into the hot world of crypto and blockchain with a new $50M Digital Asset Fund.</p>
<p>The special-vehicle fund will specialize in investing in crypto-networks and blockchain-enabled businesses and was previously going to be $30 million before raising more backing. Both Bpifrance and Ubisoft are among those institutions backing the new fund.</p>
<p>The fund will be run by New York-based General Partner Sep Alavi and supported by Principals Thomas Klocanas in New York and Sanjay Zimmermann in Toronto. The will deploy between $500,000 and $3.0 million in initial investments into 15-20 companies with a focus on North America and Europe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alavi said: “We are hyper-focused on this space and we expect to see further innovative use cases such as crypto credit, DeFi, NFTs, metaverses and more manifesting at an accelerated pace… With this fund, We are actively investing in crypto protocols, infrastructure, privacy, financial, gaming, and social use cases.”</p>
<p>The fund has already made six investments including; dfuse, Multis, Paraswap, Rally, Safello, a European crypto brokerage that went public on the Nasdaq First North stock exchange on May 12, and Ledn, a global digital asset savings, and credit platform.</p>
<p>Yoann Caujolle, managing director of Bpifrance said: &#8220;It’s critical that emerging crypto and blockchain-enabled startups receive investment from firms and professionals who have the experience and knowledge to help drive their businesses forward,” said “We’re pleased to partner with the Digital Asset Fund team for bringing their support and vision into the French and European blockchain and digital asset ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Over a call, Alavi told me: “White Star is investing across three funds, obviously our fund one, fund two, and in this new specialized Digital Asset Fund. Historically we&#8217;ve invested in enterprise and consumer businesses, we’ve not done any, any blockchain, but for two years ago we&#8217;ve been looking at this sector. And we believe that this merits its own dedicated vehicle. I&#8217;ve been personally been investing in blockchain the blockchain ecosystem since 2015 and bring your five-plus years of domain expertise and then I was able to build a team around this new fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are, we&#8217;re looking at the three main verticals in this sector. The protocol layer, the infrastructure layer, and the application layer. That&#8217;s the kind of high-level thesis. The protocol layer is where we invest in tokens, because it’s important to mention that the fund will also hold tokens as investments as well as equity. On top of that, we&#8217;re pretty much agnostic and opportunistic. We see great use cases in decentralized finance. We see some great use cases in the NFT space and have made investments there as well. As long as we&#8217;re true to those three verticals that I mentioned, we will capture great value there.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Car ownership has become pricey and untenable in many towns and cities in Europe: between congestion charges to reduce emissions, parking fees, and traffic, many consumers opt instead to use public transportation, two wheels, cabs or their own legs to get around. To add to that mix for longer journeys, today a startup that&#8217;s building a new take on car rental is announcing some funding to scale out its service.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.govirtuo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtuo</a>, a Paris-based startup that has built a very streamlined, all-digital approach for those who want to rent a car for a few days, or up to a few months, has picked up $96 million, money that it will be using to invest in its tech; to expand to more markets beyond France (12 cities including Paris), UK (London, Manchester and Edinburgh) and Spain (Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia); to add in a tier for business users; and to add more vehicles into the mix. The company currently has 150,000 active users, and grew 100% (2x) this last year, said co-founder Karim Kaddoura.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rise of the &#8216;staycation&#8217; boosted our business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we saw a surge in the average duration of a rental.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All-digital and streamlined in the case of Virtuo means exactly that: currently there are only two models to choose from outside of France &#8212; either a Mercedes Benz A-Class or a Mercedes GLA SUV &#8212; but there is no paperwork, with everything handled through an app, and you have the option of getting a car delivered to and picked up from you, meaning no lines in airports or hotel garages, and you get a virtual key to operate it.</p>
<p>The funding is coming in the form of a $60 million Series C and $36 million in asset financing. AXA Venture Partners, the strategic investment arm of the insurance giant, led the equity round, with new investors Bpifrance, Alpha Intelligence Capital and H14; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/virtuo-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous backers</a> Balderton Capital, Iris Capital and Raise Ventures, also participating. Natixis, members of Banque Populaire and Caisse d&#8217;Epargne Group handled the asset financing.</p>
<p>While companies like Zipcar, Getaround or Turo (which has, interestingly acquired Virtuo as a Google search, and even writes &#8220;Virtuo&#8221; on its search resultshave made it easy to rent cars for a day or as little as a few hours in cities, Virtuo provides a modern take on the more traditional use case for renting cars: when you need a vehicle for longer journeys that can take up to several days, and specifically in the case of Virtuo between one and 90 days.</p>
<p>As Kaddoura &#8212; who co-founded Virtuo with Thibault Chassagne &#8212; notes, traditional car rental companies serving that market are typically still pretty rigid with how they do things.</p>
<p>Even if you initiate a process online, there is usually still paperwork that needs to be filled out in person; and you need to go to a rental hub &#8212; in an airport or a hotel, but not necessarily in your neighborhood &#8212; to pick up the car. The process for checking them out and in can also be tedious and the costs for all of this quite high, with many moments where the rental company might upsell you to make a basic price suddenly quite premium.</p>
<p>&#8220;The car rental industry itself is huge but consumers in it are completely underserved,&#8221; Kaddoura said.</p>
<p>And on the other side of the equation, there is a growing case for not owning a car if you live in a city or large town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our aha-moment was when we looked into the numbers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In Paris, there are 700,000 cars parked in the streets, with twice that in London. The average European spends €7,500 per car per year when you calculate parking, insurance, damage, taxes, and the price of the car averaged out. That&#8217;s €5 billion spent by Parisians, yet those cars are idle 95% of the time. Forget the financial part and look at the impact cars have on our lives and livelihoods, occupying 50% of our urban space.&#8221; It&#8217;s all the more ironic, Kaddoura noted, given that his father is a car dealer who completely expected his son to go into business with him one day.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s partly because of this environmental angle that Virtuo is also going to be expanding its fleet to include more electric vehicles: it already inludes Hyundai&#8217;s Kona Electric vehicles in its fleets in France, and the plan is to expand to have 50% of its fleet electrified by 2025, with 100% of it covered by electric vehicles by 2030. It also has been offsetting 100% of its carbon footprint since January of this year.</p>
<p>The funding round being announced today comes after what has been a challenging period for any company with a business model predicated on people leaving their homes to do things, not least to do things in spaces others have recently occupied. That is to say, Covid-19 has encourage people to stay home and socially distance, so a car rental &#8212; which encourages travel and specifically travel in a vehicle someone else has been in &#8212; may be a challenging sell.</p>
<p>Although revenues grew in 2020, it&#8217;s perhaps partly because of the bigger market conditions that Virtuo somewhat slowed down its roll. When we covered its last round of funding, in 2019, the company said the money would be used to expand to Spain and Germany, and more markets in the UK, that year, and it was also live in Belgium. Now, Kaddoura confirms that now Germany will only be coming online in 2022. Milan will be as soon as later this month, he said, with the bigger plan being to be live in 10 countries by 2025. (And Belgium is no longer online, it seems.)</p>
<p>Added to its own scaling ambitions, however, the opportunity that Virtuo is targeting is not one that others have ignored. In addition to others like Getaround (which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got a big round</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/uks-drover-raises-26m-for-to-take-its-car-subscription-marketplace-to-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drover</a> out of the UK, Zipcar and Turo providing more streamlined rental and car-sharing experiences, recently Uber also <a href="https://www.cartrawler.com/ct/company-news/cartrawler-partners-with-uber-to-expand-car-rentals-with-uber-rent-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded a car rental offering in partnership</a> with a third party called CarTrawler. This is not a fully integrated service like Virtuo&#8217;s, nor a peer-to-peer offering like Getaround, but something that appears to aggregate and search across the same traditional car rental companies that Virtuo is competing against. That makes it, potentially, a direct competitor.</p>
<p>“We are very proud and excited to be part of the Virtuo adventure alongside the Virtuo team, led by Karim and Thibault,” said Benoit Fosseprez, general partner at AXA Venture Partners, in a statement. “Virtuo has quickly become a tech leader disrupting the car rental space, with a clear long-term vision and strong ambitions for growth into new markets. We have been impressed by the Virtuo team and look forward to working closely together on the next stages of their development. With this investment in Virtuo, the first for our Growth II fund, we are confirming our ambition in the tech-led high growth companies segment.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted to support Virtuo in its development,&#8221; said Caroline Lebel of Bpifrance&#8217;s Large Venture fund, in a separate statement. &#8220;The company offers a true alternative to owning private cars for city dwellers who wish to use more sustainable shared mobility solutions. Born in the digital era, Virtuo’s 100% digital experience is backed by powerful technology and artificial intelligence to optimize its operations. We are convinced that the mobility of tomorrow must be built with strong technology at its core, addressing new behaviors and with the freedom of choice of a multimodal offer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The real estate market in South Korea is very fragmented, which means people often have to work with dozens of brokers before they find a new home. Founded in 2020 by a former WeWork executive, <a href="https://www.dongnae.com/">Dongnae</a> wants to create a centralized base for brokers, serving as a multiple listing system (MLS). Since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/dongnae-raises-4-1-million-to-digitize-real-estate-in-south-korea/">first seed round</a> last year, Dongnae has increased its brokerage partners to more than 70. Today the startup announced it has raised a seed extension of $4.1 million, doubling its total raised to $8.2 million.</p>
<p>The new funding was led by investment fund NFX, with participation from returning investors Flybridge and MetaProp, who led Dongnae’s first seed round. NFX general partner Pete Flint, who co-founded Trulia and is a former Zillow board member, will join Dongnae’s board. The startup’s other investors include Goodwater Capital, Maple VC and strategic angel investors in South Korea and the United States.</p>
<p>“It’s an exciting time of growth at our company, and we want to make sure that we are executing our go-to-market plan,” founder Matthew Shampine, who formerly ran WeWork Asia, told TechCrunch about the seed extension. “Pete Flint and [principal] Brittany Yoon at NFX bring an amazing combination of real estate expertise and Korean startup experience that will be invaluable to Dongnae.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Dongnae also announced the release of its Android app today. The company’s Android and iOS apps let potential renters and buyers look at listings and book tours of properties in the Seoul metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Shampine said that Dongnae now has more than 8,000 listings. Since its last funding announcement five months ago, Dongnae has increased its closed deal volume by more than 65% and revenue by 150%.</p>
<p>Shampine added that the new funding will be used to grow Dongnae’s brokerage network across the Seoul metropolitan area, which accounts for almost half of South Korea’s population, and the development of its technology and brokerage teams.</p>
<p>“At the time of our seed funding, we had just launched our brokerage partner program so we actually had one partner. The name of our first partner is Global Real Estate, based in Yongsan, and they were actually the brokerage that helped me find my personal apartment around the time we started Dongnae,” said Shampine. “They’ve been a wonderful and patient partner as our organization has grown this year, and we’ve already worked together to help a number of our customers find great homes.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Flint said, “The executive team at Dongnae is uniquely qualified considering their global backgrounds and deep local real estate expertise, and I believe the timing is perfect for Dongnae and the market need they are addressing in Korea.”</p>
