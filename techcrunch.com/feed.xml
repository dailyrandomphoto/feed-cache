										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global Covid-19 pandemic had a chilling effect on a number of industries and their workforces, resulting in mass furloughs and layoffs. But now, with countries now taking steps back to &#8220;normal&#8221;, that has been leading, in many cases, back to a hiring surge. Today, <a href="https://www.smartrecruiters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SmartRecruiters</a>, one of the companies that has built software to handle that process more smoothly, is announcing $110 million in funding to seize the moment.</p>
<p>The funding, a Series E, is coming in at a $1.5 billion valuation, the company confirmed. Silver Lake Waterman is leading this round, with previous backers Insight Partners, and Mayfield Fund also participating.</p>
<p>The investment will be used in two areas. First, SmartRecruiters plans to continue expanding business &#8212; its primary customers are large enterprises with Visa, Square, McDonald’s, Ubisoft, FireEye, Biogen, Equinox and Public Storage among them, and the plan will be to bring on more of these globally. Jerome Ternynck, SmartRecruiters&#8217; CEO and founder, pointed out that one of its clients made a move recently in which it had to swiftly ramp up by 10,000 people in 90 days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That is the scale of the great rehire that we are aiming to serve,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>And second, it plans to hire and invest more in product. Specifically, Ternynck said the company is looking to build more intelligence into its platform, so that it can help customers find ideal matches for roles and provide them with tools to automate and reduce the busy work of managing a recruitment process.</p>
<p>This is a notable area for growth, and one that smaller startups have also identified and are building to fix: just yesterday, one of them, Dover, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/dover-raises-20m-to-bring-the-concept-of-orchestration-to-recruitment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a Series A</a>.</p>
<p>Ternynck likes to describe SmartRecruiters as &#8220;the Salesforce of recruiting&#8221;, by which he means that it provides a system of record for large enterprises who can manage 100% of the process of recruitment, from sourcing candidates to hire.</p>
<p>&#8220;In recruiting tech, we are the mothership,&#8221; he said, with some 600 vendors integrated into its platform &#8212; a mark of how fragmented the wider industry really is.</p>
<p>(Salesforce, incidentally, is an investor in SmartRecruiters, and while right now it&#8217;s not directly working with its portfolio company to build recruitment into what it operates as essentially a massive CRM behemoth, it&#8217;s an interesting prospect and seems like a no-brainer that it might try to some day. Ternynck would not comment&#8230;)</p>
<p>There are already a lot of application tracking systems in the market that can handle the basics of logging candidates and managing their progress through the screening, interview, references, and hiring/rejection cycle &#8212; Ternynck, in fact <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerometernynck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded and sold</a> one of the pioneers in that space, But the problem with these is that they are limited and often work within their own silos. He refers to these ATS systems as &#8220;the first generation&#8221; of recruitment software, a generation that is now getting replaced.</p>
<p>There are some big changes driving that evolution, and specifically SmartRecruiters&#8217; growth. One key area is the bigger shift in &#8220;digital transformation&#8221;, precipitated by the pandemic but also a bigger shift to cloud-based computing and evolutions in big data management. Fragmentation is rife in recruiting, but we now are equipped in the world of IT with many, many ways of navigating that and using the wide amount of information out there to our advantage.</p>
<p>But there is another, more epistemological shift, too. Recruitment, and talent in general, has become a critical part of how a company conceives of its future success. Get the right people on board and you will grow. Fail to hire correctly and you will not, and you might even fail.</p>
<p>&#8220;This round and our progression signals the fact that CEOs have been forced to care more about recruiting,&#8221; he said. They want want to hire the best, he added, but that is fundamentally different from how recruiting has traditionally been approached, which is focused on cost per hire.</p>
<p>&#8220;This means recruiting is coming out of the administration function and into value add and sales and marketing,&#8221; he added. (That&#8217;s another interesting parallel with Dover which has gone so far as to conceive of its recruitment approach as &#8220;orchestration&#8221;, a word more commonly associated with sales software.)</p>
<p>The pandemic has had an impact here, too: employees and &#8220;hires&#8221; today are not what they used to be. It has become more acceptable to work remotely, and what people have come to expect out of jobs, and what roles they are coming from when applying, are all so different, and that also demands a different kind of platform to engage with them.</p>
<p>Indeed, that bigger area &#8212; sometimes referred to as &#8220;the future of work&#8221; &#8212; is part of what attracted this investment.</p>
<p>“Hiring talent and building human capital is more complex and important than ever, and SmartRecruiters is well positioned to help companies attract and land top talent,” said Shawn O’Neill, Managing Director and Group Head, Silver Lake Waterman, in a statement. “Their scale and customer growth are testament to their strong leadership and industry leading platform. We are excited to help fuel SmartRecruiters&#8217; next growth chapter.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ternynck noted that even despite the mass layoffs and furloughs experienced in some industries in the last year and a half, SmartRecruiters has seen business grow, even through some of the worst moments of Covid-19. Over the last 12 months, bookings have grown by 70%, he said. That&#8217;s a mark of how recruiting priorities are indeed changing, regardless of whether it&#8217;s a SmartRecruiters, or another kind of company entirely &#8212; and there are many, from Taleo and Cornerstone, through to smaller hopefuls like Dover, and even Salesforce &#8212; who might reap the spoils longer term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the modern world, we tend to like to know where our food comes from and this has massively influenced professional kitchens. For decades, food suppliers have sat on one side and distribution channels (restaurants and the like) on the other. But large wholesalers in the middle have traditionally crushed producers on prices and late payments. Professional kitchens can circumvent this by going direct to food producers.  But they can’t manage hundreds of direct relationships. It&#8217;s just not been possible. Until the Internet.</p>
<p><a href="http://collectivfood.com">Collective Food</a> is a new startup that addresses this with a new take on the food supply chain model. It directly sources products from suppliers, unlocking price advantages for both suppliers and buyers, it says. Its competitors include Brakes, Bidfood, and Transgourmet.</p>
<p>It’s now raised £12M / $16M in its Series A funding round led by VNV Global, along with VisVires New Protein (VVNP), Octopus Ventures, Norrsken VC, and existing investors, including  Partech, Colle Capital, and Mustard Seed. Frontline Ventures was the earliest investor in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Launched in 2019, Collectiv so far operates in the UK and France. It operates by sourcing food directly from producers, disintermediating the wholesaler middleman, and delivering straight to professional kitchens. Customers include restaurants, hotels, catering firms, meal-kit companies, and dark kitchens. The company claims that this approach generates 50% less CO2 emissions than traditional supply methods better prices, fresher products, transparency, traceability, and more reliable service.</p>
<p>Customers include Big Mamma Group, The Hush Collection, Dirty Bones, Megan’s, Crussh, Butchies, Cocotte, Tossed, and Fresh Fitness Food. </p>
<p>Collectiv founder Jeremy Hibbert-Garibaldi said in a statement: “We’re being pushed by a combination of strong tailwinds: end-consumers demanding a better understanding of provenance; cities implementing air pollution regulations that limit large freight; a post-Covid hospitality industry desperate to improve margins but with limited staff availability to facilitate this in-house. Combined with our innovative model, we’re able to set our sights on not only becoming a European leader in food distribution over the next few years, but even a global one.”</p>
<p>Björn von Sivers, Investment Manager at VNV Global, said: “Collectiv’s innovative managed marketplace connects a fragmented supply of producers with the very fragmented demand of professional kitchens, creating improved transparency amongst other clear network improvements for all stakeholders.”</p>
<p>In his former profession as a Forensic Accountant, Hibbert-Garibaldi came across the business model for Collective after he investigated one of the largest supermarket chains in the UK and their food wholesale leg, mainly for violations of codes of conduct, such as how they were behaving with their suppliers. “I quickly realized that food supply chains were broken, with too much opacity and malpractice, and at the end of the day not benefiting any sides of the marketplace,” he said.</p>
<p>Engrained with a passion for food from his French and Italian origins, he quit his job and spend months in restaurant kitchens to understand the problems they faced: “I wanted to understand why it was so hard for them to source good products, know exactly where their food was coming from, and receive these products reliably and sustainably whenever they needed them. Using this I built my case study to get out to investors and start the business.”</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if Collectiv can scale, or take a chunk out of the vast food supply chain industry, but if it ends up appealing both to suppliers and distributors it will be very interesting to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/carlyle-to-acquire-live-broadcasting-and-streaming-tech-outfit-liveu-for-over-400m-say-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report yesterday</a> of an impending sale of LiveU &#8212; one of the big developers of live streaming hardware and software, used by some 3,000 major media organizations &#8212; today the company and its buyer Carlyle <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/liveu-news/press-releases/303-20201/carlyle-to-acquire-liveu-to-further-accelerate-global-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed the deal</a>.</p>
<p>The seller is Francisco Partners, another PE firm that acquired LiveU just two years ago for <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/190602/p20#a190602p20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million</a>. LiveU and Carlyle are not disclosing the terms of this latest sale, but well-placed sources tell us it&#8217;s for over $400 million. Carlyle noted that equity for the investment will be provided by Carlyle Europe Technology Partners (CETP) IV, a fund that invests in middle market technology-focused opportunities in Europe and the U.S. LiveU is based out of Israel, and this is Carlyle&#8217;s first tech acquisition in the country.</p>
<p>LiveU&#8217;s valuation doubling over two years is partly a reflection of the state of media today. Specifically, video is the centerpiece of how content and information are consumed, and its presence is only growing, and so companies building tools to improve how it is captured and transmitted are hot.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another fillip to the video market has been the pandemic. LiveU will be used to record and transmit thousands of hours of events from the Tokyo Summer Games, which will be more reliant than ever on live video content given the absence of live audiences for a number of key events.</p>
<p>But it is also due to the fact that LiveU itself is growing and consolidating its position. Most recently, it <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/component/k2/303-20201/liveu-acquires-its-uk-channel-partner,-garland-partners-202103160749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired its channel partner in the UK market</a>, Garland Partners, to build more direct relationships and expand business with its clients in the region.</p>
<p>The company has built out a vertically integrated proposition, which includes not just cameras and other equipment for shooting video, but also encoding equipment to send it, and then hardware for receiving and using the material.</p>
<p>Alongside that, it also has built software to compress data &#8212; essential for being able to capture high-quality video yet still being able to transmit it &#8212; which works using a hybrid of different kinds of cellular, satellite and other networks.</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s a resourceful system, which can be used in a modular or all-in deployments, and that flexibility and reliability have led to it signing on some 3,000+ media organizations as customers, who have used it across a number of high-profile events (sporting events and big news events feature strongly) as well as for day-to-day video coverage.</p>
<p>While Francisco has made a relatively quick flip of LiveU as an asset, it sounds like Carlyle might have more strategic plans. The PE firm said it &#8220;will use its deep experience in the media tech sector to support LiveU’s growth ambitions.&#8221; The company already invests in adjacent companies like Disguise, NEP, The Foundry, Vubiquity, BTI Studios and The Mill. It also sounds like LiveU will be used to help the firm continue the consolidation play.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carlyle will seek to further consolidate LiveU’s market position through M&amp;A activity and organic growth while capitalizing on the rapidly growing demand for high-quality live video transmission,&#8221; LiveU noted in a statement, adding that this will also include helping forge more media partnerships. The growing ubiquity of 5G will accelerate that trend, it said.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to partner with Carlyle as we look to expand LiveU’s global footprint and service offering. This is a significant milestone for LiveU and represents a strong vote of confidence in our business,&#8221; said Samuel Wasserman, CEO and cofounder of LiveU, in a statement. &#8220;Carlyle brings deep industry expertise with their track record in the media and technology space alongside a global network. We greatly thank Francisco Partners and IGP Capital for their support and partnership over the last few years.”</p>
<p>“Carlyle has a history of investing in fast-growing and highly innovative, disruptive media technology companies and is truly excited to partner with LiveU which is at the forefront of a rapidly growing market,&#8221; added Michael Wand, MD and co-head of the CETP advisory team, in a statement. &#8220;Our partnership with the LiveU team will allow us to support their growth, driven by a mixture of expanding into new verticals, targeted M&amp;A activity and through further developing their relationships with key media broadcasters, particularly in live sports where we are witnessing an exploding demand for live content. We believe that the ongoing shift towards high quality real-time video content, the cost advantages of bonded cellular versus alternative transmission technologies, and the opportunity to bring live broadcast to hitherto neglected areas such as semi-pro or non-professional sports, provides an enormous growth potential for LiveU.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It took SoftBank several years, but the Japanese investment giant is now ready to bet on India’s food delivery market. Swiggy said on Tuesday it has closed a $1.25 billion financing round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Prosus Ventures.</p>
<p>The new financing round, a Series J, includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/indias-swiggy-nears-5-billion-valuation-in-new-800-million-fundraise/">the $800 million investment the Bangalore-based startup</a> had disclosed to employees earlier this year. (SoftBank alone invested $450 million in the new round.) The new round, which Swiggy says was “heavily oversubscribed,” gives the six-year-old food delivery startup a post-money valuation of $5.5 billion.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-500-million-in-swiggy/">first reported</a> about Swiggy’s engagement with SoftBank and the proposed valuation of $5.5 billion in mid-April. Qatar Investment Authority, Falcon Edge Capital, Amansa Capital, Goldman Sachs, Think Investments and Carmignac and existing investors Accel Partners and Wellington Management also participated in the new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Swiggy said the new financing round shows the turnaround it has demonstrated in the past few quarters. Like many other startups, Swiggy was severely hit with the pandemic. The startup said its recent bet to expand into grocery delivery, and pick-up and drop service has paid off. The value of orders it is processing now is 30% higher than those in the pre-Covid times, it said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Swiggy&#39;s performance this year, per Prosus Ventures. <a href="https://t.co/AqcKYQ8ml1">pic.twitter.com/AqcKYQ8ml1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Manish Singh (@refsrc) <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc/status/1341612973790412800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“The participation of some of the most visionary global investors is a huge vote of confidence in Swiggy’s mission and ability to build an enduring and iconic company out of India. The scope of food delivery in India is massive and over the next few years, we will continue to invest aggressively into growing this category,” said Sriharsha Majety, chief executive of Swiggy, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Our biggest investments will be in our non-food businesses that have witnessed tremendous consumer love and growth in a short span, especially in the past 15 months of the pandemic. I believe the next 10-15 years offer a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for companies like Swiggy as the Indian middle class expands and our target segment for convenience grows to 500 million users.”</p>
<p>The new investment comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record capital and a handful of mature firms are beginning to explore the public markets. Zomato, Swiggy’s chief rival in India, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">raised $1.3 billion in its initial public offering</a> last week and financial services startups Paytm and MobiKwik have also filed for their initial public offerings.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s food delivery market, which analysts at Bernstein expect to balloon to be worth $12 billion by 2022, they wrote in a report to clients earlier this year.</p>
<p>A third player, Amazon, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/amazon-expands-its-food-delivery-service-across-bangalore/">entered the food delivery market in India last year</a>, though its operations are still limited to parts of Bangalore. At a virtual conference ahead of the IPO last week, Zomato executives dismissed Amazon as a serious competitor for now. “There’s no major impact on market share from Amazon so far,” the company’s chief financial officer said.</p>
<p>For SoftBank, a regular fixture of the Indian startup ecosystem, this is the first time it has bet on a food delivery player. The Japanese conglomerate has backed Indian startups in multiple categories including e-commerce (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/flipkart-valued-at-37-6-billion-in-new-3-6-billion-fundraise/">Flipkart</a>, Snapdeal, Meesho, Lenskart, Firstcry), ride-hailing (Uber and Ola), and edtech (Unacademy). SoftBank has invested in several food delivery startups globally including DoorDash and Uber Eats. Prosus Ventures, an early investor in Swiggy, has also backed several food delivery startups globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;From its early days, I have had the privilege to watch Swiggy execute on their vision to become the leader in the convenience economy. Their focus on consumer delight, product innovation, and ecosystem support has made Swiggy a compelling digital experience in India. They have the railroads in place to empower multiple businesses to reach the new age consumer on a daily basis, and food delivery is just the beginning,” said Sumer Juneja, Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement.</p>
<p>Swiggy said it will deploy the fresh funds to accelerate its &#8220;multi-year strategy&#8221; of growing its core food delivery business and building new food and non-food adjacencies this year and beyond.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Choco is digitizing the food supply chain as the United States estimates of the food produced here approximately 40% is wasted.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The United States estimates of the food produced here <a href="https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs">approximately 40% is wasted</a>. Globally, $2.6 trillion annually is lost.</p>
<p>Berlin-based <a href="http://choco.com/">Choco</a>, which has built ordering software for restaurants and their suppliers, is working to digitize the food supply chain and announced $100 million in Series B funding, led by Left Lane Capital, to give it a $600 million post-market valuation. Joining in is new investor Insight Partners and existing investors Coatue Management and Bessemer Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The new round comes just over a year after Choco’s $63.7 million Series A, raised at two different periods, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/choco-raises-33-5m-to-bring-restaurants-and-suppliers-a-modern-ingredient-ordering-platform/">$33.5 million round</a> in 2019 and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/choco-gobbles-up-30-2m-at-a-250m-valuation-tweaks-restaurant-supplier-ordering-platform-to-sell-to-consumers-during-pandemic/">$30.2 million round</a> in 2020 — at a $230 million valuation — to bring total funding to $171.5 million since the company was founded in 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s core food procurement technology digitizes ordering workflow and communications for restaurants and suppliers. During the global pandemic, Khachab said Choco became the go-to tool for operators to be more efficient around procurement processes and reducing expenses as they adapted to the changing market conditions.</p>
<p>With the food industry a $6 trillion market, Choco CEO Daniel Khachab told TechCrunch he aims to make the food supply chain more transparent and sustainable in order to help increase margins in the food service sector and combat climate change.</p>
<p>The company did 14 months of food waste research and found that it was central to a lot of other global problems: Food waste is the third-largest driver of climate change and is causing deforestation — as evident by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55130304">news from the Amazon</a> last year  — and the extinction of animals.</p>
<p>“It makes sense to try and solve it,” he added. “The food system is highly fragile, and what was shown in the first and second waves of the pandemic is how fragile and inflexible it was. It made the industry realize that it has to step up and that it can’t continue to work on pen and paper.”</p>
<p>Between the farmer and the end point, there are some nine parties involved, Khachab said. None are connected to another, which often means nine data silos and data not collected along the chain. It is important to connect them on one single platform so decision-making can be data-driven, he added.</p>
<p>As uncertainty swept across the food industry at the beginning of the pandemic, Khachab said Choco could either lay low and wait or invest in the company. He chose the latter, pumping up the team, regions and technology. As a result, Choco’s technology is stronger than it was 15 months ago and proved to be flexible amid the inflexible environment.</p>
<p>Choco saw orders quadruple on the platform in the past year, and gross merchandise value grew to $900 million annualized, up from $230 million, Khachab said.</p>
<p>As the company continues to learn how it can provide value to the food supply chain, half of the Series B funding will go into technology development. It will also go toward doubling its headcount, especially on the engineering side. Choco recently brought on ex-Uber and Facebook executive Vikas Gupta as chief technology officer, and Khachab said Gupta’s expertise will enable the company “to build the best technology team in Europe” and scale faster.</p>
<p>Choco is already operating in six markets, including the United States, Germany, France, Spain, Austria and Belgium. Khachab expects to expand in those markets and gain a footprint in new markets like Latin America, the Middle East and Asia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube has acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/7-month-old-simsim-secures-16m-for-its-social-commerce-in-india/">social commerce startup Simsim</a>, the Google-owned firm said on Tuesday. Neither of the firms disclosed the terms of the deal, but two people with knowledge of the matter told TechCrunch the Indian startup was valued at over $70 million.</p>
<p>Two-year-old Simsim had raised about $17 million prior to today&#8217;s announcement and was valued at $50.1 million in its 2020 Series B financing round.</p>
<p>The Gurgaon-headquartered startup helps small businesses in India transition to e-commerce by using the power of video and creators. The startup&#8217;s eponymous app acts as a platform to connect local businesses, influencers and customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The thesis, according to Rohan Malhotra of Good Capital, an early backer of Simsim, is: &#8220;micro-influencers are more effective at building a targeted audience (growth), creating entertaining experiences (retention), building trust (higher value) and personalising messaging (conversion). Consumer social platforms (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, etc.) cannot meaningfully monetise via advertising-financed models in India; this unlocks the opportunity for more deeply integrated transactional platforms. New internet users in India need an interactive seller-led experience to replicate the offline e-commerce experience this market is used to.&#8221;</p>
<p>He, like everyone else, declined to comment on the size of the deal. The Simsim chief executive didn&#8217;t respond to a query about the acquisition Monday evening (IST).</p>
<p>“We started Simsim with the mission of helping users across India shop online with ease, enabled through small sellers and brands showcasing and selling their products using the power of content by trusted influencers. Being a part of the YouTube and Google ecosystem furthers simsim in its mission,&#8221; Simsim cofounders Amit Bagaria, Kunal Suri and Saurabh Vashishtha said in a joint statement. Bagaria and Vashishtha previously worked together at Paytm.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot think of a better ecosystem in which to build simsim, in terms of technology, reach, creator networks and culture. We can’t wait to be part of YouTube and are excited to build simsim within the most admired tech company in the world.”</p>
<p>For YouTube, the acquisition will enable the video streaming giant help small businesses and retailers in India reach new customers in even more powerful ways, wrote Gautam Anand, VP of YouTube APAC, <a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/07/helping-viewers-discover-and-buy.html">in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The video streaming service, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">reaches over 450 million monthly active users in India</a>, doesn&#8217;t plan to make any immediate changes to Simsim and the startup&#8217;s app will continue to operate independently &#8220;while we work on ways to showcase Simsim offers to YouTube viewers,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement is Google&#8217;s latest push in India, where it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">committed to invest $10 billion in the next couple of years</a>. The internet giant has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">backed Indian startups Glance and DailyHunt</a>, both of which operate short-video apps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;With over 2500 YouTube creators with over one million subscribers, and the success of <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a>, which we launched in India first, we’re committed to bringing the best of YouTube to India and growing the creator community by making it even easier for the new generation of mobile-first creators to get started,&#8221; he added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the city survey of Bielefeld, Germany, part of our ongoing survey into European cities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome to the city survey of Bielefeld, Germany, part of our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">ongoing survey into European cities</a>. If you&#8217;d like your city featured, just fill in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">this form</a> and add your city name. Once we have enough entries from a city, we will put your city on TechCrunch!</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.westfalen-blatt.de/Ueberregional/Nachrichten/Wirtschaft/4099368-Bereits-80-Gruenderfirmen-in-OWL-Risikokapital-und-Foerdergelder-helfen-Start-ups-sammeln-Milliarden-ein">local media reports</a>, Bielefeld’s has experienced a tech boom in recent years, with accelerators like the local <a href="http://foundersfoundation.de/">Founders Foundation</a> (backed by the Bertelsmann Foundation) and <a href="https://www.tecup.de/garage33/">Garage 33</a> (at the University of Paderborn) attracting a new wave of young company founders to the East Westphalia-Lippe region.</p>
<p>Notable startups to emerge include Semalytix, Valuedesk, Zahnarzt-Helden, StudyHelp, PartWorks and AMendate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Bielefeld suffers from the same ailment the rest of Germany is subject to: Most startups gravitate to Berlin, followed by Munich, then Hamburg (according to an initiative from <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/it-medien/gruenderszene-berlin-und-muenchen-sind-die-hochburgen-der-ki-start-ups-doch-diese-konzentration-ist-gefaehrlich/22710288.html?ticket=ST-6398724-J4XeeD4ErjqFE95MScfA-ap6">UnternehmerTUM</a> in Munich).</p>
<p>However, as Business Punk magazine <a href="https://www.business-punk.com/2021/03/vorbild-israel-wie-ostwestfalen-lippe-zum-gruenderinnen-hotspot-wurde/">found</a> earlier this year, the Ostwestfalen-Lippe region in northern North Rhine-Westphalia is home to some of Germany’s biggest companies. That means startups aiding large organizations to digitize post-pandemic have ready access to some of Germany’s largest companies and institutions.</p>
<p>Our survey respondents pointed out that the region is strong in sectors such as B2B because of the many old-school B2B companies in the manufacturing area. There is fairly ready access to many large family offices such as Dr. Oetker, Miele, CLAAS, Schüco and Bertelsmann, so there is a lot of capital available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The region has a good momentum for startups in general, [largely] because of Founders Foundation. At the same time, them being the only institutional driver leads to a certain monoculture,” said one.</p>
<p>Deep tech technologies are a feature of the ecosystem, but there are “almost no B2C or direct-to-consumer” startups, said another respondent.</p>
<p>Commenting on the investment scene in the city, survey respondents said investors have &#8220;strong bonds to the industry and Mittelstand.&#8221; However, another commented that there are &#8220;only very few local investors with NRW or OWL focus like EnjoyVenture (Technologiefonds OWL), but not much more.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, companies get decent attention from &#8220;national&#8221; investors, and Founders Foundation has really boosted the scene in the region. Angels are also becoming more active, and &#8220;there is a strong business angel community in Bielefeld who have been really supportive of the new startup scene.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Which sectors is Bielefeld&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
We are strong in the cryptotrading ecosystem. We are most excited by the adoption of Bitcoin as a financial asset by corporates and institutions as well as the ongoing network effect and adoption by the masses. We need to add support for DeFi trading venues alongside the centralized exchanges we already support.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Semalytix, Zahnarzt-Helden, Coindex and Valuedesk.</p>
<p><strong>What is the tech investment scene like in Bielefeld? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Since <a href="https://foundersfoundation.de/">Founders Foundation</a> started in Bielefeld in 2016 the startup scene has exploded. We joined the first accelerator and since then 24 startups have been founded and come through its programs. There is a strong business angel community in Bielefeld that has been really supportive of the new startup scene.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think will people stay in Bielefeld, move out, or will people move in?</strong><br />
We switched completely to home office once the pandemic got underway. For us, it has worked really well and we now have three employees who work outside of Bielefeld. Everything is more flexible now.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?</strong><br />
Sebastian Borek (CEO of the Founders Foundation), Eduard R. Doerrenberg (managing director, Dr. Wolff Group).</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think Bielefeld’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
As Bielefeld is in the heart of the German &#8220;Mittelstand&#8221;, there are huge opportunities for tech startups to help these large industries take a leap forward with technical solutions using AI, blockchain and other technologies. The city is well served by Bielefeld University, which turns out highly qualified CS graduates every year. Especially with the superb backing of the Founders Foundation, the startup ecosystem in Bielefeld has a bright future.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Louis Schulze, ecosystem development manager, Founders Foundation</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bielefeld&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 19, 2021. In the old days, venture capital had seasons. VCs didn’t work in December, and the July-August period could be a bit hazy. Such variations have declined. Deal-making, it turns out, is now pretty much the theme for all seasons. Evidence? Just read what’s below! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/colombian-on-demand-delivery-startup-rappi-raises-over-500m-at-a-5-25b-valuation/">Rappi raises $500M:</a> </strong>The on-demand economy is still hot around the world, something we can know for sure thanks to Rappi’s latest half-billion-dollar raise. The Colombian delivery company is now worth $5.25 billion. That’s a lot of money. Per Crunchbase data, the unicorn has now raised more than $2 billion since inception. Rappi operates in nine countries and 250 cities across Latin America.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/18/zoom-buys-cloud-call-center-firm-five9-for-14-7-billion/">Zoom buys Five9:</a> </strong>Well, the deal got announced at least. It won’t close until next year. But the $14.7 billion transaction has folks talking. It’s a large amount of money, and it’s the combination of two public companies. Both companies, of course, are formerly venture-backed companies, and the deal could help set some pricing notes for other software M&amp;A. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/the-zoom-five9-deal-is-a-big-bet-for-the-video-conferencing-company/">has a look at the price of the deal here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Robinhood and Duolingo set prices for their IPOs:</strong> If you are into watching the biggest tech companies go public, you are in luck.

<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/switch-raises-20m-for-a-personalized-engagement-system-designed-to-boost-health-outcomes/">Sweetch raises $20M to help you get off your backside:</a> </strong>If you wear a smartwatch, you’ve gotten notifications from it at the wrong time. A nudge to get up and move, say, when you are seated at a restaurant. Sweetch wants to provide smarter inducements for folks to take better care of themselves, framing it as a way to “outsmart chronic conditions.” Given how much we could all do better at health, I am curious about how this startup performs.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/dover-raises-20m-to-bring-the-concept-of-orchestration-to-recruitment/"><strong>Dover raises $20M to make recruiting more organized:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Recruiting is not a great process. Mostly it’s done by hand, and managed in spreadsheets, or perhaps a system like Lever. But startups think that there is more room for improvement. Dover is one such company, hoping that its software that helps recruiters “juggle and aggregate multiple candidate pools to source suitable job candidates automatically, and then manage the process of outreach” is just the ticket. And now it has raised from Tiger.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/breakr-raises-4-2m-to-connect-influencers-with-emerging-musicians/"><strong>Breakr wants to connect musicians and influencers:</strong></a> The days when radio play was the way to break into the mainstream are firmly behind us. Startups like Breakr want to help musical artists navigate the new world by connecting them to folks with their own audiences. Along the way, Breakr will take a 10% cut of fees generated from linking the two parties.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/recapped-lands-6-million-for-collaborative-sales-software-that-gets-the-customer-in-the-mix/"><strong>Recapped raises $6.3M for better sales software:</strong></a> Akin to how Dover wants to help make recruiting a smoother process, Recapped wants to improve the sales process, namely by building software that provides greater visibility into sales pipelines and by providing buyers with a similar digital interface that it provides to sales folks. Anything to make buying stuff less awful, please!</li>

Jones just raised $12.5 million to help CME folks “find and hire the people they need in a compliant way.”</li>

<h2>Founders: How well do you really understand seed-stage financing?</h2>
<p>A famous poem advises us not to compare ourselves with others, &#8220;for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same holds true for startup fundraising; the size of your seed round will be determined solely by your company&#8217;s immediate needs and the investors you&#8217;re working with.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember that fundraising is not the goal,&#8221; says three-time YC alum Yin Wu. &#8220;Building a successful business is.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you are an early-stage founder who&#8217;s seeking clarity about apportioning equity — or if you&#8217;re biting your nails over how much to raise — read this primer. It&#8217;s also a useful overview for early employees and co-founders who may be new to startup financing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM will add a full-size electric pickup truck to its GMC lineup, the latest in a string of EV product announcements by the automaker in the past year as it pushes to deliver more than 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025.</p>
<p>The EV pickup was shared in a slide deck during the media presentation and later confirmed to TechCrunch. Duncan Aldred, vice president of global Buick and GMC, didn&#8217;t provide further details about the vehicle or when it might go into production.</p>
<p>The GM brand is already aiming to begin production of its GMC Hummer EV in the fourth quarter of this year. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/gmc-reveals-the-hummer-ev-1000-hp-350-mile-range-and-0-60-in-around-3-seconds/">GMC Hummer EV</a>, which will be produced at the company&#8217;s Factory ZERO assembly plant in Detroit and Hamtramck, with a 350-mile range, 1,000 HP and up to 11,500 pound feet of torque with a starting price of $80,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The announcement comes three months after GM announced it would produce an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/gm-to-build-an-electric-chevrolet-silverado-pickup-with-more-than-400-miles-of-range/">electric Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck</a>, which will also be assembled at the Factory ZERO plant. The Chevrolet Silverado EV pickup will be based on the automaker&#8217;s Ultium battery platform and will have an estimated range of more than 400 miles on a full charge.</p>
<p>GM President Mark Reuss said at the time that the company is positioning the Chevrolet full-sized pickup for both consumer and commercial markets. The automaker plans to offer retail and fleet versions of the Silverado electric pickup with a variety of options and configurations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the weekend, an international consortium of news outlets reported that several authoritarian governments — including Mexico, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates — used spyware developed by NSO Group to hack into the phones of thousands of their most vocal critics, including journalists, activists, politicians and business executives.</p>
<p>A leaked list of 50,000 phone numbers of potential surveillance targets was obtained by Paris-based journalism nonprofit <a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/case/the-pegasus-project/">Forbidden Stories</a> and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/07/the-pegasus-project/">Amnesty International</a> and shared with the reporting consortium, including The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/">Washington Post</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/revealed-leak-uncovers-global-abuse-of-cyber-surveillance-weapon-nso-group-pegasus">The Guardian</a>. Researchers analyzed the phones of dozens of victims to confirm they were targeted by the NSO&#8217;s Pegasus spyware, which can access all of the data on a person&#8217;s phone. The reports also confirm new details of the government customers themselves, which NSO Group closely guards. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/18/hungary-orban-spyware/">Hungary</a>, a member of the European Union where privacy from surveillance is supposed to be a fundamental right for its 500 million residents, is named as an NSO customer.</p>
<p>The reporting shows for the first time how many individuals are likely targets of NSO&#8217;s intrusive device-level surveillance. Previous reporting had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/03/digital-violence-nso-group-spyware/">put the number of known victims</a> in the hundreds or more than a thousand.</p>
<p>NSO Group sharply rejected the claims. NSO has long said that it doesn&#8217;t know who its customers target, which it reiterated in a statement to TechCrunch on Monday.</p>
<p>Researchers at Amnesty, whose work was reviewed by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, found that NSO can deliver Pegasus by sending a victim a link which when opened infects the phone, or silently and without any interaction at all through a &#8220;zero-click&#8221; exploit, which takes advantage of vulnerabilities in the iPhone&#8217;s software. Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak said <a href="https://twitter.com/billmarczak/status/1416801514685796352?s=20">in a tweet</a> that NSO&#8217;s zero-clicks worked on iOS 14.6, which until today was the most up-to-date version.</p>
<p>Amnesty&#8217;s researchers showed their work by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/">publishing meticulously detailed technical notes</a> and a toolkit that they said may help others identify if their phones have been targeted by Pegasus.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt">Mobile Verification Toolkit</a>, or MVT, works on both iPhones and Android devices, but slightly differently. Amnesty said that more forensic traces were found on iPhones than Android devices, which makes it easier to detect on iPhones. MVT will let you take an entire iPhone backup (or a full system dump if you jailbreak your phone) and feed in for any indicators of compromise (IOCs) known to be used by NSO to deliver Pegasus, such as domain names used in NSO&#8217;s infrastructure that might be sent by text message or email. If you have an encrypted iPhone backup, you can also use MVT to decrypt your backup without having to make a whole new copy.</p>

	</p>
<p>The toolkit works on the command line, so it&#8217;s not a refined and polished user experience and requires some basic knowledge of how to navigate the terminal. We got it working in about 10 minutes, plus the time to create a fresh backup of an iPhone, which you will want to do if you want to check up to the hour. To get the toolkit ready to scan your phone for signs of Pegasus, you&#8217;ll need to feed in Amnesty&#8217;s IOCs, which it <a href="https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations/tree/master/2021-07-18_nso">has on its GitHub page</a>. Any time the indicators of compromise file updates, download and use an up-to-date copy.</p>
<p>Once you set off the process, the toolkit <a href="https://mvt-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ios/backup/check.html">scans your iPhone backup file</a> for any evidence of compromise. The process took about a minute or two to run and <a href="https://mvt-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ios/records.html">spit out several files in a folder</a> with the results of the scan. If the toolkit finds a possible compromise, it will say so in the outputted files. In our case, we got one &#8220;detection,&#8221; which turned out to be a false positive and has been removed from the IOCs after we checked with the Amnesty researchers. A new scan using the updated IOCs returned no signs of compromise.</p>
<p>Given it&#8217;s more difficult to detect an Android infection, MVT takes a similar but simpler approach by scanning your Android device backup for text messages with links to domains known to be used by NSO. The toolkit also lets you scan for potentially malicious applications installed on your device.</p>
<p>The toolkit is — as command line tools go — relatively simple to use, though the project is open source so it won&#8217;t be long before someone will surely build a user interface for it. The project&#8217;s <a href="https://mvt-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html">detailed documentation</a> will help you — as it did us.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A major attraction of Africa is its large population of 1.2 billion, which hints at a sizable addressable market. But what happens when your target audience is the governments of 54 countries?</p>
<p>In our situation, that was the case. We started <a href="https://www.domineum.io/">Domineum Blockchain Solutions</a> with the intention to help African governments solve problems with shipping and keeping records.</p>
<p>We knew it&#8217;d be hard work, but didn’t anticipate that getting our first customer would be the most difficult part.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			It’s typical when entering Africa to want to focus on the big and popular markets like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya. But what we’ve learned so far is that there’s a high probability that these countries might not be your first entry point. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Our first product was a cargo service that tracks shipment origin and movement and determines the contents of goods being imported or exported in any country. We built this to solve the problem of lost revenue due to shipments being passed through informal backdoor channels.</p>
<p>With our focus on sub-Saharan Africa, we approached four countries in 2019: our home country of Nigeria, plus Kenya, Gambia and Guinea-Conakry.</p>
<p>We started this conversation and didn’t get a substantial response from the four countries’ governments. They weren’t open to trying out our solution &#8212; it was new and they weren’t familiar with blockchain technology. Distraught, we decided to add a smaller country to our list: Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>The Freetown seaport, located in the country’s capital, is the main gateway for trade in and out of Sierra Leone, with 80% of trade passing through this port. The port has a long history as a trading hub and benefits from the country’s strategically important location midway between Europe and the Americas.</p>
<p>But Freetown isn’t one of the top ports in Africa or even sub-Saharan Africa; <a href="https://unctadstat.unctad.org/countryprofile/maritimeprofile/en-gb/694/index.html">a fraction of a percentage point</a> of the world’s trade shipment flows through its ports. The small African country, with about 0.1% of the world’s population, exports diamonds, cocoa and coffee and imports food, machinery and chemicals.</p>
<p>Notably, it faced big challenges in shipping these products in and out of the country. A Sierra Leonean supply chain manager <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2019/07/18/sierra-leone-trade-facilitation-improvements-are-starting-to-bear-fruit">described</a> this situation, “We used to face big challenges during the export process. There would be long delays at the port. Our trucks would arrive before midnight and could be stuck in queue for hours, even days. The documentation process was so complicated.”</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, Sierra Leone’s “trade challenges can be attributed to several factors: lack of access to trade information; high levels of physical inspections; multiple fees, licenses, permits and certificates; manual processes; and the lack of coordination among agencies.” Domineum set out to solve this.</p>
<p>Our initial conversations with the Sierra Leone government went well. Fortunately, Sierra had <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2019/07/18/sierra-leone-trade-facilitation-improvements-are-starting-to-bear-fruit">developed</a> a five-year plan (2018-2023), supported by the World Bank Group, to reduce the time and costs needed to move goods across its borders. The goal is to reduce trade costs by 10%. After three months of discussion, our cargo tracking system was implemented.</p>
<p>In late 2019, we started this partnership, and so far we’ve been able to capture $2 million in revenue that would have been lost. The business model is simple: We get a 40% commission out of extra revenue we’re able to capture for the Sierra Leone government via our cargo tracking system.</p>
<p>It’s typical when entering Africa to want to focus on the big and popular markets like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya. But what we’ve learned so far is that there’s a high probability that these countries might not be your first entry point. A business-to-government model is a difficult one. There’s a lot of politicking that goes into working with the government.</p>
<p>What we’ve seen work is to approach other countries and gain a foothold, then use that as validation that the concept works. With the success of Sierra Leone, we’re hoping to return to other countries and get a better reception.</p>
<p>The success of Sierra Leone got us rethinking the services we were offering. The initial conversation started with a cargo tracking service, but then we wondered if we should offer a different service to countries that said no at first.</p>
<p>We identified that land registration was a common problem in Africa. More than <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2013/07/22/securing-africa-s-land-for-shared-prosperity">90% of rural land</a> in Africa is undocumented and therefore vulnerable to land-grabbing. This hampers the growth of agriculture and other sectors because land is lost to other parties or taken forcefully by the government during times of conflict.</p>
<p>We returned to these countries, offering other services like land ownership registration via blockchain. We got a positive response from a state government in Nigeria to carry out a pilot program. We&#8217;re optimistic that once this pilot phase is over, we’ll be able to seal the next business deal.</p>
<p>What’s it like working with African governments? It&#8217;s a smaller addressable market. If you’re looking to pitch a product or service to governments in Africa, it’d be helpful to keep in mind that your first customer might be from a smaller country.</p>
<p>To seize other opportunities, we’ll keep looking to expand to other African countries with this mindset.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We are now seeing what growth will look like at Duolingo after its COVID-bump was digested.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Edtech giant Duolingo set an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001562088/000162828021013980/duolingos-1a1.htm">initial price range</a> for its impending IPO today. The unicorn expects to price in its public debut at $85 to $95 per share, selling 3,700,000 in the deal.</p>
<p>Another 1,406,113 shares are being sold by existing shareholders, and 765,916 shares are being offered to underwriting banks as part of the transaction. All told, the company may see 5,872,029 shares trade hands in its IPO, worth some $557,842,755. Duolingo itself can raise as much as $424,262,020 in gross proceeds at its current range, provided that its underwriting banks exercise their option.</p>
<p>The IPO is a material fundraising event for the company. Before its public offering, the largest single hit of capital that Duolingo raised was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/10/duolingo-raises-45-million-series-d-round-led-by-google-ventures-now-valued-at-470m/">$45 million Series D</a> from 2015.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into what Duolingo, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">we profiled in much more detail here</a>, is worth at its IPO price and peek at its preliminary second-quarter results. Our goal will be to understand its valuation in the context of its growth. From there, we’ll be able to draw some general conclusions about the larger edtech startup market.</p>
<h2>What’s it worth?</h2>
<p>After its IPO, Duolingo will have 35,892,152 shares outstanding, sans its underwriter’s option. At the lower and upper bounds of its simple IPO valuation, Duolingo is worth $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>As with every company going public, Duolingo’s IPO valuation rises if we include shares that have vested in RSU or options form, but have yet to be exercised. In the case of Duolingo, its share count rises to 43,776,271, per an initial TechCrunch analysis of the company’s RSU and options details provided in its S-1 filing. At that share count, Duolingo is worth $3.7 billion to $4.2 billion.</p>
<p>For every number provided, the company’s underwriter’s option adds modestly.</p>
<p>All valuations listed above are a premium over the company’s final private price set during its November 2020 Series H round of funding. That <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/language-learning-app-duolingo-confirms-it-has-raised-35m-on-a-2-4b-valuation/">$35 million round</a> valued the company at around $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>At first blush, then, the company’s IPO price range feels strong, regardless of whether we lean on simple or fully diluted share counts to come to a new price for the firm. But how do its new valuations stack against its recent revenue? Let’s find out.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">I&#8217;ve fundraised a lot. Tactically, fundraising is a skill like any other. You get better the more you do it. But practicing gets you nowhere if you don&#8217;t have a strong foundation in understanding a fundraising round&#8217;s core components.</p>
<p>As a founder, you will understand less than investors when it comes to fundraising. For investors, negotiating with founders is their full-time job. For founders, fundraising is just a small part of building a business. Understanding the basics of venture financing can help founders raise on better terms.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>How financing works: SAFEs versus equity rounds.</li>
<li>How much to raise.</li>
<li>How to arrive at your valuation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How financing works: SAFEs versus equity rounds</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As a founder, you will understand less than investors when it comes to fundraising.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Venture financing takes place in rounds. The first stage is the pre-seed or seed round, then a Series A, then a Series B, then a Series C and so on. You can continue to raise funding until the company is profitable, gets acquired or goes public.</p>
<p>We will focus here on seed-stage funding — your very first funding round.</p>
<h3>SAFEs</h3>
<p>Post-money SAFEs are the most common way to raise funding. These documents are used by Y Combinator, angel investors and most early-stage funds. You should raise on post-money SAFEs using <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/">standard documents</a> created by YC. Standard documents have consistent terms that have been drafted to be fair to both investors and founders.</p>
<p>By using the standard post-money SAFE, your negotiation can focus on the two terms that matter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Principal: The amount you want to raise per investor.</li>
<li>Valuation cap: The value of your business.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HaYIcD_rTIk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Blue Origin is set to launch its fully reusable New Shepard spacecraft with humans on board for the first time on Tuesday, and it&#8217;s sending Amazon founder and billionaire Jeff Bezos up along with his brother and two record-setting astronauts. The launch livestream above is scheduled for 6:30 a.m. CDT (7:30 a.m. EDT/4:30 a.m. PDT), with the actual liftoff targeted for 8 a.m. CDT (9 a.m. EDT/6 a.m. PDT).</p>
<p>The full flight profile includes a takeoff from Blue Origin&#8217;s remote West Texas facility, followed by an ascent to a height of roughly 62 miles above the Earth&#8217;s surface. Those on board, including Bezos, his brother Mark, 82-year-old Wally Funk and 18-year-old Oliver Daemen will then experience between three and four minutes of weightlessness inside the New Shepard capsule, before it returns to Earth slowed by parachutes for a touchdown in the West Texas desert and then a recovery by Blue Origin staff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is not significantly different in terms of timing or sequence from the 15 prior New Shepard flights that Blue Origin has flown, but this is the first one with humans on board (including the world&#8217;s richest), so it&#8217;s obviously the one to watch.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The rumors of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warnermedia-cnn-entertainment-cable-streaming-services-200009666.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">CNN streaming service</a> were true. The network has <a href="https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2021/07/19/cnn-to-debut-in-q1-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">unveiled</a> a CNN+ service that will offer a blend of live and on-demand shows that are &#8220;separate and distinct&#8221; from existing TV coverage. It will debut sometime in the first quarter of 2022. CNN hasn&#8217;t narrowed down the price, but lead executive Andrew Morse told <em>Variety</em> in an <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/inside-cnn-plus-a-first-look-at-the-new-streaming-service-exclusive-1235022517/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">interview</a> that there wouldn&#8217;t be an ad-supported tier at launch.</p>
<p>The centerpiece, as you&#8217;d expect, will be the live material. CNN+ plans to offer eight to 12 hours of in-depth topical coverage and &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; material every day, with both veterans and newcomers at the helm. You&#8217;ll also have chances to interact with anchors and experts in real-time discussions. This won&#8217;t be a digital replica of CNN&#8217;s usual news, then, but you may have reasons to tune in every day.</p>
<p>The on-demand catalog unsurprisingly taps into CNN&#8217;s existing collection, including shows like <em>Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown</em> and <em>United Shades of America</em>. There will be original shows and movies for the internet service, although CNN+ won&#8217;t reveal those until later in 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Officially, Morse said CNN+ wouldn&#8217;t be bundled or otherwise tie into HBO Max despite the WarnerMedia connection. <em>Variety</em> sources, however, claimed there was a &#8220;strong probability&#8221; the service would be bundled with HBO Max and Discovery+ after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-discovery-185439134.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="0">WarnerMedia and Discovery</a> finalize their merger.</p>
<p>Morse considered the CNN+ launch the largest the network has had since it started TV service in June 1980. It was also a chance to experiment with formats that blur distinctions between entertainment and news, the executive added.</p>
<p>The question, of course, is whether or not viewers will bite. CNN has had success with long-form content like the late Anthony Bourdain&#8217;s shows, but it&#8217;s not clear if people are ready to pay a monthly fee to see them. There&#8217;s also the matter of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-please-stop-making-streaming-services.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">streaming service overload</a> — you might not be thrilled to subscribe to yet another offering just to be sure you catch everything CNN has to offer.</p>

The company is more than doubling the number of service areas this week to north of 400 cities and towns. It now serves several major markets through the Uber and Uber Eats apps, including San Francisco, New York City and Washington DC.</p>
<p>The rapid expansion was partly fueled by a partnership with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-search-maps-covid-19-vaccines-pharmacies-160024114.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><ins>Albertsons Companies</ins></a> and its 1,200 grocery stores across the country. Albertsons owns brands including Safeway, Jewel-Osco, Acme, Tom Thumb and Randalls. Uber also offers delivery from regional chains such as Southeastern Grocers and New York’s Red Apple Group. Uber Pass and Eats Pass subscribers don&#8217;t need to pay delivery fees on grocery orders over $30.</p>
<p>Grocery delivery became an important component of Uber&#8217;s business during the toughest parts of the COVID-19 pandemic, because the number of rides people were taking dropped significantly.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Velodyne Lidar CEO Anand Gopalan is leaving the lidar company at the end of July as the sensor supplier continues to struggle with internal drama.</p>
<p>Gopalan, who was previously CTO, is leaving the top leadership position after about a year and a half on the job.</p>
<p>Velodyne said Monday in a statement that a team of top executives that includes COO Jim Barnhart, CFO Drew Hamer, Chief People Officer Kathy McBeath and Chief Commercial Officer Sinclair Vass will run the company as a search for a new chief executive is conducted. The company didn&#8217;t disclose why Gopalan was leaving.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gopalan&#8217;s resignation comes after months of internal drama and business setbacks for a company that has been considered the leading supplier of lidar, the light detection and ranging radar sensor that is considered a critical component to commercially deploy autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>The resignation is the latest in a series of issues that have cropped up since Velodyne Lidar struck a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/velodyne-becomes-latest-tech-company-to-go-public-using-a-spac-eschewing-the-traditional-ipo-path/"> deal to merge with special purpose acquisition company</a> Graf Industrial Corp. At the time, it was reported that <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Velodyne&#8217;s founder David Hall, along with backers Ford, Chinese search engine Baidu, Hyundai Mobis and Nikon Corp. would keep an 80% stake in the combined company. Hall became executive chairman and Gopalan remained in the CEO position.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Velodyne becomes latest tech company to go public using a SPAC, eschewing the traditional IPO path&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/velodyne-becomes-latest-tech-company-to-go-public-using-a-spac-eschewing-the-traditional-ipo-path/embed/#?secret=vxusAnFcdt" data-secret="vxusAnFcdt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Hall and his wife Marta Thoma Hall clashed with the SPAC that acquired Velodyne. In February, David Hall was <a href="https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-announces-changes-to-board-of-directors/">removed as chairman of the board</a> and Marta Thoma Hall lost her chief marketing officer position following an investigation by the board for &#8220;inappropriate behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ford, which had held almost 13.1 million shares — a value of about $244 million — in Velodyne at the close of the third quarter of 2020,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000110465921021932/tm213752d1_sc13ga.htm"> sold off its stake</a> by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Velodyne sensors had been used by Ford in its autonomous vehicle testing. The intention was that those would be the go-to sensor for its autonomous vehicles once they were deployed commercially.</p>
<p>Veoneer had even announced in 2019 that it was leveraging Velodyne&#8217;s technology for a contract to supply the sensor to Ford (and by extension its autonomous vehicle technology supplier Argo AI). But Veoneer reported in February that it had lost its contract.</p>
<p>Argo, which had acquired lidar company Princeton Lightwave, unveiled in May<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/argos-new-lidar-sensor-could-help-ford-vw-deploy-self-driving-vehicles-at-scale/"> details on a long-range lidar sensor</a> that it claims has the ability to see 400 meters away with high-resolution photorealistic quality and the ability to detect dark and distant objects with low reflectivity. With so much progress internally, Argo and Ford staked their future plans on its own lidar.</p>

<p>In a May letter, David Hall blamed the SPAC, specifically the SPAC-appointed members of the combined company&#8217;s board, for its poor financial performance and called for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453138/velodyne-david-hall-spac-letter-board-removal">resignation of Gopalan and two board members</a>.</p>
<p>As part of Velodyne&#8217;s announcement on Gopalan&#8217;s resignation, the company restated its business outlook for 2021 revenue, noting that its guidance of between $77 million and $94 million remains unchanged. Velodyne will report second quarter financial results August 5.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’ve just sat down to dinner and your wearable device reminds you to get up and get in your steps for the day. Maybe the app has a point, but odds are you’ll push the notification to the side. The founders of Sweetch, an Israeli company creating its own AI-driven behavior change app, are betting that if you got that notification in a different way, you’ll be more likely to take its advice.</p>
<p>Yossi Bahagon, the founder of Sweetch, describes the company’s approach to digital reminders as a mixture of artificial intelligence and emotional intelligence. The app will use AI to analyse “lifeprint” data picked up through a smartphone. Then it delivers messages to when you might be more likely to respond to them and in a “tone of voice” that encourages compliance.</p>
<p>For instance if you have meetings on Mondays between 12 and 3, but still want to get in some exercise, Sweetch won’t suggest getting a workout in during those times, or shame you for sitting through a meeting rather than getting a run in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It&#8217;s about ongoing hyperpersonalized engagement that increases the likelihood of the patient doing what [they need] to do,” says Bahagon.</p>
<p>On Monday, Sweetch announced a $20 million Series A round led by Entreé Capital. Other investors include Noaber, Kortex Ventures, Insurtech VC, Fin TLV Ventures and existing investors Philips, OurCrowd and Qure Ventures.</p>
<p>Bahagon is a family physician by training, but he’s spent the majority of his career in the digital health arena. In 2008 Bagahon founded the digital health division of Clalit Health Services, a nonprofit insurance and medical services provider that currently insures <a href="https://www.mor-research.com/clalit-at-a-glance/">60% of the Israeli population</a>. His previous company, Luminox Health, was acquired by Israeli investor platform OurCrowd in 2016, and Bahagon stayed on to manage the fund’s digital health arm.</p>
<p>Sweetch, which was founded in 2013, is yet another digital health venture for Bahagon — this time aimed at increased patient compliance. The app has already generated some interest and was one of five apps selected from over 400 to participate in the <a href="https://media.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-initiates-new-G4A-Digital-Health-Partnerships-Program">Bayer G4A program</a>, something like an accelerator developed by the pharmaceutical giant.</p>
<p>So far, Sweetch CEO Yoni Nevo says the app has “tens of thousands of users,” (the company would not provide a specific number).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s currently being used in patients with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and, in a bit of a departure from the rest: breast cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Sweetch isn’t designed for users to download at will on the app store (you can download it, but won’t get far without an access code); their go-to-market strategy is instead to partner with healthcare organizations, pharma companies, payers or providers. Then providers might prescribe Sweetch alongside the actual treatment to encourage them to stick with it.</p>
<p>There is evidence that people don’t always follow doctors’ orders — particularly when it comes to chronic conditions. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6645a2.htm">One 2017 report</a> from the CDC notes that one in five prescriptions written in the United States are never filled, and up to 50% of medicines were taken incorrectly (at the wrong time, wrong dose, etc.).</p>
<p>Improving patient compliance, though, is a more complicated problem. The CDC report outlined a few solutions — some of which have more to do with the healthcare system than they do with health tech. Those include lowering economic barriers to medication, increasing team-based healthcare (your pharmacist and doctor coordinating prescription refills, for instance), and increasing access to healthcare in the first place.</p>
<p>The report does highlight an avenue for health information technology to help address the noncompliance problem (it specifically mentions e-prescribing software).</p>
<p>Tech, like Sweetch, can only address the noncompliance problem in medicine if it doesn&#8217;t have a noncompliance problem of its own. To that end, Bahagon says the app has a record of user retention. “Even after 24 months, we still see around 45% of the patients that started using the system continue to use it,” he says.</p>
<p>User retention is a good sign for any app developer. But in the health space, it’s more complicated. Some studies <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27920321/">suggest</a> that consumer ratings are poor markers of how well these apps work to improve outcomes (you might like an app and use it, but it doesn’t make you any healthier).</p>
<p>In that regard, Sweetch does<a href="https://www.jmir.org/2018/2/e72/"> have a trial</a> under its belt, conducted at two sites in the Johns Hopkins Clinical Research Network.</p>
<p>The app was tested on 55 adults with prediabetes over the course of three months. Forty-seven of the participants finished the trial, and on average, they increased their physical activity by an average of 2.8 MET-hours (they may have actually exercised for shorter periods, but their intensity was the equivalent of 2.8 hours of work), and lost about 1.6 kilograms.</p>
<p>The users also lowered their A1c levels, a key measure of average blood sugar. Prediabetic adults usually have an A1c <a href="https://www.diabetes.org/a1c">between</a> 5.7 and 6.5 percent, and those in this trial reduced their A1c levels by about .1% (the study refers to that reduction as “clinically meaningful.”)</p>
<p>This study didn’t specifically compare Sweetch to any other prediabetes interventions. However, a study on that is upcoming. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUwMGFb8vUg">a December 2020</a> interview, Bahagon noted that Sweetch had received a grant from the National Institutes of Health to continue testing Sweetch against other “gold standard” interventions for diabetes.</p>
<p>Nevo and Bahagon didn’t provide concrete updates on the project, but noted that “in a month or so” the company may announce updates on the NIH funding and upcoming randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the company plans to use the Series A funding to expand into markets in the U.S. and Brazil, grow the user base and enhance the platform to provide specific and tailored recommendations for even more conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft has secured a court order to take down several malicious “homoglyph” domains that were used to impersonate Office 365 customers and commit fraud.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The technology giant <a href="https://noticeofpleadings.com/maliciousdomains/">filed a case</a> earlier this month after it uncovered cybercriminal activity targeting its customers. After receiving a customer complaint about a business email compromise attack, a Microsoft investigation found that the unnamed criminal group responsible created 17 additional malicious domains, which were then used together with stolen customer credentials to unlawfully access and monitor Office 365 accounts in an attempt to defraud the customers&#8217; contacts.</p>
<p>Microsoft confirmed in <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/07/19/cybercrime-homoglyphs-dcu-court-order/">a blog post published Monday</a> that a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia issued a court order requiring domain registrars to disable service on the malicious domains, which include “thegiaint.com” and “nationalsafetyconsuiting.com,&#8221; which were used to impersonate its customers.</p>
<p>These so-called “homoglyph” domains exploit the similarities of some letters to create deceptive domains that appear legitimate. For example, using an uppercase “I” and a lowercase “l” (e.g. MICROSOFT.COM vs. MlCROSOFT.COM).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“These were together with stolen customer credentials to unlawfully access customer accounts, monitor customer email traffic, gather intelligence on pending financial transactions, and criminally impersonate [Office 365] customers, all in an attempt to deceive their victims into transferring funds to the cybercriminals,” Microsoft said in its complaint, adding that the cybercriminals “have caused and continue to cause irreparable injury to Microsoft, its customers, and the public.”</p>
<p>In one instance, for example, the criminals identified a legitimate email from the compromised account of an Office 365 customer referencing payment issues. Capitalizing on this information, the criminals sent an email from a homoglyph domain using the same sender name and nearly identical domain. They also used the same subject line and format of an email from the earlier, legitimate conversation, but falsely claimed a hold had been placed on the account by the chief financial officer and that payment needed to be received as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The cybercriminals then attempted to solicit a fraudulent wire transfer by sending new wire transfer information appearing to be legitimate, including using the logo of the company they were impersonating.</p>
<p>Microsoft notes that while these criminals will typically move their malicious infrastructure outside the Microsoft ecosystem once detected, the order — granted on Friday — eliminates defendants’ ability to move these domains to other providers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The action will further allow us to diminish the criminals’ capabilities and, more importantly, obtain additional evidence to undertake further disruptions inside and outside court,” said Amy Hogan-Burney, general manager of Microsoft’s Digital Crime Unit.</p>
<p>The tech giant hasn’t yet disclosed the identities of the cybercriminals responsible for the BEC attacks, but said that “based on the techniques deployed, the criminals appear to be financially motivated, and we believe they are part of an extensive network that appears to be based out of West Africa.” The targets of the operation were predominantly small businesses operating in North America across several industries, according to Microsoft.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Microsoft secured a court order to step up its fight against cybercriminals and similar attacks, which research shows affected 71% of businesses in 2021. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/microsoft-domains-covid-19-attacks/">a court granted the tech giant&#8217;s request to seize and take control of malicious web domains</a> used in a large-scale cyberattack targeting victims in 62 countries with spoofed COVID-19 emails.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
