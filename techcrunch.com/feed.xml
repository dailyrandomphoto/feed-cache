										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just days after Elastic announced the</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/elastic-acquires-build-security-for-security-policy-definition-and-enforcement/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquisition</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of build.security, the company is making yet another security acquisition. As part of its second-quarter earnings announcement this afternoon, Elastic disclosed that it is acquiring Vancouver, Canada based security vendor CMD. Financial terms of the deal are not being publicly disclosed.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cmd.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CMD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;s technology provides runtime security for cloud infrastructure, helping organizations gain better visibility into processes that are running. The startup was founded in 2016 and has raised $21.6 million in funding to date. The company&#8217;s last round was a </span><a href="https://medium.com/cmd-security/changing-cybersecurity-announcing-our-15-million-funding-led-by-gv-81bd27e18610"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$15 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was announced in 2019, led by</span><a href="https://www.gv.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">GV.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elastic CEO and co-founder Shay Banon told TechCrunch that his company will be welcoming the employees of CMD into his company, but did not disclose precisely how many would be coming over. CMD CEO and co-founder Santosh Krishan and his fellow co-founder Jake King will both be taking executive roles within Elastic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both build.security and CMD are set to become part of Elastic&#8217;s security organization. The two technologies will be integrated into the Elastic Stack platform that provides visibility into what an organization is running, as well as security insights to help limit risk. Elastic has been steadily growing its security capabilities in recent years, acquiring</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/elastic-adds-endpoint-security-to-its-expanding-toolset/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Endgame Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 for $234 million.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elastic acquires build.security for security policy definition and enforcement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/elastic-acquires-build-security-for-security-policy-definition-and-enforcement/embed/#?secret=H5JPEFI6nm" data-secret="H5JPEFI6nm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banon explained that, as organizations increasingly move to the cloud and make use of Kubernetes, they are looking for more layers of introspection and protection for Linux. That&#8217;s where CMD&#8217;s technology comes in. CMD’s security service is built with an open source technology known as</span><a href="https://ebpf.io/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">eBPF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With eBPF, it&#8217;s possible to hook into a Linux operating system for visibility and security control. Work is currently ongoing to extend eBPF for Windows workloads, as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CMD isn&#8217;t the only startup that has been building based on eBP. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isovalent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/with-29m-in-funding-isovalent-launches-its-cloud-native-networking-and-security-platform-based-on-ebpf-and-cilium/">$29 million Series A round</a> led by Andreessen Horowitz and Google in November 2020, is also active in the space. The Linux Foundation also recently announced the creation of an</span><a href="https://ebpf.io/members/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">eBPF Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with the participation of Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix and Isovalent.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundamentally, Banon sees a clear alignment between what CMD was building and what Elastic aims to deliver for its users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have a saying at Elastic &#8211; while you observe, why not protect?&#8221; Banon said. &#8220;With CMD if you look at everything that they do, they also have this deep passion and belief that it starts with observability. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will take time for Elastic to integrate the CMD technology into the Elastic Stack, though it won&#8217;t be too long. Banon noted that one of the benefits of acquiring a startup is that it&#8217;s often easier to integrate than a larger, more established vendor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With all of these acquisitions that we make we spend time integrating them into a single product line,&#8221; Banon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means Elastic needs to take the technology that other companies have built and fold it into its stack and that sometimes can take time, Banon explained. He noted that it took two years to integrate the Endgame technology after that acquisition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Typically that lends itself to us joining forces with smaller companies with really innovative technology that can be more easily taken and integrated into our stack,&#8221; Banon said.</span></p>

<p>The End-of-Life Services by Astroscale-demonstration (ELSA-d) mission was launched in March, with the goal of validating the company’s orbital debris removal tech. The demonstrator package, which was sent up on a Soyuz rocket that launched from Kazakhstan, included two separate spacecraft: a “servicer” which was designed to remove space junk, and a “client” that poses as said space junk.</p>

<p>“A major challenge of debris removal, and on-orbit servicing in general, is docking with or capturing a client object; this test demonstration served as a successful validation of ELSA-d’s ability to dock with a client, such as a defunct satellite,” the company explained.</p>
<p>The demonstration today showed that the servicer – a model of Astroscale’s future product – can successfully magnetically capture and release other spacecraft.</p>
<p>But that’s not the end for the ELSA-d demonstration mission; the servicer and client still must hit three more capture-and-release milestones before Astroscale can call it a complete success. Next up, the servicer must safely release the client and re-capture it from a greater distance away. After that, Astroscale will attempt the same release-and-capture process, but this time with the client satellite simulating an uncontrolled, tumbling space object. The final capture demonstration the company is calling “diagnosis and client search,” in which the servicer will inspect the client from a close distance, move away, then approach and re-capture.</p>

<p>Astroscale is one of a suite of companies working on the problem of orbital debris, but it’s the first to send up a debris removal demonstration mission. According to NASA, over 27,000 pieces of orbital debris are tracked by the Department of Defense’s global Space Surveillance Network sensors. The amount of junk in space is only anticipated to grow as the cost of launching a spacecraft, and other expenses, continue to decline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Climate change is affecting farming all over the world, and solutions are seldom simple. But if you could plant crops that resisted the heat, cold or drought instead of moving a thousand miles away, wouldn&#8217;t you? <a href="https://www.avalo.ai/">Avalo</a> helps plants like these become a reality using AI-powered genome analysis that can reduce the time and money it takes to breed hardier plants for this hot century.</p>
<p>Founded by two friends who thought they&#8217;d take a shot at a startup before committing to a life of academia, Avalo has a very direct value proposition, but it takes a bit of science to understand it.</p>
<p>Big seed and agriculture companies put a lot of work into creating better versions of major crops. By making corn or rice ever so slightly more resistant to heat, insects, drought or flooding, they can make huge improvements to yields and profits for farmers, or alternatively make a plant viable to grow somewhere it couldn&#8217;t before.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are big decreases to yields in equatorial areas — and it&#8217;s not that corn kernels are getting smaller,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Brendan Collins. &#8220;Farmers move upland because salt water intrusion is disrupting fields, but they run into early spring frosts that kill their seedlings. Or they need rust resistant wheat to survive fungal outbreaks in humid, wet summers. We need to create new varieties if we want to adapt to this new environmental reality.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To make those improvements in a systematic way, researchers emphasize existing traits in the plant; this isn&#8217;t about splicing in a new gene but bringing out qualities that are already there. This used to be done by the simple method of growing several plants, comparing them, and planting the seeds of the one that best exemplifies the trait — like Mendel in Genetics 101.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Hr1RQsHRi6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/in-an-increasingly-hot-biotech-market-protecting-ip-is-key/">In an increasingly hot biotech market, protecting IP is key</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In an increasingly hot biotech market, protecting IP is key&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/in-an-increasingly-hot-biotech-market-protecting-ip-is-key/embed/#?secret=Hr1RQsHRi6" data-secret="Hr1RQsHRi6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nowadays, however, we have sequenced the genome of these plants and can be a little more direct. By finding out which genes are active in the plants with a desired trait, better expression of those genes can be targeted for future generations. The problem is that doing this still takes a long time — as in a decade.</p>
<p>The difficult part of the modern process stems (so to speak) from the issue that <em>traits</em>, like survival in the face of a drought, aren&#8217;t just single genes. They may be any number of genes interacting in a complex way. Just as there&#8217;s no single gene for becoming an Olympic gymnast, there isn&#8217;t one for becoming drought-resistant rice. So when the companies do what are called genome-wide association studies, they end up with hundreds of candidates for genes that contribute to the trait, and then must laboriously test various combinations of these in living plants, which even at industrial rates and scales takes years to do.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193982" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rice-tests.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193982" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193982" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rice-tests.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="573" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rice-tests.jpg 2860w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rice-tests.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rice-tests.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rice-tests.jpg?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rice-tests.jpg?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rice-tests.jpg?resize=1536,859 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rice-tests.jpg?resize=2048,1146 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rice-tests.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2193982" class="wp-caption-text">Numbered, genetically differentiated rice plants being raised for testing purposes. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Avalo</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to just find genes and then do something with them is actually pretty limited as these traits become more complicated,&#8221; said Mariano Alvarez, co-founder and CSO of Avalo. &#8220;Trying to increase the efficiency of an enzyme is easy, you just go in with CRISPR and edit it — but increasing yield in corn, there are thousands, maybe millions of genes contributing to that. If you&#8217;re a big strategic [e.g., Monsanto] trying to make drought-tolerant rice, you&#8217;re looking at 15 years, 200 million dollars … it&#8217;s a long play.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is where Avalo steps in. The company has built a model for simulating the effects of changes to a plant&#8217;s genome, which they claim can reduce that 15-year lead time to two or three and the cost by a similar ratio.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea was to create a much more realistic model for the genome that&#8217;s more evolutionarily aware,&#8221; said Collins. That is, a system that models the genome and genes on it that includes more context from biology and evolution. With a better model, you get far fewer false positives on genes associated with a trait, because it rules out far more as noise, unrelated genes, minor contributors and so on.</p>
<p>He gave the example of a cold-tolerant rice strain that one company was working on. A genomewide association study found 566 &#8220;genes of interest,&#8221; and to investigate each costs somewhere in the neighborhood of $40,000 due to the time, staff and materials required. That means investigating this one trait might run up a $20 million tab over several years, which naturally limits both the parties who can even attempt such an operation, and the crops that they will invest the time and money in. If you expect a return on investment, you can&#8217;t spend that kind of cash improving a niche crop for an outlier market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here to democratize that process,&#8221; said Collins. In that same body of data relating to cold-tolerant rice, &#8220;We found 32 genes of interest, and based on our simulations and retrospective studies, we know that all of those are truly causal. And we were able to grow 10 knockouts to validate them, three in a three-month period.&#8221;</p>

The Avalo model clears up the data and selects only the most promising ones. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Avalo</p></div></p>
<p>To unpack the jargon a little there, from the start Avalo&#8217;s system ruled out more than 90% of the genes that would have had to be individually investigated. They had high confidence that these 32 genes were not just related, but causal — having a real effect on the trait. And this was borne out with brief &#8220;knockout&#8221; studies, where a particular gene is blocked and the effect of that studied. Avalo calls its method &#8220;gene discovery via informationless perturbations,&#8221; or GDIP.</p>
<p>Part of it is the inherent facility of machine learning algorithms when it comes to pulling signal out of noise, but Collins noted that they needed to come at the problem with a fresh approach, letting the model learn the structures and relationships on its own. And it was also important to them that the model be explainable — that is, that its results don&#8217;t just appear out of a black box but have some kind of justification.</p>
<p>This latter issue is a tough one, but they achieved it by systematically swapping out genes of interest in repeated simulations with what amount to dummy versions, which don&#8217;t disrupt the trait but do help the model learn what each gene is contributing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193983" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193983" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193983" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg 2739w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=2048,1199 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2193983" class="wp-caption-text">Avalo co-founders Mariano Alvarez (left) and Brendan Collins by a greenhouse. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Avalo</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Using our tech, we can come up with a minimal predictive breeding set for traits of interest. You can design the perfect genotype in silico [i.e., in simulation] and then do intensive breeding and watch for that genotype,&#8221; said Collins. And the cost is low enough that it can be done by smaller outfits or with less popular crops, or for traits that are outside possibilities — since climate change is so unpredictable, who can say whether heat- or cold-tolerant wheat would be better 20 years from now?</p>
<p>&#8220;By reducing the capital cost of undertaking this exercise, we sort of unlock this space where it&#8217;s economically viable to work on a climate-tolerant trait,&#8221; said Alvarez.</p>
<p><span class="il">Avalo</span> is partnering with several universities to accelerate the creation of other resilient and sustainable plants that might never have seen the light of day otherwise. These research groups have tons of data but not a lot of resources, making them excellent candidates to demonstrate the company&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<p>The university partnerships will also establish that the system works for &#8220;fairly undomesticated&#8221; plants that need some work before they can be used at scale. For instance it might be better to supersize a wild grain that&#8217;s naturally resistant to drought instead of trying to add drought resistance to a naturally large grain species, but no one was willing to spend $20 million to find out.</p>
<p>On the commercial side, they plan to offer the data handling service first, one of many startups offering big cost and time savings to slower, more established companies in spaces like agriculture and pharmaceuticals. With luck Avalo will be able to help bring a few of these plants into agriculture and become a seed provider as well.</p>
<p>The company just emerged from the IndieBio accelerator a few weeks ago and has already secured $3 million in seed funding to continue their work at greater scale. The round was co-led by Better Ventures and Giant Ventures, with At One Ventures, Climate Capital, David Rowan and of course IndieBio parent SOSV participating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brendan convinced me that starting a startup would be way more fun and interesting than applying for faculty jobs,&#8221; said Alvarez. &#8220;And he was totally right.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kanye (or <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kanye-west-files-to-change-his-name-to-ye/">“Ye,” as it were</a>) is going all out in the promotion of his upcoming tenth studio album, &#8220;Donda&#8221; (named for his late-mother, Donda West). In July, there was a massive listening party at New Orleans’ Mercedes-Benz Stadium (where he also took up residence in a locker room). For an upcoming listening party in his native Chicago, meanwhile, the rapper is <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/kanye-west-rebuilds-childhood-home-for-donda-listening-event-at-soldier-field-thursday-photos-show/2597155/">rebuilding his childhood home at Soldier Field</a>.</p>
<p>The forthcoming LP also sees West launching a $200 music gadget called,<a href="https://www.kanyewest.com/"> Stem Player</a>, under his Yeezy Tech brand. The product is designed to isolate stems &#8212; specific elements like vocals, bass, samples and drums. It can add effects and remix the song elements according to the site.</p>
<p>The device reportedly ships with a copy of the new record pre-loaded. A FAQ on the site helpfully adds, however, while the product is being released in conjunction with &#8220;Donda,&#8221; it can also be used for other music.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194041" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194041" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2194041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="628" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg 1872w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg?resize=1536,942 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kanye West</p></div></p>
<p>Interestingly, the device was created in tandem with Kano, a London-based startup known for a different kind of STEM product. The company creates educational devices to help children learn things like programming. In 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/kid-focused-stem-device-startup-kano-sees-layoffs-as-it-puts-disney-e-device-on-ice/">Kano struggled through layoffs</a>, in spite of releasing a number of Disney-branded devices.</p>
<p>It seems the company’s found an interesting new bit of life here, and the product even goes so far as crediting Kano on the back of its silicone skin exterior with a Yeezy Tech x Kano branding on the rear.</p>
<p>West name-checked the device (or its predecessor) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuOCvKvrwI8">during an interview</a> around his previous album, &#8220;Jesus Is King&#8221; in 2019. At the time, it appeared to be a collaboration with design firm Teenage Engineering. “This portable stem player that we designed with Teenage Engineering for this album and the albums before it, is to spread the gospel,” West told Zane Lowe at the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product is set to ship this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Can an old Terminal learn new tricks? <a href="https://fig.io">Fig</a>, a company out of Y Combinator’s S20 class, has raised a $2.2M seed round to prove that it can. Their goal: augment (but don’t try to replace) the command line terminal that so many people use every day and make it more powerful and easy to use — especially for teams.</p>
<p>The first of these augmentations is autocomplete. Start typing your command and it’ll respond with a narrowing drop down of things that might complete it, saving you the keystrokes, time and brain juice required to perfectly remember the myriad terminal commands you might use throughout your work day.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re changing directories, for example, it can help finish paths as you type; with Git, it can keep track of your most recently tapped branches. If you find yourself punching in the same Google Cloud or AWS commands 10 times a day, it&#8217;ll put them a tap away. The autocomplete functionality tied to each command line tool can be <a href="https://fig.io/docs/getting-started">tweaked to your liking</a> and shared with the wider community. Everything can be done without taking your hands off the keyboard, for those who tend to avoid reaching for a mouse.</p>
<p>Autocomplete is a great feature, though perhaps not enough to fuel an entire company — but it’s just step one, says the team. Fig founder Brendan Falk tells me the goal is to build out an “app ecosystem” for companies that use the terminal as a key part of their daily workflow, charging teams a monthly subscription fee. They’ve built a platform for shareable Markdown-based apps that can a user can launch from the terminal, giving them a visual interface that can be filled out and adjusted before piping output back into the terminal. Autocomplete, as they see it, is just the foot in the door.</p>
<p>“Suddenly I’ve written a little script, but it’s visual, it’s discoverable, I can share that with my team,” says Falk. “Building these internal tools for your development team is really where we want to go here … things like sharing scripts, sharing deployment workflows, sharing monitoring commands. All of this boilerplate stuff that is spread throughout your system, that really is focused within your terminal and should be contained within the terminal.”</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a tweet from Fig showing that visual interface in motion:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The team didn&#8217;t initially set out with their sights set on the terminal. Falk tells me that he and co-founder Matt Schrage had pivoted from idea to idea for months, building out things like a personal CRM, prediction markets and a stock exchange for creators. &#8220;We had all of the bad college kid ideas,&#8221; Falk says, &#8220;but they were just not problems we had. They were ideas, as opposed to problems people had.&#8221;</p>
<p>A bunch of pivots later, says Falk, they realized that each pivot had them back in the terminal typing the same commands, following the same complicated workflows to spin up a new project. &#8220;The last major changes to the terminal were in 1978, and it hasn&#8217;t really changed much since.&#8221; notes Falk. &#8220;Yet literally every hardware engineer, software engineer, data scientist is using it.&#8221; Could <em>that</em> be the problem they went after?</p>
<p>It seems there&#8217;s an audience for it; while Fig is still in private beta, Falk tells me they currently have tens of thousands of users on the waitlist to get access.</p>
<p>This round was led by General Catalyst, and backed by YC, SV Angel, Kleiner Perkins and a bevy of current/former tech execs including Adobe CPO Scott Belsky, Stripe CPO Will Gaybrick, Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel, former Github CTO Jason Warner, former Heroku CEO Adam Gross, Segment co-founder Calvin French-Owen and Eventbrite founder Kevin Hartz.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fig works with macOS’ built-in terminal app out of the box, but they’ve also got add-on integrations to make it work within things like VSCode, Hyper and iTerm. It won’t work on <a href="https://github.com/withfig/fig/issues/35">Windows</a> or <a href="https://github.com/withfig/fig/issues/34">Linux</a> just yet, but the team says support for them is on the roadmap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://canalys.com">Canalys</a> released <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/us-pc-shipments-q2-2021?ctid=2188-341e8f4ea5ad6bc6ab1cb69aa884215e">its quarterly U.S. PC sales</a> today, and while the news was quite good with sales overall up 17% YoY, the growth slowed significantly from the prior quarter when sales soared to 74% pushed by the pandemic. Perhaps that is also due the widely reported <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2021/07/how-has-the-global-chip-shortage-impacted-the-pc-industry-so-far/">worldwide chip shortage</a>.</p>
<p>HP retained top spot for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/u-s-pc-shipments-soar-73-in-the-first-quarter-as-apple-falls-from-top-spot/">the second straight quarter</a> with 21.9% of the market, up over 20% from the previous year. Apple remained in the second spot with a 20.6% share. It&#8217;s worth noting, however, that Apple&#8217;s growth fell -2.8% for the year.</p>
<p>Dell was in third place with 15.6%, followed by Lenovo with 12.4%. If you&#8217;re looking at yearly growth rate, Samsung had the highest with over 50%, but that translated into just over 6% market share.</p>

<p>Brian Lynch, research analyst at Canalys, is optimistic that the pandemic-fueled growth we have been seeing in this market throughout 2020 and 2021 will continue and that consumer refreshes could be on the horizon as the economy continues to rebound.</p>
<p>&#8220;The commercial and education segments have exploded, triggering tremendous refresh potential. The U.S. economy has bounced back well from its pandemic woes and small businesses are recovering, which will lead to a wave of purchasing from the segment,&#8221; Lynch said in a statement.</p>
<p>Overall there were 36.8 million units sold and that includes notebooks, which were up 27%; desktops, which were up 23%; and tablets, which were basically stagnant with growth actually down 1%. Canalys attributed this drop to the education market moving away from tablets and the fact that many people bought tablets when they were stuck at home, but won&#8217;t be refreshing quickly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In spite of this, Apple remains firmly in charge in the tablet market with a 45% share, while Amazon is well back in second place with 22% followed by Samsung with 18%.</p>
<p>It seems clear that even though more people may be returning to in-person learning and in-office work at some point, many schools and businesses will continue to take a hybrid or even fully remote approach and that should bode well for the PC industry, especially whenever the chip shortage finally abates.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">More than 10 companies currently compete across Europe with an instant grocery delivery business model. Half of them were established in 2020, the year of the pandemic. These companies have raised more than $2 billion to date.</p>
<p>Existing and well-funded online food-delivery service players like Delivery Hero are also joining the race by launching dedicated grocery offerings. However, if lessons from the world’s largest online grocery market, China ($400 billion), matter, then it’s clear that instant delivery is not the magic bullet to crack the dominance of Europe’s incumbent supermarket chains in the overall $2 trillion-plus flat market.</p>
<p>Instead, China’s quick-commerce equivalents (like Dingdong Maicai, Miss Fresh and Meituan Maicai) compete alongside a wealth of other online grocery models (such as Pinduoduo, JD’s Super and Alibaba’s Taoxianda), which have helped bring total market penetration to 20% and beyond.</p>
<p>Quick commerce suffers from narrower profit margins compared to competing models and is addressing lower consumer demand in China than anyone in the West is expecting it to achieve in Europe and the U.S. If the performance of online grocery platforms in China (a market five to seven years ahead of Europe in terms of online retail) is anything to go by, a range of B2C business models would be more likely to displace the traditional grocery retailers.</p>
<h2>Third-time luck for quick commerce?</h2>
<p>The idea of ordering groceries online and having them delivered to consumers in less than an hour is nothing new. Back in the heyday of the dot-com bubble, a company attempted to do just that: Kozmo.com. Founded in 1998, it raised more than $250 million (around $400 million in today’s dollars) from investors, promising to deliver food, among other items, to consumers within an hour, while charging no delivery fees.</p>
<p>In 1999, it had revenues of $3.5 million and a loss of $1.8 million. However, in 2001, the business was shut down by its board after the company could not make the business model work at scale.</p>
<p>Some 15 years later, another company had a go. Gopuff was established in Philadelphia in 2013 and originally targeted students. What started out as a hookah delivery service soon expanded into a much broader convenience store offering and delivered to customers in approximately 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Gopuff was most recently valued at $15 billion after raising a total of $3.4 billion — 75% of which occurred in the past 12 months. Last year, Gopuff grew revenues from around $100 million to $340 million.</p>
<p>Kozmo.com went out of business after just three years. Meanwhile, Gopuff was turned down by several VCs in its early days, and it wasn’t until the pandemic that it saw a rapid acceleration in fundraising. Little did teams at either company know that they would later become the inspiration for a whole generation of founders in Europe.</p>
<h2>Europe’s $2B instant-grocery gamble</h2>
<p>Has anything fundamentally changed in the 20 years since Kozmo.com? Indeed, we’ve seen little technological progress that would hugely affect the operations of an instant commerce business. However, there have been much larger shifts in consumer habits.</p>
<p>Firstly, the number of global internet users has skyrocketed (from below 500 million to beyond 4 billion), and mobile internet has taken over. Secondly, demand for online grocery delivery has grown significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumers have preferred to make retail purchases from home for safety reasons. Thirdly, consumers are now accustomed to paying fees for delivery services, typically around $2 per order, which Kozmo notoriously did not do.</p>
<p>While many online grocery business models exist, the instant grocery, quick-commerce approach has been the favorite of European entrepreneurs and VCs over the past 18 months. The model itself, also referred to as q-commerce, is not that hard to understand.</p>
<p>Companies maintain a small product offering of around 1,000–2,000 SKUs that consumers would otherwise find in convenience or drug stores. These products are purchased directly from brands or through distributors and are stored in self-operated microwarehouses close to customers’ locations.</p>
<p>Marketing tactics are aggressive, often employing vouchers for first-time users of up to $12 (50% of an average shopping basket), and many startups offer their products at supermarket price or even at a discount of 10%–15%. Delivery usually happens by bicycle, e-bike or scooter, within 10-30 minutes of an order being placed, for a fee of around $2 with no minimum order value.</p>
<p>Companies like Getir from Istanbul (total funding: $1 billion, last valuation: $7.5 billion) and Gorillas from Berlin (total funding: $335 million, last valuation: $1 billion) are leading the way. When Gorillas announced its $290 million Series B in March 2021, it became the fastest European startup to achieve unicorn status (nine months after launch). The company is already rumored to be seeking Series C financing at a $2.5 billion valuation.</p>
<p>There are more than 10 companies across Europe with more or less the same business model. Those include the 2020-established Flink (Germany-based, $300 million raised), Zapp (U.K.-based, $100 million raised), Dija (U.K.-based, $20 million raised and just acquired by Gopuff), Jiffy (U.K.-based, $7 million raised) and Cajoo (France-based, $6 million raised).</p>
<p>There is also JOKR, which was started by the founder of Foodpanda. JOKR was only established in Q1 2021, but right after incorporation raised one of the largest ever initial seed rounds (rumored to be $100 million) and subsequently a $170 million Series A in July to bring the model to Europe, Latin America and the U.S.</p>
<p>Likewise, companies coming from food delivery have pushed further into this space and received additional funding in recent months, notably Delivery Hero through Dmart and Glovo through SuperGlovo, following role models in the U.S., such as DoorDash.</p>
<h2>Does instant grocery stand a chance of becoming profitable?</h2>
<p>As these companies approach later-stage financing sometime in the future, questions will be asked about the path to profitability in an industry of notoriously thin margins. Indeed, this is an uncomfortable truth that hasn’t changed since the early days of Kozmo.com.</p>
<p>The available figures show that old patterns are repeating. Gopuff recently reported an EBITDA of negative $150 million on $340 million in revenue (EBITDA margin: -45%). Furthermore, an analysis by the German business monthly Manager Magazine concluded that Gorillas was operating at negative unit economics of -6%. Additional costs, such as overhead and technology, might push this number up significantly further.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the first time, Hulu has started adding support for HDR viewing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/08/youtube-will-join-netflix-and-amazon-with-support-for-hdr-video/?_ga=2.185109295.748415581.1629728212-1532633466.1621860309">years after</a> some of its competitors. The gradual rollout of HDR support began on August 19, Hulu told TechCrunch, and should be available to all users with HDR-compatible devices in the coming days.</p>
<p>So far, Hulu has only enabled HDR viewing on high-profile original content, like &#8220;The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale&#8221; and &#8220;Nine Perfect Strangers,&#8221; but the streaming service said that it will continue adding HDR support to both new and existing content over time.</p>
<p>If a viewer is using an HDR-compatible device, a badge will appear on a show&#8217;s details page, indicating that it can be streamed in HDR. Per Hulu&#8217;s <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/video-quality#HDR">support page</a> &#8212; which is where users spotted the feature&#8217;s quiet rollout &#8212; HDR content on the Hulu app is supported with HDR-compatible models of Roku, Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, Fire TV Cube, Apple TV 4K, Vizio and Chromecast Ultra. Hulu told TechCrunch that &#8220;it is recommended that viewers update their devices to the latest version for the best experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hulu has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/12/hulu-brings-back-4k-content/">historically been slower</a> than its competitors to enable support for technology like HDR, which provides an enhanced viewing experience. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">HDR isn&#8217;t a resolution like 4K, but rather, it creates a more natural-looking image by expanding its contrast ratio and color palette. </span>YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/08/youtube-will-join-netflix-and-amazon-with-support-for-hdr-video/?_ga=2.185109295.748415581.1629728212-1532633466.1621860309">rolled out HDR support</a> in 2016, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/24/amazon-prime-instant-video-adds-limited-support-for-hdr/?ncid=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=sfgplus&amp;%3Fncid=sfgplus&amp;_ga=2.112576386.748415581.1629728212-1532633466.1621860309">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/netflix-introduces-hdr-video">Netflix</a> enabled the feature within the previous year. Though Disney+ and Hulu share a parent company in Disney, Disney+ has already <a href="https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&amp;sys_kb_id=7dfe2218db0d40d03c0cf158bf96190e">supported HDR</a> for some of its content.</p>
<p>Some streaming services like Netflix offer <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926">pricier monthly subscription</a> plans for access to HD or Ultra HD content, but as of now, Hulu doesn&#8217;t <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/how-much-does-hulu-cost">charge a premium</a> for access to higher-quality streaming.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Those at risk are always vigilant for the signs of a stroke in progress, but no one can be vigilant when they&#8217;re sleeping, meaning thousands of people suffer &#8220;wake-up strokes&#8221; that are only identified hours after the fact. <a href="https://www.zeitmedical.com/">Zeit Medical&#8217;s</a> brain-monitoring wearable could help raise the alarm and get people to the hospital fast enough to mitigate the stroke&#8217;s damage and potentially save lives.</p>
<p>A few decades ago, there wasn&#8217;t much anyone could do to help a stroke victim. But an effective medication entered use in the &#8217;90s, and a little later a surgical procedure was also pioneered — but both need to be administered within a few hours of the stroke&#8217;s onset.</p>
<p>Orestis Vardoulis and Urs Naber started Zeit (&#8220;time&#8221;) after seeing the resources being put toward reducing the delay between a 911 call regarding a stroke and the victim getting the therapy needed. The company is part of Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 cohort.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It used to be that you couldn&#8217;t do anything, but suddenly it really mattered how fast you got to the hospital,&#8221; said Naber. &#8220;As soon as the stroke hits you, your brain starts dying, so time is the most crucial thing. People have spent millions shrinking the time between the 911 call and transport, and from the hospital door to treatment. but no one is addressing those hours that happen <em>before</em> the 911 call — so we realized that&#8217;s where we need to innovate.&#8221;</p>
<p>If only the stroke could be identified before the person even realizes it&#8217;s happening, they and others could be alerted and off to the hospital long before an ambulance would normally be called. As it turns out, there&#8217;s another situation where this needs to happen: in the OR.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193577" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193577" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193577" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png" alt="" width="1024" height="405" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png?resize=300,119 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png?resize=768,304 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png?resize=680,269 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2193577" class="wp-caption-text">For illustrative purposes, an EEG signal that changes its character can be detected quickly by the algorithm. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zeit</p></div></p>
<p>Surgeons and nurses performing operations obviously monitor the patient&#8217;s vitals closely and have learned to identify the signs of an impending stroke from the EEG monitoring their brainwaves.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are specific patterns that people are trained to catch with their eyes. We learned from the best neurologists out there how they process this data visually, and we built a tool to detect that automatically,&#8221; said Vardoulis. &#8220;This clinical experience really helped, because they assisted in defining features within the signal that helped us accelerate the process of deciding what is important and what is not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team created a soft, wearable headband with a compact EEG built in that monitors the relevant signals from the brain. This data is sent to a smartphone app for analysis by a machine learning model trained on the aforementioned patterns, and if anything is detected, an alarm is sent to the user and pre-specified caregivers. It can also be set to automatically call 911.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vast majority of the data we have analyzed comes out of the OR,&#8221; said Vardoulis, where it can immediately be checked against the ground truth. &#8220;We saw that we have an algorithm that can robustly capture the onset of events in the OR with zero false positives.&#8221;</p>
<p>That should translate well to the home, they say, where there are actually fewer complicating variables. To test that, they&#8217;re working with a group of high-risk people who have already had one stroke; the months immediately following a stroke or related event (there are various clinically differentiated categories) is a dangerous one when second events are common.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right now we have a research kit that we&#8217;re shipping to individuals involved in our studies that has the headband and phone. Users are wearing it every night,&#8221; said Vardoulis. &#8220;We&#8217;re preparing for a path that will allow us to go commercial at some point in 2023. We&#8217;re working with he FDA to define the clinical proof needed to get this clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve earned a &#8220;Breakthrough Device&#8221; classification, which (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/brainq-raises-40m-to-transform-stroke-patient-rehabilitation-with-its-home-therapy-device/">like stroke rehabilitation company BrainQ</a>) puts them in position to move forward quickly with testing and certification.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to start in the U.S., but we see a need globally,&#8221; said Naber. &#8220;There are countries where aging is even more prevalent and the support structure for disability care is even less.&#8221; The device could significantly lower the risk and cost of at-home and disability care for many people who might otherwise have to regularly visit the hospital.</p>
<p>The plan for now is to continue to gather data and partners until they can set up a large-scale study, which will almost certainly be required to move the device from direct-to-consumer to reimbursable (i.e., covered by insurance). And although they are totally focused on strokes for the present, the method could be adapted to watching for other neurological conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope to see a future where everyone with a stroke risk is issued this device,&#8221; said Vardoulis. &#8220;We really do see this as the missing puzzle piece in the stroke care continuum.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix has announced <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-invites-you-to-tudum-global-fan-event">Tudum</a>, a global virtual fan event set for September 25 that will showcase exclusive news and first looks at some of the streaming giant’s original content. Tudum, which is named after the sound users hear when they press play on Netflix, will feature stars and creators from over 70 Netflix series, films and specials.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s our first-ever global Tudum event, and our goal is simple: to entertain and honor Netflix fans from across the globe,” a spokesperson for Netflix told TechCrunch in an email.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&mdash; Netflix (@netflix) <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1430530407729041409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The event will feature interactive panels and conversations with the creators and stars of some of Netflix’s most popular shows, including “Stranger Things,” “Emily in Paris,” “The Witcher,” “The Crown,” “Cobra Kai” and “Bridgerton.” Netflix will also feature some of its popular films including “Red Notice,” “Don’t Look Up,” “Extraction,” “The Harder They Fall,” “The Old Guard” and more.</p>
<p>Netflix is among several other major companies that have started hosting their own virtual events during the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift toward livestreamed programming. Disney+, for instance, held a special <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1263077012299628545">event to honor National Streaming Day</a> earlier this year in May. These types of events are becoming the new way for companies to showcase their original content, whereas in previous years they would do so at various in-person fan conventions.</p>
<p>With this new fan event and other similar ones such as <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/everything-to-know-about-geeked-week">Geeked Week</a>, Netflix is no longer relying on other programming or conventions to promote its original content as it can now host its own events. Tudum also seems to be a way for Netflix to acquire more subscribers by promoting popular returning shows and teasing upcoming content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The virtual livestream for the three-hour Tudum event starts at 12 p.m. EDT/9 a.m. PDT on Saturday, September 25. The event will be broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitch. Netflix is also hosting special pre-shows to showcase its Korean and Indian original series and films along with its anime content at 8 a.m. EDT/5 a.m. PDT.</p>
<p>Netflix’s event announcement comes as the streaming giant has spent the past year expanding its service and adding new features. Recently, the platform has launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/netflix-launches-its-shuffle-feature-now-called-play-something-to-users-worldwide/">new &#8220;Play Something&#8221; shuffle feature</a>, a new section to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/netflix-aims-to-retain-subscribers-with-launch-of-a-feature-to-track-new-releases/">help users track upcoming releases</a> and a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/netflix-launches-downloads-for-you-a-new-feature-that-automatically-downloads-content-youll-like/">&#8220;Downloads For You&#8221; feature</a> that automatically downloads content you&#8217;ll like. In terms of the future, Netflix has said its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/netflix-says-its-gaming-push-will-begin-with-mobile/">gaming push will begin with mobile</a> and that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/spatial-audio-is-coming-to-netflix-on-iphone-and-ipad/">plans to bring spatial audio</a> to the platform&#8217;s iPhone and iPad apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://shares.io">Shares</a>, a new European startup that wants to add a social twist to financial investment — in this case, the company means &#8220;social&#8221; as in &#8220;social network&#8221;. The startup has been developing its product under the radar for a few months already. It is also moving at a fast pace. It has assembled a team of 35 people and raised $10 million in a pre-product seed round.</p>
<p>Shares sent me a few details about what you should expect from the trading platform and why it’s different from what’s out there. Essentially, the startup combines two important trends.</p>
<p>First, stock trading has been moving to mobile and a few tech companies have been working on well-designed trading platforms to appeal to a new set of users. That shift is well underway in the U.S., as Robinhood has managed to attract <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/">tens of millions</a> of users.</p>
<p>In Europe, it’s been a different story as the European market is still fragmented with a handful of stock-trading apps slowly expanding to new markets. Those companies include <a href="https://freetrade.io">Freetrade</a>, <a href="https://traderepublic.com">Trade Republic</a>, <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com">Bitpanda</a> and, to a certain degree, <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="asuCkPAxf6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/">How Robinhood&#8217;s explosive growth rate came to be</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Robinhood&#8217;s explosive growth rate came to be&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/embed/#?secret=asuCkPAxf6" data-secret="asuCkPAxf6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The second big investment trend of the past couple of years is that investment has become a social activity. Evidence of this lies in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze">GameStop short squeeze</a> that occurred back in January 2021. In other words, people like to talk about stocks on Reddit, Discord, Telegram groups and more.</p>
<p>With Shares, users will be able to trade 1,500 stocks with no-minimum, no-fees access. You’ll be able to buy fractional shares and start investing with £1.00 in your Shares account. With such a low barrier to entry, the startup wants to convince first-time investors, as the vast majority of people don’t own individual stocks. Shares plans to comply with KYC and AML regulation (Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the app will offer more than just an interface to buy and sell shares. Users will be able to start conversations with friends, learn from experts and access market intelligence data. Shares will also feature some information to learn more about investing, tax, regulation and compliance. The most intriguing feature will be the ability to create group stock indexes with friends.</p>
<p>The startup was co-founded by Benjamin Chemla and François Ruty. Among other things, Chemla previously co-founded <a href="https://stuart.com">Stuart</a>, a last-mile logistics company that was acquired by La Poste in 2017.</p>
<p>They have already raised $10 million in a seed round led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/singular-is-a-new-paris-based-vc-firm-with-265-million/">Singular</a>. Valar Ventures, Global Founders Capital and Red Sea Ventures also participated in the funding round. The startup has also partnered with some strategic advisors, including Freetrade co-founder André Mohamed.</p>
<p>That’s an impressive seed round for a fintech company that isn’t live yet. With a team of 35 people, it’s clear that Shares wants to move fast. It&#8217;s going to be interesting to see how online communities react when the app goes live.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Estonia-based </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://membo.ee/?lang=en">Membo</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; which is backed by Y Combinator and will be presenting at the incubator&#8217;s Summer 2021 Demo Day next week &#8212; is aiming to take a slice of the premium end of grocery shopping in Europe and a bite out of supermarket giants&#8217; continued dominance of the traditional weekly food shop. </span></p>
<p>On-demand food delivery in Europe is of course a highly competitive business, with rapid-fire market moves and bursts of consolidation among app makers making a kind of sizzling startup stir-fry. Online grocery delivery, by contrast, tends to be a bit more sedate. Although there is some overlap, with developments like dark stores.</p>
<p>Interest in app-based grocery shopping also had an especially big boost during the pandemic &#8212; which has fired up consumer interest in doing the weekly shop online, so that&#8217;s now driving more startup activity and capacity from supermarket giants trying to meet increased demand for online delivery.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="L7sq77REH5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/on-demand-grocery-startup-instashop-acquired-by-delivery-hero-for-360m/">Delivery Hero picks up InstaShop in $360M deal to expand in groceries in the Middle East</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Delivery Hero picks up InstaShop in $360M deal to expand in groceries in the Middle East&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/on-demand-grocery-startup-instashop-acquired-by-delivery-hero-for-360m/embed/#?secret=L7sq77REH5" data-secret="L7sq77REH5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Entering this fray is Membo &#8212; which, starting in Estonia, has built an app-based marketplace for local food producers to sell directly to consumers, cutting out other middlemen as the startup handles delivery logistics and billing.</p>
<p>Its service is live in the Estonian cities of Tallin and Tartu, currently. So most of us can merely ogle the <a href="https://membo.ee/pood/vegan">mouth-watering fare</a> for now.</p>
<p>Food producers display their wares in Membo&#8217;s app, which it likens to a virtual farmers&#8217; market &#8212; allowing shoppers to browse and buy from multiple high-quality, local fresh food producers and have everything delivered to them in one go. Its business model is based on taking a commission on orders made via its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Products ordered via Membo can be delivered to customers in one of (currently) three slots a week. So within a few days or even the next day. The startup batches customer orders to send to producers who only have to send one bulk order back to Membo&#8217;s centralized warehouse &#8212; where its staff take care of the packing and distribution to fulfil all the individual customer orders.</p>
<p>It launched the service last December and has seen 30% month on month growth over the<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> past eight months &#8212; with, t</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">o date, 4,000+ orders sent out and customer numbers reaching over 1,400.</span></p>
<p>While local produce &#8212; and therefore the environmental benefits of sourcing food locally (lower &#8220;food miles&#8221;) &#8212; is a big feature of what Membo is selling, it does also offer food from further afield &#8212; shipping Spanish oranges to its Estonia-based shoppers, for example &#8212; in order that it can provide customers with a full range of groceries and do things like be able to offer certain seasonal produce at different times of the year.</p>
<p>A full inventory is also important for it to be able to compete with traditional supermarkets on the &#8220;single weekly shop&#8221; convenience front too, of course.</p>
<p>At present there are 800+ items listed on Membo&#8217;s platform from some 65 producers. (And while groceries are its core offering, it says it&#8217;s keeping an open mind about how that might expand &#8212; noting it recently added a locally produced pet food producer to its inventory, for example.)</p>
<p>But the overarching idea is for the food Membo sells to be as locally sourced to the customer as possible &#8212; which obviously has positive knock-on impact on freshness and therefore overall grocery quality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything that we&#8217;re doing stems from the insight that people ordering their weekly groceries actually care much more about freshness and quality of their food than they actually care about 15-minute deliveries,&#8221; says co-founder and CEO Vahur Hansen, who cut his startup teeth working as an early engineer for TransferWise (now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">Wise</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming from that insight we set out to build a model that can guarantee that when you order from us, every item in your cart always arrives as the freshest version possible. As an example&#8230; when you order trout from us the same trout was caught the day before. You get dairy produce that was specifically prepared for your delivery. You get oranges that were picked from the tree 24 hours ago. That&#8217;s the sort of reality that we&#8217;re focused on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The product, from a fundamental point of view, is built for Europeans &#8212; and sort of for the European mentality,&#8221; he also tells TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s not new for people [here] to have this sort of mission/feel on being able to consume local produce. Europeans all over, in every country, they know that they need to support their local producers but they also know that local producers really make the best products for them. And for us the bigger goal is to build a cross-European, high-quality producer network &#8212; coupled with very efficient logistics &#8212; so that we can, anywhere, deliver high-quality local producers across Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the last-mile delivery side, the team has tried a few different approaches but is currently outsourcing that to delivery partners &#8212; with Hansen reiterating it makes sense for it to stay focused on the core logistics piece.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started with this product we realized that we&#8217;re more of a logistics company than an actual store. So everything that we do is logistics in trying to figure out how to organize the quickest producer to end customer delivery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the target segment is premium groceries, Membo shoppers&#8217; baskets are unsurprisingly more valuable than the average food delivery app &#8212; which conversely cater to impulse buys and hyper-quick convenience. (Toothpaste, chocolate bars, takeaways, that sort of thing.)</p>
<p>So although there can be some overlap in the basic nature of what&#8217;s offered for delivery by Membo versus the average on-demand food delivery app, there is more than enough clear blue water separating its value proposition versus &#8212; for example &#8212; the stuff that even a dark store operator like Spain&#8217;s Glovo can bike to your door.</p>
<p>It is very hard for hyper-speedy delivery-focused players to handle fresh produce and get it intact and in date to the customer&#8217;s door. Non-perishable, long shelf life products &#8212; processed foods, bottled drinks, toiletries etc. &#8212; or indeed meal deliveries from restaurants that are set up to dish up takeaway, are far easier for such platforms to manage and deliver. So grocery freshness is an especially difficult USP for such apps to compete on.</p>
<p>The question then is how large is the market for freshness and quality in the grocery space versus hyper-quick, push-button convenience.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spain&#8217;s Glovo inks real estate tie-up to add more dark stores for speedy urban delivery&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/spains-glovo-inks-real-estate-tie-up-to-add-more-dark-stores-for-speedy-urban-delivery/embed/#?secret=4xRS8WScEa" data-secret="4xRS8WScEa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Membo&#8217;s bet is that delivering quality groceries is ultimately the more sustainable app business to be in. And it looks like a solid one. Certainly in a wealthy region like Northern Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a different model to dark stores &#8212; where they need to have mini warehouses spread across all cities &#8212; and also for us, unit economics-wise, it&#8217;s a very good thing, because you can really save on scale,&#8221; says Hansen, discussing how Membo&#8217;s model contrasts with on-demand delivery apps doing grocery deliveries out of networks of dark stores.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that us needing one big warehouse as opposed to like 10 smaller ones really effects our unit economics positively.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They capture impulse buys &#8212; and we capture planned out weekly grocery baskets,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;Based on my research, our grocery baskets are at least 50% higher than for the sort of &#8216;convenience&#8217; grocery apps. Right now it&#8217;s around $50 for an average customer. So from a very practical point of view we already see that &#8212; people come to our site to really order all of our fresh produce. As opposed to just a few items.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is another differentiating factor in play too.</p>
<p>Membo isn&#8217;t relying on a retail model that requires predicting customer demand in advance &#8212; so its business can be leaner and more efficient. Which also sums to less food being wasted &#8212; something else Membo&#8217;s target buyers are probably going to appreciate too. (The typical Membo customer is a 27 to 55-year-old suburban mother who likes to cook for their family and prepare weekly meals ahead, per Hansen &#8212; someone who &#8220;really appreciates high-quality, mostly eco ingredients for the food that they make&#8221;.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We set out to avoid food sitting in our warehouse and all the fresh produce that comes to our warehouse in the morning &#8212; it&#8217;s based on orders and it gets sent out to end customers the same evening. And also as a side effect of that model for the local food produce that we serve &#8212; there&#8217;s no food waste,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;Everything that arrives to our warehouse has already been ordered by our customers and our warehouse, essentially, is empty by the end of the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early days for Membo of course. But it has big expansion plans in the region.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been using its home market as a &#8220;playground&#8221; for fine-tuning its model and operations ahead of planned scaling into other European markets &#8212; with an eye on potential launches in Switzerland, Germany or France.</p>
<p>Markets with a rich network of local food producers who can be persuaded to sell their wares more directly to consumers via its platform will take priority, per Hansen, who says a range of factors will be involved in deciding where it goes next &#8212; so clearly the local competitive mix will also be key.</p>
<p>(Europe-based rivals include the U.K.&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/14/farmdrop-picks-up-10m-series-b/">Farmdrop</a> &#8212; which targets a similarly discerning grocery shopper, who cares where their food is coming from and has the money to pay a quality premium, offering farmer sourced produce direct to U.K. consumers via its own online platform.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been using Estonia as a playground to figure out what is the exact operating model under which we can guarantee freshness for every item. So we&#8217;re been fine-tuning our product and building it so that we know it&#8217;s a sustainable business before going into expansion,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;That&#8217;s also one of the things that YC has really taught us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Build a working business and don&#8217;t go into scaling mode too quickly. But we are getting to the point where we&#8217;re already mapping bigger Western European countries and really honing in &#8212; trying to figure out what is the best combination of all of these factors to go in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prior to taking in investment from YC, Membo had raised a little pre-seed funding to get going &#8212; although Hansen notes that its team remains small and expenses are therefore pretty lean. Its pre-seed backers included the CEO and VP of growth at Estonian ride-hailing startup Bolt, as well as some of Hansen&#8217;s ex colleagues at (Transfer)Wise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://miflink.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flink</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Mexico City-based neobroker, has raised $57 million in a Series B round of funding led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing comes just over six months after Flink </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/accel-backs-mexican-startup-flinks-effort-to-bring-investing-to-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $12 million in a Series A round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Accel. Existing backers Accel,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ALLVP, Clocktower and new investor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/the-chainsmokers-just-closed-their-debut-venture-fund-mantis-with-35-million/">Mantis Venture Capital</a> (founded by The Chainsmokers) also put money in the Series B. Since its 2017 inception, the startup has raised nearly $70 million.</span></p>
<p>Neobrokers are defined as startups that are disrupting the investment industry by providing a platform for a wider range of consumers to partake in the stock market by offering them more incremental investment options and modern and easy mobile-based interfaces to manage their money. There is a growing number of them globally, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/european-neobroker-scalable-capital-raises-180m-at-a-1-4b-valuation/">Scalable Capital,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/trading-platform-bitpanda-raises-263m-at-a-4-1bn-valuation/">Bitpanda</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/berlins-trade-republic-nabs-900m-led-by-sequoia-at-a-5b-valuation-to-take-its-neo-broker-app-across-europe/">Trade Republic</a> in Europe.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Mexico City-born Sergio Jiménez Amozurrutia, the fact that in his country of more than 120 million people, only a </span><a href="https://www.cnbv.gob.mx/SECTORES-SUPERVISADOS/BURS%C3%81TIL/Boletines-de-Prensa/Prensa%20%20Casas%20de%20Bolsa/Comunicado%20de%20Prensa%20078%20CB%20junio%202020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiny fraction </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the population has the ability to invest in the capital markets felt unfair. To him, the lack of widespread participation in investing is an example of the rich getting richer as part of an infrastructure “that is built for the wealthy.” The result of the imbalance is that a lot of people have historically been locked out of making potentially wealth-building investments.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So after selling Easy Credit, a consumer lending platform he’d built with Rick Rafael Bueno (whom he met in 2015 at a hackathon at Tech de Monterrey), Amozurrutia set out to give Mexicans access to something he believed they’d never had access to: an app-based consumer trading platform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flink launched its app in 2018 with a wallet service, a digital and physical global debit card backed by Mastercard and, last year, it began offering the ability to buy and sell fractional shares from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 pesos, without commissions, for NYSE-listed stocks.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Users can invest as little as US$1 and with zero commissions,” Amozurrutia said. “We want Flink to be the easiest way to invest, save and use your money.” </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193835" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193835" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2193835 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flink-1.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flink-1.jpg 2316w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flink-1.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flink-1.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flink-1.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flink-1.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flink-1.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flink-1.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flink-1.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193835" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lightspeed&#8217;s Mercedes Bent and Flink founding team / Lightspeed</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for what the startup has to offer is clearly there. Since launching its first brokerage product in July of 2020, Flink has 1.6 million users, up from 1 million users at the time of its February raise. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 85% of its users are first-time investors.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> GenZers seem to be the most interested in investing &#8212; 27% of the app&#8217;s clients are between 18 and 25 years old, while 22% are millennials, execs say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most legacy Mexican banks cater to less than 1% of the population — meaning most Mexicans don’t have a bank account, let alone a brokerage account,” Amozurrutia said at the time of the company’s last raise. “At Flink, we’re guided by the belief that Mexico’s financial system should work for everyone — not only a select few.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is growing its user base by 38% per month and revenue by 31% per month, according to  Amozurrutia, and touts a user acquisition cost of 62 cents. It is currently the largest retail brokerage service in Mexico, he said. Flink has 110 employees, up from 25 people a year ago today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">use its new capital to keep growing its team, toward product development and to expand its service to different countries in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The lack of access for retail investing is all over LATAM, and at Flink we want to change that,” Amozurrutia told TechCrunch. “We are focused on offering the opportunity to invest and grow their money to everyone in LATAM.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightspeed Partner <a href="https://lsvp.com/team/mercedes-bent/">Mercedes Bent</a> said her firm “fell in love” with Flink’s mission and impact on the country’s “financial ecosystem.” It was also impressed by the company’s unique features, including allowing Mexican investors to access the U.S. stock market and invest fractional shares.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many equities platforms only let you invest in equities in your own country,” she said. “Flink also has a big focus on education and creating an investment experience that makes it easy for their users to onboard.” For example, Bent noted, Flink has a podcast dubbed “Finanzas en órbita” that provides financial and stock market education in México.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a blog post, Bent and Will Kohler wrote that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they could feel the company’s passion and vision for creating more financial inclusion in Mexico, even via a Zoom call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The excitement leapt through the video screen,” the pair wrote. “&#8230;Flink’s vision for the future goes beyond accessing stocks, and we wanted to be a part of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flink marks Lightspeed’s third investment in Mexico, alongside <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/stori-raises-32-5m-to-build-mexicos-credit-card-for-the-masses/">Stori</a> and Frubana, and Bent and Kohler say there is “more to come.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are big believers in México, and bullish on LATAM,” they wrote.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Don&#8217;t call <a href="https://www.iheartjane.com/">Jane Technologies</a> the Amazon of weed. Instead, think of Jane Technologies as the Shopify of weed, and it&#8217;s an important distinction. While other startups attempt to build a destination marketplace like Amazon, Jane Technologies is trying something more powerful. The company is building the backends for dispensaries that are quickly taking their cannabis offerings online, and the company accounts for 20% of all legal cannabis sales in the United States. To Jane Technologies, the future of cannabis isn&#8217;t a single destination like Amazon; the future of cannabis is the neighborhood dispensary that sells weed online, and Jane wants to power their online store.</p>
<p>Today, the company is announcing a $100 million Series C financing round, bringing the total amount raised since its founding in 2015 to $130 million. Honor Ventures lead the round, and founding Managing Partner Jeffrey Housenbold joined Jane Technologies&#8217; board of directors.</p>
<p>Jane Technologies expects to use the additional capital to grow its digital footprint and its teams across multiple areas of operations. The company intends to build new features and expand its product offering for large and small cannabis operations.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;These 5 VCs have high hopes for cannabis in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/these-5-vcs-have-high-hopes-for-cannabis-in-2021/embed/#?secret=RTxNjYa7SF" data-secret="RTxNjYa7SF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Online cannabis retail sales are quickly becoming the norm as consumers&#8217; expectations change, and Jane offers a turn-key solution to build a robust online presence quickly.</p>
<p>Socrates Rosenfeld, Jane Technologies co-founder and CEO, is quick to point out Jane&#8217;s current positioning is a long time in the making. In an interview with TechCrunch, he says that this was a bet the company made in 2015 that the future of e-commerce is not a marketplace, but the complete digitization of all commerces.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are really seeing the next chapter of what the future of e-commerce will look like,&#8221; Rosenfeld said, &#8220;not just in the cannabis industry, perhaps across the world with various retail verticals like alcohol, convenience goods, restaurants and groceries. Local establishments [now have] some digital connective tissue to their local community, and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a more challenging environment than the cannabis industry. I&#8217;m very proud of the team that we&#8217;ve come this far and still have a long way to go, but I think that&#8217;s the direct result of us being able to raise this [$100 million].</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s often cited that cannabis was one of the winners of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales lit up as the world shut down. Jane Technologies&#8217; internal numbers lend more supporting evidence. According to their data, only 17% of legal cannabis sales were done online before the pandemic. However, during the height of the pandemic, online sales reached a high of 52%, and now, halfway through 2021, Jane Technologies says online sales account for 38% of all legal cannabis sales.</p>
<p>According to Rosenfeld, in 2019, Jane saw $100 million in total transactional volume, with one million people on the platform, and worked with 1,000 dispensaries. In 2021, the company forecasts it will reach $3.5 billion in total transactional volume and is now working with 2,100 dispensaries, including in Canada. Even more impressive, the company has nearly doubled the number of products listed on its product database, with 700,000 items, up from 350,000, showing a dramatic increase in cannabis products available to the consumer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel extremely fortunate to be born from the cannabis industry where there was no direct consumer ecosystem,&#8221; Rosenfeld said. &#8220;And we had to go and figure out a way to connect and tie the consumer to the brand and the retailer. We couldn&#8217;t do that by shipping products directly to the consumer, and we couldn&#8217;t do that by competing against the retailer; we had to work in partnership with our retail partners to provide them with powerful e-commerce enablement tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month Jane Technologies partnered with its first Canadian retailer, High Tide. Then, two months ago, the company launched Jane Roots, a powerful all-in-one e-commerce platform that allows dispensaries to focus mainly on the front-end design while Jane takes care of the retail integrations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last 25 years I&#8217;ve spent working with e-commerce companies, few have become enduring global platforms,&#8221; said Housenbold, in a released statement. &#8220;Jane has all the right ingredients to become the next eBay or Shopify. They are creating a win-win for all constituents in the ecosystem – brands, retailers and consumers all benefit from their platform and trust Jane to be the go-to service provider to build the future of cannabis commerce on a global basis. I&#8217;m excited to watch Socrates and his team build an amazing company, a great place to work and a trusted brand.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Warby Parker has two main sales channels, largely attractive economics, falling losses and rising adjusted profitability. You could even argue it handled the pandemic well. So what's it worth? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Did you miss IPOs? I sure did. They could be coming back after a summer lull.</p>
<p>Warby Parker, a D2C glasses company backed by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/warby-parker/company_financials">over a half-billion dollars</a> of private capital, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001504776/000162828021017546/warbyparkerincs-1.htm">filed to go public yesterday</a>. For investors like General Catalyst, Tiger Global and Durable Capital Partners, it&#8217;s an important debut. Having taken on equity capital since at least 2011, investors have been waiting a long time for Warby to float.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>And there&#8217;s quite a lot to like about the company, the first parse of its IPO filing reveals. There are some less attractive elements to its business worth discussing, and we need to examine how COVID-19 impacted the company&#8217;s 2020 performance.</p>
<p>Warby last raised known private capital in August 2020, a $120 million Series G that valued the company at just over $3 billion on a post-money basis. D1 Capital Partners led that transaction, which included both Durable Capital and Baillie Gifford.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>For D2C startups, the Warby IPO is something of a do-over. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/3-unicorn-takeaways-from-the-casper-one-medical-ipos/">Casper IPO from early 2020</a> is now a cautionary tale for companies employing the business model; The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/casper-lowers-its-ipo-price-range-a-gloomy-portent-for-2020-debuts/">reduced its IPO range</a>, priced at $12 per share and today trades for just over $5.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more to Warby Parker&#8217;s IPO than just the D2C category. It&#8217;s a public benefit corporation, which it says in its filing means that it is &#8220;focused on positively impacting all stakeholders&#8221; as opposed to merely <em>shareholders</em>. And the company has a charitable bent to its efforts through a foundation and donation model of giving away eyewear when customers purchase their own set. Warby also has a hybrid sales model, leaning on both IRL and digital retail channels. There&#8217;s lots to dig into.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s parse Warby&#8217;s growth history, its profitability progress over time and how the company is blending IRL shopping with digital channels. We&#8217;ll close by examining just how the company was priced last year, taking a guess at what it might be worth in today&#8217;s public markets.</p>
<h2>Inside Warby Parker&#8217;s historical growth</h2>
<p>Looking at Warby&#8217;s full-year results for 2020 is not inspiring. The company grew well from 2018 to 2019, expanding from $272.9 million in revenue to $370.5 million in revenue, or around 36%. That&#8217;s not an astounding pace of growth, but it&#8217;s more than respectable for a company of Warby&#8217;s age and size.</p>
<p>Then in 2020 the company only managed to eke out 6% growth to $393.7 million in top line. What happened to slow the company&#8217;s growth rate from Just Fine to Not Fine At All? COVID, it appears.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mindset, a platform featuring personal story collections from recording artists, announced today that it raised $8.7 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>As co-founders of the K-pop-focused podcast production company <a href="https://www.divestudios.io/">DIVE Studios</a>, brothers Brian Nam, Eric Nam and Eddie Nam noticed that the studio&#8217;s best-performing content came from podcast episodes where stars discussed how they handle struggles in their personal lives. So, the Nam brothers came up with the idea for <a href="https://www.getmindset.com/">Mindset</a>, an off-shoot of DIVE Studios.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that this was a unique selling point people really wanted more of &#8212; so we started to think about ways to really double-down on that aspect,&#8221; said CEO Brian Nam. &#8220;How do we provide more of this valuable content to Gen Z and young millennial audiences? We decided that there wasn’t really the right kind of platform out there for this type of storytelling, so we decided to develop our own mobile platform to uniquely share these stories in an audio format.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193807" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193807" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2193807 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193807" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mindset</p></div></p>
<p>In its current format, Mindset features four audio collections from artists like Jae, Tablo, BM and Mindset co-founder <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ericnam/">Eric Nam</a>, who happens to be a K-pop star himself. Each collection has 10 episodes of around 10 to 20 minutes long &#8212; the introductory episode is free, but to gain access to the rest of an individual artist&#8217;s collection, users must pay $24.99. The app also has free Boosters, which are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/">Calm</a>-like, five-minute clips of bedtime stories and motivational mantras.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up until now, the primary source of income, especially for musicians, has been touring, music streams and then maybe some endorsement deals, but we&#8217;re able to unlock this fourth one, which is monetizing your stories,&#8221; Nam said. &#8220;The pricing is similar to how they might price a ticket, or how they would sell merchandise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mindset isn&#8217;t meant to be a therapy app. “We’re not licensed therapists, we don’t try to act like we are,” Nam said. Rather, it&#8217;s a way for artists to share more intimate experiences with their fans to show that behind they music, they&#8217;re people too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Mindset launched in an MVP (minimum viable product) version in February. Nam declined to share active user or revenue numbers, but said that the app gained enough traction that by May, it raised venture funding. The $8.7 million round is led by Union Square Ventures with strategic participants like record executive Scooter Braun (of TQ Ventures), who has more recently made headlines over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_masters_controversy">the Taylor Swift masters controversy</a>. Other backers include Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin, Opendoor co-founder Eric Wu, and more.</p>
<p class="p1">“Scooter Braun was a strategic investor,&#8221; Nam told TechCrunch.</p>
<p class="p1">Braun has also worked with artists like Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;He&#8217;s really opened a lot of doors for us to branch out into the Hollywood and Western space, where we traditionally came from the K-pop space,&#8221; Nam added.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Mindset is putting its seed funding toward content creation, hiring and product development. The app is currently available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1539382364?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mindset">Android</a>, but it will officially launch on September 14. After that, Mindset will release another audio collection from an artist or actor every two weeks. Nam declined to share who these artists will be. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aileen Lee is one of the most prestigious and successful venture capitalists of the past decade. Before starting her own firm in Cowboy Ventures, Lee was a partner at KPCB for more than 12 years. Her portfolio includes DocSend, Ironclad, Philz Coffee, StyleSeat and many, many more.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Lee join us alongside one of her portfolio company founders, Guild Education&#8217;s Rachel Carlson, on an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-with-cowboy-ventures-and-guild-education?ref=2981607eb662">Click to register for free!</a></p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live brings founders and their investors together to pop the lid off of the black box that is fundraising. How did they meet? Why did they choose each other? What got them to yes? How do they work together now?</p>
<p>These are the pieces of the fundraising process that often aren&#8217;t covered in your average &#8220;how to fundraise&#8221; blog posts and programming, and we&#8217;re here to get these questions answered.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> also features the ECL Pitch-off, which gives folks in the audience the chance to raise their hand and pitch their startup to our guests, who will give their live feedback.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. Let&#8217;s get to know our guests.</p>
<p>Lee has been one of the most sought-after investors in Silicon Valley for as long as I&#8217;ve been in tech. A founding partner at All Raise, she is committed to diversity and inclusion and has an eye for talent, realizing that the former often precedes the latter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She&#8217;s been on the Midas List a handful of times, and is also listed as one of Forbes&#8217; most influential people.</p>
<p>Rachel Carlson founded Guild Education in 2015 and has led the company since. Guild has raised upwards of $370 million from investors that include General Catalyst, Felicis, Bessemer and more.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to these two about how to get to yes, what sings in a pitch deck and how they operate as partners to this day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a blog post this morning, Alphabet drone delivery company Wing announced that it is set to hit 100,000 customer deliveries over the weekend. The news comes on the second anniversary of the service’s pilot launch in Logan, Australia, a city of roughly 300,000 people in the Brisbane metropolitan area.</p>
<p>It also, notably, arrives a few weeks after <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air">Wired reported</a> that Amazon’s own drone delivery efforts are “collapsing inwards.” Wing comms head Jonathan Bass told TechCrunch that the service is set to enter additional markets in the coming months.</p>
<p>“I think we&#8217;ll expand quite a bit,” Bass told TechCrunch. “I think we&#8217;ll launch new services in Australia, Finland and the United States in the next six months. The capabilities of the technology are probably ahead of the regulatory permissions right now.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2193555" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Recording-2021-08-24-at-4.36.05-PM.2021-08-24-16_38_06.gif" alt="" width="800" height="403" /></p>
<p>Of the existing deliveries, more than half were completed in Logan over the course of the last eight months. The first week of August, for instance, found customers place orders for 4,500 deliveries, which works out to one every 30 seconds during Wing’s delivery window.</p>
<p>The numbers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>10,000 cups of coffee</li>
<li>1,700 children’s snack packs</li>
<li>1,200 hot chooks (roasted chicken, in Australian)</li>
<li>2,700 sushi rolls</li>
<li>1,000 loaves of bread</li>
</ul>

That means the trips are fairly short, so there’s not a lot of issue with foodstuffs staying hot or cold, in spite of the package (which resembles a Happy Meal) being transported outside the drone. The primarily limitation, the company says, is weight, with capacity to carry up to three pounds. Apparently the system has had no issues carrying extremely fragile objects like eggs.</p>
<p>The drones cruise at around 100 to 150 feet in the air and lower down to about 23 feet when they reach their destination. From there, a tether lowers the package to the ground and unhooks it. No one is required to receive the package.</p>

<p>“If you combine the test flights with deliveries, it’s close to half-a-million flights over the past four or five years,” says Bass. “We’ve gradually moved into dense environments and listen to communities.” That last bit includes community feedback to reduce the drone’s noise levels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getbalance.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a payments platform aimed at B2B merchants and marketplaces, has raised $25 million in a Series A funding round led by Ribbit Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avid Ventures participated in the financing, in addition to existing backers Lightspeed Ventures, Stripe, Y Combinator Continuity Fund, SciFi VC and UpWest. Other individual investors that put money in the round include early employees and executives from Plaid, Coinbase, Square, Stripe and PayPal, such as </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-reses-938b7850/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jaqueline Reses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, formerly head of Square Capital. The financing comes just over six months after Balance announced </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/lightspeed-and-max-levchin-bet-on-balance-to-bring-b2b-payments-into-the-digital-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $5.5 million seed round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The motivation for starting the company was simple, said CEO and co-founder Bar Geron: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wanted to create an online B2B experience that doesn’t suck.” He and Yoni Shuster, both former PayPal employees, started the company in early 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B2B payments, he said, have historically differed from B2C primarily in that they have not taken place at the moment of purchase (or at the point of sale) but rather within 30 days and with an invoice. This is not an efficient process for merchants or vendors alike, the company maintains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most businesses have avoided paying for their supply with credit cards, because cards can quickly max out, Geron said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only element that keeps many merchants offline is payments,” he told TechCrunch. “It’s a process that is stuck in the flow of those marketplaces and keeping them from scaling. We got fascinated with the problem.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lightspeed and Levchin bet on Balance to bring B2B payments into the digital world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/lightspeed-and-max-levchin-bet-on-balance-to-bring-b2b-payments-into-the-digital-world/embed/#?secret=M6kdToNE24" data-secret="M6kdToNE24" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After starting out at Y Combinator, Balance has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed what it describes as a “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consumer-like B2B checkout platform for merchants and marketplaces,” or a “self-serve digital checkout experience company for B2B businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What that means is that Balance has built a B2B payments platform that allows merchants to offer a variety of payment methods, including ACH, cards, checks and bank wires, as well as a variety of terms, including payment on delivery, net payment terms and payment by milestone. Behind the scenes, Balance underwrites the terms of those transactions requiring financing by evaluating the risk of the customer, the merchant and the specific payment terms selected. Balance is built on top of Stripe and offers all of Stripe’s credit card payment options, but then extends far beyond them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balance, according to Geron, invested “a lot” in APIs for marketplaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a very robust API platform so that these businesses can manage the entire payment flow without being exposed to the risk and regulation of payments,” he told TechCrunch. “And this is all happening without them even touching the funds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plus for merchants is the ability to get immediate payout that is always reconciled like credits. Marketplaces are equipped with automated vendor disbursement, a full compliance umbrella and reconciliation management, Balance says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make the online payments experience for businesses as seamless as it is for consumer payments, and we want to do it globally,” Geron told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has already partnered with e-commerce giants such as BigCommerce and Magento and will soon also work with Salesforce, according to Geron. Its customers range from startups to publicly traded marketplaces to e-commerce enterprises across a variety of industries such as steel, freight, hardware, food ordering, medical supply and apparel. They include Bryzos, Choco, Zilingo and Bay Supply, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s early days yet, but Balance has seen growth of about 500% to 600% since the time of its last raise in February, Geron said. The company, which has offices in Tel Aviv and New York, has about 30 employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jordan Angelos, a general partner at Ribbit and former head of M&amp;A and investment at Stripe, believes the fact that Balance has built its platform specifically for “rapidly scaling” B2B marketplaces and merchants is reflective of a “well-placed” focus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“B2B marketplaces, for example, have a very particular set of payments and capital markets-related needs that can be much more holistically and elegantly solved with Balance&#8217;s flexible toolkit than alternatives,” he wrote via email. “Payments and checkout are two sides of the same coin, and Balance&#8217;s products allow users to address them together to better serve their customers as well as their own margins.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Productivity has been a focal point for many enterprise businesses since before the pandemic hit, and even more so since its onset. But <a href="https://www.macro.io/">Macro</a> founders Ankith Harathi and John Keck are taking a different tack.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Zoom SDK-powered product has been reimagined by its team, and is relaunching today.</p>
<p>When Macro first launched into beta, with $4.3 million in seed capital led by FirstMark, the idea was that Zoom calls lacked the infrastructure to be truly useful (and equitable). As a solution, the company created a Zoom overlay that allowed users to type in action items, takeaways, etc. right in the call. Macro would then transfer all that information into a Google Doc and send it to attendees.</p>
<p>The product also gave users the option to choose their layout, including a skin that would just show thumbnails of attendees over the browser or application of choice, rather than taking up the whole screen. It even had a feature called Airtime that showed how much each individual was talking during a meeting, ensuring that everyone&#8217;s voices are heard.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that final feature, and the feedback of Macro users, that culminated in this relaunch. Shifting away from its early productivity bend, Macro is now focusing on self-expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the future of video communications, one of our most intimate forms of communication, will be super personalized. You and I are fundamentally very different people,&#8221; Harathi said to me over Zoom. &#8220;But we are in the Zoom era, and we&#8217;re all using the same really generic interface regardless of how different we are.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="G4A5fCBcQ1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/macro-just-raised-4-3m-to-make-your-never-ending-zoom-calls-more-useful/">Macro just raised $4.3M to make your never-ending Zoom calls more useful</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Macro just raised $4.3M to make your never-ending Zoom calls more useful&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/macro-just-raised-4-3m-to-make-your-never-ending-zoom-calls-more-useful/embed/#?secret=G4A5fCBcQ1" data-secret="G4A5fCBcQ1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new Macro allows users to personalize their interface and express themselves, using shapes, colors, filters and more. In fact, the company is working alongside some big-name artists (TBA) to offer users special reactions within their Zoom calls. Whether or not other members of the call are using Macro, they&#8217;ll still see you the way you present yourself using the service.</p>
<p>Some features from the original iteration of Macro remain, such as Airtime. Harathi and Keck explained to TechCrunch that the main feedback they received on the product at launch, back in July of 2020, was that its features around self-expression and inclusivity were resonating the most with users, and that few folks were actually making use of the service&#8217;s productivity suite.</p>
<p>Macro is also reintroducing the skin that allowed users to hang out (and see each other in Zoom) while working collaboratively in some other application, calling it Rooms. Macro currently works with MacOS.</p>
<p>The company is keeping its bottoms-up approach to growth, offering the product for free to anyone who wants to use it, without having to get an entire organization on board.</p>
<p>Macro is riding the Zoom wave as the video conferencing behemoth shifts focus to its app ecosystem. Harathi and Keck believe that Macro is to video conferencing what Superhuman is to email, with the main caveat being that Macro is doubling down on self-expression over productivity.</p>
<p>They believe that the UI winner has a lot to gain as the protocol of video meetings continues to prosper, and the company is aiming to be that winner.</p>
