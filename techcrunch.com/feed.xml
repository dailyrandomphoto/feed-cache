					<description><![CDATA[Over the past two weeks, Anna Heim has interviewed Bashir from Arbisoft. They were recommended to us through our survey; we'd love to know which software consultants you'd recommend to other startups.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;In 2007, I, along with a few other colleagues, founded Arbisoft because we loved solving a variety of computing problems rather than staying close to one particular domain or technology vertical. We felt it was much easier to do that in a software services company than a software product company,&#8221; says Yasser Bashir, co-founder of Arbisoft. &#8220;In addition to our love for software development, we also had strong ideas on the kind of culture that would likely inspire smart people to do their best in a technology-focused organization. Arbisoft is a manifestation of many of those ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, Anna Heim has interviewed Bashir from Arbisoft as part of our Experts project. They were recommended to us through our <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">survey;</a> we&#8217;d love to know which software consultants you&#8217;d recommend to other startups. We also had guest columns focused on growth marketing about growth tactics and early-stage comm teams, but more on that below.</p>
<h2>Software Consulting</h2>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="https://arbisoft.com/">Arbisoft</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Omri Traub, CEO of <a href="https://www.popcart.com/">Popcart</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“We were able to create a high-performance dev team that includes dev, QA and DevOps. We had access to top talent and, importantly, elasticity in hiring. If we wanted to add a developer, we could have an incredible one join our team in under one week. It would have taken us weeks and months to recruit and hire a developer in Boston or the U.S.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222579" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="https://www.solwey.com/ ">Solwey Consulting</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Paul Shaked, <a href="https://sandlandsleep.com/">Sandland</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“They helped us tremendously &#8212; a not so great dev team in Europe built our site with no documentation and lots of sloppy code, but Solwey was able to come in and sort through everything. Not to mention, our e-comm site is built on a headless CMS x Shopify checkout. Solwey was one of the only teams that was able to jump in and really get things to a good place with almost no major delays due to tech debt.”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant:</strong> <a href="https://managedkube.com/">Planetary</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Ryan Doney, <a href="https://getadlunam.com/">Ad Lunam </a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“I vetted several different consultancies, and Planetary not only brought technical expertise to the table, but their startup-specific mindset meant that it was incredibly easy to get aligned on our mission, and how to best build it. Josh is a great talent, and he&#8217;s built a remarkable team. Their work dramatically cut down our time to market, as well as giving us a ready-made jumping off point to start iterating on our product.”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant:</strong> <a href="https://managedkube.com/">OpenCubicles</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Anonymous<br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“The OpenCubicles team helped us improve our infrastructure utilization, response time and other aspects critical to e-commerce success. We were able to rationalize cloud infrastructure costs due to thorough analysis and optimization. They helped us automate many aspects of operations. Would recommend to those looking for reliable technology services, especially e-commerce development.”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="https://www.thinknimble.com/">ThinkNimble</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Philip Deng, <a href="https://grantable.co/">Grantable</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“They are focused on helping startups succeed and they care deeply about the missions of the companies they help. They brought us way forward in terms of our design and also connected us with lots of thoughtful people beyond the company who have helped us move forward.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/arbisoft-co-founder-yasser-bashir-on-building-trust-with-early-stage-startups/">Arbisoft co-founder Yasser Bashir on building trust with early-stage startups:</a> Anna and Bashir spoke about how Arbisoft has grown over the past 13 years, how they build trust with their clients and the startup scene in Pakistan. Bashir says, &#8220;I have been very involved with the startup and tech ecosystem in the country since its inception. It is indeed taking off like a rocket ship right now, and we couldn’t be more excited about it. This year, startups raised more funding than all of the previous years combined. Arbisoft is excited because many of these startups need technology services, and therefore, we have a new and exhilarating market at our disposal.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Growth Marketing</h2>
<p><strong>Marketer:</strong> Ki from <a href="https://within.co/">WITHIN</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Anonymous<br />
<strong>Testimonial:</strong> “Ki has been supporting our business for over three years, and every time he finds unique ways to exceed expectations. From launching new products that sell out in days rather than weeks, being able to onboard new members of our team so they can contribute faster, and being someone that can work at a strategic level with our VPs and at the data-driven level with analysts, his range is truly outstanding and I believe he is in the 1% of the 1% of marketers.”</p>
<p><strong>Marketer:</strong> Kaveh from <a href="https://within.co/">WITHIN</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Anonymous<br />
<strong>Testimonial:</strong> “Kaveh is one of the most empathetic and collaborative marketers I have ever worked with. Our team was largely brand marketers and Kaveh did a great job of bridging their world and our profit-optimized media strategy seamlessly (even if it meant an after-hours marketing jam session). Not only that, but you could tell he really cared about the brand, catching small issues with the site and sharing them with the team proactively, etc.”</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 400px;" data-tf-widget="bwwIWF03"></div>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/smart-growth-tactics-can-put-account-based-marketing-within-reach-for-startups-and-smbs/">(TechCrunch+) Smart growth tactics put account-based marketing within reach for startups and SMBs:</a> Jonas van de Poel, head of content marketing at Unmuted, says, “F​​or many startups and SMBs, successfully setting up account-based marketing strategies can feel like a pipe dream. Startups still struggling to find product-market fit wouldn’t dream of being able to identify and map out their ideal customer profile (ICP) clearly enough. At the same time, small and midsize businesses often lack the resources to invest in elaborate multitouch-point content marketing strategies.” Van de Poel shares what account-based marketing is, the importance of mapping a customers journey to marketing content and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/hiring-is-just-the-first-step-when-building-an-early-stage-comms-team/">(TechCrunch+) Hiring is just the first step when building an early-stage comms team:</a> Yousuf Khan, partner at Ridge Ventures, writes about not just the importance of having an early-stage comms team, but the importance of communicating with them. Khan says, “It’s not just important to have relationships between executives and media — you should have solid relationships with your comms people, too. Allow them to get to know you, your likes and dislikes, the environments in which you thrive and where you feel most comfortable.”</p>

<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Three Easy Steps to Capture Global Opportunities<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by KUDO</em><br />
As our economy becomes increasingly global, is your business prepared to succeed? KUDO co-founder and CEO Fardad Zabetian shares his insights on how to capture global opportunities.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Data Warehouse — The Foundation of the Modern Data Stack<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by RudderStack<br />
</em>The modern data stack is changing rapidly, with new technology emerging every day. Increasingly, though, architectures are being built around the data warehouse. In this panel discussion, Ben Gotfredson, global startup program manager at Snowflake, and Adam Gross, ex-CEO at Heroku, join RudderStack founder and CEO Soumyadeb Mitra to discuss why this new architecture has emerged, what specific technologies are driving the trend and what the data stack of the future looks like.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>9 Security Tips For Startups<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by Vanta<br />
</em>When startups are in the beginning stages of growth, it becomes harder to balance between taking necessary security measures and bringing the product to market. You don’t want to slow iteration speed, but you also know that there are security steps that need to happen in order to grow the business. How do you balance these competing objectives? Christina Cacioppo, co-founder and CEO of Vanta, shares nine practical tips for building your product with security in mind and how to engage in conversations around security expectations from the start.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong><span class="schedule-item__title">Disrupting Product Innovation<br />
</span></strong></span><em>Presented by Onshape, a PTC Business</em><br />
Innovation is a business imperative in today’s global economy. In fact, 84% of executives say innovation is key to their growth strategy, according to a McKinsey report. While companies need to innovate at scale to stay competitive, engineers need the right tools to avoid the many challenges associated with the product development process. In this session, hear Jon Hirschtick’s entrepreneurial journey and how cloud and SaaSification of the industry can accelerate product innovation as well as tips on scaling businesses into multimillion-dollar companies.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Accelerate your growth using agile market research throughout the product lifecycle<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by Momentive.ai<br />
</em>Conducting market research at each stage of your product lifecycle is a critical component to a successful product launch and sustained growth in an increasingly competitive market. While traditional market research can be costly and require a specialized team, agile market research software makes it possible for anyone on your team to get the insights you need fast. Join Momentive.ai to learn how to conduct your own market research to identify what kinds of products and features users value most, get insight into the competitive landscape and track your brand’s awareness and shifting perceptions over time.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>How do High-growth Companies Use Technology to Inform Strategy and Drive Results?<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by SAP<br />
</em>Fast-growing companies are in a constant state of transition, as high performance and growth can lead to ever-changing business priorities and challenges. Hear from a couple of SAP’s hypergrowth customers about how they use technology to inform their strategy and ultimately drive business results. SAP Managing Director, Midmarket and Ecosystem, Greg Petraetis will share how businesses grow from being innovators to disruptors to category leaders and how the technology they choose can impact the future of their business productivity.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Optimizing SaaS Productivity — Why SaaS Sprawl Prohibits Growth?<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by LeanIX</em><br />
SaaS represents an increasing share of the installed software estate — in cloud-born companies, often 100%. If not managed and optimized, an uncontrolled adoption leads to SaaS sprawl, sometimes called “Shadow IT.” Sub-optimized usage of SaaS subscriptions, increased risk and audit exposures will become a headache when scaling a business. André Christ, LeanIX co-founder and CEO, leads this talk illustrating frequent pitfalls and proposes the needed processes, skills and capabilities of the emerging SaaS management discipline for CEOs, CFOs and CIOs.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Things Fall Apart At $10MM ARR: Lessons For Growing Your SaaS Company<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by <span class="sponsors-label__sponsor-name">Vista Equity Partners<br />
</span></em>The strategies that get you to $10 million ARR look very different to those that get you to $50 million or even $100 million. At the $10 million growth inflection point, most software companies need to pivot their approach and often find they are facing new &#8212; often seemingly insurmountable &#8212; challenges. The team at Vista Equity Partners &#8212; one of the largest enterprise software investors in the world with over $81 billion AUM &#8212; have worked with many founders and companies to successfully bridge this transition. In this session, Rene Stewart, co-head of Vista’s growth-stage Endeavor Fund, discusses the missteps and misconceptions around software company growth and what you can do to achieve success that scales beyond $10 million ARR.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Taking Your People from Startup to Scale<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by SAP<br />
</em>As your business grows, you need to help your people grow with you. And, in a world that is transforming faster than ever, the methods of developing your team don’t cut it. In this session you’ll hear from Max Wessel, chief learning officer at SAP, about how to build a culture and workforce that is flexible, adaptable and fit for a rocket ship.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Future Forward — How Machine Learning and Human-in-the-Loop Approaches Are Expanding the Capabilities of Automation<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by AKASA<br />
</em>Digital transformation efforts in a number of industries have driven massive adoption of robotic process automation (RPA) over the past decade. The hard truth is that RPA is a decades-old technology that is brittle, with real limits to its capabilities. It will always have some value in automating work that is simple, discrete and linear. However, the reason automation efforts often fall short of their aspirations is because so much of life is complex and constantly evolving — too much work falls outside of the capabilities of RPA. In this talk, Varun Ganapathi, co-founder and CTO of AKASA, will discuss how exceptions and outliers can actually make automation stronger and how emerging machine-learning-based technology platforms combined with human-in-the-loop approaches are already expanding what it is possible to automate across a number of industries.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Friday! Dear friends, we <em>made</em> it to the end of the week. It was a big, busy few days, so give yourself a round of applause. Looking ahead, not only do we have earnings from Facebook and Alphabet and Microsoft and Robinhood next week, but our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/well-be-discussing-why-its-automations-moment-at-tc-sessions-saas-on-oct-27th/">super-great SaaS event is taking place on Wednesday</a>. I’m hosting and doing a panel or two, so see you there for all the fun! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/the-trump-spac-is-doing-stonk-things-which-is-hilarious/"><strong>Public markets welcome Trump SPAC:</strong></a> Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s new media company announced yesterday that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">go public via a SPAC-led transaction</a>. Today, investors spent quite a lot of money bidding up shares in the blank-check company that will take Trump Media and Technology Group public. In retrospect, however, of <em>course</em> the SPAC became a memestock given its lack of fundamentals or, well, product.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/snap-q-3-2021-earnings/"><strong>Snap suffers from supply-chain, Apple woes:</strong></a> U<strong>.</strong>S. social networking company Snap saw around a fifth of its value disappear today after it reported earnings following the end of trading yesterday. In short, despite a pretty good quarter, Snap’s growth expectations for Q4 were way under expectations. Why? Changes to iOS from Apple and supply-chain issues leading to reduced advertiser demand. TechCrunch also discussed how Snap’s issues help <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">make the argument for Facebook’s metaverse push</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/brex-raises-300m-at-a-12-3b-valuation/"><strong>Brex raises again (again):</strong></a><strong> </strong>The corporate spend and expense reporting market can apparently absorb an infinite amount of capital, a fact that we learned again recently after TechCrunch broke the news that Brex once again raised more money at a higher price. This may kick off fundraising for Brex’s various competitors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We have our usual run of startup news below, but before we get into that, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/working-to-understand-rent-the-runways-ipo-valuation/">spent a few words today thinking through Rent the Runway’s expected IPO price range</a> and how it stacks up against related companies. We have questions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/intelligent-implants-seed-round/"><strong>Startup hopes to help you grow backbone:</strong></a><strong> </strong>We really shouldn’t make spine-based jokes given that someone will find them in poor taste, but <a href="https://twitter.com/haje">Haje Jan Kamps</a> started with his headline, so please direct all complaints in that direction. Regardless, Intelligent Implants has raised $8.7 million for its health-focused hardware that could help with back health.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/how-lunchclub-landed-a-preemptive-term-sheet-from-lightspeed/">How Lunchclub landed a preemptive term sheet from Lightspeed:</a></strong> One of TechCrunch’s best &#8212; if also best-hidden &#8212; talents, <a href="https://twitter.com/NeeshaTambe">Neesha Tambe</a> wrote up a recent talk we had with a startup concerning how it managed to raise preemptive cash from a major investor. Founders, this is for you.</li>

Here’s hoping that the startup uses the funds to help make meals and doesn’t make a meal out of it.</li>

<h2>Hiring is just the first step when building an early-stage comms team</h2>
<p>There are a few places where founders can cut corners, but your first comms hire is not one of them. Companies that choose not to invest in finding the best person for this role will inevitably regret it later.</p>
<p>Since these are the people tasked with bringing your message to the outside world, &#8220;look for a strategic partner rather than a manager,&#8221; advises Yousuf Khan, partner at Ridge Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should be able to discuss your product and industry as well as anyone on your sales team. If that sounds like a tall order, it is — yet another reason to properly invest in the role.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage entrepreneurs who are eager to ship usually spend more time calculating their startup’s monthly burn rate than selecting an optimal development environment.</p>
<p>As a result, technical debt starts to accumulate. And accumulate.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Senior Writer Romain Dillet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/how-do-you-select-the-right-tech-stack/">interviewed Jill Wetzler, VP of Engineering at Pilot, and Preeti Somal, EVP of Engineering at HashiCorp</a>, to learn more about how they evaluate third-party vendors, select open-source components and think ahead with regard to engineering capabilities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222614" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<hr />
<p>“All you’re doing that sprint is working off your tech debt backlog,” said Somal. “I think the really key thing is to recognize it, find a strategy to work with it, and don’t let it build to a point where it just feels like you’re going to take a massive hit on productivity.”</p>
<p>Their discussion, which took place at TechCrunch Disrupt, also addressed the value of using test suites and selecting a reliable continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) framework.</p>
<p>“What are the things that can help our team move really fast and ship really fast?” asked Wetzler. “Because I think that is the name of the game when you’re talking about a startup. It just comes down to how you can get your code out the door as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading TechCrunch+, and I hope you have an excellent weekend.</p>

<p>Offering consumers affordable options for high-end clothing and accessories is innovative, but Rent the Runway’s recent IPO filing makes the company’s “overall business profile” look “unsteady,” writes Alex Wilhelm in today’s edition of The Exchange.</p>
<p>But because its price range indicates that Rent the Runway is a unicorn in waiting, “we have to take it seriously.”</p>

<p>The tide is high for startup founders who are looking to raise their first round in October 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But easy money can create special pressure for early-stage founders, according to Lightup.ai founder Manu Bansal.</p>
<p>“You can’t speed up GTM with more money. If valuations go up astronomically, I remind myself that I have to deliver performance,” he says.</p>
<p>“If I cannot show traction, sooner or later this beast will come back to haunt me. I’d rather avoid the price runners.”</p>

<p>Plaid has steadily expanded its payments toolkit for years, but yesterday, it unveiled new services that integrate its infrastructure deeper with partners’ payment flow.</p>
<p>It is a potential game-changer, as millions of merchants “now have a low-cost alternative to avoid credit card processing fees that cut into their margins,” writes Ryan Lawler.</p>

<p>Fintech in Latin America is on fire, and nowhere more so than in Mexico — startups in the sector roped in nearly 20% of all capital invested in the region last year.</p>
<p>“Considering that nearly 40 million people in Mexico (almost a third of the population) are unbanked, fintech has been a necessary vehicle for fresh routes for credit, insurance and remittances,” writes Jen Laloup, CEO of Mobile Growth Association.</p>

<p>Technology should enhance customer service operations, but automation can risk making the experience feel a little robotic.</p>
<p>Joyce Lee, Alorica’s chief culture officer, shares four actionable steps companies can take to foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with an inclusive onboarding process.</li>
<li>Host interactive forums.</li>
<li>Implement an ongoing speaker series.</li>
<li>Define your commitment.</li>
</ul>
<p>“The more diverse your people are, the more they can relate to a diverse customer base,” she writes.</p>

<p>In other IPO news, edtech provider Udemy could well be worth more than $4 billion after its upcoming debut, which it expects to price at $27-$29 per share.</p>
<p>“It’s a modest bump in worth for the company, which was last valued at $3.32 billion during its $50 million November raise,” write Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm, who studied its S-1/A filing.</p>
<p>But slowing revenue growth means the company will need to convince potential investors that its business has more mountains to climb.</p>
<p>“While few would argue that digitization and rapid re-skilling are impacting workforces across the world, some may need to be convinced that enterprise edtech is the solution to the resulting gaps.”</p>

<p>There are a few places where startup founders can cut corners, but your first comms hire is not one of them.</p>
<p>Companies that choose not to invest in finding the best person for this role will inevitably regret it later. Since these are the people tasked with bringing your message to the outside world, &#8220;look for a strategic partner rather than a manager,&#8221; advises Yousuf Khan, partner at Ridge Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should be able to discuss your product and industry as well as anyone on your sales team. If that sounds like a tall order, it is — yet another reason to properly invest in the role.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Zillow announced that it was hitting pause on its iBuying operations earlier this week, but rival Opendoor says it is expanding operations and plowing ahead.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Zillow announced that it was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-17/zillow-pauses-home-purchases-as-snags-hit-tech-powered-flipping?sref=1SlQD502">hitting pause on its iBuying operations</a> earlier this week, the news sent shockwaves through the real estate industry.</p>
<p>Zillow blamed the pause on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/zillow-gets-outplayed-at-its-own-game-11634551201">labor and supply constraints</a> that were hampering its ability to quickly renovate and efficiently turn over its housing inventory. The announcement sent Zillow’s stock plummeting 10% in the day after the report, while driving competitor Opendoor higher.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The key to Opendoor’s recent market expansion can be tied to a fundamental retooling of its playbook for launching in a new city or region.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Given the overlap between operations &#8212; Opendoor is in 23 of the 25 markets where Zillow was purchasing homes &#8212; there was some question about whether Opendoor was affected by the same shortages. But while Zillow is pulling back, Opendoor says it is plowing ahead.</p>
<p>Over the past nine months, Opendoor has aggressively expanded operations and has been growing its inventory. The company purchased 8,500 homes in the second quarter &#8212; more than double Zillow’s tally &#8212; and said it had contracts to purchase another 8,200 homes in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Shortly after Zillow confirmed the pause in its iBuying operation, Opendoor issued a statement which said, “We know how important certainty and convenience are to homeowners seeking to move and we’ve worked hard over the past seven years to ensure we can continue to deliver our experience at scale. Opendoor is open for business and continues to scale and grow.”</p>
<p>Basically, Opendoor has no plans to slow down anytime soon. The company can cite a combination of proprietary data, centralized operations and an increasingly digital process for evaluating homes and making offers as just some of the reasons why it has been able to more than double the number of markets it operates in over the past nine months.</p>
<h2>Data, data, everywhere</h2>
<p>The key to any successful iBuying business is the use of data to make a competitive offer to sellers while also having a strong understanding of the price you can expect to garner when you put the home back up for sale.</p>
<p>That data, and how you model it, becomes even more crucial in a dynamic real estate market like the one that has emerged over the past 18 months, where historically low interest rates and unprecedented demand constrained inventory and led to home price appreciation in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>“Our job as a company is to provide a really compelling and competitive offer to sellers,” said Opendoor CTO Ian Wong. “If we can&#8217;t offer a competitive offer on the single largest asset most people have, they simply won&#8217;t take [it].”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like it or not, memes are part of how we communicate now &#8212; we even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/the-trump-spac-is-doing-stonk-things-which-is-hilarious/">reference memes</a> in our headlines. But iterating upon existing memes can be a needlessly <a href="https://imgflip.com/">clunky</a> user experience. First, you need to find a meme template, then you need to figure out how to add text, even if that means reverse-engineering Instagram story drafts into photo-editing software.</p>
<p>But instead of scrolling through Google images, looking for a clean template of the latest meme, <a href="https://antimatter.systems/">Antimatter</a>&#8216;s Reverse Meme Search app, released today for web and iOS, does the work for you. Just upload a meme, and the app will return you a blank slate. You can even long press a photo on apps like Reddit and Twitter, and when iOS prompts you to choose where to share the image, you can click on the Reverse app icon. Once the template is identified, you can use the app&#8217;s built-in photo editor to add text to the meme and choose the text&#8217;s font, color, size and location. You can&#8217;t use comic sans on the app, which feels like an intentional omission.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/etCL7CXlbQo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222556" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch tested the app&#8217;s capabilities &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/the-red-flag-meme-is-a-red-flag-for-accessibility/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">Spider-Man pointing meme</a> was easy enough to reverse engineer, but we quickly stumped the Reverse Meme Search with a deep-fried Owen Wilson meme (it&#8217;s the <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xgRdTevf9P4/maxresdefault.jpg">first result on Google Images</a> when you search &#8220;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/zmm885/how-to-deep-fry-a-meme">deep-fried memes</a>,&#8221; but not necessarily a template itself). But, fear not, the app comes with a free Meme Concierge. Less than an hour after submitting our request, we received an email with the subject, &#8220;We found your template: Owen Wilson Deep Fried Meme.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be honest, even those of us who got fine arts minors in college and still borrow the university&#8217;s Adobe subscription (don&#8217;t tell them!) probably couldn&#8217;t cleanly edit the text and emojis off of a deep-fried meme on Photoshop (or, we just have other things to do). So this is actually a useful service, even if the &#8220;Meme Concierge&#8221; is just, as the email says, &#8220;a human with 16 GB of RAM and two USB-C ports.&#8221;</p>

<p>Antimatter founder Jonathan Libov wouldn&#8217;t tell us how the app works &#8212; is it essentially just a reverse image search, where the app needs to recognize what meme you&#8217;re looking for to send back the template you want? Or does the app use some tech wizardry to automatically clear the text from the image? It&#8217;s probably a reverse image search, seeing as we stumped the app with deep-fried Owen Wilson, but now, anyone who tries to make their own deep-fried Owen Wilson meme won&#8217;t need to use the concierge, because the template is now in their system. I even checked their work, uploading a copy of the image with added text.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;We envision this app as Instapaper and Pinterest plus Figma. The two key features are (A), collecting visuals (eventually more than just meme templates &#8212; any visual that you find useful and meaningful) that you (B), store in your library,&#8221; Libov told TechCrunch. &#8220;Antimatter is actually a P2P learning and education company, and Reverse Meme Search is part of the creation experience that we just wanted the world to have sooner rather than later.&#8221; Antimatter says on its <a href="https://antimatter.systems/">website</a> that it&#8217;s &#8220;inspired by the many great learning meme communities on the internet.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/">introduced</a> a new set of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store Guidelines</a> that include three key changes. One of the changes is the result of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/">previously announced</a> settlement agreement with a class of U.S. app developers. It clarifies that developers are allowed to communicate with their customers about other payment methods available outside their app. Related to this, another new guideline explains that apps may request customer information like name and email, but the request must be optional for the user and shouldn&#8217;t prevent them from using the app.</p>
<p>The third guideline is unrelated to legal action, and simply details how developers can use a new App Store feature, called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=zghdvfza">in-app events</a>, which rolls out next week.</p>
<p>In August, Apple first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/">announced</a> it had reached a proposed settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed against it in 2019 by a group of U.S. app developers. The agreement included a few items, but the biggest was that developers would be able to share information with their users about how to pay for purchases outside their iOS app and the App Store. At the time, Apple said the changes would clarify that developers &#8220;can use communications, such as emails, to share information about payment methods outside of their iOS app.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222622" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;As always, developers will not pay Apple a commission on any purchases taking place outside of their app or the App Stores,&#8221; Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-us-developers-agree-to-app-store-updates/">had also said</a>.</p>
<p>Now those proposed changes are officially part of the App Store Guidelines.</p>
<p>Specifically, Apple deleted a clause from guideline 3.1.3 that had previously said developers were not permitted to use information obtained within their app to target individual users outside of the app to use purchasing methods other than Apple&#8217;s own in-app purchases. The old rule had also said this would include sending out emails to the address on file obtained when the customer signed up for the app.</p>
<p>With this clause gone, developers are no longer barred from those sorts of communications.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple also added a new section to guideline 5.1.1 (x) that explains further how developers may go about requesting user contact information. It says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apps may request basic contact information (such as name and email address) so long as the request is optional for the user, features and services are not conditional on providing the information, and it complies with all other provisions of these guidelines, including limitations on collecting information from kids.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rules against contacting customers, or what is referred to as &#8220;anti-steering&#8221; guidelines, is an area that has become the subject of much regulatory scrutiny in recent months. Lawmakers around the world have been working to determine if Apple is acting as a monopolist by limiting how developers can run their own businesses in terms of customer outreach, marketing and payment systems choice.</p>
<p>Already, Apple was being forced to adjust its App Store rules due to various settlements in specific markets.</p>
<p>South Korea, for instance, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">passed</a> new legislation that bans Apple and Google from requiring that developers use their respective payment systems. In Japan, Apple last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/">reached a settlement</a> with regulators over &#8220;reader&#8221; apps that now allows them to link to their own websites from within their apps.</p>
<p>In the U.S., meanwhile, Apple is engaged in a lawsuit with Fortnite maker Epic Games. Though the case is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">now under appeal</a>, the judge&#8217;s original ruling would have required Apple to allow developers to point to their own websites within their apps, where customers could then pay directly for its services or subscriptions, bypassing Apple&#8217;s payment systems in the process.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s changes don&#8217;t go so far as to allow alternative payment systems to be embedded directly in their apps, however.</p>
<p>The anti-steering updates are only one area where regulatory pressure has been playing a role in pushing the tech giants to adopt new policies.</p>
<p>Apple and Google have both also adjusted their commission structures to lower their cut of developers&#8217; revenues in different ways, including for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">smaller businesses</a>, apps that provide <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/google-lowers-play-store-fees-to-15-on-subscriptions-apps-as-low-as-10-for-media-apps/">access to media</a> and apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/">run by news publishers</a>. Google this week<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/google-lowers-play-store-fees-to-15-on-subscriptions-apps-as-low-as-10-for-media-apps/"> lowered its fees to 15%</a> for subscription-based apps from day one, instead of 30% during the first year which lowered to 15% in year two. It also lowered commissions to as much as 10% for specific media apps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222558" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222558" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2222558 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1151" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222558" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The other new rule arriving today is related to in-app events and <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">simply guidance as to how the new feature can be used. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-to-introduce-a-b-testing-and-in-app-events-to-the-app-store/">Announced at WWDC</a>, in-app events give app makers a better way to showcase things taking place inside their apps, like game competitions, movie premieres, livestreamed experiences and more. The events will begin to appear on the App Store starting on October 27 with the release of the iOS 15.1 update.</p>
<p>Apple advises developers to ensure the metadata is accurate and related to the event specifically when entered in App Store Connect and that the events must run on the dates selected, including across multiple storefronts. It also specifies the deeplink must launch the event directly when tapped, and notes events can be monetizable.</p>
<p>All three rule <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">changes</a> are live as of today.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Arbisoft is the latest addition to our series profiling startup software consultants. Its CEO Yasser Bashir shared thoughts on agile development, data science, customer and employee satisfaction, etc.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Co-founded in 2007 by Yasser Bashir, <a href="https://arbisoft.com/">Arbisoft</a> falls on the larger end of the spectrum of software development partners that our readers have recommended in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">our ongoing survey</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the company has a few hundred employees distributed across Pakistan, Australia, Texas and Malaysia, but it continues to service startups of all sizes, says Bashir.</p>
<p>Omri Traub, CEO of e-commerce startup <a href="https://www.popcart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popcart</a>, told TechCrunch that their company has worked with Arbisoft since its early stages.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220868" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We had access to top talent and, importantly, elasticity in hiring. If we wanted to add a developer, we could have an incredible one join our team in under one week,&#8221; said Traub. &#8220;It would have taken us weeks and months to recruit and hire a developer in Boston or the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221693" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221693" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2221693 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Arbisoft-CEO-Yasser-Bashir.jpg?w=300" alt="Arbisoft CEO Yasser Bashir" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Arbisoft-CEO-Yasser-Bashir.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Arbisoft-CEO-Yasser-Bashir.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Arbisoft-CEO-Yasser-Bashir.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Arbisoft-CEO-Yasser-Bashir.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Arbisoft-CEO-Yasser-Bashir.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Arbisoft-CEO-Yasser-Bashir.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Arbisoft-CEO-Yasser-Bashir.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Arbisoft-CEO-Yasser-Bashir.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221693" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yasser Bashir</p></div></p>
<p>According to Anna Bailey, product manager at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/ad-supported-ev-charging-network-developer-volta-raises-125-million/">Volta Charging</a>, &#8220;help [from Arbisoft] has allowed us to build reliably and at a large scale without having to burden our internal engineers.&#8221;</p>
<p>We spoke to Bashir to learn more about how Arbisoft works with its clients, most of whom &#8220;have either closed or are about to close Series A rounds,&#8221; he said. In our conversation, he discussed agile development, data science, customer and employee satisfaction.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><b>Can you briefly tell us about your background and what inspired you to create Arbisoft?</b></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Yasser Bashir:</strong> I was 10 when my father bought me and my brother a Commodore 64. In the little town that I grew up in, we were among the only three families that owned a computer. I know very few people who used one of those C-64 machines in the 80s and didn&#8217;t end up loving computers or computer science. I was no exception. I went on to get an undergraduate degree in computer science from the top CS school in my home country and later ended up at Stanford University for a graduate degree.</p>
<p>Each of those steps paved the way, in one way or another, toward a career in computing in general and the creation of a technology company in particular.</p>
<p>In 2007, I, along with a few other colleagues, founded Arbisoft because we loved solving a variety of computing problems rather than staying close to one particular domain or technology vertical. We felt it was much easier to do that in a software services company than a software product company.</p>
<p>In addition to our love for software development, we also had strong ideas on the kind of culture that would likely inspire smart people to do their best in a technology-focused organization. Arbisoft is a manifestation of many of those ideas.</p>
<p><b>How has Arbisoft evolved since its creation 13 years ago, and and how did it grow?</b></p>
<p>What started with three people in 2007 is now one of the most successful software companies in our region. We have almost 750 people, mostly engineering staff, and we are software development partners for many organizations that are leaders in their verticals, including KAYAK, MIT, edX, Insurify and many others.</p>
<p>Almost all of our growth has been organic; companies that have had a great experience of outsourcing their software development needs to us strongly recommend our services to others. Not surprisingly, we consistently get a net promoter score of 75 or above from our customers in our biannual NPS surveys. Our growth is a direct consequence of our customers promoting us to others.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best software consultants for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><b>How is your team structured?</b></p>
<p>Arbisoft is structured as a network of independent, cross-functional teams. Each team is typically working on just one client project at any given time. We strongly believe in autonomous, self-managed teams that are agile and constantly evolving to improve their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Among the many books that have shaped my thinking on organizational structures, one of the most important is Frédéric Laloux&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reinventingorganizations.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Reinventing Organizations.&#8221;</a> His concepts for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal_organisation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teal organizations</a> are very ambitious — sometimes overly idealistic — but definitely paint a picture of an organization that is way more evolved than the majority of companies in the world today. In shaping our team structures, we have borrowed many ideas from the book.</p>
<p><b>What range of services do you provide? Why did you choose to go full-stack and beyond?</b></p>
<p>Our range of services, by virtue of our size, is pretty wide. We provide full-stack web and mobile app development, DevOps for cloud computing, machine learning, AI, UI/UX/product design, project management, and manual and automated software QA. Basically, we provide most, if not all, of the services that may be needed by a modern tech startup to get to a production-ready solution. Beyond launch, we continue to support our customers with maintenance, bug fixing and new feature development.</p>
<p><b>Among your clients, at what stages are the startups that you work with? How early-stage can they be?</b></p>
<p>We work with startups across all stages of their evolution, but more typically with ones that have either closed or are about to close Series A rounds. There is no restriction on the startup stage as such though. For the right idea, we can start at its very inception.</p>
<p><b>How do you build trust with your clients that make them potentially willing to rely on Arbisoft for all of their engineering needs?</b></p>
<p>Openness and transparency are fundamental enablers of the trust our clients have in us. We make sure we represent our capabilities exactly how they are so that we can set the right expectations and exceed them whenever possible. Our teams working on client projects are seamlessly embedded into the clients&#8217; own teams and, for all practical purposes, work as if they are a part of the clients&#8217; business.</p>
<p>Vulnerability also plays a role in building that trust — when we make mistakes, we are open about sharing them and learning from them, so that they are not repeated. Other agile principles help too but <i>blameless retros</i> are probably the most effective tool in openly discussing and learning from mistakes.</p>
<p><b>Can you tell us more about the data side of Arbisoft?</b></p>
<p>For quite a few of our customers, our primary service is collecting, cleaning, analyzing and presenting data. We have developed deep expertise in libraries and frameworks that assist with our data science practice. From the get-go (no pun intended), Python was one of our go-to languages. Luckily, Python is one of the strongest languages for dealing with data. Libraries like Scrapy, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Plotly, etc. come in really handy for all of our data science needs and we have pretty deep expertise in them.</p>
<p><b>You also built <a href="https://arbisoft.com/solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solutions</a> such as Edly, ListenTool and more — can you tell us about these and why you are doing it?</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a great question. Considering that Arbisoft is a reasonably sized organization now, we often need technology to manage our processes more efficiently and maintain our leadership position as a software services provider. When we are unable to find a good match for our needs, we build solutions to solve our own problems. If it works for us, we then productify the solution so it can solve similar problems for other organizations.</p>
<p>For example, we built <a href="https://listentool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ListenTool</a> because Arbisoft is big on frequent, instance-based feedback. We built <a href="https://edly.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edly</a> because we found ourselves frequently building custom learning management systems (LMS) for our customers and it seemed natural to abstract many of the complexities of an online learning solution into a customizable product offering.</p>
<p>This has been a successful strategy and we are likely to continue building such products in the future as well. We are also spinning off some of these products into organizations that can sustain and grow themselves independently of Arbisoft.</p>
<p><b>Why do you have offices in Texas, Australia and Malaysia in addition to Pakistan, and what are the advantages of this setup and locations?</b></p>
<p>Most of these locations are front offices closer to where our customers are. Since 80% of our customers are in the U.S., it really helps to have a presence on the ground. We have our customers nicely distributed between the West Coast (San Francisco) and East Coast (New York and Boston) so having an office in the middle optimizes time overlap and travel. Our customers can get the high availability and service quality of an onshore provider with the cost and other benefits of an offshore operation. It&#8217;s the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><b>Pakistan&#8217;s tech scene seems to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/pakistans-growing-tech-ecosystem-is-finally-taking-off/">taking off</a>. What has been your involvement with it personally, and what impact does this growing ecosystem have for Arbisoft if any?</b></p>
<p>I have been very involved with the startup and tech ecosystem in the country since its inception. It is indeed taking off like a rocket ship right now, and we couldn&#8217;t be more excited about it. This year, startups raised more funding than all of the previous years combined. Arbisoft is excited because many of these startups need technology services, and therefore, we have a new and exhilarating market at our disposal. We have a great brand and most businesses look at Arbisoft as one of the most reliable and dependable technology partners they can hope to have. So the demand for our services has surged by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p><b>What are some arguments for Arbisoft to attract and retain talent?</b></p>
<p>Arbisoft is known for having a great organizational culture — we care deeply about our people and create opportunities for them to constantly learn and grow their capabilities. I’d have to say that is the primary reason people come to Arbisoft and stay. We have one of the lowest turnover rates in the industry. When people do leave, it&#8217;s usually for opportunities outside the country or ambitions like higher education. Invariably, you will find Arbisoft alumni to be our best ambassadors, who are not only helping us find new talent to replace them but also redirecting new business to us.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the tech industry, diversity is a hot topic. We’ve seen companies such as Facebook and Google commit to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in hopes of improving their company culture. But <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/six-years-into-diversity-reports-big-tech-has-made-little-progress.html">analysis shows</a> that there has been no appreciable change in diversity for these allegedly DEI-driven companies over the past 10 years despite these efforts.</p>
<p>In the 2010s, many tech companies made their annual diversity reports public to demonstrate transparency. Still, a problem emerges when reviewing the data: While the reports often describe incremental gains or losses in diversity numbers, they often fail to analyze data that can help the company make tangible change.</p>
<h2>Using data to dig deeper into systems that impact diversity</h2>
<p>The data in these reports provide us with a statement of the outcomes. We can see if the company has had growth or decline in the measured areas of diversity &#8212; typically demographic representation. What we can&#8217;t see is why these outcomes are happening and at what point in the system we&#8217;re missing the mark.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221892" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Therefore, these reports miss out on the powerful accountability effects of measuring improved processes and systems.</p>
<p>To illustrate an example, we&#8217;ll look at a company&#8217;s marketing data.</p>
<p>When a large corporation is trying to optimize its marketing funnel, it can see data at every level of the marketing process. For example, they can estimate the number of impressions they receive from external marketing efforts, quantify the number of conversions from ads to their website and calculate how many website visitors convert to customers. This information is used regularly to optimize performance and increase sales &#8212; and it&#8217;s prioritized because leaders know that revenue generation is essential for the company to succeed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leaders can accomplish this quality of analysis at the hiring level by recording and analyzing data at every level of the recruiting system. Data sets would include demographic information for every point of interaction, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of impressions received for a job ad.</li>
<li>Candidates identified through sourcing channels.</li>
<li>Candidates being presented for interviews.</li>
<li>Interviewer assessment results.</li>
<li>Job offers and job offers accepted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaders could then ensure demographic representation at each level of the process is at least equivalent to the demographics of the available talent pool. The company would then need to prioritize using this data to make changes to the system regularly (not annually) to improve the results.</p>
<p>Recruiting is only one example, and there are other areas of business that can benefit from more informative diversity data.</p>
<h2>Making information actionable</h2>
<p>As a leader, you have a choice to make your data actionable by publishing information that can result in accountability and greater equity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Consider sharing each of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay transparency and pay equity by demographic.</li>
<li>Engagement and inclusion data by demographic.</li>
<li>Rates of promotion by demographic.</li>
<li>Rates of retention by demographic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, your general counsel’s skin may crawl at these recommendations. However, organizations innovating on talent, culture and equity are willing to wander into these territories of transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have seen organizations that are willing to stand on their integrity wholeheartedly by publishing these data make significant progress toward building cultures of belonging that center on diversity.</p>
<h2>Data transparency doesn&#8217;t equal data <em>accountability</em></h2>
<p>We often believe that if we can measure something, we can change it; however, measurement alone does not drive change. Therefore, it’s crucial to measure the right data elements while holding stakeholders accountable for measurable change.</p>
<p>Let’s consider how this is done in sales.</p>
<p>Sales teams measure individual performance based on their contribution to achieving revenue targets. They are <em>required </em>to get results or risk losing their job because failure can cause harm to the business.</p>
<p>If we did the same for DEI, we&#8217;d see leaders held accountable for getting tangible results quarterly or annually as part of their performance appraisal goals. But, unfortunately, putting out a report stating what occurred won’t inspire leaders to do more to change the processes that impact outcomes meaningfully.</p>
<h2>Benchmarking against already low numbers won&#8217;t move the needle</h2>
<p>Diversity reporting often benchmarks annual data against the company&#8217;s previous metrics, the industry as a whole, companies of a similar size or an entire geography (i.e., the U.S.). This form of measuring progress makes incremental progress seem like a bigger achievement than it is. Leaders can point to this data and say they are meeting industry standards, but if the industry’s rate of progress is negligible, it simply removes accountability for achieving better results. Organizations have not been getting diversity right for decades, why benchmark to those underperforming?</p>
<p>Let’s say this simply: Benchmarking to poor performance is a poor practice.</p>
<p>If you do a benchmark, at least seek to make a real improvement by benchmarking against companies performing in the top quartile when it comes to diversity representation. But, again, this sets the bar higher and challenges leaders to be more strategic.</p>
<p>More importantly, companies should benchmark against the available talent pool (by using <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> data in the U.S., or by <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/">graduation rates by demographic and field of study</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span> to determine underrepresentation within your geography, industry and job field.</p>
<p>For example, the rate of graduation among women computer science majors is dramatically higher than the representation of women in junior-level software engineering roles in most companies.</p>
<p>And yet, even BLS data can be flawed because it relies on several assumptions about who is eligible for employment and excludes whole swaths of truly employable people. So, you may also combine these benchmarks with <em>local </em>population data as yet another data set to show how effective you’ve been.</p>
<p>If tech companies publish data that not only describes what is currently happening in the organization but also gives context to how systemic bias impacts diverse talent who cannot access their organizations, these reports might motivate behavioral change and be more valuable for readers from other industries aspiring to improve their own organizational outcomes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spinal surgery is not for the faint of heart at the best of times, but <a href="http://intelligentimplants.ie">Intelligent Implants</a> raised €7.5 million ($8.7 million) to make spinal surgery less of a pain in the backside. The company&#8217;s smart implants&#8217; first application is in spinal fusion surgery &#8212; where two or more vertebrae are permanently connected to improve stability, correct a deformity or reduce pain. Globally, more than a million of these surgeries are performed, but they are typically seen as a last resort because of the risk of complications or continued pain after the operation.</p>
<p>Intelligent Implants uses wireless implantable electronics to stimulate, steer and monitor bone growth. The company points out that the current state-of-the-art post-operation management is potentially long-term dependence on physical therapy and/or painkillers. Intelligent Implants is wading into the market to add a more tech-forward solution to the mix.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s smart, active implants aren&#8217;t the first devices in this category. You&#8217;ll be familiar with pacemakers and cochlear implants, which have been available since the 1950s and 1970s, respectively. Intelligent Implants’s innovation is in creating a solution that doesn&#8217;t require wires or batteries. The product is placed between vertebrae with the same standard surgical procedure as current non-active implants.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The implant is then powered externally through induction, much like how your phone might use a wireless charging pad. This creates an electric field that stimulates and guides bone growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish this surgery on anyone, but if you have to do it, we have to make sure that the outcomes are as good as they can be,&#8221; said John Zellmer, CEO of Intelligent Implants.</p>
<p>The electrodes that are used for stimulation can also be used as sensors. The device consists of a standard orthopedic implant, with some additional magic thrown in. The magic, in this case, is a number of electrodes that can be used for neuromodulation to aid bone growth, along with some antennas and electronics to control it all. After fusion surgery, the patients wear a spinal corset to keep everything in place where it is meant to be &#8212; and that&#8217;s a convenient place to keep the power and control units for the device.</p>
<p>Zellmer explains that Intelligent Implants get the sensor side of the equation almost as a side effect of the bone-growth stimulation. He explains that the device can do impedance measurements. Bone doesn&#8217;t conduct very well, so when the graft material is gradually replaced by bone in the body, the electrical signature changes, and in the process you can measure the bone growth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company&#8217;s product &#8212; called SmartFuse &#8212; just received a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/breakthrough-devices-program">Breakthrough Device designation</a> from the FDA, which, among other things, means that the government agency believes that &#8220;the device provides for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease or conditions.&#8221; The company explains that, in order to be part of the program, it completed large-animal trials on sheep, which showed three times more bone growth and cut the time to fusion down by 50%.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is pretty uncommon to get a Breakthrough Device Designation based on pre-clinical data,&#8221; said Zellmer, who points out that most BDDs are based on human trials. &#8220;We definitely did a big dance around the office when we got the news.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has so far been using sheep for its trials to date &#8212; sheep or goats being the most commonly used animals for orthopedic trials. The company is aiming to do its first human clinical trials in 2023.</p>
<p>“After a family member suffered from poor outcomes we decided to tackle this hard problem. We knew our solution would only work if our team had strong domain knowledge, long-term commitment and if we could fit our technology into the current practices (standard-of-care) of surgeons,&#8221; said Zellmer. &#8220;We are now more than halfway in bringing our product SmartFuse to market, and the FDA’s decision is a confirmation that our approach was sound.”</p>
<p>The company was part of the SOSV <a href="https://hax.co/">HAX</a> tech program, before graduating and announcing it is closing its seed round today. It raised €4.5 million ($5.2 million) from EU’s <a href="https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/eic-accelerator_en">EIC Accelerator</a>, with participation from <a href="https://sosv.com/">SOSV</a>, and an additional €3 million ($3.5 million) from a group of Swedish angel investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We met the SOSV partner Bill Liao back in 2015, and he has been supporting us ever since. That&#8217;s a long time for a venture firm, and they have done a really amazing job, both in terms of helping us from an operational perspective, but also supporting us in every round since then,&#8221; says Zellmer. &#8220;I think that is spectacular: We are doing something really hard here. This is a Class 3 device, an active implantable device with a stimulation system. What we are doing is totally new, and bringing that into the orthopedics field shows vision and guts.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Creating implantable technology is about as hard as it gets, and Intelligent Implants have been tremendously steady in its progress. We are proud to keep supporting them on this journey to help millions of patients and serve a market poised to reach $9B in a few years”, says Bill Liao, general partner at SOSV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In less than seven days, Lunchclub co-founder Vlad Novakovski had a sizable term sheet in hand from Lightspeed Ventures, despite his startup not looking to raise at the time. How did that happen? A sticky product experience with the customer feedback and growth to back it up made the startup an investment opportunity Lightspeed’s Nicole Quinn just couldn’t pass up.</p>
<p>A week ago, Novakovski and Quinn joined us on TechCrunch Live to give a breakdown of Lunchclub’s Series A deck and the details on how they connected toward the beginning of the pandemic. Lunchclub is an AI-driven networking tool virtually connecting professionals across multiple industries and levels.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live, formerly known as Extra Crunch Live, takes place every Wednesday at noon PDT/3 p.m. EDT. Each week, audiences get to hear the backstory, best practices and should-haves from founders and the investors who led their round. In the second half, founders in the audience get to live-pitch directly to the guests.</p>
<p>Take a look at some key learnings from our chat with Vlad and Nicole below, and check out the full recording of the episode with the live pitch-off.</p>
<h2>A well placed intro goes a long way</h2>
<p>The impact of your early-stage investors can go a long way. Nicole Quinn discovered Lunchclub through one of the company’s initial investors in the early months of the pandemic in 2020.</p>
<p>“I received an email from an angel investor in Lunchclub, Greg Arrese, saying, ‘Lunchclub just started doing fireside chats,” Nicole recalled. “These fireside chats have really found product-market fit. I mean, we just launched them and they&#8217;ve got thousands of people joining them.’”</p>
<p>Initially connecting with Vlad to participate in a fireside chat and learn more about the company on Wednesday, conversations quickly evolved resulting in a term sheet on Monday, less than a week after meeting.</p>
<p>Introductions to investors from other founders are often touted as the best way to get in front of a VC. In Vlad’s case, it was the investor who made a difference.</p>
<p>“I think as a founder … that speaks to [the] kind of value having a strong … angel investor network when you do your seed or your pre-seed,” Vlad added.</p>
<h2>Consumer feedback is everything</h2>
<p>Founders diligently build products to solve a problem but the true test is with the customers themselves. Novakovski’s Series A deck had customer feedback in the form of social media screenshots but had limited data and case studies — a change he wished he had made before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/creators-brands-collaborate-content/">testing new tools</a> for creators to earn commissions and form partnerships with brands on its platform. The Facebook-owned company is expanding its existing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/instagram-adds-affiliate-and-shop-features-for-creators/">native affiliate tool</a>, which launched in June and allows creators to discover products, share them with followers and earn commissions for sales driven by their posts.</p>
<p>With this latest launch, creators can now add a digital storefront to showcase products or collections that are already part of their affiliate partnerships within the &#8220;view shop&#8221; button on their profile and earn a commission on sales. Instagram says this new feature is currently only available to creators who are part of its native affiliate program.</p>
<p>Instagram is also testing new branded content partnership features to help creators get discovered by brands. Creators now have the ability to add to their preferred &#8216;brands list&#8217; brands they’re interested in partnering with, which will give them priority when companies are searching for new creators to work with.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222547" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Additionally, Instagram is rolling out a new folder within DMs exclusively for partnership messages. The new folder aims to ensure that creators don’t miss opportunities from brands whose messages may have otherwise been buried in a creator’s inbox. Partnership messages will skip the requests folder and get priority placement so that brands and creators are able to find and manage their content partnerships.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222550" style="width: 946px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222550" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2222550" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png" alt="" width="936" height="930" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png 936w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=300,298 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=768,763 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=680,676 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222550" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Brands now also have the option to use data and unique filters to discover suitable creators for their campaigns. They can then also organize shortlists to manage multiple campaigns and creators. Businesses can now also create branded content Reels ads. Further, Instagram has rolled out new account permissions that allow creators to enable brands to create content ads from any of the creator’s posts, stories and Reels.</p>
<p>“These brand-creator partnership tools are a big part of our ongoing commitment to help creators make a living on Instagram — whether they’re partnering with brands, earning money from advertising, getting support from their audience or earning bonuses directly from Instagram,” the company said in a <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/creators-brands-collaborate-content/">blog post.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instagram notes that it will continue to test and refine these features and make them available for more brands and creators in the future.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Instagram is among several digital platforms working to make it easier for brands and creators to work together. For instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tiktoks-new-creator-marketplace-api-lets-influencer-marketing-companies-tap-into-first-party-data/">TikTok</a> has a Creator Marketplace that helps marketers discover top TikTok personalities for their brand campaigns. Similarly, <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/introducing-new-ways-for-creators-to-earn-money-and-partner-with-brands-on-pinterest">Pinterest</a> has rolled out features to help creators partner with brands on its platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The era of private space stations is officially here as Nanoracks, Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/nanoracks-lockheed-martin-and-voyager-space-plan-to-launch-crewed-commercial-space-station-by-2027/">announce plans to launch a commercial station in 2027</a>, but it’s just the next logical step for developing the new space economy, the companies say.</p>
<p>“One of our key theses for the industry is that the last 10 years have been defined by building access to space, the next 10 years will be about destinations,” Voyager CEO Dylan Taylor said.</p>
<p>The new space station, dubbed “Starlab” in homage to the third-ever U.S. space station, Skylab, will be composed of an inflatable habitat module, a docking node and a robotic arm. The companies anticipate robust demand from both the public sector and private industry, though Nanoracks CEO Jeffrey Manber emphasized, “the core of Starlab is science.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222562" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Starlab could eventually also host tourists, he added that it’s not a tourism-first project. “Space tourism is what captures the headlines, but to have a sustainable business model, you really do need to move beyond that,” he said.</p>
<p>The trio of companies have submitted Starlab to NASA as a bid under the agency’s Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations project, which will allocate up to $400 million in contracts to private companies developing space stations. Any such project will likely require intensive public investment, but Taylor said the funding is just as important as a sign to the world that NASA is interested in maintaining a presence in low Earth orbit, particularly in light of the impending deorbiting of the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Manber echoed his sentiments. “We do not want a space station gap,” he said. “Everybody in the industry, in the community, understands that we cannot have a period where the United States lacks a space station, or space stations, in low Earth orbit.”</p>
<p>Overall, however, private financing will be key, and this is where Voyager comes in. The company, which acquired majority control over Nanoracks this year, will be overseeing financing and allocating capital for the project.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Realistically, there is not enough funding from Congress,” Manber said. “Those days have gone. This is a commercial project.”</p>
<p>Many things remain unclear regarding the future of the LEO economy, especially how companies and public agencies plan to balance standardization across design with keeping competitive. Taylor suggested a consortium approach could be one way to create standards for a handful of key technologies. Investment from NASA could also help drive commonality across habitation systems, Lisa Callahan, Lockheed Martin’s VP of commercial civil space, said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“NASA as a customer has unleashed this extraordinary revolution in space transportation,” Manber said. “Building on the success that NASA had with cargo, building on the success of commercial crew, one can anticipate that with the markets interested in space, we&#8217;re going to see the same thing with smaller private space stations.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Ethereum is the world’s most popular digital contract compiler, maintained by many but owned by none. Perhaps one of the most interesting factors behind its popularization is the future it paints &#8212; one that transforms our current internet standards for ownership, value creation and, most importantly, privacy.</p>
<h2>A transformed future?</h2>
<p>Not only can apps be written on top of Ethereum, but it allows any digital thing &#8212; a picture, a music file, a video, your mom’s favorite pumpkin pie recipe &#8212; to be uniquely owned, traded and stored for value, among many other possibilities that are created daily.</p>
<p>While many have predicted the future of the internet to be layered in bundles and levels of protection, it turns out that, <a href="https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/world-wide-access-accessible-web-design#:~:text=Accessibility%20Guidelines&amp;text=As%20Tim%20Berners%2DLee%2C%20Director,disability%20is%20an%20essential%20aspect.&amp;text=Building%20web%20content%20that%20is,challenge%20for%20web%20development%20teams.">paraphrasing</a> Tim Berners-Lee, making the underlying technologies accessible to everyone supercharges its adoption and usefulness.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222126" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ethereum and the emergence of Web 3.0 paint a shifting picture &#8212; an internet not just private, but open and transparent by default.</p>
<h2>A brief history</h2>
<p>In 2013, Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin">conceived</a> the idea of Ethereum, which would be developed and deployed two years later. The platform was built to allow anyone in the world with access to the internet to write permanent applications (known as decentralized apps or dApps) upon it, which anyone else can interact with but cannot change &#8212; basically open source software with integrity to the nth degree. The bread and butter of these apps are called smart contracts &#8212; a digital contract or intermediary.</p>
<p>Translated, that means financial and legal services no longer require a middleman. Ethereum basically substitutes an escrow agent, a notary, a bank teller who checks your ID, or a mortgage originator for an instant, digital transaction.</p>
<p>This invaluable function makes Ethereum one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies and blockchains in existence, with many contenders trailing. Bitcoin prices recently hit an <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin">all-time high</a>, and the hype surrounding Ethereum remains in full swing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/">Web 3.0</a>, an associated concept, is an imagined future internet that uses these peer-to-peer blockchains to allow users to interact with data, value stores, entities, etc., all without a middleman.</p>
<h2>Ethereum today</h2>
<p>As Ethereum becomes an underlying infrastructure for legal cases, financial deals, binding agreements and more, understanding its weaknesses and strengths will become a fundamental trait of property ownership and transfer.</p>
<p>Updating Stephen Hawking’s <a href="https://twitter.com/codeorg/status/357514287658434560">words</a> on how “basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn,” understanding the fundamentals of smart contracts such as those on Ethereum will become a basic legal and financial skill.</p>
<p>Today, the most booming applications on Ethereum are NFTs &#8212; non-fungible tokens. While NFTs are relatively new, they’re catching on with consumers, artists and investors not only as a store of value but as an assertion of digital, unique ownership.</p>
<p>NFTs allow anything digital (any file) to be owned and traded on the internet because it can’t be manipulated, changed or copied – it’s non-fungible. Any social media hubbub surrounding Apes, Kittys or Punks are all in relation to the burgeoning fan-favorite phenomenon of luxury digital art.</p>
<p>We predict that one use case for this technology will be in interplanetary mining, as companies based on Earth will need to buy and sell mineral rights in asteroids that few if any of their human employees have ever actually visited or seen themselves.</p>
<p>Other predictions for use cases are mortgage lending, property purchasing, event ticketing, music festivals, file storage and gaming &#8212; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725083/axie-infinity-sky-mavis-blockchain-economy-game-pokemon">Axie Infinity</a>, for example, is a testament to how players can make a decent living in an NFT-based gaming world.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless and are being thought up by the curious and energized community more and more every day.</p>
<h2>Challenges and Ethereum of tomorrow</h2>
<p>As regulation catches up to the power of this underlying technology, many wonder if we’ll see attempts to control it. Much like the years-long debate in the <a href="https://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/11/14/riana-pfefferkorn-the-looming-battle-in-the-crypto-wars/?slreturn=20210921141037">Crypto Wars</a>, which entailed requests to compromise or break encryption, changes to the assertions of Ethereum’s immutability could compromise its main valuable characteristic: its permanent integrity.</p>
<p>There may be a potential conflict between Ethereum’s immutability and its widespread adoption. It might mean that financial regulators will attempt to take some form of ownership or control over its deployment. We would be curious as to how those potential future regulators would answer the question: How can a widely connected sphere of nodes be cautiously governed while not compromising its true value &#8212; decentralization itself?</p>
<p>Other challenges and limitations the technology is likely to face are performance sustainability &#8212; fees to build on top of Ethereum called gas fees have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/cryptocurrency/news/ethereums-scaling-issues-strike-again-as-time-magazines-nfts-sell-for-30-times-their-price/articleshow/86490791.cms">gone up</a> in recent years and the platform is known to be slowing in processing time. Ethereum 2.0 is anticipated to smooth inefficiencies, but how do we continue to maintain speed in a blockchain optimized for storing and computing each and every transaction?</p>
<p>Security also remains a challenge, with known Ethereum vulnerabilities existing though not widely exploited. Poly Network reported a hack this year that resulted from a <a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/poly-network-hack/">&#8220;vulnerability between contract calls.” </a></p>
<p>Smart contracts are intricate and complex functions to write, so they require in-depth auditing before being deployed to a network. Ethereum security is also built on passwordless, asymmetric cryptography. It’s entirely possible that quantum computing will eventually disrupt our asymmetric cryptography standards.</p>
<p>We’re interested in how Ethereum and blockchains can be sustained, and we’re HODLing all the way through. Into the metaverse and beyond ….</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX&#8217;s Starship rocket is still in development in southeast Texas, with major progress being made on key elements like the launch tower construction, and installation of the vacuum-rated Raptor engines that will power the vehicle once it reaches space. Elon Musk says that it could be ready to make its first orbital flight attempt next month — provided it gets the regulatory sign-offs it needs.</p>
<p>SpaceX will require approvals from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to make the attempt, as it has for all of its prior test flights of Starship from its development location outside of Brownsville, Texas. The FAA basically requires that SpaceX demonstrate it has taken all necessary safety precautions to ensure that there&#8217;s minimal risk in case of anything going wrong during the launch attempts.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If all goes well, Starship will be ready for its first orbital launch attempt next month, pending regulatory approval</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222531" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1451581465645494279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At this stage of development, that&#8217;s not even a highly unlikely outcome: SpaceX has already seen a number of its Starship prototypes explode (or experience &#8220;rapid, unscheduled disassembly,&#8221; as it&#8217;s often known in the industry) during the development program. Starship testing has also had its successes, however, including completing high-altitude flight tests that are still within Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, and bringing the spacecraft back down for a controlled landing.</p>
<p>The next major milestone for SpaceX is flying a fully stacked version of its Starship and Super Heavy booster combo beyond Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and to outer space. As told by Musk, the company is technically ready for that step, but that regulatory approval could take a lot longer than a month to materialize, if the FAA&#8217;s recent call for public comments on granting a launch license are any indication.</p>
<p>During town hall meetings this past week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738106/spacex-boca-chica-starship-launch-site-faa-town-hall-environmental-assessment">supporters and detractors both got very vocal and raised a number of issues</a> that the FAA will have to review and address along with SpaceX before proceeding to the next step. The FAA could forestall resolving some of these by issuing a temporary license for the purpose of a test and revisiting ongoing launch permissions, however.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>When you share individual issues of your newsletter, they&#8217;ll look the same as if you shared an article from any other website &#8212; only once someone clicks the article, when they return to their timeline, they&#8217;ll see the subscribe button.</p>
<p>In August, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/twitter-is-testing-a-feature-that-puts-users-revue-newsletters-on-their-profiles/">tested a feature</a> that allowed Revue newsletter writers to highlight their newsletter right on their profile. By September, the feature <a href="https://twitter.com/revue/status/1435641482254368772">became available</a> to all Revue writers. But previously, subscribing to a newsletter via Twitter &#8212; whether on someone&#8217;s profile, or now, via a tweet &#8212; required verifying your email. But now, if you already have an email address linked to your Twitter account, you can subscribe with one click without confirming via email.</p>
<p>This feature is currently available on the web, but will roll out to iOS and Android soon, Revue said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/revue/status/1451564116007657472">tweet</a>.</p>

<p>Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">acquired Revue</a> in January, helping the platform compete in the fast-growing newsletter space.

So, if someone subscribes to your Revue newsletter for $5, you’ll take home $4.30. Comparatively, Substack takes 10% of writers’ revenue, plus processing fees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">automation hit center stage</a> when robotic process automation (RPA) vendor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company/">UiPath went public</a> after raising $2 billion in private investment. Investors who had been a part of that were richly rewarded when it closed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/as-uipath-closes-above-its-final-private-valuation-cfo-ashim-gupta-discusses-his-companys-path-to-market/">above its private valuation</a>. At the same time, established companies like ServiceNow, Microsoft, IBM and others were seeing the value in building automation into their product sets.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have three people who have been smack dab in the middle of this trend on a panel called &#8220;Automation&#8217;s Moment Is Now&#8221; at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=automationpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=automationpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS</a> happening on October 27th. Those panelists include UiPath CEO Daniel Dines; Laela Sturdy, general partner at CapitalG and Dave Wright, chief innovation officer at ServiceNow.</p>
<p>Dines&#8217; company, which went public in April, concentrates mostly on RPA, and is the market leader according to Gartner, but automation has many dimensions beyond RPA, including no-code/low-code tools and workflow automation. As we wrote on in an article <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">on the hot automation market</a> earlier this year:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221300" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>What we have here is a frothy mix of startups and large companies racing to provide a comprehensive spectrum of workflow automation tools to empower companies to spin up workflows quickly and move work involving both human and machine labor through an organization.</p></blockquote>
<p>RPA helps companies automate a series of mundane legacy tasks, which can include human intervention or not. Think of pulling information from an insurance claim, adding it to a spreadsheet and emailing a human administrator with the needed information &#8212; and doing all of this without a human touching it.</p>
<p>ServiceNow got into RPA in March when it bought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/servicenow-takes-rpa-plunge-by-acquiring-india-based-startup-intellibot/">Indian startup Intellibot</a>. It also has several tools for low-code and workflow automation, and with the Intellibot purchase, other acquisitions and organic development, has built automation across its entire platform.</p>
<p>Sturdy was an investor in UiPath and serves on its board. Other investments include Stripe, Cloudflare and Credit Karma, which Intuit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/intuit-credit-karma/">bought last year for $7.1 billion</a>. She was also the captain of the women&#8217;s basketball team while attending Harvard, and participated in the 1998 NCAA basketball tournament, <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/3/14/a-look-back-to-1998-harvard/">helping defeat No. 1 Stanford</a> in a huge upset.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re going to discuss why automation is coming to the fore now, the role of the pandemic in its rising popularity and whether it&#8217;s a jobs killer or if it&#8217;s actually making life easier for employees.</p>
<p>We hope you&#8217;ll join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=automationpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=automationpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS on October 27th</a>. We&#8217;ll also be talking to Monte Carlo CEO Barr Moses, Microsoft executive Jared Spataro and investor Casey Aylward.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I could never really figure out why Facebook spent heavily on VR, but the move may have actually been pretty brilliant from a strategic perspective.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of Snap are off just over 20% this morning, a huge cut to the valuation of the social networking company.</p>
<p>In one sense, the post-earnings drop is an indictment of the company&#8217;s business. On the other, Snap&#8217;s stock has merely retreated to midyear levels and remains far above the historical price range it found itself mired in during its more unprofitable days.</p>
<p>But Snap&#8217;s <a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-2021-Press-Release.pdf">earnings report</a> and its ensuing selloff have not held their impact to just the company&#8217;s own value. Other social companies have also taken hits: Facebook shares are off nearly 5% this morning, while Twitter is off around 3%. It&#8217;s an arse day for social media companies that are public &#8212; and for their private-market brethren, even if we can&#8217;t see their prices change as granularly.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Let&#8217;s answer the <em>why</em> before we get into what the situation may mean for social companies more generally. We&#8217;ll focus on Facebook at that point, considering its metaverse and impending name change.</p>
<h2>Why Snap is down: Supply chains and Apple&#8217;s power</h2>
<p>Snap posted $1.07 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter, lower than market expectations of $1.10 billion, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/snap-earnings-q3-2021.html">per CNBC reporting</a>. That revenue result was up 57% year over year, and Snap narrowed its net loss to just under $72 million in the quarter, down from just under $200 million in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Even better, Snap posted massively improved cash flow results in the period when compared to its year-ago results. Growth? Check. Improving profitability? Check. Ability to self-fund? Check. And yet its stock fell sharply. Why? Guidance.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Snap said that it expects revenues for Q4 2021 &#8220;to be between $1.165 million and $1.205 million.&#8221; The market, in contrast, expected the company to generate $1.36 billion in the current quarter. The <em>lowest</em> analyst estimate for Q4 2021 Snap revenue <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP/analysis?p=SNAP">that Yahoo Finance has on file</a> was $1.20 billion. The company may miss even that guess.</p>
<p>Companies that are valued more on growth than GAAP profitability tend to swing sharply when growth slows. And Snap is forecasting an almighty revenue growth deceleration. That explains the selloff. But what explains the company&#8217;s slowing revenue growth?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Meet is getting new <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/10/google-meet-meeting-hosts-now-have-more.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GoogleAppsUpdates+%28Google+Workspace+Updates+Blog%29">audio and video locks</a> to let hosts turn off the microphones and cameras of other participants. The new feature essentially lets you mute a user and prevent them from unmuting themselves until you unlock them.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Google rolled out the ability for hosts to mute everyone all at once in a group call. This latest feature takes the move a step further by preventing participants from unmuting themselves at any point during the call.</p>
<p>Once a host enables either an audio or video lock in the main meeting, it will also be applied to breakout rooms. However, any changes made to a lock setting within a breakout room will not affect the settings of other breakout rooms or the main meeting.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222490" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Google says audio and video locks give hosts more control over their meetings by letting them decide when they want to allow different levels of participation from users. It also gives them the ability to address disruptive meeting participants.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that participants using versions of the Android and iOS apps that do not support the new feature will be removed from the meeting if the host turns on the audio or video lock. If users try to join a meeting that currently has the locks enabled, they will be prompted to update their app in order to be allowed into the meeting. However, if the host turns off the locks, the participants will be able to rejoin the meeting.</p>
<p>The new audio and visual lock features are starting to roll out today to all Google Workspace customers, along with G Suite Basic and Business customers.</p>
<p>Google has been rolling out numerous features for Meet over the past few months, as it continues to compete with Zoom and Microsoft Teams amid the work-from-home era brought on by the pandemic. For instance, the company launched a new feature last month that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/google-meet-will-automatically-adjust-webcam-brightness-in-your-browser/">automatically adjusts</a> your webcam brightness. Additionally, Google rolled out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/google-meet-gets-a-refreshed-ui-multi-pinning-autozoom-and-more/">refreshed UI</a> and several features for Meet in April. The videoconferencing platform has also partnered with other services, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/otter-ai-expands-automatic-transcription-assistant-to-microsoft-teams-google-meet-and-cisco-webex/">Otter.ai</a>, with the goal of retaining and attracting more users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When news broke that former U.S. President Donald Trump had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/trump-launches-his-own-social-media-platform-truth-social/">conceived of a media and technology company</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">intended to take it public via a blank-check company</a>, you would have been forgiven if you immediately began to wonder how quickly you could short the stock.</p>
<p>Pick a reason: Right-leaning social networks have largely flopped; the company appeared to be severely underfunded given the scope of its goals and the wealth of its rivals; the fact that there was no product available to use, let alone historical revenue to model forward. There are other reasons for skepticism, but those are my favorite.</p>
<p>And yet! Shares of the SPAC in question, Digital World Acquisition Corp, shot higher on the news. And it is repeating the feat this morning:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2222460" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-9.30.40-AM.png?w=362" alt="" width="362" height="127" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-9.30.40-AM.png 362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-9.30.40-AM.png?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-9.30.40-AM.png?resize=300,105 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-9.30.40-AM.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /></p>
<p>Recall that DWAC is the Class A share ticker symbol of Digital World Acquisition Corp, while DWACU is the same equity, but with half a warrant attached. The latter shares are up less, which is a bit odd.</p>
<p>Regardless, DWAC now sports a market cap of around $4.7 billion, per Yahoo Finance. That means that Digital World &#8212; aka Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) &#8212; is something akin to the newest unicorn to come out of the land of media and tech. Sure, it&#8217;s a public price, but because the company that will merge with Digital World is so nascent as to be risible: <em>Fuck it</em>, let&#8217;s call it a startup.</p>
<p>None of this makes sense. Even by the standards of 2021 and the SPAC era, this is all very stupid.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The only thing that TMTG has that makes it anything other than hot air attached to tissue-thin market statistics &#8212; we&#8217;d like to thank the company&#8217;s presentation for reminding us that podcasts are rising in popularity, a truly mind-bending insight &#8212; is Trump&#8217;s name. Recall that TMTG intends on using SPAC money to fund its operations, not Trump cash; it doesn&#8217;t even really have the financial backing of the man whose name is atop its business. You know, the supposed billionaire.</p>
<p>Perhaps the fact that the company is so silly should have tipped us off to it becoming a memestock, or stonk. Why? Because only the wackiest companies seem to make the cut. Physical retail is falling amid rising digital delivery of gaming goods? Let&#8217;s send GameStop to the moon. No one is renting cars? Let&#8217;s pile into Hertz stock. That sort of thing.</p>
<p>So, almost, <em>of course</em> DWAC is going vertical. Why <em>not?! </em>This stock shooting higher is at once utterly hilarious and a grim indictment of efficient market theory. Nothing makes a stonk better as a meme than it making little to no sense as a business. Thus, TMTG is up a kajillion percent, which makes sense precisely in how little sense it makes.</p>
<p>Normally I&#8217;d just go to bed at this point, but it turns out I have a lot of work to do so, we&#8217;ll leave this here for now. Good luck to everyone trading today.</p>
