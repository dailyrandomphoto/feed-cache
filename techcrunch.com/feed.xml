										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not often that you hear DNA described as a wafer – but that’s the analogy that Grant Aarons, the founder of FabricNano, a cell-free biomanufacturing company uses to describe his company’s major product. That DNA, the company hopes, will make a dent in a growing global petrochemical industry that currently relies on fossil fuels and their byproducts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FabricNano is a London based company founded in 2018 through Entrepreneur First, a technology startup accelerator. FabricNano is invested in the creation of cell-free biomanufacturing. Biomanufacturing, simply, uses the enzymes within a cell or microbe to produce an end-product. FabricNano’s approach is to place those enzymes on the DNA wafer instead (that process is called enzyme immobilization). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those enzymes, Aarons argues, can produce chemicals, like those used to make drugs or plastics, with higher efficiency compared to cell-based systems, and without the reliance on fossil fuels that are currently used to make those chemicals en masse.The heart of the company is the DNA scaffold, which can house enough enzymes to scale up those reactions. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, FabricNano announced $12.5 million in Series A funding this week complete with a cadre of high profile angel investors. The round was led by Atomico, and included investment from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, actress, UN Sustainability Ambassador Emma Watson, and former Bayer CEO Alexander Moscho. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went out and actively tried to get the right angels for the company,” says Aarons. “We also looked at a few different technology angels. Because at the end of the day what we&#8217;re manufacturing is an enabling technology for manufacturers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re not looking to manufacture bio-based plastics or bio-based monomers, at any sufficient scale,” he continues. “We&#8217;re looking to provide [manufacturers] with the technology that they can then use to manufacture at scale and at a low enough cost. It is a scalable and sustainable way to make low-value molecules, like bioplastics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of FabricNano’s identity hinges on creating a bio-based alternative within the growing petrochemical sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, about 14 percent of global oil demand goes towards making plastics. Petrochemicals, or chemicals obtained from oil and gas that can be used to make plastics or other materials, are expected to drive about half of the world’s oil demand by 2050, according to The International Energy Agency’s </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/news/petrochemicals-set-to-be-the-largest-driver-of-world-oil-demand-latest-iea-analysis-finds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 projections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plastics, a major end-product of the petrochemical industry, contribute to climate change at nearly every point in their life cycles – when they’re manufactured by heating up oil or ethane or when they’re burned as waste. If both plastic production and use continue at their current pace, emissions are projected to reach 1.34 gigatons by 2030 (the equivalent of 295 coal fired power plants), according to the </span><a href="https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plastic-and-Climate-Executive-Summary-2019.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for International Environmental Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, making</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more plastic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, no matter how it is made, will contribute to ecological catastrophe in its own way (</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/01/call-for-global-treaty-to-end-production-of-virgin-plastic-by-2040"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scientists have called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for phase out of “virgin” plastic production by 2040). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the nebulous term “bioplastic” can refer to anything from a biodegradable plastic to a plastic created without the use of fossil fuels (even one that is not biodegradable), That makes the world of environmentally-friendly plastics highly susceptible to greenwashing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question that remains is how big an impact biomanufacturing can make on reducing petrochemicals’ contribution to climate change? At this point that’s unclear. Aarons argues that part of the appeal of cell-free manufacturing can pull the industry away from using petroleum (or in the US, ethanol) to make plastics or other commodity chemicals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re really talking about a new technology to take over a lot of the commodities sector, and pull a lot of those petroleum-based products away from petroleum and into the biological realm,” says Aarons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, there are also clear concerns with the production of plastics as-is, leaving room for alternatives to emerge if they prove to be scalable and cost-effective enough to supplant the existing petrochemical industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is some evidence that cell-free manufacturing has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">already </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">scaled well. For instance, high fructose corn syrup is made when corn starch is broken down by enzymes into glucose. The final step requires one enzyme, glucose isomerase. Aarons calls high fructose corn syrup production “the largest implementation of cell-free in the world.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FabricNano is partially looking to build upon that concept to offer a greater suite of available chemicals. At the moment, FabricNano can already create chemicals like 1,3 propanediol, an ingredient that can be used to replace polyethylene glycol in toothpaste or shampoo. The input needed to create that product is glycerin, a major waste product of biodiesel manufacturing, which may help keep costs down and provide an alternative feedstock to fossil fuels.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aarons says that FabricNano has proved capable of making four additional products, but didn’t disclose what kinds. He says FabricNano is “interested in the pharmaceutical space”, and in commodity chemicals. “There are a lot of commodity chemicals we can manufacture. 1,3 propanediol is just the tip of the iceberg,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, FabricNano’s distinguishing approach probably isn’t the commodity chemicals it has made so far, but the actual DNA scaffold. If the enzymes that stick to that DNA wafer and help produce chemicals are software, the DNA scaffold is FabricNano’s hardware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That hardware is a major way the company hopes to bring cell-free into the world of commodity chemicals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The real missing piece, and why [cell-free manufacturing] has been a niche technology for a long time is that there has been no generalizable technology to immobilize all of these proteins,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the newest round of funding FabricNano plans to increase its employee workforce from 12 to thirty people, and move into a new London-based office. Total investment in the company stands at $16 million. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influential entrepreneurs like Paul Graham and Naval Ravikant always preach the need for startups to have founders-turned-investors on their cap table</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ravikant puts it, “founders want to know that the people they are taking money from have first-hand experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His platform AngelList has helped individual founders-cum-investors source and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in deals via collectives</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some venture firms have taken this up a notch by bringing founders to create a fund and invest together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, one of such,</span><a href="https://www.magic.fund/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a global collective of founders, is announcing that it has raised a second fund of $30 million to continue backing early-stage startups across Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Southeast Asia.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the firm&#8217;s first fund launched in 2017, MAGIC has invested in 70 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across these emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these companies include <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-20/retool-nears-1-billion-valuation-with-funding-from-sequoia">Retool</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/novo-a-neobank-for-smbs-banks-41m/">Novo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/payfazz-gets-53-million-to-give-more-indonesians-access-to-financial-services/">Payfazz</a>, and Mono.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC Fund has 12 founders who act as general partners. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch caught up with managing partner Adegoke Olubusi and operating partner Matt Greenleaf about the fund&#8217;s thesis and activities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olubusi, who had built and exited a couple of startups over the years, also dabbled with angel investing for some time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2017, Olubusi&#8217;s current startup Helium Health got accepted into Y Combinator. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was there he met more founders like him who were angel investors with impressive portfolios</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The interesting bit? Each founder wanted to invest in other companies during YC&#8217;s Demo Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So about three years ago, I was at YC, and I was going to invest in my own batch. I was pitching on the day, but I was also listening to other pitches. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it wasn&#8217;t just me; there were many other founders as well,&#8221; Olubusi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After building and exiting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startups, some founders turn into angel investing to support startups and their ecosystems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, most of them tend to go alone and are stuck with cutting checks in their local markets, which limits opportunities.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173820" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173820" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2173820" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="228" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png 1442w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png?resize=300,101 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png?resize=768,258 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png?resize=680,228 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173820" class="wp-caption-text">Some MAGIC portfolio companies</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s a scenario. In 2016, when unicorns Flutterwave and Kavak raised their seed rounds in Nigeria and Mexico respectively, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an African biotech founder who knew about Kavak and a Latin American edtech founder interested in African fintech would not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have had the capacity to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaluate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> those deals even if they wanted; the reason being a lack of reach and experience in both the industry or geography</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olubusi and the other founders knew this would be a limitation in the long run if they went solo. Thus, they decided to create MAGIC. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea was to bring global founders together with diverse skillsets in diverse industries and geographies to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaluate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deals better and drive value for each other</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Hence, they can participate in two unicorns instead of one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Instead of us investing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obviously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we have somewhat limited capacity </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how much time we have as founders because of our respective companies, why don&#8217;t we collaborate on a strategy together and co-invest together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The way we thought of MAGIC was a fund of micro funds built by founders for founders,&#8221; Greenleaf continued.</span></p>
<h2>Fund of micro funds but more than money</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some of the personal conversations I&#8217;ve had with founders about their investors, a recurring theme has been that the most useful investors didn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sign the biggest checks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s a theme Olubusi also relates to all too well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was like every time we think about it, everyone who gave the most money rarely had time for us. It was so frequent that we all identified this as an actual thing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What actually drove value for us were other investors who were founders and operators, and other experienced people who were able to help us find product-market fit and fight regulators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These were actually the people in the trenches with us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olubusi believes the early-stage part of investing, particularly in pre-seed and seed, is where VCs who are founder-operators find their sweet spot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are precious when startups are trying to figure out product-market fit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And unlike traditional investors who are looking to get multiples on investments, Olubusi argues that for founders-investors, what matters is how much value they can drive for startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173821" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173821" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2173821" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173821" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MAGIC Fund</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC&#8217;s play is even more essential considering that it also plays in emerging markets where on-the-ground operational help </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is needed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in industries with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">numerous</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unknowns and uncertainties</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is so much money in the market now and early-stage decision making at pre-seed and seed should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the hands of founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because think about it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make an evaluation of whether I should invest in a healthcare or fintech company in Africa, it makes sense to have those who&#8217;ve spent years battling through it in the trenches make those decisions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what we&#8217;re trying to do with the fund is publish as much information as possible and keep performing at the 100 percentile and say this is still the best strategy and is very scalable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC Fund 1 was $1.5 million and Olubusi says the investments performed 5x over the period of three years. As some of these companies exited, their founders invested in MAGIC and came on board as Fund 2 partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC has also enlisted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors who, according to Olubusi, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are respected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their investing abilities and ecosystem support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the African tech ecosystem as a founder who goes out of his way to help established and up-and-coming fintech companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Hendra Kwik of Payfazz has such a reputation in Southeast Asia as well. They, alongside other founders, join MAGIC as limited partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the firm&#8217;s statement, one-third of the entire fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was contributed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the founder GPs.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic Fund 2 will be writing $100,000 to 300,000 checks at pre-seed and seed stages focusing on fintech, healthcare, SaaS and enterprise, women&#8217;s health, developer tools</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does the fund look for in founders? Olubusi gives two answers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, MAGIC wants to back founders with incentives to stick through the hard times of a company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At pre-seed and seed, you don&#8217;t have enough data about a company to make an investment decision. Your bet is entirely on the founder and the founding team. What we know, having done this several times, is that things get harder. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when we&#8217;re looking at the founder, we&#8217;re evaluating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether or not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the founder has the grit to stick through the toughest times which are going to come up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second indicator factors if the founder has the willingness, openness, the flexibility to learn and use that knowledge to succeed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenleaf believes these strategies have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helped the firm fund exceptional companies and maintain good relationships with founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Most of these founders don&#8217;t view us as their investors. They view us as fellow founders who are helping them along their journey. I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that also ties into them keeping it real with us and allows us to see them as people, and not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That&#8217;s one of the things that have worked in our favor,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fittingly, we don’t know a lot about Nothing. The young hardware startup has, however, done a stellar job building hype around precisely that fact. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555247/nothing-ear-1-true-wireless-earbuds-july-27th-launch-oneplus-carl-pei">the lead up to the July 27 launch</a> of the company’s first product, the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/nothings-first-product-the-ear-1-earbud-launches-in-june/"> Ear 1</a>, the Nothing marketing machine has released information in drabs and drabs.</p>
<p>Ahead of the event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nothing-founder-carl-pei-on-ear-1-and-building-a-hardware-startup-from-scratch/">we sat down with founder Carl Pei</a> for a wide ranging interview about launching his latest hardware company. During the conversation, he revealed some additional information about the upcoming fully wireless earbuds.</p>
<p>“It’s going to have leading features like noise cancellation and great build quality,” Pei told TechCrunch. “Because we&#8217;re primarily going to be focused on online sales channels, we are going to be able to [make it] &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t say ‘affordable,’ but quite a fair price to consumers. With the Ear One, it&#8217;s a much more costly design to realize than a standard, non-transparent design. I think it&#8217;s going to be a good price at $99 USD, €99 Euros and £99. Feature-wise, it’s similar to the AirPods Pro, but the AirPods Pro is $249.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Pricing in the earbud market is all over the place at the moment, of course. Apple is holding up the high end of the mainstream with its AirPods Pro. Sony’s latest manage to edge that out into truly premium pricing at $280. At the other end of the spectrum, meanwhile, it’s easy to snag a pair of buds for well under $50, though at the low end of the market, your mileage will vary.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173825" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173825" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2173825" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173825" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nothing</p></div></p>
<p>The Ear 1s are aggressively priced at $99 – putting them in the same pricing category as the Samsung Galaxy Buds and the recently released Google Pixel Buds-A. Though Pei promises Nothing’s product will have the upper hand with an AirPods Pro-like feature set, including active noise cancelling. In an email to TechCrunch, the company says the ANC will arrive via three &#8220;high definition&#8221; mics. Pei added that the IP purchased from Essential won&#8217;t appear in this first product.</p>
<p>&#8220;[B]efore we were called Nothing, &#8216;Essential&#8217; was one of the names we were brainstorming, internally,&#8221; said Pei. &#8220;So that’s why we&#8217;ve acquired the trademark. We don&#8217;t have any plans to do anything with Essential.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still, he stresses that it’s not a features race for Nothing. “If you look at what kids want to become today, they want to be TikTokers, or YouTubers,” Pei tells TechCrunch. “Maybe it&#8217;s because technology isn&#8217;t as inspiring as before. We talked to consumers, and they don&#8217;t care as much as a couple of years ago, either. If you look at what brands are doing in their communication, it&#8217;s all about features and specs. There&#8217;s nobody in this space trying to like with a higher purpose.”</p>
<p>The ‘higher purpose’ here is Nothing’s broader ecosystem play, connectivity and making users’ “digital lives more seamless.” It’s also, as the name implies, an attempt to make tech that gets out of its own way. That’s, in part, is the job of the aesthetics. We do know that the buds will be transparent – a design decision that contributed to the delayed launch.</p>

<p>“It turns out, there&#8217;s a reason why there&#8217;s not a lot of transparent consumer tech products out there,” Pei said. “It’s really, really hard to make it high quality. You need to ensure that everything inside looks just as good as the outside. So that&#8217;s where the team has been iterating. You probably wouldn&#8217;t notice the differences between each iteration. It could be getting the right magnets &#8212; as magnets are usually designed to go inside of a product and not be seen by the consumer &#8212; to figuring out the best type of gluing. You never have to solved that problem if you have a non-transparent product, but what kind of glue will keep the industrial design intact?”</p>
<p>Nothing is relying on direct sales to drive down costs, with an initial focus on U.K., India, Europe and North America, followed by Japan, Korea and other countries. Pei says the company is still in process of negotiating additional markets. The Ear 1 are the first of three products the company currently has in its pipeline.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["If we take a take a step back and think about it from a consumer perspective, we feel like, as a whole consumer, tech is quite, quite boring.">]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On July 27, hardware maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nothings-ear-1-earbuds-will-feature-noise-cancelling-and-run-99/">Nothing will debut its first product, wireless earbuds dubbed Ear 1</a>. Despite releasing almost no tangible information about the product, the company has managed to generate substantial buzz around the launch — especially for an entry into the already-crowded wireless earbud market.</p>
<p>The hype, however, is real — and somewhat understandable. Nothing founder Carl Pei has a good track record in the industry — he was just 24 when he co-founded OnePlus in 2013. The company has done a canny job capitalizing on heightened expectations, meting out information about the product like pieces in a puzzle.</p>
<p>We spoke to Pei ahead of the upcoming launch to get some insight into Ear 1 and the story behind Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I know there was a timing delay with the launch. Was that related to COVID-19 and supply chain issues?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CP:</strong> Actually, it was due to our design. Maybe you&#8217;ve seen the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/carl-peis-nothing-shows-of-the-tobacco-pipe-inspired-concept-1/">concept image of this transparent design</a>. It turns out there&#8217;s a reason why there aren&#8217;t many transparent consumer tech products out there. It’s really, really hard to make it high quality. You need to ensure that everything inside looks just as good as the outside. So that&#8217;s where the team has been iterating, [but] you probably wouldn&#8217;t notice the differences between each iteration.</p>
<p>It could be getting the right magnets — as magnets are usually designed to go inside of a product and not be seen by the consumer — to figuring out the best type of gluing. You never have to solve that problem if you have a non-transparent product, but what kind of glue will keep the industrial design intact? I think the main issue has been getting the design ready. And we&#8217;re super, super close. Hopefully, it will be a product that people are really excited about when we launch.</p>
<p><strong>So, there were no major supply chain issues?</strong></p>
<p>Not for this product category. With true wireless earbuds, I think we&#8217;re pretty fine. No major issues. I mean, we had the issue that we started from zero — so no team and no partners. But step by step, we finally got here.</p>
<p><strong>That seems to imply that you&#8217;re at least thinking ahead towards the other products. Have you already started developing them?</strong></p>
<p>We have a lot of products in the pipeline. Earlier this year, we did a community crowdfunding round where we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/want-to-invest-in-nothing-carl-pei-opens-investment-opportunity-to-community/">allocated $1.5 million</a> to our community. That got bought up really quickly. But as part of that funding round, we had a deck with some of the products in development. Our products are code-named as Pokemon, so there are a lot of Pokemon on that slide [Editor&#8217;s note: <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nothing-community-carl-pei-interview-1227393/">The Ear 1 was</a> <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Aipom_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">“Aipom.”</a>]. We have multiple categories that we&#8217;re looking at, but we haven&#8217;t really announced what those are.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9w7HHB5PJlY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Why were earbuds the right first step?</strong></p>
<p>I think this market is really screaming for differentiation. If you look at true wireless today, I think after Apple came out with the AirPods, the entire market kind of followed. Everybody wears different clothes. This is something we wear for a large part of the day. Why wouldn&#8217;t people want different designs?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re working with Teenage Engineering — they&#8217;re super, super strong designers. I think true wireless is a place where we can really leverage that strength. Also, from a more rational business perspective, wireless earbuds is a super-fast growing product category. I think we&#8217;re going to reach 300 million units shipped worldwide this year for this category. And your first product category should be one with good business potential.</p>
<p><strong>“Screaming for differentiation” is an interesting way to put it. When you look at AirPods and the rest of the industry, are aesthetics what the market primarily lacks? Is it features or is it purely stylistic?</strong></p>
<p>If we take a take a step back and think about it from a consumer perspective, we feel like, as a whole, consumer tech is quite, quite boring. Kids used to want to become engineers and astronauts and all that. But if you look at what kids want to become today, they want to be TikTokers or YouTubers. Maybe it&#8217;s because technology isn&#8217;t as inspiring as before. We talked to consumers, and they don&#8217;t care as much as a couple of years ago either. If you look at what what brands are doing in their communication, it&#8217;s all about features and specs. <div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The upside of the Open Banking regulations which have swept jurisdictions like the UK and the EU is that many more challenger banks have appeared. The headache for either incumbent banks or for upstart startups is the very proliferation of these new banks and financial tech products. But as we know, in gold rushes, the people selling the picks and shovels usually win. Thus, startups have turned their attention, not to launching full-stack banks, but to full-stack platforms that other people can launch their fintech startups and products upon.</p>
<p>The latest to join this brigade is <a href="https://toqio.co/">Toqio</a>, a fintech platform with a white label digital finance SaaS that allows anyone to launch a new fintech product.</p>
<p>The London-based startup has now secured an €8M / $9.4M seed round of funding led by Seaya Ventures and Speedinvest, with SIX FinTech Ventures participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2019 by Eduardo Martínez and Michael Galvin, the teams behind Toqio previously built a small business SaaS startup, Geniac, which was acquired by Grant Thornton.</p>
<p>Eduardo Martínez, co-Founder and CEO, of Toqio, said: “Businesses and banks are looking to innovate in the FinTech sector, but to date, they have had to create and maintain complex software solutions to do this. This has also kept smaller niche businesses out of the market. We don’t want FinTech to end up like banking just with a new set of big incumbents trying to take control of financial services. We want to level the playing field.”</p>
<p>Toqio says its customers get access to pre-built products to create applications that can go to market quickly. Products include digital banking, card, and financing solutions, and a marketplace, aimed at financial institutions, FinTech startups, banks, and corporate brands.</p>
<p>Headquartered in London and Madrid, Toqio says it already has customers across Europe, including new Spanish bank Crealsa, business banking service Wamo in Malta, and alternative business lender Just Cash Flow in the UK.</p>
<p>Aristotelis Xenofontos, Principal at Seaya Ventures, said: ”We have spent many years following the Embedded Finance space and finally found the missing piece, a seamless enabler that glues everything together. Toqio is a truly end-to-end platform that provides a complete plug-and-play bank and allows any organization to offer a full suite of digital financial services in a rapid, painless, future-proof, and low-cost way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stefan Klestil, General Partner at Speedinvest, added: “We’ve seen the rise of neo-banks, the change of regulations across multiple markets, and now we’re starting to see traditional businesses and big brands looking to embed financial products within their existing offerings. Financial services are going to change and expand at an unprecedented rate, and Toqio will be instrumental in enabling it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce in Europe is set to <a href="https://internetretailing.net/rxgeu/rxgeu/european-ecommerce-revenues-jump-30-to-us465bn-in-2021#:~:text=European%20eCommerce%20revenues%20jump%2030%25%20to%20US%24465bn%20in%202021,-Europe%20is%20experiencing&amp;text=The%20COVID%2D19%2Dled%20boom,and%20the%20number%20of%20users.&amp;text=Statistics%20show%20that%20European%20eCommerce,US%2471bn%20increase%20YoY." target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow 30% percent this year</a>, with the online shopping surge that started at the rise of Covid-19 showing little sign of abating. Today, a startup that&#8217;s building infrastructure in the region to help merchants fill and deliver those orders &#8212; and present an alternative to using Amazon for fulfillment &#8212; is announcing funding to expand its footprint to meet that demand.</p>
<p><a href="https://getbyrd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Byrd</a>, which builds software to manage warehouses and logistics operations, and also runs a service to help online merchants store, pick and deliver their orders, has picked up €16 million ($19 million), a Series B that it will be using to expand to five more markets in eastern, northern and southern Europe in addition to the five countries where it&#8217;s already active. Founded in Vienna, Austria in 2016, Byrd is also in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and France, where together it has some 15 fulfillment centers and 200 customers, including Durex, Freeletics, Scholl, Your Superfoods and other D2C brands in health and wellness, consumer packaged goods, cosmetics and fashion.</p>
<p>Mouro Capital &#8212; a strategic fintech/e-commerce VC that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/mouro-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spun out from banking giant Santander last year</a> &#8212; led the round, with Speedinvest, Verve Ventures, Rider Global and VentureFriends also participating. Byrd isn&#8217;t disclosing its valuation but has raised some €26 million to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The gap in the market that Byrd is going after is a growing one, not just in terms of size but in terms of retailers&#8217; demand, and what they are looking for in a fulfillment partner.</p>
<p>E-commerce is a deceptively complex business &#8212; deceptive, because as consumers all we ever really see or care about is the ability to find what we are looking for at a decent price, click on it, buy it without too much fuss and have it appear at our doors, ideally asap.</p>
<p>But the steps needed behind the scenes to make all of that possible are many, and mostly complex, and not usually in the core competency of a typical small retailer, who may have identified a product it thinks the world wants, but not how to get it to them. They include marketing, payments, user interface designs, personalization, manufacturing and other supply chain concerns, and yes, the logistics and fulfillment to get orders to customers. As e-commerce continues to become a bigger channel, all of these segments in the chain represent ever-growing opportunities.</p>
<p>Typically, retailers will look to third-party tech companies to provide these different services, and this is where Byrd comes in, as an outsourced partner to handle companies&#8217; logistics and fulfillment. The company has built a set of APIs that let retailers essentially plug in and shift the whole fulfillment operation to Byrd.</p>
<p>That includes integrating with Byrd&#8217;s warehouses to receive, store and pick items; and it also includes connecting with a company&#8217;s merchant network, which could include a merchant&#8217;s own online storefront, but also Amazon and other marketplaces where items are sold. When an order comes in and it is time to pick and ship an item, Byrd also uses its tech to taps into a network of different shipping companies &#8212; the list includes the likes of UPS, DHL, Amazon, postNL and others &#8212; to find the cheapest and easiest way of getting an item to the buyer.</p>
<p>To be totally clear, Byrd is not the only one doing this. But alongside other independent companies that compete with Byrd &#8212; one of the biggest, ShipBob, last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/shipbob-nabs-200m-at-a-1b-valuation-to-help-e-commerce-companies-run-logistics-like-amazons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a big round of $200 million on a $1 billion valuation</a> &#8212; is a big elephant in the room in the form of Amazon. The e-commerce giant has positioned itself as something of a one-stop shop for merchants, providing not just fulfillment (via <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBA</a>), but storefront visibility, marketing and much more.</p>
<p>The size of Amazon is such that it typically accounts for a large market share, and many merchants can&#8217;t <em>not</em> have a presence there even if it&#8217;s primarily as a customer acquisition channel, said Petra Dobrocka, co-founder and CCO of Byrd, in an interview.</p>
<p>But the problem is that the Amazon option, and some of the other third-party providers, don&#8217;t leave much to personalization. Indeed, as e-retailers continue to mature, and find themselves facing their own stiff competition, they are looking for more ways of getting an edge, and to stand out from the crowd. Byrd provides something here for them, too, giving them the option to customize packaging so that customers are essentially experiencing a direct service, even when it&#8217;s actually coming from Byrd, and to give them options to go for more sustainable delivery and more if they choose.</p>
<p>That has possibly meant a slower rate of scaling for the startup, but it comes as a quality option, and that counts for something in a world that is teetering on very poor quality control, and definitely lack of distinct identity, in some marketplaces particularly as they continue to scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could say we are an alternative to Amazon, but also quite different. Our sellers are very brand-focused and want to provide a total experience total to customers,&#8221; Dobrocka said. &#8220;We also have smaller customers who appreciate this.&#8221; Indeed, as is so often the case, smaller businesses get short-changed on service levels compared to bigger businesses, so having a fulfillment service that treats even smaller retailers like bigger ones is a plus.</p>
<p>This is also part of a bigger trend, where a wave of tech companies are emerging to help those retailers build more distinct online presence and personalization, too. (The online storefront design platform Shogun, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/shogun-a-front-end-e-commerce-page-builder-nabs-67-5m-as-retailers-look-for-alternatives-to-marketplaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also announced funding last week</a>, is another example of a startup playing into this trend.)</p>
<p>All of this has led to Byrd seeing some very strong growth &#8212; revenues are up 300% compared to a year ago &#8212; with &#8220;hundreds of thousands of parcels per month&#8221; being handled, the company said.</p>
<p>Although its primary business is in catering to the very big B2C opportunity one obvious adjacent area where Byrd could work is in B2B, and Dobrocka said that will also be coming online in the coming months. Alongside that, while the company hasn&#8217;t specified which countries it will build out its fulfillment in next, given Mouro&#8217;s involvement, I&#8217;m guessing that Spain might be one of the next countries on the list.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to be leading Byrd’s Series B funding round, particularly as the pandemic has brought the need for flexible, digital e-commerce fulfilment solutions into sharp relief,&#8221; said Manuel Silva Martínez, general partner at Mouro Capital, in a statement. &#8220;Byrd’s end-to-end capabilities, focus on sustainability, and household brand customers set it apart from its competitors, and we look forward to seeing the successes that the geographic expansion enabled by this investment will bring.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter no longer enjoys the liability protection against user-generated content in India, the government said in a court filing this week as tension escalates between the two over the South Asian nation&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new IT rules</a>.</p>
<p>In a court filing on Monday, New Delhi said Twitter has lost its immunity in India after the American social network failed to comply with the new local IT rules, which were unveiled in February and went into effect in late May.</p>
<p>Experts have said in recent weeks that the Indian court &#8212; and not the Indian government &#8212; <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/limits-of-modis-power-to-control-twitter/">holds the power</a> to decide whether Twitter gets to keep its safe harbor protections in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Internet services enjoy what is broadly referred to as “safe harbor” protection that say that tech platforms won&#8217;t be held liable for the things their users post or share online. If you insult someone on Twitter, for example, the company may be asked to take down your post (if the person you have insulted has approached the court and a takedown order has been issued) but it likely won&#8217;t be held legally responsible for what you said or did.</p>
<p>Without the protection, Twitter &#8212; which according to mobile insight firm App Annie, has over 100 million users in India &#8212; is on paper responsible for everything those users say on its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I state the immunity conferred on intermediaries under section 79(1) is a conditional immunity subject to the intermediary satisfying the conditions under sections 79(2) and 79(3). As provided in Rule 7, failure to observe the IT Rules 2021 results in provisions of Section 79(1) of the IT Act, 2000 not being applicable to such an intermediary,&#8221; N Samaya Balan of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology wrote in the filing.</p>
<p>The move comes as tension escalates between the Indian government and Twitter. Google, Facebook, and several other firms have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/facebook-whatsapp-google-and-other-internet-giants-comply-with-indias-it-rules/">partially or fully complied with the IT rules</a>, which among other things, requires any significant social media firm (any firm with over 5 million users in India) to appoint a chief compliant officer, a resident grievance officer, and a so-called nodal contact person to address on-ground concerns.</p>
<p>Twitter has not complied with any of these requirements, the court filing said. Twitter had no comment on Monday&#8217;s filing, but has said in the past that it intends to comply with the IT rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;All social media platforms are welcome to do business in India. They can criticize Ravi Shankar Prasad, my Prime Minister or anyone. The issue is of misuse of social media. Some of them say we are bound by American laws. You operate in India, make good money, but you will take the position that you&#8217;ll be governed by American laws. This is plainly not acceptable,&#8221; India&#8217;s IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a conference last week.</p>
<p>With the liability protection stripped off, Twitter executives in India could face several criminal charges over content deemed objectionable on the platform. Indian police have already filed at least five cases against the company or its officials in the country over a range of issues.</p>
<p>A special squad of Delhi police <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">made a surprise visit to two of Twitter&#8217;s offices in late May</a> in what many perceived as an intimidation tactic. Twitter said at the time that it was “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-says-concerned-with-india-intimidation-requests-3-more-months-to-comply-with-new-it-rules/">concerned by recent events</a> regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve” and requested the Indian government to grant it three additional months to comply with the new IT rules.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, too, hasn&#8217;t fully complied with the new IT rules. The IT rules also mandate operators of encrypted messaging apps to introduce a way for the law enforcement to be able to &#8220;trace&#8221; the originator of objectionable messages. WhatsApp, which has amassed over 530 million users in India, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatsapp-sues-india-government/">sued the Indian government</a> in May over this requirement, saying making &#8220;traceability&#8221; possible would violate citizens’ constitutional right to privacy.</p>
<p>Signal has also <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/messaging-application-signal-not-in-compliance-with-new-rules-say-officials-101624508925464.html">reportedly not complied</a> with the traceability requirement. The messaging service didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. It&#8217;s unclear whether Apple, which has tens of millions of Messages / iMessage users in India, has complied with the traceability requirement. It declined to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Business trip booking platform <a href="https://www.travelperk.com">TravelPerk</a> has bagged another rival &#8212; picking up UK-based <a href="https://www.clicktravel.com">Click Travel</a>. Terms of the deal are not being disclosed but we&#8217;re told it&#8217;s the third &#8212; and largest &#8212; acquisition for TravelPerk to date.</p>
<p>The Barcelona-based startup has been on a bit of a shopping spree since the pandemic crisis hit Europe last year, picking up risk management startup Albatross in summer 2020 to bolster resilience to COVID-19&#8217;s impacts, before going on to acquire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/">US-based NexTravel</a> in January to expand its presence in the US market.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1gbILd8hOR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/">Business trip platform TravelPerk buys YC-backed rival NexTravel</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Business trip platform TravelPerk buys YC-backed rival NexTravel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/embed/#?secret=1gbILd8hOR" data-secret="1gbILd8hOR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The latest acquisition deepens TravelPerk&#8217;s UK and European business, adding Click Travel&#8217;s 2,000+ SME clients (which includes the likes of Five Guys, Red Bull and Talk Talk) to its customer base &#8212; which will total just over 5,000 post-acquisition.</p>
<p>The UK company handles some £300M in business <span class="il">travel</span> for its client base, which will bolster TravelPerk&#8217;s revenues going forward. The latter now bills itself as the &#8220;leading&#8221; travel management platform for the SME market globally and the UK as a whole.</p>
<p>“We are a global travel management platform but our core markets are the US and Europe and we expect both markets to be our primary growth areas this year,&#8221; said CEO and co-founder Avi Meir. &#8220;At the current moment, the US is our largest market due to the covid restrictions in the EU &amp; UK.”</p>
<p>“Assuming <span class="il">travel</span> restrictions won’t be imposed again, we expect to grow by 200% in 2022 with strong growth in our core markets in the US &amp; EU,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Click Travel, which is based in Birmingham, was founded all the way back in 1999 &#8212; and appears to have raised relatively little venture capital over the years, per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/click-travel">Crunchbase</a>. However, in 2018, the veteran player <a href="https://www.clicktravel.com/blog/joining-future-fifty-2018-tech-city-uk/">participated in the government-backed Future Fifty</a> scale-up program &#8212; and also took in a &#8220;<a href="https://www.clicktravel.com/blog/click-travel-receives-multi-million-pound-investment-from-the-bgf/">multi-million pound</a>&#8221; investment from the UK-based Business Growth Fund.</p>
<p>Whether there will be any domestic hang-wringing over a high growth UK business being sold to a European rival remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In a statement on its sale to TravelPerk, CEO James McLean omitted to mention the pandemic&#8217;s impact on the travel sector &#8212; choosing instead to highlight what he couched as the pair&#8217;s shared &#8220;mission&#8221; to reduce the cost and complexity of business travel.</p>
<p>“Those shared objectives, combined with the natural cultural fit between our two companies, means we are incredibly excited to bring our teams together. Combining TravelPerk’s industry-leading knowledge, technology, experience and first class customer support with our own is a powerful proposition and we can’t wait to get started,&#8221; McLean added.</p>
<p>While Click Travel has focused on serving the UK market, TravelPerk has had a global focus from the start.</p>
<p>It has also attracted a large amount of external investment (totalling just under $300M) over its shorter run (founded in 2015).</p>
<p>Back in April, for example, it <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">raised a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/travelperk-raises-160m-in-equity-and-debt-after-a-year-of-derailed-business-trips/">$160M Series D round</a>. It had also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/18/on-a-growth-tear-work-trip-saas-travelperk-adds-60m-to-its-series-c/">topped up its Series C round in July 2019</a> before the pandemic hit. So TravelPerk<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> hasn&#8217;t been short of funds to ride out the COVID-19 revenue crunch &#8212; and as well as shopping for competitors it has also been able to avoid making any layoffs over the travel crisis. </span></p>
<p>Per a press release, capital to fund the Click Travel acquisition was provided by Boston-based investment manager, The Baupost Group.</p>
<p>TravelPerk&#8217;s Meir remains bullish about the near-term prospects for growth in the business travel sector, despite ongoing concerns in Europe and the US about the more infectious &#8216;Delta&#8217; variant of the virus which is contributing to surging rates of COVID-19 in some markets (including the UK) &#8212; claiming it&#8217;s already seeing green shoots of recovery in &#8220;key markets&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;TravelPerk is outgrowing the market pace and is already at above 2019 revenue figures,&#8221; Meir told TechCrunch. “When it comes to the rest of the industry, the recovery of travel is well underway but moving at different speeds in different markets. For instance in the US, according to <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1625565110777000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcpOdkpHNnOKtACtKxfP4hXfIlog">TSA Checkpoint figures</a>, at the current rate of recovery the US travel market is expected to reach pre-pandemic volume at the end of August 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;We anticipate the global market may take a little longer but are optimistic we will see close to pre-pandemic levels in 2022.”</p>
<p>“We’re one of the few players in the travel industry that continued scaling and growing since the beginning of the pandemic with a strategy that didn’t involve any layoffs,&#8221; he also told us. “Since March last year, our strategy has been not to sit back but to be aggressive and invest massively in our product offering and in our global reach, so that we are in the best position possible to capitalise when travel makes its full recovery. Today’s news is a major part of that plan.</p>
<p>“We will aim to continue being aggressive in our growth strategy and we are open to more acquisitions if they make strategic sense and are aligned with our vision and culture.”</p>
<p>Per Meir, Click Travel and TravelPerk will initially continue to run as two independent platforms but he confirmed that an &#8220;eventual full integration&#8221; is planned &#8212; with both set to operate under the TravelPerk brand in time.</p>
<p>The startup also says it will retain all Click Travel&#8217;s staff &#8212; denying it has plans to axe any jobs. It also intends to hold onto the company&#8217;s Birmingham base &#8212; having the city as another UK hub for its business (in addition to its existing London office).</p>
<p>“The 150 amazing people working for Click Travel were a big reason why we wanted to acquire the company, and were priced into the deal,&#8221; said Meir. &#8220;We have no plans of redundancies. We rather aim to integrate the entire team into the TravelPerk Group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if TravelPerk might consider expanding its focus to also target the enterprise segment, he noted that it&#8217;s seen interest from larger businesses &#8212; and said he&#8217;s &#8220;open&#8221; to the idea &#8212; but for now Meir said TravelPerk remains fully focused on the SME market: &#8220;where we think there is the biggest need, and the biggest growth potential&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s why this acquisition is so exciting for us; it makes us undoubtedly the leading <span class="il">travel</span> management platform for SMEs globally,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2>Flexibility and sustainability</h2>
<p>Discussing how the pandemic has changed business travel, Meir highlighted two &#8220;important trends&#8221; he said TravelPerk will continue to invest it: Namely flexibility for bookings; and sustainability so environmental impact can be reduced.</p>
<p>TravelPerk plans to invest more than $100M in two key products in these areas (aka: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/travelperk-launches-flexible-refunds-to-help-businesses-save-on-cancelled-trips/">FlexiPerk</a> and GreenPerk), per Meir.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve noticed on our platform that travellers are booking closer to their departure date: Before the pandemic, trip searches were usually conducted between 7 and 30 days prior to the selected departure date,&#8221; he said, elaborating on the importance of flexibility for the sector. &#8220;Now we are seeing most trip searches are for trips less than 6 days away. Flexibility is therefore one of the most in-demand perks in business <span class="il">travel</span>. Travellers will rely on flexible fares to give them the peace of mind that they won’t lose money if they need to change or cancel a trip on short notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>On sustainability, Meir said businesses are already looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint and general environmental impact, while consumers are also wanting to make conscientious decisions to reduce carbon emission &#8212; suggesting that train-based travel is set to gain ground (vs flights) as a result. (That might, ultimately, require some creative retooling of TravelPerk&#8217;s logo &#8212; which prominently features an airplane icon&#8230; )</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to see significant interest in our carbon offsetting product, GreenPerk, as a result but we also expect to see changes in how people are choosing to <span class="il">travel</span>,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For instance, rail is undoubtedly the more environmentally-friendly <span class="il">travel</span> option. In fact, taking a train over a domestic flight can reduce an individual’s carbon emissions by about 84%. We have been building out our rail inventory for a number of years now and we expect train <span class="il">travel</span> to be an increasingly popular business <span class="il">travel</span> option for customers this year and next.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the changing mix of business-related travel in a pandemic-reconfigured world of remote work, Meir continues to argue that more businesses providing employees with remote working options will sum to more business travel overall.</p>
<p>&#8220;This might be bad news for the daily commute but it will result in more business <span class="il">travel,</span>&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;Whether they are going fully remote and &#8216;working from anywhere&#8217;, or operating on a hybrid model, distributed teams will need (and want) to come together. We believe there will be a new type of business trip &#8212; one where team members will <span class="il">travel</span> from different working hubs to get together for teambuilding and brainstorming sessions, for meetings with clients and colleagues, and even for &#8216;bleisure&#8217; (business and leisure) trips.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pine Labs said on Tuesday it has closed a $600 million financing round as the Asian merchant commerce platform sets the goal to explore the public markets within two years.</p>
<p>Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, BlackRock, Ishana, as well as a fund advised by Neuberger Berman Investment Advisers, and IIFL and Kotak invested in the round, which values the startup at $3 billion. Pine Labs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/merchant-commerce-platform-pine-labs-raises-285-million/">unveiled the new round</a>, a name of which it hasn&#8217;t disclosed, earlier this year.</p>
<p>Pine Labs, which counts Sequoia Capital India, Temasek, PayPal and Mastercard among its early backers, offers hundreds of thousands of merchants payments terminals, invoicing tools and working capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its payments terminal — also known as point-of-sale machines — are connected to the cloud, and offer a range of additional services such as working capital — to the merchants. Pine Labs’s payments terminal has integration with over two dozen banks and financial and technology partners.</p>
<p>This differentiates Pine Labs from the competition, whose terminals typically have integration with just one bank. Each time a rival firm strikes a new partnership with a bank, they need to deploy new machines into the market. This makes the whole deployment expensive for both the fintech and the bank. (This is why you also often see a restaurant has multiple terminals at the check out.) The startup says it processes tens of billions of payment transactions.</p>
<p>“Over the last year, Pine Labs has made significant progress in its offline-to-online strategy in India and the direct-to-consumer play in Southeast Asia. Our full-stack approach to payments and merchant commerce has allowed us to grow in-month merchant partnerships by nearly 100% over the last year,&#8221; said B. Amrish Rau, CEO, Pine Labs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to bring on board a marquee set of new investors in this round and appreciate the confidence they have placed on the Pine Labs business model and our growth momentum,” said Amrish Rau, adding that he plans to take the startup public in 18 months.</p>
<p>In recent years, Pine Labs has made several acquisitions to broaden its business. In 2019, it acquired QwikCilver, which leads the market in gift cards category. Earlier this year, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/pine-labs-acquires-southeast-asian-startup-fave-for-45-million/">acquired Southeast Asian startup Fave for $45 million</a> as it broadened its consume side of the business.</p>
<p>Over 6 million consumers across over 40,000 merchant establishments now have access to the Fave app, the startup said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through its acquisitions of QwikCilver and Fave, Pine Labs now has the market leading pre-paid platform in this region as well as the top consumer loyalty product in this market. With leadership across multiple categories, the company is very well positioned to help drive immense value to its merchant partners in India and across other SEA markets,” said Shailendra Singh, MD, Sequoia Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Whether you are part of the accounting department, or just any employee at an organization, managing expenses can be a time-consuming and error-filled, yet also quite mundane, part of your job. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.pleo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pleo</a> &#8212; which has built a platform that can help some of that work more smoothly, by way of a vertically integrated system that includes payment cards, expense management software, and integrated reimbursement and pay-out services &#8212; is announcing a big round of growth funding to expand its business after seeing strong traction.</p>
<p>The Copenhagen-based startup has raised $150 million &#8212; money that it will be using to continue building out more features for its users, and for business development. The round, which sets a record for being the largest Series C for a Danish startup, values Pleo at $1.7 billion, the startup has confirmed.</p>
<p>There are around 17,000 small and medium businesses now using Pleo, with companies at the medium end of that numbering around 1,000 employees. Now with Pleo moving into slightly larger customers (up to 5,000 employees, CEO Jeppe Rindom, said), the startup has set an ambitious target of reaching 1 million users by 2025, a very lucrative goal, considering that expenses management is estimated to be a $80 billion market in Europe (with the global opportunity, of course, even bigger).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It will also be using the funds simply to expand its business. Pleo has around 330 employees today spread across London, Stockholm, Berlin and Madrid, as well as in Copenhagen, and it will be using some of the investment to grow that team and its reach.</p>
<p>Bain Capital Ventures and Thrive Capital co-led this round, a Series C. Previous backers, including Creandum, Kinnevik, Founders, Stripes and Seedcamp, also participated. Stripes led the startup&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/pleo-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B in 2019</a>. It looks like this round was oversubscribed: the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/expenses-startup-pleo-preps-100m-series-c-funding-launches-new-bill-payments-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original intention</a> had been to raise just $100 million.</p>
<p>Like other business processes, managing expenses and handling company spending has come a long way in the last many years.</p>
<p>Gone are the days where expenses inevitably involved collecting paper receipts and inputting them manually into a system in order to be reimbursed; now, expense management software links up with company-issued cards and taps into a range of automation tools to cut out some of the steps in the process, integrating with a company&#8217;s internal accounting policies to shuffle the process along a little less painfully. And there are a number of companies in this space, from older players like SAP&#8217;s Concur through to startups on the cusp of going public like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expensify</a> as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/appzen-nabs-35m-for-ai-that-audits-expenses-in-real-time-for-non-compliance-and-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">younger entrants</a> bringing new technology into the process.</p>
<p>But, there is still lots more room for improvement. Rindom, Pleo&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with CTO Niccolo Perra, said the pair came up with the idea for Pleo on the back of years of working in fintech &#8212; both were early employees at the B2B supply chain startup Tradeshift &#8212; and seeing first-hand how short-changed, so to speak, small and medium businesses in particular were when it came to tools to handle their expenses.</p>
<p>Pleo&#8217;s approach has been to build, from the ground up, a system for those smaller businesses that integrate all the different stages of how an employee might spend money on behalf of the company.</p>
<p>Pleo starts with physical and virtual payment cards (which can be used in, for example, Apple Wallet) that are issued by Pleo (in partnership with MasterCard) to buy goods and services, which in turn are automatically itemized according to a company&#8217;s internal accounting systems, with the ability to work with e-receipts, but also let people use their phones to snap pictures of receipts when they are only on paper, if required. This is pretty much table stakes for expense software these days, but Pleo&#8217;s platform is going a couple of steps beyond that.</p>
<p>Users (or employers) can integrate a users&#8217; own banking details to make it easier to get reimbursed when they have had to pay for something out of their own pocket; or conversely to pay for something that shouldn&#8217;t have been charged on the card. And if there are invoices to be paid at a later date from the time of purchase, these too can be actioned and set up within Pleo rather than having to liaise separately with an accounts payable department to get those settled. Higher <a href="https://www.pleo.io/en/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">priced tiers</a> (beyond the basic service for up to five users) also lets a company set spending limits for individual users. Pricing is based on number of users, per month.</p>
<p>Pleo also has built fraud protection services into the platform to detect, for example, cases when a card number might have been compromised and is being used for non-work purposes.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s notable is that the startup has built all of the tech that it uses, including the payments feature, from the ground up, to have full control over the features and specifically to be able to add more of them more flexibly over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the beginning we ran with a partner in services like payments, but it didn’t allow us to move fast enough,&#8221; Rindom said in an interview. &#8220;So we decided to take all of that in-house.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems like this opens the door to a lot of possibilities for how Pleo might evolve in the years ahead now that it&#8217;s focused on hyper-growth. However, Rindom added that whatever the next steps might be, they will remain focused on continuing to solve the expenses problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to our infrastructure we use it only for ourselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have no plans of selling [for example, payments] as a service, even if we do have a lot of other ideas for broadening our offerings.&#8221; Indeed, the ability to pay invoices was launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/expenses-startup-pleo-preps-100m-series-c-funding-launches-new-bill-payments-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only in April of this year</a>. &#8220;We come up with things all the time, but will launch only those relevant to customers.&#8221; For now, at least.</p>
<p>That focus and perhaps even more than that the execution and customer traction are what have brought investors around to backing a fintech out of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future of work empowers employees with the tools they need to be effective, productive, and successful,&#8221; said Keri Gohman, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Pleo understands this critical shift for modern companies toward employee centricity—providing workers with a fun-to-use spend management app that automatically tracks their corporate spending and generates expense reports, paired with the powerful tools businesses need to create full visibility and management of every penny spent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bain has been a pretty active investor in European fintech, also backing GoCardless in its recent round. &#8220;BCV invests in founders who aren&#8217;t afraid to tackle big problems, and Jeppe and Nicco saw a big challenge that employers faced—tracking all corporate spending and reconciling expenses back to the general ledger—and solved it with elegant technology that both employers and employees love,&#8221; added Merritt Hummer, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures.</p>
<p>Thrive is also a notable backer here, and it will be interesting to see how and if Pleo links up with others in the VC&#8217;s portfolio, which include companies like Plaid, Gong and Trade Republic.</p>
<p>“Pleo has already transformed the way that over 17,000 companies think about managing their expenses, saving them time and lowering costs while increasing transparency,&#8221; noted Kareem Zaki, a general partner at Thrive Capital, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to partner closely with the Pleo team to help drive their next phase of growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Friday, a flood of ransomware hit hundreds of companies around the world. A grocery store chain, a public broadcaster, schools, and a national railway system were all hit by the file-encrypting malware, causing disruption and forcing hundreds of businesses to close.</p>
<p>The victims had something in common: a key piece of network management and remote control software developed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">U.S. technology firm Kaseya</a>. The Miami-headquartered company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/meet-5-cybersecurity-unicorns-that-could-ipo-in-2020/">makes software</a> used to remotely manage a company&#8217;s IT networks and devices. That software is sold to managed service providers — effectively outsourced IT departments — which they then use to manage the networks of their customers, often smaller companies.</p>
<p>But hackers associated with the Russia-linked REvil ransomware-as-a-service group are believed to have used a never-before-seen security vulnerability in the software&#8217;s update mechanism to push ransomware to Kaseya&#8217;s customers, which in turn spread downstream to their customers. Many of the companies who were ultimately victims of the attack may not have known that their networks were monitored by Kaseya&#8217;s software.</p>
<p>Kaseya warned customers on Friday to &#8220;IMMEDIATELY&#8221; shut down their on-premise servers, and its cloud service — though not believed to be affected — was pulled offline as a precaution.</p>
<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[Kaseya] showed a genuine commitment to do the right thing. Unfortunately, we were beaten by REvil in the final sprint.&#8221; <cite>Security researcher Victor Gevers</cite></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>John Hammond, senior security researcher at Huntress Labs, a threat detection firm that was one of the first to reveal the attack, said about 30 managed service providers were hit, allowing the ransomware to spread to &#8220;well over&#8221; 1,000 businesses.&#8221; Security firm ESET said it knows of victims in 17 countries, including the U.K., South Africa, Canada, New Zealand, Kenya, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>On Monday night, Kaseya said <a href="https://www.kaseya.com/potential-attack-on-kaseya-vsa/">in an update</a> that about 60 Kaseya customers were affected and put the downstream number of victims at fewer than 1,500 companies.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s becoming clearer just how the hackers pulled off one of the biggest ransomware attacks in recent history.</p>
<p>Dutch researchers said they found several zero-day vulnerabilities in Kaseya&#8217;s software as part of an investigation into the security of web-based administrator tools. (Zero-days are named as such since it gives companies zero days to fix the problem.) The bugs were reported to Kaseya and were in the process of being fixed when the hackers struck, said Victor Gevers, who heads the group of researchers, in <a href="https://csirt.divd.nl/2021/07/04/Kaseya-Case-Update-2/">a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Kaseya&#8217;s chief executive Fred Voccola told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ransomware-hackers-demand-70-million-to-unlock-computer-in-widespread-attack-11625524076">The Wall Street Journal</a> that its corporate systems were not compromised, lending greater credence to the working theory by security researchers that servers run by Kaseya&#8217;s customers were compromised individually using a common vulnerability.</p>
<p>The company said that all servers running the affected software should stay offline until the patch is ready. Voccola told the paper that it expects patches to be released by late Monday.</p>
<p>The attack began late Friday afternoon, just as millions of Americans were logging off into the long July 4 weekend. Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike&#8217;s senior vice president of intelligence, said the attack was carefully timed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make no mistake, the timing and target of this attack are no coincidence. It illustrates what we define as a Big Game Hunting attack, launched against a target to maximize impact and profit through a supply chain during a holiday weekend when business defenses are down,&#8221; said Meyers.</p>
<p>A notice posted over the weekend on a dark web site known to be run by REvil claimed responsibility for the attack, and that the ransomware group would publicly release a decryption tool if it is paid $70 million in bitcoin.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than a million systems were infected,&#8221; the group claims in the post.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volvo Group, Daimler Truck and Volkswagon&#8217;s AG heavy-truck business the Traton Group <a href="https://www.volvogroup.com/en/news-and-media/news/2021/jul/news-4017125.html">announced</a> on Monday a non-binding agreement to build a network of high-performance public charging stations for electric heavy-duty long-haul trucks and buses around Europe. The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/daimler-volvo-traton-plan-600-million-truck-charging-jv-2021-07-05/">Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>The three major European automakers will invest €500 million (~$593 million USD) to install and operate 1,700 charging points in strategic locations and close to highways. They intend to finalize the agreement by the end of this year and start operations next year, with the hopes of increasing the number of charge points significantly as the companies seek additional partners for the future joint venture.</p>
<p>The venture is meant to be a catalyst to prepare for the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2050_en">European Union&#8217;s goals of carbon-neutral freight transportation by 2050</a>. One of the main deterrents for both individuals and freight companies for switching to EVs has historically been a lack of charging infrastructure. By building that infrastructure, Volvo, Daimler and Traton can also expect to boost their own sales of electric trucks and buses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It is the joint aim of Europe’s truck manufacturers to achieve climate neutrality by 2050,&#8221; Martin Daum, CEO Daimler Truck, said in a statement.  &#8220;However, it is vital that building up the right infrastructure goes hand in hand with putting CO<sub>2</sub>-neutral trucks on the road. Together with Volvo Group and the TRATON GROUP, we are therefore very excited to take this pioneering step to establish a high-performance charging network across Europe.”</p>
<p>The partnership between Volvo and Daimler isn&#8217;t unprecedented. In May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/volvo-ag-and-daimler-trucks-team-up-in-hydrogen-fuel-cell-joint-venture/">the two competitors teamed up to produce hydrogen fuel cells for long-haul trucks</a> to lower development costs and boost production volumes. This latest venture is another signal that major companies are banding together to solve climate-related issues in the industry.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-6">European car industry association ACEA has called for up to 50,000 high-performance charging points by 2030. Traton CEO Matthias Gruendler told Reuters that roughly 10 billion euros would be needed to build out Europe&#8217;s infrastructure to be fully electrified by 2050.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-6">According to a statement released by Volvo, this venture is also a call to action for others with a stake in the industry, like automakers or governments, to work together to ensure the rapid expansion needed to reach climate goals.</p>
<p>The charging stations will be brand-agnostic, and battery electric vehicle fleet operators will be able to use both the fast charging during the European 45 minute mandatory rest period for long-distance transport and also charge overnight.</p>
<p>The joint venture will operate under its own corporate identity out of Amsterdam. Volvo, Daimler and Traton will own equal shares in the venture but will continue to compete in all other areas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Croatian electric supercar startup Rimac Automobili is taking over Bugatti. Rimac will own a controlling 55% share in the new company, Bugatti-Rimac, with VW&#8217;s Porsche owning the remaining 45%, according to reports by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/56be5f08-fe6e-481f-ba6d-71ef49d2cfc4">Financial Times.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Rimac and Bugatti are a perfect match in terms of what we each bring to the table,&#8221; said founder and CEO of Rimac, Mate Rimac, in a statement. &#8220;As a young, agile and fast-paced automotive and technology company, we have established ourselves as an industry pioneer in electric technologies. With the Nevera, we have also proven that we can develop and manufacture outstanding hypercars, that are not only fast but also exciting and high-quality. Bugatti, with over a century of experience in engineering excellence, also possesses one of the most exceptional heritage of any car company in history.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463499/rimac-nevera-production-c-two-concept-hypercar">The company recently unveiled the Nevera</a>, a hypercar powered by a 120kWh battery pack and four motors to achieve a staggering 1.4MW of power, which is about 1,914 horsepower. It can go from 0 to 60 mph in 1.85 seconds and has a top speed of 258 mph. The Nevera is expected to be the fastest sports car, a spot previously held by the Bugatti Chiron&#8217;s.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rimac&#8217;s meteoric rise from bootstrapping in a garage in 2009 to building supercars with one of the most desirable and well-known car brands demonstrates how electric vehicles are beginning to take over the luxury and sports car market. It&#8217;s not just about doing what&#8217;s right for the environment – it&#8217;s about pioneering speed in the future of automobiles.</p>
<p>Along with this announcement, Rimac said it would separate the development, production and supply of battery systems, drivetrains and other EV components into a new entity owned by Rimac Group called Rimac Technology, which will work independently with other global car manufacturers.</p>
<p>The formation of Bugatti-Rimac doesn&#8217;t affect the shareholder structure within Rimac Group. Mate Rimac will continue to hold his 37% share in Rimac Group, with Hyundai Motor Group holding the same 12% and other investors at 27%, according to a <a href="https://www.rimac-automobili.com/media/press-releases/rimac-and-bugatti-combine-forces-in-historic-new-venture/">statement</a> from the company. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/porsche-raises-stake-in-electric-car-and-components-maker-rimac-automobili/">Porsche recently upped its stake in Rimac</a> from 15% to 24%, but its total ownership doesn&#8217;t give It a controlling interest in the new EV company, the companies told FT.</p>
<p>Mate Rimac will lead Bugatti-Rimac, which will be headquartered in Zagreb, Croatia. Bugatti&#8217;s manufacturing will remain in Molsheim, France.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.manomano.com">ManoMano</a> has raised a Series F funding round of $355 million led by Dragoneer Investment Group. The company operates an e-commerce platform focused on DIY, home improvement and gardening products. It is currently available in six European countries. Following today’s funding round, the company has reached a valuation of $2.6 billion.</p>
<p>In addition to Dragoneer Investment Group, Temasek, General Atlantic, Eurazeo, Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund, Aglaé Ventures, Kismet Holdings and Armat Group are also participating.</p>
<p>“We operate in Europe and we are the industry leader in online sales,” co-founder and co-CEO Philippe de Chanville told me. In France in particular, the company has been profitable for a couple of years already. In 2020 alone, the company’s gross merchandise volume <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/manomanos-sales-are-growing-rapidly-for-its-home-improvement-e-commerce-platform/">doubled</a> to €1.2 billion ($1.42 billion at today’s rate).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So why did the company raise given that it’s already in a strong position to replicate the same model in other European markets? Because they could and because they didn’t need to. With a high valuation, ManoMano could raise quite a bit of money without having to sell a significant chunk of its equity.</p>
<p>In addition to France, the startup operates in Spain, Italy, Belgium, Germany and the U.K. With today’s funding round, the company wants to develop its activities in the U.K. and Germany in particular — they are Europe’s two biggest markets for home improvement and gardening.</p>
<p>ManoMano sells products to hobbyists and also targets the B2B market with <a href="https://www.manomano.fr/pro">ManoManoPro</a>. It’s already working well in France with very small teams (1 to 5 employees) and the company is expanding this offering to Spain and Italy.</p>
<p>The startup will also invest more heavily in its product and build a better logistics infrastructure. “For the logistics part, we work with third-party logistics companies — we are a tech company,” co-founder and co-CEO Christian Raisson told me.</p>
<p>ManoMano doesn’t have its own warehouses and doesn’t own any inventory. That’s why ManoMano plans to recruit 1,000 people over the next 18 months and most of them will be tech profiles.</p>
<p>While ManoMano has 7 million clients, sales of home improvement and gardening items still mostly happen in brick-and-mortar stores. The startup is well aware that it’s not just a matter of having the best products at good price points.</p>
<p>ManoMano works with advisors (or Manodvisors) so that experts can give advice whenever customers need some tips. Overall, customers have initiated 2.3 million conversations with advisors in 2020. Recommendations and advice will be key to gain market shares. And the company is now well capitalized to innovate on this front and differentiate itself from other e-commerce platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following on from mid-June when first-time buyer mortgage lending startup <a href="https://www.generationhome.com/">Generation Home</a> raised a $30.4m Series A round and a £300m loan facility from NatWest, it’s now adding to its board.</p>
<p>Although known for becoming an Angel investor since leaving Monzo, the challenger bank startup he co-founded, <a href="https://twitter.com/t_blom">Tom Blomfield</a> hasn’t joined any startup boards.</p>
<p>That changes today with the news that he is joining Generation Home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup launched last year with radically a different model for home buying – effectively allowing relatives to become co-equity holders in the properties their children bought, and go along for the ride.</p>
<p>Generation Home founder and CEO Will Rice says the platform, therefore, unlocks far larger amounts of capital from &#8216;the bank of mum and dad’ than normally happens when money is loaned or gifted to the next generation.</p>
<p>The UK property problem is acute. According to the English Housing Survey 2020, the average U.K. renter spends 35% of their income on rent compared with 18% for homeowners paying a mortgage. High rents inhibit their ability to save and house price inflation locks more people out of homeownership.</p>
<p>Using Generation Home, parents can contribute deposits as an equity loan. Generation Home then takes responsibility for the repayment of funds to the parents upon a sale of the property or remortgage. Repayment of the loan can also be triggered once the homeowner’s equity in the property reaches a pre-agreed level, and the value of the loan can reflect changes in the house price. Plus the loan can be converted into a gift at any time, through the Generation Home platform.</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch about his move to join the board, Blomfield said: “I met Will last year and what really excites me was the product. I think it&#8217;s so relevant, and it hasn&#8217;t really been covered in the mainstream press much. The problem with first-time buyers, trying to get a mortgage, is that they almost invariably rely on help from their parents or sometimes their friends to help. I’ve had experience with this and a lot of people actually mean it as a loan and they intend to get that money back. But mortgage lenders make you sign a piece of paper saying this is an absolute gift. So hundreds of thousands of parents around the country are basically committing a &#8211; well-intentioned &#8211; fraud to help their kids get on the property ladder. So what I loved about the Generation Home product is that they&#8217;ve got this new legal structure where parents can effectively lend that money towards the deposit, but it&#8217;s structured as a loan if they want it to be. They have the right to get their money back eventually without having to lie. So that&#8217;s one thing that really really attracted me to the company. It’s just so so relevant to everyone, and people are just kind of blind to this problem.”</p>
<p>I asked him if he thinks there’s a “Monzofication” of FinTech business models in FinTech, as suggested by the success of Monzo’s model, where the user is put front and centre?</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s certainly a lot in common between what we do at Monzo and what Generation Home is trying to do. Big mortgage lenders focus on the mortgage product and the customer is like an inconvenience. As a customer you have to fit with whatever the mortgage provider will offer you and it&#8217;s totally inflexible. It’s very similar with Monzo &#8211; we tried to flip it around, and focus on what customers really want and care about every day. Simple stuff like notifications when you spend money or alerts before you go into overdraft &#8211; those are now commonplace and they weren&#8217;t, five, six years ago. I think Generation Home is doing the same thing which is focusing on the stuff that customers really, really care about, and then providing that flexibility and more features to meet their needs, rather than just raming everyone into the straitjacket of what a mortgage is doing,” he said.</p>

The Berkeley-based company has raised a seed extension that brings the round’s total to $4.7 million, up from the $3.6 million<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/03/2221406/0/en/No-code-AI-company-Obviously-AI-announces-3-6m-in-seed-funding-from-TMV-B-Capital-Group-and-notable-individuals.html"> it announced two months ago</a>. The extension was led by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/utec-one-of-asias-largest-deep-tech-investment-firms-launches-new-275m-fund">University of Tokyo Edge Capital Partners (UTEC)</a>, a deep tech investment firm, with participation from Trail Mix Ventures and B-Capital.</p>
<p>UTEC principal Kiran Mysore told TechCrunch that he found Obviously AI on Product Hunt while helping a friend without an AI/ML or coding background build machine learning models. After using Obviously AI and benchmarking it against other AutoML products, Mysore was so impressed that he reached out to the startup and led the investment round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>No code/low code startups have gained a lot of attention—and funding—over the past year. Some notable examples are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/noogata-raises-12m-seed-round-for-its-no-code-enterprise-ai-platform/">Noogata</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/abacus-ai-raises-another-22m-and-launches-new-ai-modules/">Abacus</a>. Dave says Obviously AI’s niche is mid-market businesses that don’t have a data science team, or have people who know data analytics but are not programmers.</p>

<p>Obviously AI uses proprietary technology called “Edge-Sharp AutoML” to build and train machine learning models that are customized to their clients’ needs, and can be integrated into their existing cloud services and databases. It focuses on marketing, software, direct-to-consumer, fintech and insurance companies, and currently has more than 3,000 clients, who have used more than 82,000 predictive models hosted on Obviously AI’s model.</p>
<p>Its new seed funding will be used to expand in Asian markets including Japan, where it will partner with client Dai Nippon Printing (DNP), one of the country’s largest printing companies, on its go-to-market strategy.</p>
<p>In an email to TechCrunch, Takeya Shimomura, research and development manager at Dai Nippon Printing, said, &#8220;At DNP, cutting edge predictive analytics for marketing and sales is very important to us. However, the tools today are very complicated and take months to get results. With Obviously AI, we were able to onboard several of our analysts seamlessly and got up and running in just a few hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave met Obviously AI’s co-founder and chief technology officer Tapojit Debnath while both were international students at Hampshire College. After graduating, they started internships at startups in the Bay Area. Dave was a data science intern at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/streamlabs/">Streamlabs</a>, the live-streaming software platform.</p>
<p>Originally hired to work on video encoding algorithms, Dave also spent a lot of time building machine learning models for the company’s marketing and sales team. Debnath, who was a machine learning intern at retail software startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/b8ta/">B8ta</a>, had a similar experience.</p>
<p>The two realized there is a talent shortage of machine learning engineers, and many companies rely on “citizen data analysts,” or people who understand data science, but don’t have coding experience.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173532" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4.-Model-Report.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173532" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2173532" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4.-Model-Report.png?w=680" alt="Obviously AI's machine learning model report user interface" width="800" height="431" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4.-Model-Report.png 2850w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4.-Model-Report.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4.-Model-Report.png?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4.-Model-Report.png?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4.-Model-Report.png?resize=680,366 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4.-Model-Report.png?resize=1536,828 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4.-Model-Report.png?resize=2048,1104 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4.-Model-Report.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2173532" class="wp-caption-text">Obviously AI&#8217;s machine learning model report user interface</p></div></p>
<p>“These are people that work with a lot of data but they’re not programmers themselves, and these are the kind of folks we designed these tools for. The goal is that you understand the data, and you can take that data and use the software to build a model really fast, without waiting for hours or days,” said Dave.</p>
<p>He and Debnath quit their jobs in 2018 to start working on the startup, <a href="https://www.obviously.ai/post/airbnb-garage">doing chores for their Airbnb host in exchange for rent</a> while learning how to pitch to investors, before joining U.C. Berkeley’s SkyDeck accelerator program.</p>
<p>Dave said that many auto AI/ML software platforms “brute forces a bunch of different algorithms on a data set, and picks one that performs the best.” For example, they might run 100 different algorithms before picking the one that performs the best, which means the time spent automatically building the other algorithms is wasted.</p>
<p>What Obviously AI’s Edge-Sharp AutoML does differently is look at a specific group of machine learning models that can be used on a data set before automatically shortlisting the top five models for a client’s needs, automatically tuning their hyperparameters and returning prediction results.</p>

<p>Obviously AI’s pricing plans start at $75 a month. Its typical clients are mid-sized businesses or small teams in larger businesses that don’t have a data science team, or whose data scientists are preoccupied with other work.</p>
<p>For example, a small microlending company in India with a team of about 15 people was manually deciding which applicants to give loans to when they decided to switch to AI models. They started using Obviously AI to automatically predict the chances of an applicant defaulting and how much they should be loaned. Now the company uses Obviously AI end-to-end in their app, which means customers can see the size of a loan they are likely to get immediately after applying.</p>
<p>Another use case is a German mobile gaming company that wanted to use a dynamic pricing model and needed to figure out how much individual users would be willing to pay for products like in-game tokens. They use Obviously AI to make that prediction based on a player’s interaction with a game.</p>
<p>Part of Obviously AI&#8217;s seed funding will be used on machine learning research and development to serve more use cases. Dave said that Obviously AI focuses on supervised learning use cases, where clients have data and know what to predict. Unsupervised use cases are where they have a data set, but don’t know exactly what they want, and use machine learning models to tell them if there are any interesting patterns in it. Unsupervised learning algorithms can be used for things like automatic categorization or recommendation engines on e-commerce platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As firework volleys launched out of New York City harbor last night, a very different celebration was likely taking place just a few blocks down the street at Verizon’s official headquarters in Midtown.</p>
<p>The telco, which owns TechCrunch for hopefully just a few more weeks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">pending the close of the Apollo acquisition of our parent company Verizon Media</a>, announced overnight that it had signed an agreement with Z Holdings, a division of Japan’s SoftBank Group, to sell trademarks within the Japan market around the Yahoo brand and related tech infrastructure for approximately $1.6 billion.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TKX7eoQ62S"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">Private equity firm Apollo to buy Verizon Media assets for $5B, will rename business &#8216;Yahoo&#8217;</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Private equity firm Apollo to buy Verizon Media assets for $5B, will rename business &#8216;Yahoo&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/embed/#?secret=TKX7eoQ62S" data-secret="TKX7eoQ62S" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The extremely descriptive Z Holdings owns SoftBank’s internet businesses in Japan, most notably Yahoo Japan, whose web portal remains the country’s most trafficked news website. Under its most current agreement with Verizon Media (formerly Oath, formerly AOL + Yahoo), Yahoo Japan paid a regular royalty for the rights to use the Yahoo brand name in Japan and associated technologies. Those royalties will now stop in lieu of a one-time upfront payment.</p>
<p>The resolution of the agreement was one of the key nuances left to figure out in Apollo’s $5 billion buyout of Verizon Media. The deal will give Verizon significant additional consideration as it works to pare down its debt load acquired from a spending spree on wireless spectrum auctions, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-announces-c-band-auction-results">such as its $52.9 billion acquisition of C-band spectrum earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>In a press statement from Z Holdings, the company said that “Although the Yahoo Japan License Agreement will be terminated, Yahoo Japan and Verizon Media will retain their cooperative business and technology relationship. Yahoo Japan will continue to deliver more convenient and innovative services under the ‘Yahoo! JAPAN’ brand, based on its mission statement: ‘UPDATE JAPAN.’” Expect further patches to Japan to be delivered shortly, I guess.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy 4th of July! For those of you who are actually checking your emails today while getting some sun at an overcrowded beach or diligently grilling hot dogs, welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirsten Korosec, your usual host, is off enjoying the great American outdoors, so please enjoy this takeover all the way from Auckland, New Zealand! Despite the winter chill down under and my singularity as an American on this island, I’m feeling particularly patriotic today. It was on this day 245 years ago that the 13 colonies declared themselves free and independent states, with all the power to establish commerce and pursue happiness and what not. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I sit here, a journalist, with a front row seat to the history of technological advancement, I can’t help but notice that the spirit of the Declaration of Independence, one that rebuffs authority for freedom to act as one chooses, is alive and well in the startup world. Technology, even in the transportation space, soars ever upward, unshackled in many cases by corresponding rules and regulations, and the government hastens to catch up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t know what I mean? I had a conversation today with </span><b>Lacuna</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO Hugh Martin, and he mentioned something that stayed with me and found its way into this rant. Venture capital is pouring into startups creating technology like eVTOL, air taxis, rockets and drones, but consider this: What is the ratio of startups building such futuristic tech compared to departments of transportation with aviation departments? Public private partnerships need to step up, and fast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ok, rant over. Enjoy your firecrackers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email me at </span><a href="mailto:rebecca.techcrunch@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rebecca.techcrunch@gmail.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to share thoughts, criticisms, offer up opinions or tips.

<p><b>Bird</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is having a tough week, pulling operations in San Francisco and Santa Monica, as well as Zaragoza in Spain. Both California cities had new scooter permits beginning on July 1, but there hasn’t been a Bird in sight since June 30.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In San Francisco, Bird goes by Scoot, the company it acquired in June 2019 that has been in SF for around a decade. </span><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/san-francisco-smacks-down-scooter-startups-bird-and-lime"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird previously operated in the city, but was kicked out </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2018, along with Lime, so this was an off-hand way of making it back into the Golden City. This time around, the </span><a href="https://www.sfmta.com/blog/powered-scooters-charge-citys-transportation-recovery"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SFMTA is asking Bird to halt its operations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even as the 2021 permit program begins without it, and is also levying fines to the tune of $105,600 against the company. Apparently, Bird got caught implementing its fleet manager program with unauthorized subcontractors. The permit does allow for scooter companies to use subcontractors, but they need prior approval and proof of insurance, which Bird did not provide for at least three subcontractors. The SFMTA is currently deferring its decision on letting Bird back in until it has conducted an investigation into the matter.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Scoot is proud to have partnered with the city for nearly a decade providing shared micro electric vehicles for San Francisco,” a Bird spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We are cooperating fully with the SFMTA to swiftly resolve the clerical error that occurred while urgently providing existing local businesses an alternative source of revenue during the pandemic. We apologize for the inconvenience to our riders during this evaluation period and are eager to once again serve San Francisco residents and visitors as soon as possible.” </span></p>
<p><b>Lime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Spin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on the other hand, have been asked to stay in San Francisco, so congrats to them. They’ll also be operating in </span><a href="https://www.smdp.com/after-appeal-and-litigation-threat-bird-still-receives-boot-from-santa-monica/206315"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Monica</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where Bird was again not chosen for the 2021 scooter program in large part because the city found Bird’s service to be lacking in safety and rider features, affordability and customer service, according to the Santa Monica selection committee scorecard shared with TechCrunch. The company filed an appeal and threatened litigation back in May, but was denied this week and basically told it didn’t have a legal basis for suing, according to letters between Bird’s attorneys and the City of Santa Monica shared with TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><b>Veo </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><b>Wheels </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">will also be operating in Santa Monica. Meanwhile in Spain, the </span><a href="https://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/espana/noticias/11295435/06/21/el-ayuntamiento-de-zaragoza-impide-operar-a-bird-al-negarle-la-prorroga-en-la-autorizacion-de-servicio-actual.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zaragoza City Council asked Bird to cease operations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from September onward due to noncompliance issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of Veo, the company has been on a bit of a roll after winning the New York permit. This week, </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/veo-unveils-first-ever-e-scooters-with-turn-signals-available-for-purchase-301105857.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veo unveiled what might be the industry’s first e-scooter with integrated turn signals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a sweet new safety feature that hopefully the rest of the industry will pick up on. Veo will deploy these scooters in Santa Monica and NYC next week. </span></p>

<p><b>Something for everyone?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever felt like the electric micromobility space hasn’t been badass enough? Well, </span><b>Evolve Skateboards</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has the solution for you! Its new Hadean Series skateboard can zoom up to 31 mph, and its battery can go up to 42 miles on a single charge. Rather than a wooden board, this gnarly ride’s frame is made with forged carbon composite making it strong enough to handle increased speeds and next level ollies. The cost is in the $2,500 to $3,000 range, so it’s certainly a toy for the dedicated thrill seeker.</span></p>

Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>
<p><strong>Mayors from nine American cities</strong>, including Los Angeles and Denver, sent a letter on June 30 urging federal lawmakers to include funds for planning grants for advanced air mobility (AAM) in the massive infrastructure legislation currently being debated in Congress. The letter, shared with TechCrunch by a source familiar with the matter, argues that federal grant funding for planning studies would help cities better understand and prepare for AAM technology.</p>
<p>The brief letter is fuzzy on the details. The mayors request a “modest” amount of funding. The source told TechCrunch that it would likely be in the low tens of millions, with the assumption that a one-year planning study in a large metropolitan city would cost around $1 million. So the total funds would cover around 15-20 cities. The idea is that this information could inform future rule-makings or even the Federal Aviation Administration’s reauthorization bill that’s coming up in 2023.</p>
<p>One thing that’s notable about the letter is a line that starts, “When this new transportation technology launches in 2024 and beyond … ”. While 2024 has been publicly set as a launch target for eVTOL developer like Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation, timelines are a tricky thing for emerging technologies.</p>
<p>In any case, I’ll be keeping track of these developments. It’s hard to imagine Congressional Republicans agreeing to funding for AAM when they could hardly agree on electric vehicles, but we’ll see — the low tens of millions may be a blip on the budget line of such a large funding package.</p>
<p><strong>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</strong> on June 29 <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/document/sgo-crash-reporting-adas-ads">issued an order</a> requiring OEMS and drivers of vehicles equipped with autonomous driving systems to report crashes within one day of learning about them. The order specifically relates to SAE Level 2 advanced driver assistance systems or SAE Levels 3-5 automated driving systems. Any incident that involves an injury that had to be treated at a hospital, a death, a vehicle tow-away, air bag deployment, or a pedestrian or bicyclist must be reported, the order says.</p>
<p>NHTSA says the data collected from this order will help identify safety issues or defects in the technology. “By mandating crash reporting, the agency will have access to critical data that will help quickly identify safety issues that could emerge in these automated systems,” said Dr. Steven Cliff, NHTSA’s acting administrator. “In fact, gathering data will help instill public confidence that the federal government is closely overseeing the safety of automated vehicles.”</p>
