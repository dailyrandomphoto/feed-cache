		<a href="https://twitter.com/tclozel">Thomas Clozel, M.D</a>., is co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.owkin.com/">Owkin</a>, former assistant professor of clinical onco-hematology at Hôpital Henri-Mondor in Paris, and former member of the Melnick Lab at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every October for the last four decades, Breast Cancer Awareness Month has helped to raise visibility of the most prevalent cancer on Earth — one that takes almost three-quarters of a million lives every year.</p>
<p>Despite recorded cases stretching back to ancient Egypt, breast cancer was considered an “unspeakable” condition for millennia. Women were expected to suffer in silence and “dignity.”</p>
<p>This stigma fueled academic ignorance, with breast cancer languishing as a relatively unstudied disease until just a few decades ago. For most of the last century, a woman suffering from breast cancer would be offered radiation therapy and/or surgery — often radical surgery, leaving them disfigured for little benefit — while the treatment of other cancers progressed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218362" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Breast cancer mortality barely changed from the 1930s to the 1970s, until a concerted effort by feminist and women’s liberation groups elevated the study and treatment of breast cancer to its rightful position in heavily male-dominated hospitals and research institutions. Treatment transformed in a generation.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, a woman diagnosed with breast cancer had roughly a 40% chance of surviving the next 10 years. Today, that probability has almost doubled, thanks to new drugs, cutting-edge screening methods, and more subtle and effective surgery.</p>
<p>Crucial to this transformation has been an emphasis on early diagnosis. The earlier breast cancer is spotted, the easier it is to treat. Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly critical role in identifying breast cancer. This year, Britain&#8217;s National Health Service (NHS) announced<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/222653/ai-breast-cancer-screening-project-wins/"> a study</a> of how AI could screen for breast cancer. While intended to augment, not replace, human doctors, this would help to mitigate a shortage of radiographers —<a href="https://www.rcr.ac.uk/posts/new-rcr-census-shows-nhs-needs-nearly-2000-more-radiologists"> 2,000 more</a> are needed to clear the NHS’ backlog in scans caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Startups are also using AI to tackle this shortage. Britain’s <a href="https://www.kheironmed.com/">Kheiron Medical Technologies</a> plans to use AI to screen half a million women for breast cancer. Spain’s <a href="https://www.thebluebox.tech/">the Blue Box</a> is developing a device that can detect breast cancer from urine samples. India’s <a href="https://www.niramai.com/">Niramai</a> is working on a low-cost tool that could help screen large numbers of women in rural and semi-urban areas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But equally crucial to improving outcomes is identifying patients at high risk of relapsing. Around one in 10 breast cancer patients will relapse after their initial treatment, decreasing their chance of survival.</p>
<p>Identifying them early has historically been difficult, but my team, working with Gustave Roussy, a French cancer hospital, has developed an AI tool that can spot 8 in 10 patients at high risk of relapsing. AI helps to get patients the treatment they need earlier on while also sparing lower-risk patients from frequent, unsettling checkups. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies accelerate breast cancer drug trials by recruiting high-risk patients faster.</p>
<p>Patient data privacy can be an understandable roadblock to rapid research. Hospitals are cautious about sending data off-site, and no pharmaceutical company wants to share valuable data with competitors. But AI is helping to solve these issues, allowing for the quicker, safer and cheaper development of new treatments.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning">Federated learning</a>, a novel form of AI that trains on data from multiple institutions without the data leaving the hospitals, is being used across Europe to give researchers access to essential, yet previously inaccessible, data.</p>
<p>We will also use AI to deepen our understanding of why the most aggressive forms of breast cancer are resistant to certain drugs, helping us to develop new, tailored drugs that discriminate between healthy and tumor cells better than chemotherapy.</p>
<p>While AI’s influence is increasing, equally important to improving outcomes is a recognition that healthcare is a fundamentally human endeavor. No algorithm could ever comfort a patient in their darkest moments, and no machine could ever instill and inspire the resilience that every patient needs in order to beat their disease.</p>
<p>I and every other doctor know that treating disease is as much about understanding the patient as it is about understanding their affliction. Clinician empathy <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pon.2115">is related to</a> higher patient satisfaction and lower distress, motivating a patient to continue a difficult course of treatment. Thankfully, the AI technology that is increasingly helping breast cancer treatment is designed to augment and empower doctors.</p>
<p>Breast cancer is no longer “unspeakable” for the millions who are diagnosed with it every year. The sea of pink ribbons that herald the start of October signal how far we have come in our battle against one of our oldest foes &#8212; one that we are now defeating. We may never fully eradicate breast cancer. But with AI helping to diagnose patients earlier and enabling the rapid development of treatments, it is possible that in a few decades, we may no longer have the need for a Breast Cancer Awareness Month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello friends, and welcome back to <strong>Week in Review</strong>!</p>
<p>Last week, we talked about Apple&#8217;s subscription addiction. This week, I&#8217;m diving deep into whether there&#8217;s actually any meaning to pull out of the NFT mania of 2021.</p>

<h2>the big thing</h2>
<p>The NFT market is still defying reason, but then again that&#8217;s kind of its thing. But one thing I&#8217;m especially unsure about lately as I see JPGs continue to sell for millions of dollars is&#8230; does any of this actually matter?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time over the last year grappling with the NFT market, at times I&#8217;ve lost sleep over it. As a reporter frequently covering this market, I don&#8217;t own or trade the little images myself, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped me from obsessing over the fluctuations in their prices and scouring Discords trying to follow the trends. I&#8217;ve tuned into countless Twitter Spaces and lurked subreddits trying to understand it all. I&#8217;ve also done my best to keep most of that out of this newsletter &#8212; it&#8217;s a weird niche interest that&#8217;s especially niche at the moment &#8212; but as Bitcoin flirts with a new all-time-high and the NFT mania persists, just consider this a timely update.</p>
<p>So, in the past month, investors have continued dropping billions upon billions of dollars on NFTs. OpenSea <a href="https://dappradar.com/ethereum/marketplaces/opensea">has seen more than $3 billion in transaction volume</a> in the past 30 days, and that number is actually way down quite a bit from August, showcasing just how much off-peak money continues to flow into NFTs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of that money has gone to some colorful places. One of the bigger success stories of the past month has been the platform CrypToadz which investors dumped $100 million into. They look like <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/cryptoadz-by-gremplin">this</a>. In the past couple weeks, a brand new project called MekaVerse saw $130 million in transaction volume. They&#8217;re <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mekaverse">a bit prettier</a>, but would you spend more than $8,000 on one? The platform <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/">Cryptoslam</a> (where I pulled most of the data I reference here) is tracking 163 platforms which did more than $1 million in volume in the past 30 days, a number which doesn&#8217;t even account for individual artists selling their work on platforms like OpenSea.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GgeICiYg81"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/nba-top-shot-creator-on-the-nft-craze-and-why-ethereum-still-isnt-consumer-friendly/">NBA Top Shot creator on the NFT craze and why Ethereum still isn&#8217;t consumer friendly</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NBA Top Shot creator on the NFT craze and why Ethereum still isn&#8217;t consumer friendly&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/nba-top-shot-creator-on-the-nft-craze-and-why-ethereum-still-isnt-consumer-friendly/embed/#?secret=GgeICiYg81" data-secret="GgeICiYg81" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, there are two incredibly different segments of NFT communities out there, larger-scale NFT projects like <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a> and NBA Top Shot with tens and hundreds of thousands of users and smaller-scale NFT projects like CryptoPunks and Art Blocks with just a few hundred or thousand owners. Larger-scale projects can represent more traditional gaming titles with more complex in-game economies while smaller-scale projects simply look more like fine art markets teamed with exclusive social clubs. Some smaller-scale projects have the ambition to eventually become larger-scale ones, but many have capped the number of NFTs in their projects and are designed to be exclusive.</p>
<p>In the past 30 days, Axie Infinity did more than $500 million in sales spread across nearly 2 million transactions and over 350,000 buyers. On the flip side, CryptoPunks did $200 million in sales during that same time frame across 484 transactions and 309 buyers.</p>
<p>Generally, when I&#8217;m talking about some of these big sales from smaller-scale projects with friends of mine, the first thing they mention is how this is probably all just money laundering. While I&#8217;d certainly imagine <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny/status/1443435334365114370?s=20">some of that is happening</a>, that&#8217;s ultimately a much more boring explanation than my best guess of what&#8217;s really going on, which is that a group of several thousand investors have separately rationalized irrational investing. They just happen to have chosen to do so through buying pixel art and drawings of animals.</p>
<p>While some investors might suggest that a handful of the earliest NFTs hold intrinsic value as historic objects, there are plenty of brand new NFT projects earning ten-million dollar valuations on day one with low amounts of effort and imagination.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="onWR0ozK9z"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/">The Cult of CryptoPunks</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Cult of CryptoPunks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/embed/#?secret=onWR0ozK9z" data-secret="onWR0ozK9z" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s seemingly the result of momentum from awe-struck retail investors entering a market filled with massive amounts of wealth being generated and re-invested by Ethereum millionaires who can massively overpay for deals while pushing the implied value of the objects, the projects, the entire NFT market and the price of Ethereum up concurrently. Most of these investors are also people who have held onto Ethereum through its waves and have grown fundamentally averse to cashing out, meaning they&#8217;re less likely to sell the NFTs they buy unless they&#8217;re just trying to buy another more expensive NFT or have been made an offer too good to refuse. As a result, many high-value smaller-scale projects stay liquid on the low-end while fewer sales of the rarer items underpin the massive valuations of the projects and those occasional big buys keep pushing prices higher.</p>
<p>All of this babbling of mine is to say, what&#8217;s happening here is strange. It&#8217;s also an incredibly large amount of noise mostly coming from a few thousand buyers.</p>
<p>But when most investors talk about mainstream adoption and future use cases, they&#8217;re looking at the creation of more larger-scale projects like Axie and Top Shot which embody many of the technical bells and whistles of crypto economics in more user-friendly packages that can reach the mainstream. NFTs as a concept for driving more complex virtual economies is, indeed, really fascinating, but I don&#8217;t think there are as many takeaways to draw from billions of dollars flowing into digital art and these smaller-scale projects like CrypToadz as many crypto investors and venture capitalists are trying to convince themselves.</p>
<p>Only three NFT platforms out there had more than 10,000 active unique buyers in their community in the past 30 days, and while the successes of platforms like Axie Infinity are definitely worth dissecting, it also seems clear we&#8217;re in the midst of a speculative frenzy and it&#8217;s not a very easy time to draw sober conclusions about what all this madness means for the future of the web.</p>

<h2>other things</h2>
<p>Here are a few stories this week that I think you should take a closer look at:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/"><b>Apple probably won&#8217;t be supporting alternate App Store payments anytime soon</b></a><br />
Apple did their best to convince the press and public that the court&#8217;s decision in its legal fight with Epic Games was an outright win for Apple, but over the weekend they quietly announced that weeks later they&#8217;re appealing the decision and asking the courts to put the ordered changes to allow alternative payments inside iOS apps on hold.</p>
<p>Apple put on a cool demeanor after this ruling, but it&#8217;s apparent that there are billions on the line for Apple if this order stands. Therefore delaying its rollout means billions of dollars that aren&#8217;t going to other payment providers or staying in developer coffers. Epic had already appealed the decision as well, hoping to try for a more favorable ruling, but it&#8217;s clear that anyone hoping for a speedy resolution will be disappointed &#8212; as is often the case in corporate law.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/animal-crossing-new-horizons-will-get-major-updates-and-happy-home-paradise-dlc-on-november-5/"><b>Nintendo reshapes its SaaS ambitions</b></a><br />
Nintendo has been and probably always will be a bit of an odd big company. They&#8217;ve been resistant to new trends in gaming and when they embrace them, they don&#8217;t necessarily do a great job capitalizing on them, and yet their mountain of beloved IP allows them chance after chance to get things right. This week, they announced more details on their new annual membership called Nintendo Switch Online+ which, for $50 per year will give gamers a deeper array of content. That&#8217;s a good deal more than the standard $20 per year for the regular Nintendo Switch Online subscription, but beyond expanded virtual console support for an unannounced array of N64 games, it&#8217;s not clear what exactly the sell is for consumers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they&#8217;re launching the service with free access to a major update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It&#8217;s a play that only works when you&#8217;re Nintendo and the penetration of your first-party titles is so incredibly high among device-owners (and especially likely subscribers). Nintendo has sold more than 3.4 million copies of the new Animal Crossing title globally.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">Microsoft pulls LinkedIn from China</a><br />
</b>It&#8217;s been a particularly turbulent time for tech companies across China as government regulators crack down and the outlook clouds for big platforms there. This week, Microsoft announced that it&#8217;s pulling LinkedIn out of China, detailing that LinkedIn was now “facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China.” LinkedIn didn&#8217;t have a huge presence in China so this won&#8217;t make major waves, but as other American tech giants are forced to make major adjustments to their China strategy, this marks yet another datapoint in the cooling of relations between China and the West.</p>
<p>The LinkedIn&#8217;s of the world don&#8217;t hold much sway in China, the most curious bit of this is how this regulatory upswing eventually affects Apple which does hold plenty of influence. While officials probably aren&#8217;t keen to jam them up, the past year has shown that China&#8217;s regulators have plenty of surprises up their sleeves.</p>

<p><em>Some of my favorite reads from our newly-renamed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/">TechCrunch+</a> subscription service this week:</em></p>

&#8220;&#8230;Visa and Plaid might have chosen to go their own ways in the end, but the year wasn’t a total loss for the data connectivity startup: Plaid claims its customer count grew 60% in 2020, and company execs say it has had similar growth so far this year&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;More capital is flooding into growth equity at earlier stages, and it’s happening faster than ever before. But even with the rampant enthusiasm for pouring bigger equity checks into startups, founders are now in a unique place in time where they can think differently about how to capitalize their companies&#8230;.<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span></p>

The goal of GSDD is to increase the amount of time we spend in deep work by minimizing distractions for one day every other week&#8230;&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>This week, cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase announced that it is launching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-its-own-nft-platform-to-take-on-opensea/">its own NFT platform</a> to take on OpenSea, an existing NFT platform. Some techies aptly pointed out that both Coinbase and OpenSea are backed by Andreessen Horowitz, leading to questions around competitive conflicts that could arise from having a shared investor (it’s unclear if a16z ever sold its shares in Coinbase after it went public).</p>
<p>As we discussed on Equity this week, the idea of having competitive companies within the same portfolio feels uncomfortable. It could impact how open each company is with its investors, and, as we saw with Hinge Health, can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/bessemer-replaces-board-member-at-hinge-health-following-competitive-tensions/">cause tension if there’s an overlap in advisers.</a> It’s a fair argument.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218530" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SCIBSfXMVk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/coinbase-goes-fishing-for-openseas-catch/">Coinbase goes fishing for OpensSea’s catch</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Coinbase goes fishing for OpensSea’s catch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/coinbase-goes-fishing-for-openseas-catch/embed/#?secret=SCIBSfXMVk" data-secret="SCIBSfXMVk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But, is it just me, or does competitive conflict sound somewhat inevitable? As venture firms grow, especially an institution like a16z, the idea that no portfolio companies in booming sectors like fintech or crypto overlap in vision feels unrealistic. Clubhouse, another a16z-backed company, was met with an entire wave of competitors after its debut — and I joked then that it&#8217;s only a matter of time until one of the firm’s portfolio companies pivots to social audio, too.</p>
<p>In a world of rapid deal-making and booming subsectors, competitive conflict will continue to grow. Imitation holds startups to a higher standard. If a startup can copy your idea, and entirely win based off of that, a shared investor is likely not your problem. Sure, there should be some processes in place to make sure that your board member isn’t sitting in meetings with your closest competitor, but, beyond extreme cases, the line is blurring on what should constitute conflicts.</p>
<p>I’m being harsh, but that’s my first reaction. Your competitor can always eat your lunch, but in the great OpenSea, maybe that just means it’s time to swim a little deeper.</p>
<p>As always, you can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> or <a href="https://linktr.ee/Equitypod">listen to me on Equity.</a> This week, I also made a guest appearance on Here &amp; Now <a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/10/13/education-technology">to talk about edtech’s evolution!</a></p>
<h2>A fund for, and by, South Asian female entrepreneurs</h2>

<p>As a South Asian female, I was amped to see the emerging fund manager world get a new influx of my people this week. Neythri Futures Fund announced that it has closed a $10 million fund with investments from leading South Asian men and women.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what you need to know: </strong>The fund, per founding managing partner Mythili Sankaran, brought together 200 investors, with 90% South Asian women and, here’s the kicker, 70% first-time investors. It was built on AngelList, which has been working on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/angellist-pioneers-rolling-vc-funds-in-pivot-to-saas/">a suite of SaaS tools for venture capitalists.</a></p>

ClassPass, for those who don’t know, helps fill workout classes with consumers, while Mindbody provides the software that helps fitness centers and boutique shops better run their business.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>It felt sensical and smart, two words that should be associated with acquisitions.</p>
<blockquote><p>By combining forces, the Mindbody/ClassPass entity has the opportunity for huge growth. ClassPass studios that are not using a booking software — Lanman says it’s about one-third of the studios on ClassPass — will now have the chance to sign up with Mindbody.</p>
<p>Mindbody’s consumer-facing business will have the chance to double down on their experience by signing up for a ClassPass subscription and get access to those studios. And, of course, gyms and studios that use Mindbody for à la carte bookings could be upsold to ClassPass, as well. — Jordan Crook</p></blockquote>

<p>This week on Equity, the TechCrunch team looked at how two travel-focused startups have pivoted and rebounded their way through the pandemic. While one startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/zeus-living-closes-on-55m-to-offer-flexible-furnished-rentals-as-it-expands-beyond-corporate-housing/">chose to focus on flexible living</a>, another decided to go the fintech route.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know</strong>: TripActions went from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/from-0-in-revenue-to-a-7-25b-valuation-why-tripactions-275m-raise-has-fintech-to-thank/">$0 in revenue to $7.25 billion</a> in valuation. How? Well, as Mary Ann reports, TripActions leaned into the very nascent fintech product that it launched a month before the pandemic hit, giving it growth and a way to support customers through expense management. The news reminds us all that every startup, eventually, is a fintech company.</p>
<p><em>Fintech &amp; friends:</em></p>

The weekly event, put together by some of the best internal folks at the publication, connects founders and the investors who finance them in a chill chat.</p>
<p>TC interviews investors on their thought process when writing checks, pushing for specifics and reverse engineering their biggest deals to date. Then, in the latter half of each episode, founders in the audience are encouraged to jump on our virtual stage and pitch their products, receiving live feedback from our esteemed duos.</p>
<p>This past week, we had Chime founder and CEO Chris Britt with Menlo Ventures partner Shawn Carolan. In the past, we’ve had Poshmark CEO Manish Chandra, Mayfield’s Navin Chaddha, Planet FWD’s Julia Collins and Cleo Capital’s Sarah Kunst.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is free for anyone who would like to attend live, so come hang every Wednesday at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT.</p>

<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h3>Google responds to the Epic Games antitrust suit, Apple appeals</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1689580" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1689580" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1689580" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="399" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg?resize=680,399 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1689580" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Epic Games</p></div></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">As the Apple v. Epic Games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">lawsuit</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">goes under appeal,</a> Google this week filed an answer and counterclaim in the Epic Games’ antitrust litigation against the company. The tech giant and Android maker denies Epic’s allegations of antitrust behavior and instead says that it’s owed relief, as Epic Games breached the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement (DDA) by allowing Fortnite players who download the app through Google Play to use Epic’s own payment processing technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This situation is similar to what took place on the App Store, where Epic Games updated its app to workaround App Store policies, and then facilitated payments through its own payments system, in violation of its legal contract with Apple. The court’s decision in Apple’s case was that Epic owed financial relief to Apple, to the tune <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-pays-apple-6-million/">of $6 million</a>.</p>
<p>Epic Games did much of the same thing on Google Play, the counterclaim alleges. Last year, Epic submitted a build of Fortnite to Google Play which used Epic’s own direct payments system and not Google Play Billing. This submission was immediately rejected for failing to comply with Google’s policies. Epic then submitted a compliant version in April 2020, which Google now describes as “an act of deception designed to provoke litigation.” The new version had concealed Epic’s payment system in an update that was sent to both Apple and Google’s app stores. This would allow Epic to switch over to its own payment system by applying a server-side configuration change, or “hotfix,” without Google’s knowledge.</p>
<p>That switch was flipped on August 13, 2020. It allowed Fortnite users to choose between Google Play Billing and Epic’s own direct payments system. Now Google wants to recoup the money lost to this version, as those who downloaded the app from the Play Store could continue to use Epic&#8217;s billing, even after the app was pulled down.</p>
<p>Epic’s position has been that Apple and Google’s requirement to use their own in-app payment systems exclusively is a monopolistic practice that disadvantages developers. In Apple’s case, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">the court agreed</a> that Apple should not block developers from sharing a link to other payment methods inside their own app or communicating to customers. It did not declare Apple a monopoly. Despite the largely favorable ruling,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/"> Apple decided to appeal its case this week,</a> after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">Epic filed its own appeal</a>.</p>
<p>The key factor to Apple&#8217;s appeal is that it&#8217;s also asking the court to put a hold on it having to implement changes to the App Store&#8217;s anti-steering guidelines. That means, instead of permitting developers to add links to their website and other methods of payments, things would continue as is until the appeals case was decided. That could be months or even years from now.</p>
<p>In terms of the antitrust complaint, Google’s situation is a bit different from Apple&#8217;s, however. Android already allows for sideloading apps — that means there’s another method of reaching Android users outside Google Play, making an antitrust claim more difficult.</p>
<h3>Twitter adds more ads</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1824810" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1824810" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1824810" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1824810" class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)</p></div></p>
<p>Twitter says it’s going to test a new ad format and placement on its platform. On Wednesday, Twitter Revenue Product Lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brucefalck/">Bruce Falck</a> said Twitter would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/twitter-found-a-way-to-show-users-more-ads/">begin showing ads on mobile devices</a> inside conversation threads after the first, third and eighth replies. While the company stopped short of confirming the change would be permanent, it did say it would experiment with the formula to best determine the insertion points and layouts that made the most sense. Twitter also said it would consider making the display of the ads something creators would opt into, rather than forcing them to accept ads in their threads. In that case, creators would also see a share of ad revenue, Twitter said.</p>
<p>The company historically <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18213567/twitter-to-stop-sharing-mau-as-users-decline-q4-2018-earnings">has struggled</a> to <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/twitter-posts-strong-revenue-result-in-q3-as-user-growth-slows/588093/">grow</a> its user base by significant numbers, meaning it’s had to get more creative with maximizing the revenue it’s able to extract from its existing users. Despite a flurry of new product development &#8212; which has included creator tools, subscriptions, audio chat rooms, tipping and more &#8212; Twitter has not yet had a runaway hit. For example, third-party data indicated recently Twitter’s new creator platform called Super Follow had only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/">generated</a> around $6,000 in its first two weeks live in the U.S. and Canada, or perhaps a bit more ($12,400 during 17 days in September, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/">according</a> to a second firm’s analysis).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Twitter made a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitter-plans-to-double-revenue-by-2023-reach-315m-daily-users/">promise to investors</a> that it will be able to double its revenue from $3.7 billion in 2020 to $7.5 billion or more in 2023. If the new products don&#8217;t turn a sizable profit, increasing Twitter&#8217;s ad load could help. Unfortunately, monetizing conversations like this could encourage users to post more content they hope to make viral. That could impact Twitter’s content and culture. Twitter is already a place that tends to reward a sort of performative type of user — like those posting snark, jokes, angry tweets and other emotive content; tying tweets’ “virality” to creator revenue could push Twitter even further away from the genuine, thoughtful conversations the company claims it wants to host.</p>

<li><strong>Roblox co-founder and CEO David Baszucki, at the company&#8217;s annual developer conference, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/roblox-avatar-updates-rdc-2021/">outlined plans</a> to modernize player avatars, introduce new in-game monetization streams and streamline the experience for developers.</strong> Instead of Roblox&#8217;s classic, block-like avatars, the new avatars will look more life-like (and more like metaverse rival Fortnite). Also new is support for layered clothing, &#8220;dynamic heads&#8221; (facial animations for avatars rolling out for developer access), expanded access to voice chat, limited edition items, and a new development system called Open Cloud. The latter supports creating content in third-party tools, then exporting it to Roblox.</li>

At the core of the Disney Genie experience is a smart trip-planning capability that maps out a personalized itinerary based on which rides, attractions or food and entertainment experiences guests want to make sure to do while at the parks. This is rolling out to the My Disney Experience app, and will accommodate real-time scheduling changes &#8212; like if you decide to take a detour on your route or head back to the hotel for a break, for instance. The feature could potentially put some third-party itinerary apps out of business, given Disney will have the advantage of leveraging its own park data and real-time updates, like ride closures and the like.</li>

<p>When Trump’s ban on TikTok failed, the short-form video app Byte exited to rival <a href="https://www.clashapp.co/">Clash</a> — an admission of sorts that TikTok’s momentum couldn’t be beaten if it was allowed to remain in the U.S. This week, Byte&#8217;s new owner Clash relaunched its app with the “best of Byte” under the hood alongside a suite of creator tools for monetizing a fan base. And this time, the focus isn’t on beating TikTok, but working in parallel alongside it. The newly rebuilt Clash app introduces a set of tools for creators and their fans, including a virtual tipping mechanism called Drops (not to be confused with product drops, popular in e-commerce) and a paid messaging system called Fanmail. The idea is that Clash would be used with a creator&#8217;s most loyal fans who would like to have more exclusive access, a closer connection or behind-the-scenes content, among other things. Creators can cash out when they&#8217;ve earned at least $25 in Drops. The app relaunched in Byte&#8217;s place on the App Store and is arriving on Android soon. (Read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/one-time-tiktok-rival-byte-relaunches-as-clash-an-app-for-video-creators-and-their-top-fans/">the full review here</a>.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hardware season is heading for a dramatic finale next week, with three events from three major companies, three days in a row. Apple, Google and Samsung (in that order) are all hosting big events next week, getting their last big announcements (hopefully) out of the way ahead of the upcoming holiday season.</p>
<p>That means your friendly neighborhood hardware editor &#8212; and much of the TechCrunch staff &#8212; is set to be busy for the next few weeks, writing about and reviewing all manner of gadgets. Meantime, we’ve got some information to go off, in terms of what we can expect next week, through a combination of rumors, leaks and process of elimination.</p>
<p>That last bit holds especially true in the case of Apple and Samsung. Both companies are following recent big product unveils, and barring brand new product lines, we can triangulate what’s likely next on the docket for each. Google, meanwhile, has essentially announced what it’s got brewing for Tuesday.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219040" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Let’s work chronologically here.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150727" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150727" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2150727" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Pro silver keyboard. close up Mac on the blue background" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg 2121w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150727" class="wp-caption-text">Apple MacBook Pro silver keyboard. close up Mac on the blue background</p></div></p>
<p>Apple’s kicking things off <strong>Monday at 10AM PT/1PM ET</strong>. It’s been just over a month since the company’s latest event, which brought new iPhones, Apple Watches and iPads. One big missing product line was absent, however. We didn’t see any new Macs. With macOS Monterey dropping any day now, and the company’s already announced plans to upgrade its entire line to first-party silicon, the absence was felt at the event.</p>
<p>It seemed reasonable to expect the company might go the press release route, but instead, it looks like Apple’s opted to give Mac its moment in the spotlight. As I’ve noted before, companies are generally less obligated to cram everything into a single event now that they&#8217;re not asking attendees to fly from around the world to be there. Some have taken liberties with this notion &#8212; though I don’t anticipate that to be the case here. At the very least, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/macbook-pro-better-displays-faster-magsafe-charging/">we expect some big Mac news</a>, including:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>A new MacBook Pro in 13 and 16-inch versions</li>
<li>A new Mac Mini</li>
<li>A 27-inch iMac</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2153026" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153026" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153026" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153026" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The first two essentially replace last year’s M1 models, which effectively had the same guts. A new, even faster M1X chip is said to be arriving, along with potential hardware redesigns. The 27-inch iMac, meanwhile, would augment the 24-inch model, serving as a more pro-focused system.</p>
<p>An overdue update to the entry-level AirPods are said to be in the works, as well, featuring improved sound quality and design more inline with the Pros &#8212; but without active noise canceling.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184612" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184612" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2184612" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg 1060w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=768,319 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=680,282 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184612" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Speaking of new chips, Google already announced its plan to unveil its in-house Tensor chip, becoming the latest company to buck Qualcomm for first-party silicon. That will be used to power the new Pixel 6 and a Pro model. The handsets feature a radical redesign for a line that’s been stumbling to stay afloat in the smartphone wars.</p>
<p>Google has gone as far as putting up a product page for the pair ahead of the event. Cribbing from<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-gives-the-world-its-first-glimpse-of-the-pixel-6/"> Greg’s writeup</a> of the initial announcement here:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The base 6 will have a matte aluminum finish with a 6.4″ display, while the Pro has a shinier polished aluminum finish with a 6.7″ display.</li>
<li>Pixel 6 has two cameras (wide and ultrawide), while the 6 Pro adds a telephoto zoom lens.</li>
<li>If you were hoping the increasingly common “camera bump” trend was on the way out… not quite. The bump has now evolved into the “camera bar,” with Google’s Rick Osterloh noting that better sensors and lenses just won’t fit in a smaller package.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/pixel-6-further-leaks/">A recent leak</a> has offered up a bit more info on their camera system &#8212; two rear-facing on the 6 and three on the Pro. They’ll both feature a 50-megapixel wide-angle and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide, while the Pro adds a 48-megapixel telephoto. That event is going down Tuesday at <strong>10AM PT/1PM ET</strong>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188134" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188134" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2188134" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188134" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Samsung’s Wednesday event is the biggest question mark of the three &#8212; which, given how Samsung products tend to leak, is not something we get to say much. The new foldables were recently announced and we don’t expect another Galaxy S device until around MWC in February/March of next year. A PC or tablet seems to be a reasonable guess. Though the bright colors in the invite could offer another clue. That event kicks off at <strong>7AM PT/10AM ET on Wednesday.</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Hello friends! Happy weekend. Up top, there’s an extra Equity episode dropping today digging into the larger China-Microsoft dustup over LinkedIn. So if you need more on that, it’s coming. Let’s go!</p>
<p>The key money story in Startup Land this week was the simply massive GitLab IPO.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218986" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In case you are behind, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/inside-gitlabs-ipo-filing/">GitLab filed to go public</a>, and we noted that at current market prices, the DevOps giant could be worth some $10 billion. That wound up being conservative. GitLab wound up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/gitlab-raises-ipo-range-targeting-valuation-of-as-much-as-11b/">raising its IPO price range far above its initial estimate</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">then pricing at $77</a>. Late Friday afternoon, as I write to you, it’s worth more than $108 per share.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="X5aQWIjrOy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">3 things GitLab&#8217;s wild IPO pricing says about public markets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;3 things GitLab&#8217;s wild IPO pricing says about public markets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/embed/#?secret=X5aQWIjrOy" data-secret="X5aQWIjrOy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I got on the horn with GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij to chat about the deal. I’ve nattered with Sijbrandij here and there for some time, starting back with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/13/the-newest-members-of-the-100m-arr-club/">this particular story</a>. So it was good fun to talk to him on IPO day, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/an-interview-with-visionary-founder-ceo-on-large-unicorns-ipo-day/">constrained as he was by normal SEC rules</a>. Here’s what I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why did GitLab go public now?</strong> It hit all the marks, Sijbrandij said, including revenue scale, revenue predictability and compliance. And the IPO date wound up being 10 years to the month from when co-founder Dmitriy Zaporozhets wrote his first code for the company. So that’s a nice circle of timing. Humans do so love round numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Did GitLab’s strong net retention metrics help with revenue predictability?</strong> Yes, but Sijbrandij didn’t want to say that explicitly.</li>
<li><strong>Open-source is now an advantage, not a hindrance:</strong> This point is an echo of something we noted concerning startups the other month, but it’s worth flagging all the same. Having open-source code is now a <em>boon</em> to companies hoping to build long-term relationships with developers, something that is often key when it comes to product-led growth, I’d hazard. This is the polar opposite of the world that existed a decade ago, and is perhaps why Microsoft changed its tune some time back on the concept of open code.</li>
<li><strong>And will we see GitLab get into MLOps as well as DevOps? </strong>Maybe? Sijbrandij wasn’t black-and-white on the matter, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/weights-biases-raises-new-capital-as-developer-tools-remain-a-venture-focus-ml-matures/">but with the MLOps world accelerating</a>, I wouldn’t be shocked if we saw GitLab wander into what could be called startup territory in time. It certainly now has the cash to do whatever it wants.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cloudflare versus the world</h2>
<p>Let’s dive back to the news from late September that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/cloudflare-enters-infrastructure-services-market-with-new-r2-storage-product/">Cloudflare was moving into the “storage as a service” market</a>. The news was that Cloudflare intends to offer cloud storage through its collection of global data centers. The product news was far afield from what Cloudflare is best known for, namely making websites appear more quickly and more securely.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Why was the now-public company getting into something as commodified as <em>storage? </em>At the time, Ron Miller wrote that Cloudflare was turning something it built for itself and offering it to others. And that by eliminating some fees, Cloudflare’s storage service – R2 – would be cheaper than what Amazon offers, for example, via its AWS collection of infra services.</p>
<p>I have had a thought. Namely, I will not be utterly gobsmacked if we see large, but not titanic, tech companies with a global footprint that offer a particular flavor of digital service <em>also</em> get into providing what <em>appear</em> to be initially niche infra tooling that competes modestly – at first – with what Amazon and Microsoft currently offer via AWS and Azure.</p>
<p>This may be Big Dumb, but we can explain ourselves a bit by analogy. My argument is akin to how Intel ran the world with its particular CPU methodology for a long time, only to lose the future to not only GPUs forced into the cryptocurrency salt mines, but also a grip of startups building, say, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/hailo-raises-136m-ai-chips/">AI-tuned silicon</a>. In our analogy, AWS is Intel and AI chips are things like R2 from Cloudflare.</p>
<p>The days when AWS and Azure were trading price cuts back and forth is behind us. What’s next?</p>
<h2>Odds, ends</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2021/10/prisidio-raises-additional-3-5m-in-seed-funding.html">mix of Midwest VCs put $3.5 million into Presidio</a>, a digital vault startup aimed at consumers. It’s a Florida-based company, and is looking toward a 2022 launch. I have myriad questions about this. But that someone is building a storage-centric startup in this time and era caught my eye.</li>
<li>Cap table software company <a href="https://carta.com/data-desk/#interactive-data">Carta put out a data product</a> that I have enjoyed tinkering with. If you want to mess about with a host of funding data sortable by era and company type, it’s good fun.</li>
<li>I was going to write up notes on <a href="https://adambird.com/posts/back-to-eu/">this essay from a U.K. startup</a> about how it is redomiciling to the EU after its home country started to change privacy rules, but our own Natasha Lomas beat me to it. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/so-much-for-levelling-up/">read her post</a>, which is better than what I could have come up with.</li>
<li>And, speaking of the U.K., Freetrade in the country has now <a href="https://freetrade.io/blog/freetrade-reaches-one-million-users">signed up 1 million users</a>. This stat matters as it indicates that the Robinhood boom is truly an international consumer movement that will lift many startups’ boats.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Analogue&#8217;s much-anticipated Pocket retro gaming machine will come with more than just sleek design and the ability to play tons of classic games. The device will be the first with AnalogueOS on it, an effort to make what founder Chris Taber calls the &#8220;Library of Alexandria of video games.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, he called it the &#8220;<em>great fucking</em> Library of Alexandria,&#8221; which gives you an idea of how excited he is about it. See, retro gaming is a strange place — there&#8217;s tons of information out there, but few sources are exhaustive and many are decidedly retro themselves.</p>
<p>Depending on the information you want, you may find it in a wiki dedicated to a game or system, a message board frequented by old 8-bit gaming devs, a hex file used in modding a ROM, even an out-of-print book. The history and versions of a game, as well as ephemera like manuals, reviews, and technical documentation might be scattered in a dozen places.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218853" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s the goal of AnalogueOS to curate and present as much as this information as possible, as close to the games themselves as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;At its heart, AnalogueOS is purpose built for exploring and celebrating all of video game history. Designed to be the definitive, scholarly operating system for playing and experiencing the entire medium. Our vision is total, absolute,&#8221; said Taber. &#8220;And yes, AnalogueOS will be on every future Analogue system.&#8221;</p>
<p>To start with the OS will be a flexible and extensible way to play and track your games. If you&#8217;ve got dozens of games for the GameBoy, Game Gear, Lynx, and so on, you certainly could just pop one in and play. But the Pocket is meant to be a showcase, not simply the nicest way to play those games (though it almost certainly will be that).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218932" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218932" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218932" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg" alt="Images of different handheld games being played on an Analogue Pocket." width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg 1557w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg?resize=1536,1150 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2218932" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Analogue</p></div></p>
<p>Therefore each game will be embellished with box art, screenshots, publisher and other metadata, all in an organized fashion so you can say one day, &#8220;What Sunsoft games do I have?&#8221; and just browse those. Or if you&#8217;re curious about one in particular, say <em>Blaster Master: Enemy Below</em>, you can browse through data pertaining to that title, its revisions and changes, sequels and prequels, guides and screenshots.</p>
<p>Not all the data will be available right off the bat, as the database is still under construction, but Taber confirmed that the intent — and Analogue is the type of obsessive company to follow through — is to integrate as much of this as users choose. As most of this data is text, it can easily be integrated directly into the OS with minimal storage cost. &#8220;You stick a game cartridge in and it will be able to read exactly what game it is,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For collectors looking for a specific region or revision of a game — rare cartridges used in competitions, illegal distributions, promotions and so on — that information can be confirmed in seconds now. Find something interesting at an estate sale? Pop it in the Pocket and find out exactly what version of the game it is — garden variety or once-in-a-lifetime find?</p>
<p>Box art, being more bulky, can be downloaded by users from sets devs are already working on. Folks who move in retro gaming circles will already be familiar with the type of light work involved in scanning your library and bringing over only the required images. (There are copyright considerations here, so the company must be careful what it provides.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218929" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218929" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218929" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png" alt="Screenshots of the AnalogueOS interface showing the ability to save states and track gameplay." width="1024" height="828" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png 1419w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png?resize=300,243 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png?resize=768,621 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png?resize=680,550 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2218929" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Analogue</p></div></p>
<p>The Pocket will enable save states to be used on cartridge-based games, a huge boon for gamers who prefer to get as close to the original hardware and software as possible. Analogue is outspoken in its preference for FPGA-based cores that imitate the original chips rather than software-based emulation, and being able to load a game and hardware state in that architecture is surely a tricky process.</p>
<p>The OS will track your play by hour and day, and you can even make your own &#8220;playlists&#8221; to share with others (assuming they have the games to go with them). And there are quality of life changes like remapping controls, Bluetooth controller support and so on.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as you can see, Analogue wants to make its hardware not just the best way to play retro games on modern hardware (like high-definition TVs, which old consoles weren&#8217;t designed for), but also a complete resource for history and collector data on the games themselves. It&#8217;s ambitious, and though some may point out that there are such resources already available, they&#8217;re scattered and fragmented. If Analogue can successfully unify all this information into a single place, and make it available where the players are — in front of the game — it could help the company graduate from luxury option to must-have in the retro gaming world.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch&#8217;s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. Or, as in today&#8217;s episode, talk our way through some big breaking news from the technology world so that we can better understand just what is going on.</p>
<p>Danny and Alex got together late Friday on a Twitter Space to discuss <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">Microsoft&#8217;s decision to pull LinkedIn from the Chinese market</a>, a move that lit up headlines around the world. That LinkedIn was still in China in 2021 may feel more surprising than the news that it will exit that particular market, but the moment matters all the same as it marks the end of an experiment &#8212; could a mega-tech company have a US HQ and a first-party service live in China?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218957" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Er, no, it turns out. Not really.</p>
<p>Microsoft found itself jammed between its own ethics, and governmental censure. It was a lose-lose for the company, so pulling the plug was the smart move. The company isn&#8217;t going to miss the revenue.</p>
<p>For startups, the Microsoft decision is a good reminder that doing business in China is at a minimum very hard for non-Chinese companies, and perhaps impossible. Recall that Microsoft had to work with a Chinese company (21Vianet) to get Azure into the country at all, and that the Chinese government is using a few companies to build a new OS for the country so that it can replace Windows.</p>
<p>Precisely how good that OS will prove is not yet clear, at least from a consumer perspective.</p>
<p>And then we riffed on GitLab&#8217;s IPO. My favorite topic of the week. You&#8217;ll see why it came up when you hit play. Chat Monday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There may be plenty of funding for some startups these days. But plenty of companies will tell you otherwise. <a href="https://govclab.com/">VC Lab</a>, an accelerator for venture capital firms, wants to create investors who will back the rest of the world.</p>
<p>A basic hurdle to this goal is the standard paperwork you need to set up a new fund. It currently requires specialized lawyers whose time can cost more than $100,000 per fund formation.</p>
<p>Today, VC Lab is providing a set of <a href="https://govclab.com/2021/09/27/cornerstone-limited-partner-agreement/">freely available boilerplate documents</a> intended to streamline the process, save everyone time and money and make fund governance structures more accessible.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219068" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We have general partners launching funds from all around the world,” co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adeoressi/">Adeo Ressi</a> explains. “The last cohort enrolled venture investors from 62 different countries, including Central Asia, Africa, and every other place you can imagine.”</p>
<p>Legal costs are the last thing they need.</p>
<p>“The new managers who are getting into venture are coming in with a passion for change — the funds often have a very focused thesis, and they tend to be smaller in size. They really want to help the companies they work with to succeed at any cost. They don’t need 200 to 400 pages of legal agreements governing every small decision that they make. They need lean and light, easy-to-use agreements.”</p>
<p>The package, which <a href="https://govclab.com/2021/10/08/releasing-cornerstone-to-fix-vc/">VC Lab is calling Cornerstone</a>, is a short 33 pages that include a term sheet, a subscription agreement and an LPA (and this <a href="https://govclab.com/2021/10/07/how-to-use-cornerstone-to-form-a-fund/">user guide</a>). Similar fund formation documents regularly run into the hundreds of pages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There’s been widespread recognition that fund formation docs are ridiculously complex and in need of an overhaul,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hansekim/">Hans Kim</a>, a longtime startup lawyer in Silicon Valley who co-authored the new package. “I’ve had numerous founder clients who made money and want to put their capital to good use through investing. But if they get more serious than personal angel investing, you refer them to a fund formation lawyer. Then they see the price and have to think twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Improvements include a streamlined list of definitions, simplified sections on management fees and triggers for limited operator mode, according to co-author <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richgora/">Rich Gora</a> of Gora LLC. The current document includes details for domiciling the firm in the United States with plans for other popular locations like Canada, the Netherlands and Singapore coming soon.</p>
<p>As a fund formation lawyer who works with a wide variety of investors, he says the goal is to help businesspeople work out business issues in plain terms. Once the parties have talked through what they want to agree to, they can take the product to an expert like himself to finalize.</p>
<p>“Over the last 10 months,” he says about the writing process, “we looked at every single industry LP agreement we could find. We took concepts that would be 20 lines and distilled them into three. The concepts are there but the lawyer verbiage is gone.”</p>
<p>Ressi estimates that the new documents can cut legal costs in half or more, depending on factors like how many LPs you bring in. There’s also a shortage of lawyers with fund formation expertise, he notes. Providing standard documents will speed this process up and help the global venture capital ecosystem develop faster.</p>
<p>VC Lab was formed within the <a href="https://fi.co/">Founder Institute</a>, a global startup accelerator that has already made similar contributions to the startup ecosystem. Nearly nine years ago it helped develop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/31/thefunded-founder-institute-and-wilson-sonsini-debut-startup-friendly-seed-financing-vehicle-convertible-equity/">the concept of convertible equity</a>, a precursor to the SAFE note, which removes the debt elements from convertible notes.</p>
<p>“We believe that all the bottlenecks need to be done away with,” Ressi says about startup investing. “Then, there will be an explosion of new VCs and new LPs all around the world who are entering the asset class. That will create a real positive change for humanity because, no matter where you are in the world, you can pursue an idea to make the world a better place and find the resources you need to make it a reality. Unfortunately, this is not true today.”</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 15, 2021! Happy Friday to you and yours; I am proud of us all for making it through a week that was more than hectic. Up top, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/final-hours-to-save-100-on-passes-to-tc-sessions-space-2021/">discounts end on our space event in very short order</a>. And with no further ado, let’s get into the news! – <a href="twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/f12-isnt-hacking-missouri-governor-threatens-to-prosecute-local-journalist-for-finding-exposed-state-data/">Missouri governor conflates journalism, hacking</a>:</strong> The United States is a large nation with many smart and many less-smart people. A story from the latter category ended up in our wheelhouse when a state governor decided that a journalist pointing out security flaws in an official website was malicious hacking. Perhaps stories like this are why so many Gen Z folks are doomers?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/instacart-shopper-activists-are-going-on-strike/">Instacart shoppers are going on strike</a>: </strong>Try to recall a time when some section of the Instacart workforce was happy and not either about to strike or on strike. It’s hard, yeah? This Saturday, “some Instacart shoppers will go on strike, protesting the company’s low pay and lack of communication with its laborers,” TechCrunch reports. Let’s see if this particular piece of the larger Striketober saga ends up with worker-friendly results.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/apple-removes-a-popular-quran-app-in-china-after-request-from-local-regulators/">Apple yanks Quran app after Chinese regulators ask</a>:</strong> The day after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">Microsoft announced</a> that it was going to pull LinkedIn’s main service from China after failing to reconcile that country’s government and its own views, Apple appears to have complied with a Chinese state request to remove “Quran Majeed, a popular app for reading the Islamic religious text and other prayer-related information” from the Chinese app store. This isn’t a small act, given the Chinese state’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/new-details-torture-cover-ups-china-s-internment-camps-revealed-n1270014">abuse of Muslims inside its borders</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Let’s take our time today in the world of startups, it being Friday and all.</p>
<p>First up, we have a great piece from <a href="https://twitter.com/rebeccabellan">Rebecca Bellan</a> digging into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/meet-the-startups-changing-mobility-for-emerging-middle-classes/">host of startups that are helping emerging middle classes around the world get places</a>. This list includes, and I quote, “Swvl, Treepz, Jatri, SafeBoda, Urbvan, Chalo and Buser,” among others. If you are into the transportation tech beat, it’s a great read.</p>
<p>Next up, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andystinnes/">Andy Stinnes</a>, a general partner at Cloud Apps Capital Partners, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/the-venture-bull-market-is-great-for-founders-but-not-in-the-way-they-might-expect/">wrote an essay for the blog today</a> discussing that while the present-day venture capital bull market (more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">here</a>) is a general good for founders, “closer inspection reveals that these trends are a lot more nuanced and apply very unequally across the funding continuum from seed to the late stage.” If you are looking to raise capital, it’s worth your time.</p>
<p>Moving along, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/tayhatmaker">Taylor Hatmaker</a> did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/core-manticore-metaverse-game-creation-hands-on/">yeoman’s work digging into Core</a>, a metaverse environment where she wandered around, finding the landscape to be both great-looking and “seamless.” If you want a peek into what could be the future of gaming and social interaction, this is for you.</p>
<p>And, before we get to the rest of our startup rundown, I wrote an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/an-interview-with-visionary-founder-ceo-on-large-unicorns-ipo-day/">imaginary interview with a made-up CEO concerning a fictional IPO</a>. For more context, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/an-interview-with-a-leading-venture-capitalist/">head here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/pandora-is-partnering-with-soundcloud-to-launch-a-new-station/">SoundCloud lands Pandora partnership, new radio station</a>:</strong> As Spotify grew to become a music behemoth, SoundCloud stuck closer to the underground. And it survived, which some didn’t expect. Today, the upstart music service announced a deal with Pandora that could help bring it a bit more audience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/clubhouse-music-mode/">Clubhouse adds “music mode”</a></strong>: Sticking to a musical theme for another measure or two, Clubhouse has built out a way for musicians to better stream their music live on the service. So, I suppose Clubhouse can now also be <a href="http://instantrimshot.com/">coffeehouse</a>?</li>
<li><strong>And, finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/spot-ai-emerges-from-stealth-with-22m-with-a-platform-to-draw-out-more-intelligence-from-organizations-basic-security-videos/">Spot AI leaves stealth with its security cam search tool</a>:</strong> Flush with $22 million and freshly denuded of its “stealth” tag, Spot AI is out in the public view today, which is fitting as its core product deals with security cameras and how they are ingested. The company “reads” footage from the devices, allowing the video itself to be searchable. Which is cool, if vaguely creepy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bringing it in-house: What to look for when hiring a general counsel</h2>
<p>Experienced lawyers may be drawn away from big firms to join a startup as general counsel for a variety of reasons, LinkSquares’ chief legal officer Tim Parilla writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“For some, it’s an attempt to find a better work-life balance (whoops!), while others are eager to build and manage their own team or see it as an opportunity to work for a mission-driven company,” he writes.</p>
<p>For founders, it’s an opportunity to snag a seasoned professional who can build in-depth knowledge of your business &#8212; rather than relying on a generic (and costly) outside law firm.</p>
<p>Parilla offers detailed tips on what startup leaders should look for in an in-house counsel (as well as a few things that would indicate a lawyer is not fit for your business).</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">During the pandemic, we realized that we were swamped with work and overloaded with information. So we came up with an idea to fix that.</p>
<p>At Travelpayouts, we plan a strategy for a year, then each team plans iterations for every quarter, and within a quarter, we plan for two weeks ahead. By doing it this way, every day propels the company towards its goals.</p>
<p>However, unexpected challenges and tasks show up in all areas on a daily basis. For example, managers are sometimes overloaded with meetings that affect their productivity. So it is not surprising that some tasks just fall short of deadlines and accumulate over time.</p>
<p>To improve our productivity, we introduced a Getting Shit Done Day (GSDD): Our employees define clear-cut goals and receive specific, usually non-trivial, tasks with little to no communication involved (we encourage our employees to avoid social media on this day, but we are not looking over their shoulder). The goal of GSDD is to increase the amount of time we spend in deep work by minimizing distractions for one day every other week.</p>
<p>After two months of testing the GSDD in our marketing and business development departments, we’ve seen some results. First, long-term projects, which took weeks before, began to wrap up earlier. Second, we were able to explore a few topics that we never got around to: For example, monetizing our own traffic through affiliate programs, effective outreach methods, and email marketing best practices.</p>
<p>Thanks to the GSDD, we have also delved into tasks that were otherwise sidelined:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix fired an employee who led the company&#8217;s trans employee resource group and planned a walkout on October 20, a current and former Netflix employee with knowledge of the situation confirmed to TechCrunch. The termination was first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle">reported by The Verge</a>.</p>
<p>Netflix workers planned the walkout to protest statements that its co-CEO Ted Sarandos made about Dave Chappelle&#8217;s recently released special, &#8220;The Closer.&#8221; The company claims<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723592/netflix-trans-employees-walkout-statements-ceo"> </a>that it fired the employee in question because the company suspects that they leaked internal information.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We have let go of an employee for sharing confidential, commercially sensitive information outside the company,&#8221; a Netflix representative told TechCrunch. &#8220;We understand this employee may have been motivated by disappointment and hurt with Netflix, but maintaining a culture of trust and transparency is core to our company.&#8221;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218933" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The leaked information in question appears to be some internal metrics on &#8220;The Closer&#8221; that appeared in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">story by Bloomberg</a>, which reported that Netflix spent $24.1 million for the one-off special. Meanwhile, the company spent $3.9 million on Bo Burnham&#8217;s recent comedy special &#8220;Inside&#8221; and $21.4 million on the buzzy, nine-episode &#8220;Squid Game,&#8221; Netflix&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-says-squid-game-is-its-biggest-series-launch-ever?srnd=pursuits-vp">best-ever debut.</a></p>
<p>Earlier this month, as Netflix prepared to release &#8220;The Closer,&#8221; employees <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">raised concerns</a> about potentially harmful anti-trans jokes in the show &#8212; Chapelle goes as far as declaring that he&#8217;s &#8220;Team TERF,&#8221; referring to trans-exclusionary radical feminists, who conflate gender with biological sex and oppose the movement for transgender rights. When Netflix released the special on October 5 anyway, employees and Netflix subscribers alike lashed out against the streaming service.</p>
<p>The day after the special&#8217;s release, a trans software engineer at Netflix, Terra Field, tweeted a <a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1445914236668895236">viral thread</a> about the impact of anti-trans rhetoric. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Promoting TERF ideology (which is what we did by giving it a platform yesterday) directly harms trans people, it is not some neutral act. This is not an argument with two sides. It is an argument with trans people who want to be alive and people who don&#8217;t want us to be,&#8221; Field wrote. </span></p>

But Field was <a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1448097310026747908">reinstated</a> the next day after finding that she didn&#8217;t try to attend the meeting with ill intent &#8212; in fact, a director had shared the link, leading her to think she could attend. But some Netflix employees were fed up, especially after co-CEO Ted Sarandos <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/ted-sarandos-dave-chappelle-defense-1235088647/">wrote in an email</a> to them that &#8220;content on screen doesn&#8217;t directly translate to real-world harm.&#8221; He continued, &#8220;we have &#8216;Sex Education,&#8217; &#8216;Orange Is the New Black,&#8217; &#8216;Control Z,&#8217; Hannah Gadsby and Dave Chappelle all on Netflix. Key to this is increasing diversity on the content team itself.&#8221;</div>
<p>A lesbian comedian celebrated for her Emmy-winning Netflix special &#8220;Nanette,&#8221; Hannah Gadsby spoke out against Sarandos&#8217; attempt to paint her as a figurehead for queer inclusivity at Netflix.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t pay me nearly enough to deal with the real world consequences of the hate speech dog whistling you refuse to acknowledge, Ted,&#8221; she wrote <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVCiLl9FWoB/?utm_medium=copy_link">on Instagram</a>. &#8220;Fuck you and your amoral algorithm cult.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">We are only in the first chapter of Latin America’s long journey to tech growth. But with the region’s thirst for innovation, the market is expected to expand<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/latin-americas-digital-transformation-is-making-up-for-lost-time/"> nearly tenfold</a> over the next decade, with open banking through the use of APIs leading the way and acting as digital transformation facilitators.</p>
<p>With LatAm businesses and startups continuously integrating with new-age platforms and services, adopting an API-driven transformation strategy has become essential – as a result, the entire financial system is being “APIfied.”</p>
<p>In other words, this open API ecosystem, in which third-party service providers access consumer data from financial institutions, means financial services will be optimized to lower costs and time spent on transactions and improve user experience.</p>
<p>The advantages of having open communication between different products and services are nearly infinite for credit scoring, moving money between bank accounts, and spanning verticals like the neobanks, credit providers, and personal finance products Latin Americans use every day.</p>
<p>In 2019, API usage was more mature in the<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/estrategias-con-apis-en-am%C3%A9rica-latina-y-tendencias-nicholas/"> financial and e-commerce</a> sectors, but it is now venturing into other areas such as marketing and insurance. <a href="https://www.delitosfinancieros.org/fintech-pagos-digitales-y-las-nuevas-herramientas-financieras-para-el-comercio-electronico-en-america-latina/">Fintech companies</a> are increasingly collaborating with traditional players like banks, payment agencies, insurance providers and stock exchanges. Cryptocurrency trading platforms and companies are also fighting for their space in the spotlight and have adopted API platforms to support crypto-assets since most of their operations are already digitized.</p>
<p>The API revolution seems well underway. So, what’s next for LatAm?</p>
<h2>The key to tech penetration in LatAm: APIs</h2>
<p>Until recently, many traditional financial institutions and banks in LatAm were gatekeepers, with a bank account being the prerequisite for consumers to participate in the economy. And prior to the <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap112.pdf">advent of fintech</a>, these financial institutions’ back-office infrastructures for risk management, credit decisions, and fraud detection involved manual effort and required cross-departmental coordination.</p>
<p>Each step was carried out by a person, from registering a user to the production of products and services. This often left customer data unexploited, increased transaction costs, impeded innovation and degraded customer experience.</p>
<p>As financial institutions grapple with digital transformation, <a href="https://www.fintechamericas.co/news/the-art-of-collaboration-how-banks-fintech-can-partner-for-success/">Andres Meta, VP at Grupo Bind</a> and co-founder of Arfintech, said many banks are partnering with fintechs or accessing technology-based products to create unique business models and stay relevant.</p>
<p>One way to revamp the back-office, lower costs and improve communication is to use APIs. This will enable access to information, improve consumption of products and services, and disrupt and de-structure established value chains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We can&#8217;t check out every investing outfit&#8217;s demo day. But one event that we try to catch every year is that of <a href="https://www.pear.vc/">Pear</a>, which is held annually each fall and features (blessedly) just a dozen or so very nascent startups.</p>
<p>Pear, a seed-stage venture firm founded in 2013, has an impressive track record when it comes to identifying promising companies from their earliest stages, including DoorDash, Gusto, Aurora Solar, Vanta, Branch Metrics and Guardant Health. As notably, despite introducing a far smaller number of teams to investors than Y Combinator and more renowned accelerator programs, there always seem to be at least one or two projects in Pear&#8217;s Demo Day mix that turn into actual, sustainable and, sometimes, sizable companies.</p>
<p>Consider that over seven previous &#8220;batches&#8221; that featured a collective 69 teams altogether, Pear has helped push into the market Xilis, which uses “micro-organoids” to quickly make thousands of 3D replicas of a patient’s tumor that can then be tested for drug compatibility (it closed a <a href="https://www.precisiononcologynews.com/cancer/xilis-raises-70m-series-financing-support-miniature-organoid-platform-technology">$70 million</a> Series A round this summer); the relationship intelligence company Affinity (which announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/affinity-a-relationship-intelligence-company-raises-80m-to-help-close-deals/">$80 million</a> in Series C funding last month), and Viz.ai, whose software helps doctors diagnose strokes and coordinate care (and whose funding now tops $150 million after closing its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-viz-ai-raises-71-million-in-new-funding-11615980601">most recent round</a> back in March). Pear has some others it can, and does, boast about, too.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This year, the event, held this past Wednesday, shined a light on 13 of these very nascent teams. Pear also connected investors in attendance with five of its own portfolio companies that were just coming out of stealth mode. For those of you who might be interested in tracking emerging themes or actual investment opportunities, here&#8217;s a quick rundown of who pitched what (with the Pear-backed companies at the end of this list).</p>
<p>Note that we did not write the descriptions below. These were the exact pitches that the teams delivered straight to investors in attendance, so you&#8217;ll naturally spot a bit of hyperbole (because, startups).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.transcera.bio/"><strong>Transcera</strong></a></p>
<p>Founders: Hunter Globe (CEO), Wayne Lencer (Academic Co-Founder), Justin Wolfe (CSO)</p>
<p>&#8220;Biologic drugs have been one of the biggest revolutions in medicine of the last 30 years. Blockbuster biologics like Humira changed the way we treat chronic diseases, from Crohn’s Disease to cancer, and created a $375 billion market. But there’s a problem. Biologics are large, complex molecules that are not naturally absorbed in the body. The way we get around this today is by injecting or infusing biologic drugs, so they can get more directly to the bloodstream. Many patients won’t stick with an injectable treatment long term. Others won’t take one at all. Pharma companies have been trying to enable oral absorption of large molecule drugs for years. These approaches don’t work well, and result in very low levels of absorption &#8211; usually less than 1% of the total administered drug. We developed a better way &#8211; a platform that enables greater absorption of biologics following oral administration. After 30 years of research on cholera and how the bacteria infects the human body, Dr. Wayne Lencer, a Harvard Professor and Transcera co-founder, discovered a type of lipid which can carry larger molecules across the body’s cellular barriers. His lab at Boston Children’s Hospital synthesized and simplified these carriers to enhance absorption of biologic drugs. This is a platform technology which we plan to apply to many chronic diseases. But we’re starting with oral peptide drugs for diabetes and obesity.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://omniscientlabs.io"><strong>Omniscient Labs</strong></a></p>
<p>Founders: Andrew Fang (CTO), Jon Braatz (CEO)</p>
<p>&#8220;Omniscient Lab’s geospatial image intelligence platform uses computer vision to automatically monitor locations, starting with defense and intelligence customers. More than 90% of collected imagery isn’t actually reviewed, resulting in critical information and threats being missed. Omniscient’s platform detects equipment, facilities&#8217; and surfaces&#8217; historical patterns, while integrating with existing workflows. They’ve received grants from the Air Force and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency that can lead to large contracts.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://recorahealth.com"><strong>Recora</strong></a></p>
<p>Founder: Abhishek Chandra (CEO)</p>
<p>&#8220;One in three of us will die of heart disease – it’s time to change that.Recora is the enterprise platform for cardiac care. We help members recover from home after a heart attack. Right now, patients drive to a hospital to complete a recovery program. These facilities are 40 miles away and have 6 week wait times. So 96% of people don’t finish and quickly get hospitalized again.<br />
Using video visits and connected devices, we’ve designed a virtual cardiac recovery program. We ran a 200-patient pilot last year and showed 3x better outcomes. Today we cover 23,000 patients across 12 hospitals and are enrolling them at 220% month-over-month. Just these three contracts are a $46 million opportunity. We’re on track to close 20 contracts in 26 states over the next twelve months, and corner a $10 billion market. Before Recora, we founded and scaled Spring Health, a $2 billion mental health platform. Now we’re redefining the future of heart health so that everyone can live a long, full, and optimal life.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://kensa.ai/"><strong>Kensa AI</strong></a></p>
<p>Founder: Nathan Schuett (CEO)</p>

The founder and CEO graduated from Stanford, and he’s now raising a seed round to grow the company’s leadership position in 3D digital twins and AI-based inspection for industrial assets.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://farmraise.com"><strong>FarmRaise</strong></a></p>
<p>Founders: Jayce Hafner (CEO), Albert Albedi (Head of Product), Sami Tellatin (COO)</p>
<p>&#8220;Over half of American farms don&#8217;t have the tools or bandwidth they need to identify ways to improve their farms and become profitable. Our API links to the farmer&#8217;s bank account where our algorithm assesses the financials to provide a &#8220;Farm Read,&#8221; scoring the farmer&#8217;s financial health. We regularly monitor the farm data to continuously provide clean financials and recommendations on how to improve their farms. We use this farm specific data to connect farmers with capital to improve their score.&#8221;</p>

We are starting to sell to investing professionals as our initial wedge and plan to expand into all professionals for who managing their network is key.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smarty.ai/"><strong>Smarty</strong></a></p>
<p>Founders: Denzil Eden (CEO)</p>
<p>&#8220;Smarty is an intelligence layer that connects you to all your data and applications from its one-stop hub.

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">A recent Corporate Counsel <a href="https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2021/09/02/fintech-startups-are-luring-in-fortune-500-finance-lawyers/">article</a> highlighted a growing trend: More senior legal leaders are migrating to startups to take on general counsel roles. For some, it’s an attempt to find a better work-life balance (whoops!), while others are eager to build and manage their own team or see it as an opportunity to work for a mission-driven company.</p>
<p>This is great news for startups, especially those in regulated industries, where building strong in-house legal teams has been a challenge and fees can really add up if they choose a law firm. Founders can find top-tier talent out there, and discovering the right resource for your early to mid-sized company has never been more likely.</p>
<p>The abundance of available legal talent brings challenges as well as opportunities. Whether you’re the CEO of a high-growth startup or even a mid-sized technology company, finding the right legal leader will have implications for your business down the line. It’s a move you want to get right from the very beginning.</p>
<h2>Know what a GC can bring to the business</h2>
<p>The primary benefit of bringing on an in-house attorney is that they will become an expert in every aspect of your business, which will let them provide more actionable legal advice as well as a (sometimes) unique input on various business decisions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			You don’t want a lawyer who will panic and create more chaos in an already chaotic environment, and you definitely don’t want the lawyer who presents you and the rest of the management team “the facts” and leaves the decision to you (it’s a &#8220;business decision”).					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Another big aspect is that law firms are, by nature, highly risk-averse. This can often be at odds with the business&#8217; ability to accomplish its objectives. However, CEOs are going to take risks to move the business forward, and having an excellent lawyer in-house who can manage the potential downside of those risks is critical.</p>
<p>CEOs need a lawyer who they can trust to manage a situation after it becomes an issue, as well as one who is thoughtful and clear on communicating potential risks up front. Leaders don’t need someone telling them not to take risks, or saying, “I told you so” when things go wrong; they need someone who can manage the consequences (good and bad) of business decisions in a calm, organized and professional manner.</p>
<p>Finally, cost is a factor. Law firms traditionally charge an hourly rate, which can become frustrating to manage and fiscally untenable for a startup trying to stretch funding. While alternative fee arrangements are becoming more commonplace, most firms limit those arrangements to a relatively “plain vanilla” representation and will charge hourly for more complex matters.</p>
<p>Hiring a full-time lawyer and paying that lawyer a decent wage will allow you to better manage costs and they, over time, should provide you with better advice.</p>
<h2>Experience and attitude matter</h2>
<p>An important aspect to evaluate is the risk appetite of a legal chief candidate. Many in-house attorneys claim to be &#8220;commercial,&#8221; but that’s rarely the case. Relatively few in-house leaders are willing to actually make the call to take on almost certain risk to accomplish a business objective.</p>
<p>There’s something about how lawyers are trained that makes us jump to the worst-case scenario, but in reality, there’s a lot of room between taking the risk and the catastrophic scenario. Great GCs make the business decision, shoulder the risk, and do so with the confidence that they can manage the results to preserve the commercial value of the decision while managing the matter to prevent the worst-case scenario.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A new research paper written by a team of academics and computer scientists from Spain and Austria has demonstrated that it&#8217;s possible to use Facebook&#8217;s targeting tools to deliver an ad exclusively to a single individual if you know enough about the interests Facebook&#8217;s platform assigns them. The paper &#8212; entitled &#8220;Unique on Facebook: Formulation [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06636.pdf">research paper</a> written by a team of academics and computer scientists from Spain and Austria has demonstrated that it&#8217;s possible to use Facebook&#8217;s targeting tools to deliver an ad <em>exclusively</em> to a single individual if you know enough about the interests Facebook&#8217;s platform assigns them.</p>
<p>The paper &#8212; entitled &#8220;Unique on Facebook: Formulation and Evidence of (Nano)targeting Individual Users with non-PII Data&#8221; &#8212; describes a &#8220;data-driven model&#8221; that defines a metric showing the probability a Facebook user can be uniquely identified based on interests attached to them by the ad platform.</p>
<p>The researchers demonstrate that they were able to use Facebook&#8217;s Ads manager tool to target a number of ads in such a way that each ad only reached a single, intended Facebook user.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218214" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The research raises fresh questions about potentially harmful uses of Facebook&#8217;s ad targeting tools, and &#8212; more broadly &#8212; questions about the legality of the tech giant&#8217;s personal data processing empire given that the information it collects on people can be used to uniquely identify individuals, picking them out of the crowd of others on its platform even purely based on their interests.</p>
<p>The findings could increase pressure on lawmakers to ban or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">phase out</a> behavioral advertising &#8212; which has been under attack for years, over concerns it poses a smorgasbord of individual and societal harms. And, at the least, the paper seems likely to drive calls for robust checks and balances on how such invasive tools can be used.</p>
<p>The findings also underscore the importance of independent research being able to interrogate algorithmic adtech &#8212; and should increase pressure on platforms not to close down researchers&#8217; access.</p>
<h2>Interests on Facebook are personal data</h2>
<p>&#8220;The results from our model reveal that the 4 rarest interests or 22 random interests from the interests set FB [Facebook] assigns to a user make them unique on FB with a 90% probability,&#8221; write the researchers from Madrid&#8217;s University Carlos III, the Graz University of Technology in Austria and the Spanish IT company, GTD System &amp; Software Engineering, detailing one key finding &#8212; that having a rare interest or lots of interests that Facebook knows about can make you easily identifiable on its platform, even among a sea of billions of other users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study that addresses individuals’ uniqueness considering a user base at the worldwide population’s order of magnitude,&#8221; they go on, referring to the scale inherent in Facebook&#8217;s data mining of its more than 2.8 billion active users (NB: The company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/them-too/">processes information about non-users</a>, meaning its reach scales to even more internet users than are active on Facebook).</p>
<p>The researchers suggest the paper presents the first evidence of &#8220;the possibility of systematically exploiting the FB advertising platform to implement nanotargeting based on non-PII [interest-based] data&#8221;.</p>
<p>There have been earlier controversies over Facebook&#8217;s ad platform being a conduit for one-to-one manipulative &#8212; such as this 2019 <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/husband-brainwash-wife-spinner-ads-facebook/">Daily Dot</a> article about a company called the Spinner which was selling a &#8220;service&#8221; to sex-frustrated husbands to target psychologically manipulative messages at their wives and girlfriends. The suggestive, subliminally manipulative ads would pop up on the targets&#8217; Facebook and Instagram feeds.</p>
<p>The research paper also references an incident in U.K. political life, back in 2017, when Labour Party campaign chiefs apparently successfully used Facebook&#8217;s Custom Audience ad-targeting tool to &#8220;pull the wool&#8221; over former leader Jeremy Corbyn&#8217;s eyes. But in that case the targeting was not just at Corbyn; it also reached his<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> associates, and a few aligned journalists.</span></p>
<p>With this research the team demonstrates it&#8217;s possible to use Facebook&#8217;s Ads Manager tool to target ads at just one Facebook user &#8212; a process they&#8217;re referring to as &#8220;nanotargeting&#8221; (versus the current adtech &#8220;standard&#8221; of microtargeting &#8220;interest-based&#8221; advertising at groups of users).</p>
<p>&#8220;We run an experiment through 21 Facebook ad campaigns that target three of the authors of this paper to prove that, if an advertiser knows enough interests from a user, the Facebook Advertising Platform can be systematically exploited to deliver ads exclusively to a specific user&#8221;, they write, adding that the paper provides &#8220;the first empirical evidence&#8221; that one-to-one/nanotargeting can be &#8220;systematically implemented on FB by just knowing a random set of interests of the targeted user&#8221;.</p>
<p>The interest data they used for their analysis was collected from 2,390 Facebook users via a browser extension they created that the users had installed before January 2017.</p>
<p>The extension, called <a href="https://www.it.uc3m.es/acrumin/papers/CHI_2017.pdf">Data Valuation Tool for Facebook Users</a>, parsed each user&#8217;s Facebook ad preferences page to gather the interests assigned to them, as well as providing a real-time estimate about the revenue they generate for Facebook based on the ads they receive while browsing the platform.</p>
<p>While the interest data was gathered before 2017, the researchers&#8217; experiments testing whether one-to-one targeting is possible through Facebook&#8217;s ad platform took place last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, we have configured nanotargeting ad campaigns targeting three authors of this paper&#8221;, they explain, discussing the results of their tests. &#8220;We tested the results of our data-driven model by creating tailored audiences for each targeted author using combinations of 5, 7, 9, 12, 18, 20, and 22 randomly selected interests from the list of interests FB had assigned them.</p>
<p>&#8220;In total, we ran 21 ad campaigns between October and November 2020 to demonstrate that nanotargeting is feasible today. Our experiment validates the results of our model, showing that if an attacker knows 18+ random interests from a user, they will be able to nanotarget them with a very high probability. In particular, 8 out of the 9 ad campaigns that used 18+ interests in our experiment successfully nanotargeted the chosen user&#8221;.</p>
<p>So having 18 or more Facebook interests just got really interesting to anyone who wants to manipulate you.</p>
<h2>Nothing to stop nanotargeting</h2>
<p>One way to prevent one-to-one targeting would be if Facebook were to put a robust a limit on the minimum audience size.</p>
<p>Per the paper, the adtech giant provides a &#8220;Potential Reach&#8221; value to advertisers using its Ads Campaign Manager tool if the potential audience size for a campaign is greater than 1,000 (or greater than 20, prior to 2018 when Facebook increased the limit).</p>
<p>However the researchers found that Facebook does not actually prevent advertisers running a campaign targeting fewer users than those potential reach limits &#8212; the platform just does not tell advertisers how many (or, well, few) people their messaging will reach.</p>
<p>They were able to demonstrate this by running multiple campaigns that successfully targeted a single Facebook user &#8212; validating that the audience size for their ads was one by looking at data generated by Facebook&#8217;s ad reporting tools (&#8220;FB reported that only one user had been reached&#8221;); having a log record in their web server generated by the (sole) user click on the ad; and &#8212; in a third validation step &#8212; they asked each nanotargeted user to collect a snapshot of the ad and its associated “Why am I seeing this ad?” option. Which they say matched their targeting parameters in the successfully nanotargeted cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main conclusions derived from our experiment are the following: (i) nanotargeting a user on FB is highly likely if an attacker can infer 18+ interests from the targeted user; (ii) nanotargeting is extremely cheap, and (iii) based on our experiments, 2/3 of the nanotargeted ads are expected to be delivered to the targeted user in less than 7 effective campaign hours,&#8221; they add in a summary of the results.</p>
<p>In another section of the paper discussing countermeasures to prevent nanotargeting, the researchers argue that Facebook&#8217;s claimed limits on audience size &#8220;have been proven to be completely ineffective&#8221; &#8212; and assert that the tech giant&#8217;s limit of 20 is &#8220;not currently being applied&#8221;.</p>
<p>They also suggest there are workarounds for the limit of 100 that Facebook claims it applies to Custom Audiences (another targeting tool that involves advertisers uploading PII).</p>
<p>From the paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most important countermeasure Facebook implements to prevent advertisers from targeting very narrow audiences are the limits imposed on the minimum number of users that can form an audience. However, those limits have been proven to be completely ineffective. On the one hand, Korolova et. al state that, motivated by the results of their paper, Facebook disallowed configuring audiences of size smaller than 20 using the Ads Campaign Manager. Our research shows that this limit is not currently being applied. On the other hand, FB enforces a minimum Custom Audience size of 100 users. As presented in Section 7.2.2, several works in the literature showed different ways to overcome this limit and implement nanotargeting ad campaigns using Custom Audiences.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the researchers refer throughout their paper to interest-based data as &#8220;non-PII&#8221; [aka, personally identifiable information] it is important to note that that framing is meaningless in a European legal context &#8212; where the law, under the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes a much broader view of personal data.</p>
<p>PII is a more common term in the U.S. &#8212; which does not have comprehensive (federal) privacy legislation equivalent to the pan-EU GDPR.</p>
<p>Adtech companies also typically prefer to refer to PII, given it&#8217;s far more bounded a category versus all the information they actually process which can be used to identify and profile individuals to target them with ads.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN">GDPR</a>, personal data does not only include the obvious identifiers, like a person&#8217;s name or email address (aka &#8216;PII&#8217;), but can also encompass information that can be used &#8212; indirectly &#8212; to identify an individual, such as a person&#8217;s location or indeed their interests.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the relevant chunk from the GDPR (Article 4(1)) [emphasis ours]:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier <strong>or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person</strong>;</p></blockquote>
<p>Other research has also repeatedly &#8212; over decades &#8212; shown that re-identification of individuals is possible with, at times, just a handful of pieces of &#8220;non-PII&#8221; information, such as <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/on-the-reidentifiability-of-credit-card-metadata/overview/">credit card metadata</a> or <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/12/why-anonymous-data-sometimes-isnt/">Netflix viewing habits</a>.</p>
<p>So it should not surprise us that Facebook&#8217;s vast people profiling, ad targeting empire, which continuously and pervasively mines internet users&#8217; activity for interest-based signals (aka, personal data) to profile individuals for the purpose of targeting them with &#8220;relevant&#8221; ads, has created a new attack vector for &#8212; potentially &#8212; manipulating almost anyone in the world if you know enough about them (and they have a Facebook account).</p>
<p>But that does not mean there are no legal problems here.</p>
<p>Indeed, the legal basis that Facebook claims for processing people&#8217;s personal data for ad targeting has been under challenge in the EU for years.</p>
<h2>Legal basis for ad targeting</h2>
<p>The tech giant used to claim that users consent to their personal data being used for ad targeting. However it does not offer a free, specific and informed choice to people over whether they want to be profiled for behavioral ads or just want to connect with their friends and family. (And free, specific and informed is the GDPR standard for consent.)</p>
<p>If you want to use Facebook you have to accept your information being used for ad targeting. This is what EU privacy campaigners have dubbed &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">forced consent</a>&#8220;. Aka, coercion, not consent.</p>
<p>However, since the GDPR came into application (back in May 2018), Facebook has &#8212; seemingly &#8212; switched to claiming it&#8217;s legally able to process Europeans&#8217; information for ads because users are actually in a contract with it to receive ads.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke/">preliminary decision</a> by Facebook&#8217;s lead EU regulator, Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC), which was published earlier this week, has proposed to fine the company $36 million for not being transparent enough about that silent switch.</p>
<p>And while the DPC doesn&#8217;t seem to have a problem with Facebook&#8217;s ad contract claim, other European regulators disagree &#8212; and are likely to object to Ireland&#8217;s draft decision &#8212; so <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the regulatory scrutiny over that particular Facebook GDPR complaint is ongoing and far from over. </span></p>
<p>If the tech giant is ultimately found to be bypassing EU law it could finally be forced to give users a free choice over whether their information can be used for ad targeting &#8212; which would essentially blast an existential hole in its ad targeting empire, since even holding a few pieces of interest data is personal data, as this research underlines.</p>
<p>For now, though, the tech giant is using its customary tactic of denying there&#8217;s anything to see here.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to the research, a Facebook spokesperson dismissed the paper &#8212; claiming it is &#8220;wrong about how our ad system works&#8221;.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s statement goes on to try to divert attention from the researchers&#8217; core conclusions in an effort to minimize the significance of their findings &#8212; with its spokesperson writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>This research is wrong about how our ad system works. The list of ads targeting interests we associate with a person are not accessible to advertisers, unless that person chooses to share them. Without that information or specific details that identify the person who saw an ad, the researchers’ method would be useless to an advertiser attempting to break our rules<em>.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Responding to Facebook&#8217;s rebuttal, one of the paper&#8217;s authors &#8212; Angel Cuevas &#8212; described its argument as &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; &#8212; saying the company should be deploying stronger countermeasures to prevent the risk of nanotargeting, rather than trying to claim there is no problem.</p>
<p>In the paper the researchers identify a number of harmful risks they say could be associated with nanotargeting &#8212; such as psychological persuasion, user manipulation and blackmailing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is surprising to find that Facebook is implicitly recognizing that nanotargeting is feasible and the only countermeasure is assuming advertisers are unable to infer users interests,&#8221; Cuevas told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many ways interests could be inferred by advertisers. We did that in our paper with a browser plug-in (with explicit consent from users for research purposes). Even more, beyond interests there are other parameters (we did not use in our research) such as age, gender, city, zip code, etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think this is an unfortunate argument. We believe a player like Facebook can implement stronger countermeasures than assuming advertisers are unable to infer user interests to be later used to define audiences in the Facebook ads platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>One might recall &#8212; for example &#8212; the 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/">Cambridge Analytica Facebook data misuse scandal</a>, where a developer that had access to Facebook&#8217;s platform was able to extract data on millions of users, without most of the users&#8217; knowledge or consent &#8212; via a quiz app.</p>
<p>So, as Cuevas says, it&#8217;s not hard to envisage similarly opaque and underhanded tactics being deployed by advertisers/attackers/agents to harvest Facebook users&#8217; interest data to try to manipulate specific individuals.</p>
<p>In the paper the researchers note that a few days after their<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> nanotargeting experiment had ended Facebook shuttered the account they&#8217;d used to run the campaigns &#8212; without explanation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The tech giant did not respond to specific questions we put to it about the research, including why it closed the account &#8212; and, if it did so because it had detected the nanotargeting issue, why it failed to prevent the ads running and targeting a single user in the first place. </span></p>
<h2>Expect litigation</h2>
<p>What might the wider implications be for Facebook&#8217;s business as a result of this research?</p>
<p>One privacy researcher we spoke to suggested the research will certainly be useful for litigation &#8212; which is growing in Europe, given the slow pace of privacy enforcement by EU regulators against Facebook specifically (and adtech more generally).</p>
<p>Another pointed out that the findings underline how Facebook has the ability to &#8220;systematically re-identity&#8221; users at scale &#8212; &#8220;while pretending it does not process &#8216;personal data&#8217; on the data&#8221; &#8212; suggesting the tech giant has amassed enough data on enough people that it can, essentially, circumvent narrowly bounded legal restrictions that might seek to put limits on its processing of PII.</p>
<p>So regulators looking to put meaningful limits on harms that can flow from behavioral advertising will need to be wise to how Facebook&#8217;s own algorithms can seek out and make use of proxies in the masses of data it holds and attaches to users &#8212; and its likely line of associated argument that its processing therefore avoids any legal implications (a tactic Facebook has used on the issue of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/facebook-faces-fresh-criticism-over-ad-targeting-of-sensitive-interests/">inferred sensitive interests</a>, for example).</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Another privacy watcher, Dr Lukasz Olejnik, an independent privacy researcher and consultant, called the research staggering &#8212; describing the paper as among the top 10 most important privacy research results of this decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reaching 1 user out of 2.8bn? While the Facebook platform claimed there are precautions making such microtargeting impossible? So far, this is among the top 10 most important privacy research results in this decade,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Such precision is totally identifying and singling out individuals. This is highly privacy invasive. I&#39;m SHOCKED that the researchers and the press describe it as &#39;without personal data&#39;. Not true! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDPR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GDPR</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ePrivacy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ePrivacy</a> <a href="https://t.co/LOe707CKyf">pic.twitter.com/LOe707CKyf</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lukasz Olejnik (@lukOlejnik) <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1448667592676175876?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;It seems that users are identifiable by their interests in the meaning of article 4(1) of the GDPR, meaning that interests constitute personal data. The only caveat is that we are not certain how such a processing would scale [given the nanotesting was only tested on three users].&#8221;</p>
<p>Olejnik said the research shows the targeting is based on personal data &#8212; and &#8220;perhaps even special category data in the meaning of GDPR Article 9&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would mean that the user&#8217;s explicit consent is needed. Unless of course appropriate protections were made. But based on the paper we conclude that these, if present, are not sufficient,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Asked if he believes the research indicates a breach of the GDPR, Olejnik said: &#8220;DPAs should investigate. No question about it,&#8221; adding: &#8220;Even if the matter may be technically challenging, building a case should take two days max.&#8221;</p>
<p>We flagged the research to Facebook&#8217;s lead DPA in Europe, the Irish DPC &#8212; asking the privacy regulator whether it would investigate to determine if there had been a breach of the GDPR or not &#8212; but at the time of writing it had not responded.</p>
<h2>Towards a ban on microtargeting?</h2>
<p>On the question of whether the paper strengthens the case for outlawing microtargeting, Olejnik argues that curbing the practice &#8220;is the way forward&#8221; &#8212; but says the question now is how to do that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if the current industry and political environment would be prepared for a total ban now. We should demand technical precautions, at the very least,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean, we were already told that these were in place but it appears this is not the case [in the case of nanotargeting on Facebook].&#8221;</p>
<p>Olejnik also suggested there could be changes coming down the pipe based on some of the ideas built into Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox proposal &#8212; which has, however, been stalled as a result of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">adtech complaints triggering competition scrutiny</a>.</p>
<p>Asked for his views on a ban on microtargeting, Cuevas told us: &#8220;My personal position here is that we need to understand the tradeoff between privacy risks and economy (jobs, innovation, etc.). Our research definitely shows that the adtech industry should understand that just thinking of PII information (email, phone, postal address, etc.) is not enough and they need to implement more strict measures regarding the way audiences can be defined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saying that, we do not agree that microtargeting &#8212; understood as the capacity of defining an audience with (at least) tens of thousands of users &#8212; should be banned. There is a very important market behind microtargeting that creates many jobs and this is a very innovative sector that does interesting things that are not necessarily bad. Therefore, our position is limiting the potential of microtargeting to guarantee the privacy of the users.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the area of privacy we believe the open question that is not solved yet is the consent,&#8221; he also said. &#8220;The research community and the adtech ecosystem have to work (ideally together) to create an efficient solution that obtains the informed consent from users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zooming out, there are more legal requirements looming on the horizon for AI-driven tools in Europe.</p>
<p>Incoming EU legislation for high-risk applications of artificial intelligence &#8212; which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">proposed earlier this year</a> &#8212; has suggested a total ban on AI systems that deploy &#8220;subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness in order to materially distort a person’s behaviour in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm&#8221;.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s at least interesting to speculate whether Facebook&#8217;s platform might face a ban under the EU&#8217;s future AI Regulation &#8212; unless the company puts proper safeguards in place that robustly prevent the risk of its ad tools being used to blackmail or psychologically manipulate individual users.</p>
<p>For now, though, it&#8217;s lucrative business as usual for Facebook&#8217;s eyeball targeting empire.</p>
<p>Asked about plans for future research into the platform, Cuevas said the obvious next piece of work they want to do is to combine interests with other demographic information to see if nanotargeting is &#8220;even easier&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, it is very likely that an advertiser could can combine the age, gender, city (or zip code) of the user with a few interests to nanotarget a user,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;We would like to understand how many of these parameters you need to combine. Inferring the gender, age, location and few interests from a user may be much easier than inferring few tens of interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cuevas added that the nanotargeting paper has been accepted for presentation at the <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2021/schedule/">ACM Internet Measurement Conference</a> next month.</p>
<p><em>This report was updated with a correction: We originally misstated that the researchers had used Facebook&#8217;s Custom Audience tool to nanotarget individual users &#8212; the tool is actually called Facebook Ads Manager</em></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Climate in the last decade has been unprecedented in many ways, none of them good.</p>
<p>Wildfires in California have consumed entire towns; thousands of miles away, New Yorkers inhale the ashes. Across Europe and Japan, flash floods wreak widespread devastation. We all see the videos on YouTube and CNN. And we shrug.</p>
<p>The recently released <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/">6th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report</a> concluded that human-created climate change is taking place faster than we thought, calling it a &#8220;code-red alert.&#8221; At just 2 degrees warmer than today, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02323/full">one estimate predicts more than 300,000,000 climate-related deaths</a> globally by 2100. And that’s the optimistic estimate. Global warming is overwhelming and feels impossible to fix. What the hell can we do?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218667" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like many of you, I am an optimist. Humanity has come to the limits of nature many times in the past, and has overcome them with technology. We have always adapted ourselves to our environment; changing our technology and behavior due to environmental change is part of our history.</p>
<p>Regulation will help incentivize corporations to clean up, but only technology can solve the intractable problem of sustainably giving us what we desire. Thoughtless consumption brought us climate change, but it is also true that mindful consumption can get us out of it.</p>
<p>How do we use capitalism to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions worldwide? Follow the carbon. That leads us to the three main bottlenecks on the road to net-zero carbon emissions.</p>
<p>What follows is necessarily a high-level overview of huge and complex industries. I’ve purposely left out granular details so we could address the overarching issues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Electrification: 36 gigatons CO2 emitted</h2>
<h3>TAM: $7 trillion</h3>
<p>Global carbon usage is highest in energy production as we burn coal, oil and natural gas to power our cars, cities and industry (yes, coal is still mined and burned in 2021). That’s a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es400399h">whopping 36 gigatons of CO2 emissions per year</a>. Why do we still burn coal? It&#8217;s cheap, on-demand, universal, portable, an order of magnitude more efficient than lithium-ion batteries, and much safer.</p>
<p>But it needs to be eliminated, very soon.</p>
<p>The IPCC report found that 89% of global CO2 emissions come from fossil fuels. Further, it tells us we must cut these emissions in half over the next decade or risk a 1.5-degree Celsius increase in average global temperatures.</p>
<p>Currently, wind and solar cannot produce electricity 100% of the time; generated energy must be stored rather than just dumped if unused, as it is done today. There are many ways of producing clean energy today, including nuclear, tidal, hydroelectric, geothermal and other means. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/fusion-energy-is-coming-and-maybe-sooner-than-you-think/">Fusion is advancing every year</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Civilization was born alongside the sheep and cow, but 10,000 years later, the sheep, cow and pig are killing us. They emit 10% of global greenhouse gases, and global demand for meat is skyrocketing.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We will need more than double today’s clean energy output to service growing demand. But until we can store this energy and use it in cars, boats, airplanes and more, clean energy production will not eliminate the need for oil and coal. Energy storage is the main bottleneck for a global electric economy. We need bigger, safer and cleaner batteries that can be used everywhere from the grid to our cars to our homes, and keep the lights on when we need them most.</p>
<p>You and I won’t be buying these batteries, but they will power everything we do buy. From cars to the cargo ships that deliver them to the airplanes that carry us, they will all eventually be electric. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/united-airlines-to-buy-100-19-seat-electric-planes-from-heart-aerospace-.html">Boeing just ordered 100 electric planes from Heart Aerospace</a>, in which it also invested. The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/world/yara-birkeland-norway-crewless-container-ship-spc-intl/index.html">world’s first electric cargo ship</a>, the Yara Birkeland, built by Marin Teknikk, is scheduled to have its maiden voyage soon.</p>
<p>There are no fewer than a dozen electric aircraft companies and six dozen electric vehicle companies. But the bottleneck for these efforts to scale and replace all fossil fuel planes, ships and cars with equivalent performance is a humble battery capable of delivering sustained, high power output over a long period of time. Without that fundamental advancement, these companies will stay in the conceptual stage for a long time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, lithium-based battery technology still only has one-tenth the maximum energy density of gasoline (which is around 50 megajoules per kilogram). It isn&#8217;t enough. The closest we can get with lithium-ion technology is the lithium-air battery, which has a theoretical energy density of 40 megajoules per kilogram, but new electrolytes need to be invented for it to work. Like Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier to usher in the supersonic era, we need to break through this density barrier to power our green future.</p>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that melanin, our skin pigment, has also shown promise as a potent cathode that can make rechargeable sodium batteries a possibility. This would enable large-scale “salt” batteries that can be used to create a safe and clean grid storage solution. Researchers have also used viruses to create nanolayers of different elements to make higher-performance cathodes. Other lines of research have shown that batteries driven by enzymatic catalysts can potentially use sugar water to slowly charge your car or house with bio-electricity. None of the solutions above are within a decade to market; all are in the research stage.</p>
<p>The winners of the electrification wars will aggregate these technologies across industries and provide consumers with a seamless, wonderful experience. From fast wireless charging of electronics and vehicles to self-adapting national electrical grids, an electrified world will be quieter, efficient and clean. I am excited about the prospect of living in a fully electric world.</p>
<h2>Rematerialization: 10.2 gigatons emitted</h2>
<h3>TAM: $12 trillion</h3>
<p>Every object in the room you’re sitting in was made unsustainably and reeks of carbon emissions. The cement floor, sofa, dining table, desk, refrigerator, sink, chairs, even the walls contribute to climate change. Consumers have no choice; they can’t buy green, and we need to change this.</p>
<p>Durable goods and our built environment alone account for <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es400399h">more than 10.2 gigatons of CO2 emissions yearly</a>, or nearly one-third of total emissions. The heights of dirty industry need to be toppled and rebuilt from scratch with a new goal in mind: Sustainable production for hundreds of years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Cement</strong></p>
<p>Global cement production emits <a href="https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/low-carbon-concrete-can-fight-global-warming">nearly 2.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide per year</a>. There are dozens of green cement companies now trying various approaches to eliminating CO2 emissions from cement and concrete. At IndieBio, I invested in Carbix, a company that takes CO2 emissions and uses them to make olivine cement. They have made a few bricks and are years from the market.</p>
<p>The main barrier for most green cement formulators is proving equivalent structural performance. Getting to scale is expensive. However, a few companies promising greener concrete are coming to market in the next few years.</p>
<p><strong>Steel</strong></p>
<p>Making steel and aluminum is energy-intensive. In fact, aluminum is referred to by many commodity traders as “energy in solid form.” Powering our foundries with clean energy and reducing their carbon usage <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/decarbonization-challenge-for-steel">will help eliminate 8% of emissions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Wood</strong></p>
<p>Trees are our biggest carbon sinks. They suck in CO2 from the air and exhale the oxygen we breathe. So why do we still cut them down?</p>
<p>Hopefully, soon we won’t have to. Companies are using flax and other natural fibers to create bio-composites that are stiffer than steel and lighter than wood, or developing sustainable bamboo for exterior building panels. Others are experimenting with mushroom mycelium to grow entire buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Leather and fabrics</strong></p>
<p>Cows contribute 7.1 gigatons of CO2 per year to global warming, <a href="https://clear.ucdavis.edu/explainers/using-global-emission-statistics-distracting-us-climate-change-solutions">a full 14.5% of the total</a>. We don’t just eat them, we use their skin a lot. Leather is everywhere, from shoes and couches to purses and clothing. We need to replace this material if we are to eliminate cows from our supply chain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a dozen companies are making headway into eliminating plastic and leather from fashion. All are finding tremendous traction with consumer companies looking to provide their consumers with vegan and sustainable products.</p>
<p>Fabrics like polyester are made of petrochemicals. Fermentation technologies excel at making oils from sugar water by using algae or yeast as a factory. Fermentation is scalable and exists today, while a newer technology called cell-free synthesis is being applied to these same problems. We can expect new green fabrics in the next five years.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial chemicals</strong></p>
<p>Break down oil and you get a list of unpronounceable names that make much of our world. These chemicals are used in engines, antifreeze, cosmetics and even foods. To eliminate any need for oil, these products must be replaced through fermentation, which converts sugar into chemicals.</p>
<p>The sugar can come from corn or even waste CO2 in chimneys. Cells don’t have to be alive either, as cell-free synthesis allows the enzymes themselves to do the work. A huge number of companies have been started to remake all these chemicals through varieties of fermentation and synthesis.</p>
<p>Rematerializing our planets with sustainable, carbon-neutral sources can remove up to 10 gigatons of emissions from our economy. Our houses and everything inside them will eventually become carbon-neutral through rematerialization. I am excited about breaking this bottleneck to progress because it naturally leads to better products for everyone.</p>
<h2>Food: 3.6 gigatons C02 emitted</h2>
<h3>TAM: $10 trillion</h3>
<p>The first slide of a presentation I gave to explain the new food revolution depicted cavemen with spears being mauled by a giant prehistoric bear. The point? Protein is important enough to die for. As we transitioned from hunting to farming, our society reorganized around cities and the division of labor.</p>
<p>Civilization was born alongside the sheep and cow, but 10,000 years later, the sheep, cow and pig are killing us. They <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">emit 10% of global greenhouse gases</a>, and global demand for meat is skyrocketing. Over the past six years at IndieBio, I&#8217;ve invested in Clara Foods, Geltor, Memphis Meats (now Upside Foods), NotCo,and many others to reinvent agriculture through fermentation, plant-based formulations and cell-based culture.</p>
<p>These startups reinvented familiar foods like burgers, mayonnaise, popcorn shrimp, egg whites, poke bowls, sausages and chicken wings. As affluent societies began eating more processed foods, foods became products: Cows became burgers, pigs became bacon and chickens are now nuggets. A legion of food-as-product companies have followed in their footsteps and there are entire conferences dedicated to them. &#8220;Food is hot&#8221; is an understatement in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Having been a part of the food revolution from its earliest days, I am struck by the magnitude of these revolutions once they really get going. I am also wary of revolutions that stall. Cell-based foods should be on the market next year and consumers will get to decide for themselves if the revolution is for them. So the final shape and form of the world once the revolutions roll through society and become the new normal is not easy to predict.</p>
<p>I am a fan of history, so I look into the past to see where we are going next. My mother’s recipe for curry chicken is a good place to start. It calls for chicken thighs with the bone in, chopped. If I want to make a low-carbon, animal-free version of that recipe, I’d have to use something other than chicken, but what? Just’s cell-based chicken nuggets? No, breaded chicken nuggets won’t work, nor would soy alternatives. Beyond Curry? My mom wouldn&#8217;t approve.</p>
<h2>Biofarming real food</h2>
<p>For agriculture to be reinvented for everyone, not just the 1%, we must make food. Real, natural food. Steaks, chicken breasts and thighs, bone-in meats and spare ribs. Not a processed version of these products, but ingredients to make whole-food dishes.</p>
<p>Food 3.0 is biofarming. Biofarming will have to solve for taste and wholesome nutrition. Delicious foods with no processing other than mom’s recipe. Regenerative agriculture will enable carbon-neutral vegetables and plants if we can help farmers get their yields high enough to turn a profit while a field is fallow for a season. Numerous technologies are helping to achieve this.</p>
<h2>We aren’t F’d yet</h2>
<p>Bloomberg recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/climate-change-linked-to-5-million-deaths-a-year-new-study-shows">reported</a> that there have been over 5 million deaths a year globally from climate change-related events from 2009 to 2019. That&#8217;s 1 in 10 deaths on the planet. Since we do not track this statistic (we track heat stroke, drowning, landslide, suicide, and the things that directly kill us), nor other effects like people not having children and extreme anxiety, it is impossible to know the true magnitude of misery climate change will bring. How far will we let this go before we all act? How many more will have to die?</p>
<p>The new normal doesn’t need to be this way. Scientists can choose to apply their work to solve the paradox of carbon and production. Investors can choose to put money into companies rebuilding our world to be gentle and green. And entrepreneurs can choose to build companies that reshape our carbon economy for the greatest opportunity in history. The above road map represents the ability to erase nearly all carbon emissions by humanity.</p>
<p>We are far from doomed. Together, we will all build and we will all fight for our future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SiriusXM-owned Pandora is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pandora-launches-the-lookout-by-soundcloud-301401002.html">partnering with SoundCloud</a> to launch &#8220;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3324202-1&amp;h=2999458705&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpandora.app.link%2FDKybDpowkkb&amp;a=HERE">The Lookout by SoundCloud</a>,&#8221; a new station available on Pandora that aims to showcase music from the “hip hop superstars of tomorrow.” Today’s announcement comes as Pandora’s parent company, SiriusXM, recently partnered with SoundCloud to launch a show of the same name on its Hip-Hop Nation channel. It’s no surprise that SiriusXM is joining forces with SoundCloud across its properties, as the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/music-streaming-pioneer-soundcloud-raises-75m-from-pandora-owner-siriusxm/">invested $75 million in SoundCloud</a> last year.</p>
<p>The Lookout by SoundCloud features new artists weekly, like Toosii, Sheff G, Metro Marrs, Young Devyn, $NOT, Dro Kenji, Cico P, Flo Milli, Nevi, SoFaygo, Isaiah Rashad, Sleepy Rose and more. The station features songs heard on the SiriusXM SoundCloud show.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a hit slot on SiriusXM&#8217;s Hip-Hop Nation and now a new home on Pandora, SoundCloud&#8217;s top playlist, &#8216;The Lookout&#8217;, is the go-to source with the largest digital audio reach for fans to discover the best in breaking hip hop,&#8221; said R. Caiaffa, the interim head of music at SoundCloud, in a statement. &#8220;Joining forces with Pandora to expand &#8216;The Lookout by SoundCloud&#8217; amps up our shared commitment to help the emerging hip-hop artist community to get heard and discovered.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218810" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new station originates from one of SoundCloud’s most popular playlists, ‘The Lookout,’ which launched in 2019. The playlist has since become a popular destination for discovering the next generation of rising stars in hip hop.</p>
<p>SiriusXM notes that The Lookout has spotlighted some of today’s biggest artists in hip hop before they became household names, including Pop Smoke, Megan Thee Stallion, Roddy Ricch, Rod Wave and more.</p>
<p>It’s clear that SiriusXM is looking to attract more younger listeners across its offerings with its various partnerships with SoundCloud. Additionally, SiriusXM recently launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/siriusxm-launches-tiktok-radio-a-music-channel-featuring-viral-hits-hosted-by-tiktok-stars/">TikTok Radio channel</a>, which features TikTok creators as channel hosts, in another push to capture a younger audience. The station is designed to sound like a radio version of TikTok’s &#8220;For You&#8221; feed.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, SiriusXM and Pandora have also struck deals with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/siriusxm-acquires-simplecast-to-double-down-on-podcasts-with-distribution-and-analytics-tools/">Simplecast</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-for-325-million-steps-up-its-march-into-podcasts/">Stitcher</a> to become more competitive in both music and podcast streaming. Most recently, SiriusXM partnered with audio entertainment production studio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/siriusxm-partners-with-audio-up-to-develop-new-original-podcasts/">Audio Up</a> to develop new original scripted podcasts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In emerging economies, where spending billions to build public transit infrastructure can be out of reach, startups are using technology to meet the mobility needs of a rising urban middle class.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.swvl.com/">Swvl</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/plentywaka-founder-onyeka-akumah-on-african-startups-and-global-expansion/">Treepz</a>, <a href="https://www.jatri.co/">Jatri</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-motorcycle-ride-hailing-wars-in-nigeria-and-uganda-is-safebodas-to-lose/">SafeBoda</a>, <a href="https://urbvan.com/">Urbvan</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/chalo-raises-40-million-to-digitize-bus-commutes-in-india/">Chalo</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/brazil-startup-buser-raises-138-million-lgt-softbank-others-2021-06-10/">Buser</a> are just a few of the startups that have popped up in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America in recent years,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> all with a focus on providing on-demand access to transportation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are these startups products of the emerging markets, but because mobility is so essential to a thriving economy, they’re actually driving development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that if you want to get good economies of scale and see the positive spillovers of a big urban space, you need to be able to get around at a low cost and in an efficient way,” Nikos Tsafos, the James R. Schlesinger Chair in Energy and Geopolitics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told TechCrunch. “What this does is it enlarges the labor market and makes it more efficient.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2204834" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Necessity might be the mother of innovation, but that innovation isn&#8217;t limited to the economies where it was conceived. These startups are also providing a less car-centric blueprint for the rest of the world, including economies with existing public transit.</p>
<p>The table stakes stretch beyond the financial future of a handful of startups. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">If startups like these don&#8217;t succeed, one of the risks is that as GDP continues to grow in emerging markets, populations with more discretionary funds will end up purchasing their own vehicles, which will only contribute to the global climate crisis.</span></p>
<h3><b>Swvl: Repurposing underutilized vehicles for shared transport</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swvl is a Dubai-based startup that provides shared transportation services for intracity and intercity trips for both individual commuters and corporations, schools and tour operators. Since its founding in 2017, the startup has expanded across UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kenya and Pakistan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its business model revolves around repurposing underutilized buses or minivans that are privately owned, usually by small or medium-sized businesses and fleet owners, for different uses throughout the day. For example, when a bus that usually drives kids to and from school only twice a day signs on with Swvl, it will also be used for a combination of intracity B2C routes, corporate drives, intercity rides or tour group rides.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This significantly increases utilization of that vehicle,&#8221; Mostafa Kandil, CEO and founder of Swvl, told TechCrunch. &#8220;With every incremental utilization of the vehicle, the fixed component of the cost of the vehicle itself gets amortized over more and more rides, so we’re able to pay less and less on a per-unit level and on a per-ride level. Hence, we’re able to continuously drop our price to the end consumer while actually significantly increasing our margin.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riders can book a seat on a fixed route and track their ride at every step. In cities where public transit is unreliable or dangerous, services like Swvl’s can be a game-changer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Swvl is close to becoming a unicorn is a signal of the strength of this industry. In July, the company entered into a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/swvl-a-transformative-mass-transit-platform-announces-business-combination-with-queens-gambit-growth-capital-301343236.html">SPAC agreement with Queen&#8217;s Gambit Growth Capital</a> with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an implied enterprise value of $1.5 billion, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swvl says it is forecasting an annualized gross revenue of $79 million through December, which is an increase of about 55% from February 2020 revenues of $51 million. By 2025, the startup also plans to achieve $1 billion in annual gross revenue and operate in 20 countries on five continents, with SaaS or transportation as a Service (TaaS) expansions set to occur across Europe, the U.S. and the APAC region through a<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/swvl-expands-into-europe-latam-and-apac-via-acquisition-of-mass-transit-saas-platform-shotl-301358508.html"> recent acquisition of Spanish-based mass transit SaaS platform Shotl</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the immediate need to provide basic transportation to growing middle classes, Kandil says the initial product-market fit is naturally within emerging markets, but he sees Swvl’s services in global terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Governments across the world spend billions of dollars on transportation infrastructure that are actually becoming obsolete,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you think about New York in the summer versus in the winter, it’s a totally different city. The movements, the patterns in a city change quite significantly throughout the year, but the public transportation system doesn’t really change. So what we are building is the mass transit system of the future that can serve any type of city with a public transportation system that’s demand-responsive, that can change every day, every hour, and can self-optimize based on how the entire city is moving.”</span></p>
<h3><b>How Treepz provides ‘Uber for buses’ in Nigeria</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onyeka Akumah, CEO and founder of Treepz, formerly Plentywaka, said the day his startup was conceived was the day he got off a plane in Lagos and had to take two bikes, a boat and then a bus just to get around town for meetings. He described the bus experience as a harrowing one where he literally “had to hold one of the doors throughout the trip from falling off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lagos is Nigeria’s largest city, with 14 million residents who have to commute daily. While the country has the most startups in Africa, it falls short of other metrics that would help it rank competitively among other African nations, according to an </span><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2021/05/24/south-afria-future-tech-ecosystem/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African Tech Ecosystem ranking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For entrepreneurship to thrive, fDi Intelligence, the specialist division within Financial Times that published the report, says a country must have cost-effectiveness, country-wide tech talent, cooperative government, good internet access and healthy infrastructure. Much of this simply cannot be achieved if people can&#8217;t move around easily, efficiently and cheaply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treepz provides another example of the public sector stepping forward and, hopefully, driving the country toward prosperity. The startup offers a similar service to Swvl, one where commuters can book intracity or intercity travel through an app, reserve their seat and track their ride. While Treepz has expanded throughout the country, it also plans to move into Uganda, Ghana and a handful of other African nations over the next few years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Millions of people have to commute on a daily basis using public transportation, and if they can’t afford an Uber ride, and they want to get to work on time, this is the only way they can do it,” Akumah told TechCrunch. “We wanted to give people a better way to commute with predictability, where they can know when the bus will get here, the certainty that they will have a seat on the vehicle, that it’s a decent vehicle and a safe one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Swvl allows customers to book a seat online and then pay the driver later with cash, Treepz presently won’t accept cash, which is part of the reason the service is really geared toward the middle class. Akumah said at the moment, cash is too risky because it invites corruption at the worst and difficulty keeping track of sales at best.</span></p>
<h3><b>Creating accountability for Bangladesh’s public transport with Jatri</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bangladesh-based Jatri aims to address the problem of inconsistent public transportation timetables, payment difficulties and constantly changing routes. The startup says it’s the first bus tracking and digital ticketing platform in Bangladesh, serving both bus companies that need to regulate how their buses were functioning and commuters who need a more frictionless service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riders can subscribe, plan their trips, track buses and secure tickets, while operators can utilize Jatri’s bus trip analytics. The company is also working on creating data that regulators can use for urban planning purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jatri was founded in 2019 and in that time has digitized the operations of thousands of bus partners, hosting more than 3.5 million transport tickets on its platform across three cities. Earlier this month, the startup raised a $1.2 million pre-Series A round that it says it will use to expand its nationwide coverage. It recently partnered with BRTC, a state-owned transport corporation of Bangladesh, to provide its tracking and ticketing services for many of its routes, with the possibility of nationwide adoption.</span></p>
<h3>The role of transportation in emerging markets</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the middle class grows and incomes rise, people tend to become more concerned with the quality of services like mass transit. </span><a href="https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/bangladeshs-rising-middle-class-myths-and-realities-1614610680"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rising expectations could potentially become a source of friction for a country like Bangladesh, where its citizens may experience what economist Albert Hirschman described as the “tunnel effect.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is when vulnerable members of society start to see increased inequality based on an uneven growth process. They initially tolerate it, expecting that their time for prosperity will come. But if they do not catch up in time, their tolerance may morph into frustration &#8212; and ultimately sociopolitical upheavals. </span></p>
<p>Which is what makes the emergence of startups dedicated to easing the strain of public transportation so vital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transportation systems have the ability to connect people to jobs, as well as leisure and like green spaces and entertainment,&#8221; said Tsafos. &#8220;Those are the central elements for the vibrancy of the city, so what I would be expecting is in the absence of those transportation solutions is a city that&#8217;s underperforming and is not living up to its potential because you just have a fragmented urban space that can&#8217;t take full advantage of the human capital that resides in this sort of broad metropolitan area.&#8221;</p>
