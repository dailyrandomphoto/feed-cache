										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tier, a Berlin-based e-scooter company that&#8217;s quickly expanding throughout Europe, has acquired Vento Mobility, the Italian subsidiary of Wind Mobility. The companies are not sharing the terms of the deal, but it will mark Tier&#8217;s entry into the Italian market.</p>
<p>Just last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/e-scooter-startup-tier-buys-nextbike-to-double-down-on-commitment-to-e-bikes/">Tier also acquired Nextbike</a>, a German bike-sharing platform, a move to both become multi-modal and further consolidate its micromobility empire. Since its founding, Tier has also acquired Makery, a provider of digital services like product strategy, design and management, engineering, testing and quality, training and support, and staff augmentation, as well as Pushme, a battery swapping company.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">On the Wind side of things, the company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/russian-tech-giant-yandex-expands-israeli-footprint-with-acquisition-of-winds-tel-aviv-operations/">recently sold off its Israeli operations to Yandex</a>, the Russian tech giant, so it&#8217;s possible Wind is succumbing piece by piece to the inevitable industry consolidation. The company has raised a total of $72 million; its last funding round was a Series A back in 2019. Tier, for comparison, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/tier-scoots-off-with-first-close-of-its-200m-series-d/">raised $200 million as only part of its Series D round in October</a>, bringing its total funding up to around $647 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246953" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wind did not respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s inquiry for more information about its strategy moving forward.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, the first Tier e-scooters will be available on the streets of Bari and Palermo, with other Italian cities to follow in the coming days and weeks, according to the company. Tier is already present in 165 cities in 18 countries, offering its scooters that include an integrated helmet, turn signals on the handlebar and rear wing, and triple brakes with a large front wheel.</p>
<p>Wind&#8217;s Italian fleet had 4,500 e-scooters across 11 towns and cities in Italy. Tier did not respond to requests for more information about what would be done with those scooters, or if Tier would inherit all, or just some key members, of Wind&#8217;s Italian staff.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly six years after Netflix launched its service in India, the global streaming giant is still struggling to find enough customers willing to pay what is already one of the world’s most affordable prices.</p>
<p>The American firm on Tuesday further lowered the subscription price in India, cutting each monthly subscription tier&#8217;s cost by at least 18% and up to 60.1%. The Netflix Basic plan, which permits streaming on any device but caps the resolution at 480p, now costs ₹199 ($2.6) in India, down from ₹499 ($6.6).</p>
<p>Netflix Standard, which improves the video resolution to HD (720p) and permits two simultaneous views, now costs ₹499, down from ₹649 ($8.5). Netflix Premium, which offers four simultaneous views and streams in UltraHD (4K) video quality, now costs ₹649, down from ₹799 ($10.5).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This isn’t the first time Netflix has played around with prices in India. In 2019, after months of testing, Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/netflix-launches-rs-199-2-8-mobile-only-monthly-plan-in-india/">unveiled a “mobile only” tier in India</a> in a global first that was priced at ₹199. That plan is now available for ₹149 ($1.96), Netflix said today.</p>
<p>India is one of the world’s largest entertainment markets. But Netflix has struggled to produce content that helps it court customers beyond a small circle of loud Twitter users in the country &#8212; despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-to-release-41-original-indian-shows-and-movies-this-year/">sinking nearly $1 billion on it to date</a>. At the same time, Disney&#8217;s Hotstar continues to dominate the market &#8212; without much assistance from the Twitter crowd &#8212; thanks to a much larger ad-supported local content library, syndication deals with international giants such as HBO, as well as nearly all sports streaming rights. (Also, YouTube reaches half a billion users in India, according to estimates from App Annie.)</p>
<p>Research firm Mobile Partners Asia estimates that India will have 89 million individuals who pay for subscription services by the end of this year, up from 57 million last year.</p>
<p>The price cut in India, for which Netflix offered no explanation, comes at a time when the streaming giant has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/netflix-is-raising-prices-on-most-of-its-plans-in-the-us/">raised the monthly tariff</a> in several parts of the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yet another ‘quick commerce’ 15-minute groceries startup is hoping to make a name for itself in this space, adding to the myriad of companies currently crowding out this market. But <a href="https://grovy.store/en">Grovy</a> is avoid the crowded cities of Western Europem, setting its sights on becoming a daily-delivery leader in the East.</p>
<p>It’s now finalized a €3 million financing round led by Lighthouse Ventures to expand across Central and Eastern Europe, with offices already running in Prague and Bucharest, after entering the German market in Frankfurt and Mainz.</p>
<p>While many players rely on significant mark-ups, which can be as high as 20%, as well as low-paid gig workers, Grovy says it only employs full-time workers and leverages a 5% markup on deliveries, with a flat delivery fee that is waived for orders above €40.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246799" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s other schtick is sustainability, with deliveries only on bikes and EVs, discounts on “ugly” produce and soon-to-expire perishables (helping to cut down on food waste) and working with food waste startups such as <a href="https://toogoodtogo.com/">Too Good To Go</a>, while employing a carbon offset program.</p>
<p>Justin Adam, co-founder and CEO of Grovy said: “Frankfurt and Mainz, with their high demand for quick commerce solutions, served as the perfect sandbox. But rather than replicate our model in other German cities, we are bringing it to larger cities across the CEE region, where 10-minute delivery is still a novelty and the potential to scale is massive.”</p>
<p>Michal Zalesak, managing partner at lead investor Lighthouse Ventures said: “Grovy has made achievements in mere weeks that would take a normal grocery chain a year to accomplish. Despite enormous competitive pressures, their unique approach to quick commerce has landed them phenomenal success in Germany, and we want to support them as they take on Central and Eastern Europe’s cities.”</p>
<p>Grovy faces competition from Gorillas and Flink in Germany, Lisek in Warsaw, but tends to face only one-hour delivery competition from the likes of Bolt or Delivery Hero in most other European cities it’s operating in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The beauty and wellness industry, annually worth <a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/future-post-coronavirus-beauty-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some $4 trillion</a>, is underpinned by tens of thousands of businesses and millions of professionals carrying out haircuts, treatments and workouts. Today, a company called <a href="https://www.fresha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fresha</a>, which provides a software stack to help them run those operations, is announcing new funding of $52.5 million to continue building out its own business.</p>
<p>Fresha got its start, and is best known among its 60,000 customers, for its booking software, which it provides on a subscription-free basis, <a href="https://www.fresha.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charging</a> instead based on taking a cut on payments, or first-time bookings and marketing messages (if a customer chooses those latter two options). But its ambitions, co-founder and CEO William Zeqiri said in an interview, are to be the go-to destination for any digital tool that a salon or independent professional might need to run a business: like Shopify, LinkedIn, Wix, Square or QuickBooks, but tailored for the specific demands of beauty and wellness professionals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stylists [and other beauty and wellness professionals] are not really trained in business management,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our goal is to free that up and automate all aspects of their business.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246481" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Michael Lahyani and BECO Capital co-led the round, with previous backers General Atlantic, Partech, Target Global and FMZ Ventures also participating. Fresha has raised $182 million overall.</p>
<p>This latest funding is coming in the form of a Series C extension &#8212; Fresha <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/fresha-raises-100m-for-its-beauty-and-wellness-booking-platform-and-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised the first $100 million</a> in June of this year &#8212; and with it, the startup&#8217;s valuation has shot up to over $640 million. For context, the company previously had not disclosed its valuation, but Zeqiri confirmed that it increased significantly in the extension due to the company&#8217;s own growth in the last six months.</p>
<p>Beauty and wellness had a mixed bag of luck as the pandemic took hold across the world. People overall were going out a lot less, or not at all, and thus spending significantly more on products to treat themselves at home. But on the other hand, Covid-19 led to a lot of municipalities shutting down salons to help curb the spread of the virus; and in cases where they were open follow more restrictive protocols for the customers who did show up.</p>
<p>That presented an obvious challenge to a company like Fresha, built around the premise of providing appointment booking and payments for in-person, very physical businesses. However, like other tech companies that have carved out a niche for themselves in providing tools specifically catering to and mastering the needs of a specific service-industry vertical &#8212; Toast being on strong example &#8212; Fresha&#8217;s focus helped it identify the opportunity inherent in that challenge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, Fresha&#8217;s tools include booking and point-of-sale payment software &#8212; used in some 120 countries with its biggest markets the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Europe, where it sees tens of millions of appointments booked monthly and has processed $15 billion in transactions to date.</p>
<p>But Zegiri said that with the big shift among Fresha&#8217;s customers to move more interactions and services online in the wake of Covid-19, Fresha has built a &#8220;Shopify&#8221; for beauty and wellness websites to sell goods and services (this is launching in the coming days). It&#8217;s now in the process of finishing up its &#8220;Wix&#8221; for designing sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to build the Amazon of the beauty and wellness industry, with a full suite of services that compete at every level, and in all markets,&#8221; he said. That will include marketing, and marketing automation tools, and more down the line, he said. It will in the meantime face a pretty big army of competitors, from Square through to Booksy, Phorest, Treatwell, SalonIQ and many others.</p>
<p>There has also been an interesting shift in the business models around beauty and wellness that has also played into Fresha&#8217;s hand, said Nick Miller, the company&#8217;s other co-founder and chief product officer.</p>
<p>Specifically, the pressures of the pandemic forced a lot of salons and brick and mortar businesses to downsize; or sometimes shut down altogether and &#8220;go mobile&#8221; where pro&#8217;s paid people home visits to carry out services.</p>
<p>Or, in cases where they were willing to stick it out and continue paying rent on premises, increasingly there was a move to models where pros were no longer directly employed by salons and spas, but rather hired out space within them to serve their own client lists; or some variation on that theme, for example staying on the books as contractors and sharing a common appointment book, but still &#8220;renting&#8221; the space to carry out work.</p>
<p>All of this presents a complex mix of new use cases, and customers, to sign on to a platform like Fresha&#8217;s, Miller noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s been one of the Covid effects,&#8221; he said. And because its users are not tech-interested in the main, the idea of using multiple services for different aspects of running their businesses, and &#8220;jumping to different platforms,&#8221; in his words, they appealed to Fresha to bring in the functionality that they wanted to have. &#8220;It was great timing for us,&#8221; Miller said.</p>
<p>Sadly, one of the other consequences of the pandemic has been the closure of a lot of small and independent businesses. Zeqiri noted that Fresha has had multiple offers from its customers to buy them up, but that&#8217;s not the core of how the startup sees itself growing: its aim is instead to build tools to make those businesses viable again, he said.</p>
<p>“Fresha has positioned itself as a major player in the beauty and wellness industry with a large and loyal customer base,” said Aaron Goldman, global co-head of financial services and MD of General Atlantic, in a statement. “We strongly believe in Fresha&#8217;s balanced strategy of providing one of the best products in the market at no cost to salons and then driving monetization via payments and value-added services.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet Topi, a Berlin-based startup that raised a $4.5 million pre-seed funding round co-led by <a href="https://www.indexventures.com">Index Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.creandum.com">Creandum</a>. The company is working on a payment solution that is both fast and capital efficient for businesses.</p>
<p>On the B2C front, consumer payments have evolved at a rapid pace over the last few years. When it’s time to check out, customers expect to be able to choose between several payment methods that all offer different advantages and drawbacks.</p>
<p>Usually you can pay with your debit or credit card, which could let you take advantage of some kind of insurance and accumulate points or cash back. You can also choose to pay with a digital wallet, like PayPal. Sometimes, you may choose to spread a big purchase over several months with Klarna, Affirm, Afterpay, etc.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246765" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>And yet, B2B transactions haven’t changed as much. Businesses often face a simple dilemma — they pay directly or they spend some time negotiating a financing offer. A supplier can offer some financing options directly. Sometimes companies ask their bank directly. In all cases, it’s a lengthy, bureaucratic and manual process.</p>
<p>Topi wants to reach the ideal Venn diagram of B2B payments —&nbsp;a payment solution that doesn’t require any paperwork, but a payment method with some financing offers. Topi thinks it can offer financing options of up to five years with instant approval.</p>
<p>“We’re building all of that ourselves. We’re building the first product right now and it’ll come on the market during the course of next year,” co-founder Estelle Merle told me.</p>
<p>This payment solution would be particularly useful for expensive purchases — a new machine, a big event or an upgrade for the restaurant kitchen. Topi expects to integrate its payment solution directly in the checkout flow of popular B2B merchants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Many merchants already offer financing options, but they usually just link to a help page with some information to go further. “We’re digitizing this manual process and brining it straight to the point of sale,” Merle said.</p>
<p>This isn’t just a technical challenge as there’s some financial risk involved with SMB financing. The company wants to be able to make smart decisions without asking for too much input. A customer should be able to know if they are eligible for financing options in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>“We have an in-house risk team,” co-founder Charlotte Pallua told me. “What we don’t want to do is ask SMBs to upload financial statements from three years ago. Everything has to be digital.”</p>
<p>She then gave me some hints about data sources. For instance, Topi could get some sales data from a payment processor, or e-commerce performance from a Shopify account. With open banking rolling out across Europe, you could also imagine entering your business bank account login information to let Topi fetch the past few months of transactions.</p>
<p>In addition to Index Ventures and Creandum, several business angels invested in the startup, such as HelloFresh founder Dominik Richter, N26 founder Max Tayenthal, Adyen founding team member Thijn Lamers and WeFox founder Fabian Wesemann.</p>
<p>Topi’s two co-founders Charlotte Pallua and Estelle Merle originally met during their MBA at Harvard. Pallua spent some time working for Apple on financing programs while Merle has previously worked for Goldman Sachs and Via Transportation. Topi’s CTO Ernesto Jiménez worked for GoCardless and led a big engineering team there.</p>
<p>When you look further down the road, Topi’s vision goes beyond simplifying payments. If the startup manages to become an important brick in B2B transactions, companies who use Topi could end up spending a lot of time on Topi’s portal. They could see upcoming payments and manage early repayments.</p>
<p>But Topi’s portal could also become a SaaS product on its own. For instance, customers could choose insurance products from Topi directly. Once you control the customer relationship, there are a lot of possibilities to expand horizontally. And Topi is well aware of that opportunity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Southern Europe has sometimes been seen as a little bit of a backwater in terms of venture capital funding. However, that has gradually started to change in recent years. Earlier this year Marathon Venture Capital in Athens <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/greeces-marathon-venture-capital-completes-first-close-for-fund-ii-reaching-47m/">raised</a> a $47M fund. And LAUNCHub Ventures, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/launchub-ventures-heading-towards-a-85m-fund-for-south-eastern-european-startups/">closing</a> in on a €70 million final close.</p>
<p>But today there’s news that <a href="https://venturefriends.vc/">VentureFriends</a>, a European early-stage VC that started from Athens but now has offices in London and Warsaw, has completed the first closing of its new fund at €90 million, with an aim for a hard cap at €100 million ($112M). This is the third fund for VentureFriends, which launched in 2016.</p>
<p>The new fund is backed by family offices/HNW, founders and operators, the European Investment Fund and the Hellenic Development Bank of Investments.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246842" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Seed and Series A focus of the fund remains the same. It invests €500,000 to €2.5 million per company but can follow-on up to €10 million. It invests in B2C and B2B startups, including Consumer, PropTech, FinTech, Marketplaces, and SaaS.</p>
<p>VentureFriends’ portfolio includes proptech Blueground ($180 million Series C), grocery delivery marketplace Instashop in the Middle East (acquired by Delivery Hero), fintech B2B Belvo in Mexico ($43 million Series A), fintech Plum out of London ($20 million Series A) and FBA roll-up Factory14 from Spain ($200 million Seed). There is also FlexCar, Spotawheel, Justlife, Byrd, Agro.Club and Influ2. More recently, VentureFriends invested in the UAE proptech/fintech Huspy.</p>
<p>The VC also said it intends to invest beyond Europe, in Latin America, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>George Dimopoulos co-founder and Partner said: “Raising a private only fund in Greece in 2015 wasn’t easy. We have worked hard to prove the investment worthiness of the asset class in the region. We are now happy to have reached a point where we experience multi-hundred million exits as with Instashop, and companies reaching Unicorn status such as Blueground.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apostolos Apostolakis, co-founder &amp; Partner at VentureFriends said: “We have steadily grown our presence and access to great entrepreneurs by providing relevant support and having a value-based and founder-friendly approach. We are excited about the first closing of our 3rd fund that hopefully is a testament of the work we have done and we look forward to expanding the network of entrepreneurs we will support.”</p>
<p>VentureFriends’s founders were previously entrepreneurs and angels, exiting e-food.gr to Delivery Hero in 2015 in which Apostolakis was a co-founder. They also exited taxi-hailing company Beat to Daimler in which both founding Partners were angels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.forwardx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ForwardX Robotics</a>, a Beijing-headquartered company that makes autonomous mobile robots (AMR), said Tuesday it has closed the initial tranche of its Series C funding round as it looks to expand globally.</p>
<p>The startup is fundraising for the rest of its Series C round at a time investors are courting warehousing and manufacturing robot makers in China, the company&#8217;s chief operating officer Yaxin Guan told TechCrunch during an interview.</p>
<p>The new investment lifted ForwardX&#8217;s total raise to about $100 million since Nicolas Chee, a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-chee-0352502a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former vice president at Oracle</a>, founded the company in 2016. The startup declined to disclose its post-money valuation or how much it plans to rake in for the entire Series C.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246434" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The C1 round was led by Taikang Life Insurance, a Chinese insurer, with participation from Qualcomm Ventures and Starlight Capital, an early-stage Chinese investment firm focused on industrial upgrades.</p>
<p>In 2014, Qualcomm <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2014/07/23/qualcomm-commits-150-million-strategic-venture-fund-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it had committed $150 million to fund Chinese startups advancing mobile technologies for the internet, e-commerce, semiconductor, health and education.</p>
<p>Having the chipmaking giant onboard will allow ForwardX to &#8220;work with a 5G technology leader to further advance the use of 5G in its smart warehousing and manufacturing projects,&#8221; the company said, though the startup is currently using chips from another major supplier.</p>
<p>With the new financial injection, the Chinese startup plans to accelerate its R&amp;D timeline, ramp up its deployment capabilities in &#8220;key markets&#8221; such as the U.S., and expand sales into new markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Most of its revenues currently come from China, with e-commerce powerhouse JD.com and logistics behemoth SF Supply Chain China, which has a partnership with DHL, being two of its main customers. The robot maker so far has accured more than 5 million picks for JD.com&#8217;s warehouses, according to Guan.</p>
<p>Like a few other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/flexiv-100-million-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chinese robotics startups</a>, ForwardX is making a steady foray into overseas markets. It already opened an office in Tokyo, is on course to launch a U.S. branch and plans to enter Europe next year.</p>
<p>That means it&#8217;s coming after its American counterparts like Locus Robotics and 6 River Systems. To compete, the company claimed its solution requires less initial investment than its competitors due to &#8220;competitive hardware costs and a need for fewer robots per person in its solutions.&#8221; Its robots can carry up to 1,200 kilograms of goods each.</p>
<p>Aside from selling AMR solutions, ForwardX also touts a fleet management system that can determine how robots roam about within a warehouse, not unlike algorithms used by ride-hailing platforms to optimize driver productivity.</p>
<p>With help from its lidar- and deep learning-enabled robots, workers can spend more time picking than walking around, and new hires are spared from having to memorize where everything is within the warehouse, Guan explained.</p>
<p>Chinese tech companies are increasingly under scrutiny abroad by regulators. From a &#8220;business perspective,&#8221; Guan doesn&#8217;t see how U.S.-China tensions could hobble the firm&#8217;s U.S. expansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are even fewer people available in the U.S., so robots are what logistics customers need in the U.S.,&#8221; she said.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Power in the investment management industry is shifting to the money holders from money managers, driven by several major economic, social and political trends.</p>
<p>Collectively, these are irresistible forces meeting a moveable object: the traditional asset management industry structure. Below are five key trends impacting the investment management industry.</p>
<h2>A new group of underserved customers</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/women-as-the-next-wave-of-growth-in-us-wealth-management">Women in the U.S. are expected to control as much as $30 trillion in assets</a> over the next three to five years, and <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/millennials-and-the-future-of-wealth-management/">millennials $20 trillion</a> by 2030. The new decision-makers will expect the industry to reflect better gender balance and be more accessible.</p>
<p>Women and millennials tend to invest differently than the past generation of older men. Millennials are both <a href="http://spectrem.com/Content/Millennial-Investors-Have-Greater-Concern-Over-Social-Responsibility.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more risk averse and more socially conscious</a> when selecting investments. In addition, because they came of age during the financial crisis, millennials have a negative perception of some of the traditionally dominant financial services companies. The change in the values of the investor base helps explains the popularity of ESG investing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244212" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244212" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2244212 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image1-1.png" alt="power is moving from money managers to money holders" width="990" height="583" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image1-1.png 990w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image1-1.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image1-1.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image1-1.png?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image1-1.png?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image1-1.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244212" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BCG Center for Sensing and Mining the Future</p></div></p>
<p>Additionally, allocators are becoming a lot less tolerant and unwilling to turn a blind eye toward toxic cultures of sexual harassment and discrimination, which have been tolerated at some largely male-led investment managers for years. Our view is that as the culture and preferences of allocators change, so will their investment criteria and the tolerance for bad behavior.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			VCs tout our industry as frontier technology investors, but many of us are using the same infrastructure tools we have used for the past 20+ years.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Millennials are, “inherently distrustful of authority so the traditional financial adviser model is not going to work for them,&#8221; said Suzanne Ley, formerly head of financial institutions at Westpac. &#8220;They demand complete transparency in all aspects of their life, so hidden/opaque fees structures are not going to be tolerated. They also have a high propensity to move jobs more frequently than past generations, so the portability of financial assets is going to be very important going forward,&#8221; she added.</p>
<h2>Geopolitical risk leads to capital flight</h2>
<p>Political volatility is not good for savers and allocators, as it tends to destroy asset value. The new cold war between the U.S. and China is ideological in part, but it is also in large part about technology dominance and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The new cold war has only increased the movement of capital to regions of relative stability. The fear of totalitarian regimes or anarchy in China, Russia, the Middle East and South America has millions of well-educated and wealthy citizens looking to protect themselves and their nest eggs. We are seeing the first net private capital outflows in emerging markets due to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emerging-markets-flows-idUSKBN26M5Q6">&#8220;risk-off&#8221; sentiment</a> and risk of rising rates in the U.S. and Europe. Even though the economic outlook in the U.S. is negative and the COVID-19 response inadequate, the country remains relatively stable. Together with places like Switzerland, Singapore and the U.K., the U.S. remains an attractive safe haven.</p>
<p>Pension funds and wealth management funds have a big opportunity in growing their footprint geographically. While traditional markets in Europe, the U.S. and Japan are saturated, India, for example, provides the perfect environment for the growth of a new wealth management industry. A combination of a strong middle and upper-middle class, well-educated professional class, a free-market economy and expansion of disposable wealth will drive demand for wealth management products, both in the institutional and retail spaces.</p>

We&#8217;re officially nearing the end of the year, and what a year it&#8217;s been. Despite the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, I think it&#8217;s pretty safe to say that this has been a watershed 365 days for the space industry.

<h2>Astra is heading to Cape Canaveral</h2>
<p>Fresh on the heels of its first successful launch to orbit, space startup Astra is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/astra-will-launch-a-rocket-from-cape-canaveral-in-florida-for-the-first-time-in-january/">heading to the Space Coast</a>. The company said it would carry CubeSats for NASA for its first mission to take place outside of Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska on Kodiak Island. The launch, which is scheduled for January, will fly as part of a Venture Class Launch Services program contract Astra won last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244782" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a big win for the company. Multiple launch locations means Astra can finally demonstrate one of its key value propositions: that its on-site launch operations are agile, lightweight and can be effectively deployed from a number of sites. The Florida location will also give the company access to more orbits &#8212; which means being able to serve even more customers.</p>

<h2>Ursa Major wants to disrupt the vertically integrated rocket launch sector</h2>
<p>Ursa Major is scaling up its ambitions to disrupt the vertically integrated launch sector with a fresh round of funding. The company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/ursa-major-raises-85m-to-disrupt-the-vertically-integrated-launch-sector/">an $85 million Series C</a> led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, as well as participation from XN, Alsop Louie, Alpha Edison, Dolby Family Ventures, KCK, Space Capital, Explorer 1, Harpoon Ventures and others.</p>
<p>The startup has already put its first product into production, a 5,000-pound thrust liquid oxygen and kerosene engine called Hadley, and it&#8217;s at work on the Ripley, the next-gen engine that’s 10 times more powerful than Hadley, with a 50,000-pound thrust.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO Joe Laurienti likened Ursa Major to a company like Intel, which is constantly innovating more powerful processors and outsourcing that expertise to brands like Dell and Lenovo. “We really like the notion that we are a technology development company, and the companies that are flying rockets today should not be flying the same engine that they architected for their rocket 10 years ago. That’s the paradigm we see in vertical integration.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In recent years, enterprise software companies have grown faster, and more valuable, than ever. Still, most startups never reach that kind of escape velocity, with many plodding along while their venture backers &#8212; who are returning to market more quickly and raising bigger funds &#8212; move on to newer, shinier objects.</p>
<p>The end result is many thousands of stranded companies with a limited number of options. One of these is to simply shut down. Another option for some companies is buy back their shares. A third option for some is sell to a private equity firm that is interested in potentially rolling up sub-scale properties or bolting a startup onto another asset. There is so much opportunity for PE firms, in fact, that according to the Financial Times, the software-focused buyout firm Thoma Bravo plans to raise up to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/456f2fd7-f868-4ea6-abd7-fce34e783333" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$35 billion </a>for its next fund.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, newer players are also getting in on the action. Among them is <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.camber.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camber Partners</a>, a San Francisco-based growth equity firm founded last year by investor Scott Irwin, long of the venture firm Rembrandt Venture Partners.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246838" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Camber is today taking the wraps off a $100 million debut fund that promises to either buy &#8212; or buy a majority stake in &#8212; stranded SaaS companies, reinvigorate them with its own in-house data science technology, then sell them within what would ideally be around five years or less.</p>
<p>Irwin says he founded Camber Partners largely out of aggravation with the current venture environment, which requires that startups scale up unnaturally fast in order for VCs to return the massive amounts of capital they&#8217;ve been raising in recent years.</p>
<p>He says he grew tired of &#8220;some of those adverse incentives&#8221; involved. As he puts it, &#8220;100% growth isn&#8217;t interesting; it&#8217;s gotta be 200%. Earning $100,000 a month isn&#8217;t interesting; it has to be a million. A good solid management team that&#8217;s going to learn over time and grow the business isn&#8217;t interesting. It&#8217;s instead, &#8216;How do we jump ahead faster and hire more experienced people?'&#8221;</p>
<p>VCs have seen some &#8220;awesome successes because of the model but &#8220;the failure rate is also way higher.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for Irwin&#8217;s alternative, he says that helped by co-founder and serial operator Jason Hable, along with Scott Ernst, Camber&#8217;s VP of data and engineer, the young outfit is positioned with a data platform called Gemini to isolate companies across the globe with a specific profile, then help fuel their growth. Its targets should make a &#8220;well-loved product&#8221; that enjoys &#8220;strong, organic inbound&#8221; interest from potential customers; they should be generating between $3 million and $10 million in annual recurring revenue; and they will be looking to overcome an &#8220;under-optimized go-to-market&#8221; strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you feel like you haven&#8217;t fully realized the growth potential of the business, that&#8217;s a really good fit,&#8221; says Irwin.</p>
<p>Already Camber has backed two companies: Scout APM and SE Ranking. It spent $8 million to pick up a majority interest in Scout, which makes application performance software, along with a related business called ExceptionTrap.</p>
<p>It has not disclosed terms of its deal with SE Ranking, which makes SEO software, but Irwin says a typical investment will be &#8220;$10 million to $25 million checks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Altogether, Camber Partners expects to invest this first fund in six to seven companies.</p>
<p>As for exits, Irwin says he expects that they will look like typical SaaS exits, including sales (&#8220;full or partial&#8221;) to financial sponsors like Thoma Bravo or another active software investor, Vista Equity Partners. In some cases, if the stars align, he hopes initial public offerings will be in the cards.</p>
<p>Either way, &#8220;We don&#8217;t need 50 times our return,&#8221; says Irwin. &#8220;We try to get very aligned with a team that a $200 million exit can be life changing and a strong return for everyone involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not always an easy number to sell in today&#8217;s go-go market.</p>
<p>&#8220;The good thing about private equity interest in the space is that if investors want to accept it [a buyout proposal] and the management team wants to keep going, you can work that out,&#8221; says Irwin. &#8220;The challenge is when the investors are like, &#8216;Oh, yeah, $200 million just doesn&#8217;t move the needle for us. We&#8217;re not willing to accept that. You need to turn that down and go for a billion-dollar exit,&#8217; and then it turns out it&#8217;s a wipeout.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Monday, December 13! The theme of today is crypto, or web3 if you prefer that rebranding. Why? Because it turns out that an NFT project is making a game, a new startup wants to bring crypto and no-code together and there are several other bits of web3 startup news on our pages today.</p>
<p>Yes, we also have our normal run of funding rounds, unicorn exits and the like. But, strap in for some token talk! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246819" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/12/chinas-ai-giant-sensetime-postpones-ipo-after-us-blacklisting/">Chinese AI IPO on hold:</a> </strong>The SenseTime IPO was set to raise around $767 million in a Hong Kong listing. However, after finding itself on an American technology blacklist as of Friday, the IPO is on hold. As Didi looks to delist from the American markets, seeing such a high-profile Hong Kong debut on hold is not a great look for Chinese tech liquidity.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/bored-apes-shoots-for-the-moon/"><strong>Bored Ape Yacht Club game?</strong></a> If you aren’t a fan of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT series — I am not, for what it’s worth — you may not be hype to hear it, but there’s a game coming from the image collection. If this is a hit, expect many games to be built atop other NFT IP. Quickly, I wonder what the market size is for this game, given that there are only 10,000 images in the series.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/cma-microsoft-nuance/">UK taking look at Microsoft-Nuance deal:</a></strong> A $19.7 billion deal between Microsoft and “speech-to-text specialist Nuance,” as TechCrunch put it, has picked up regulatory scrutiny by a U.K. watchdog. This is the prelude to an investigation, it appears, but the fact that Microsoft is even getting a second look could chill other large buys by the megacorps of the technology world.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>A few themes are obvious today, including the startup exit market and crypto. We’ll take those on first, and then close with the rest of the startup news of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Exits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/what-2021s-ipo-pops-tell-us-about-future-flotations-and-spacs/">So much for that IPO pop:</a> </strong>A number of 2020 and 2021 IPOs had super strong first-day performances and early trading gains. This led to much complaining that tech offerings were being mispriced on purpose, to the benefit of banking customers. Well, we took a look back, and the numbers with a little time are far less clear than they once seemed.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/walmart-supported-symbotic-set-to-go-public-via-softbank-spac/"><strong>Robot company Symbotics to go public via SPAC:</strong></a> After securing greater commitment from huge American retailer Walmart, Symbotics has decided to pursue a public listing via a SPAC, or blank-check company. Notably the deal will see the robot firm link with Softbank Investment Advisers’ SVF Investment Corp. 3.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/harley-davidsons-ev-motorcycle-unit-livewire-to-go-public-via-spac/"><strong>E-motorcycle company LiveWire to go public via a SPAC:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Have you ever heard the pneumonia-rattle of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle? Well, it turns out that the company <em>also</em> makes electric bikes. Who knew! The deal, per TechCrunch, will allow Harley to hold onto a good stake in the company while also injecting capital into the business. We’re just glad that the company is making bikes that don’t sound like their engines are filled with used dentures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And then, crypto: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/gary-vaynerchuk-mark-cuban-web3-thirdweb/"><strong>Thirdweb raises $5M for the union of crypto and no-code:</strong></a><strong> </strong>What Thirdweb is doing sounds cool. TechCrunch reports that the company’s software helps “developers build, launch and manage their web3 projects without writing any lines of code.” Anything that makes tech more generally accessible is fine by us, including, yes, crypto.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/justin-kan-debuts-fractal-a-solana-based-marketplace-for-gaming-nfts/"><strong>Fractal is an gaming NFT marketplace built on Sol</strong><strong>ana:</strong></a> Did that make sense to you? If not, let me help. Fractal is a company that is building a market to sell gaming-related non-fungible tokens on the Solana blockchain, which rivals Ethereum and Bitcoin. How does gaming come into the speculative world of NFTs? Well, there are now play-to-earn games out there, where players are rewarded with NFTs instead of, say, internet points. So you can trade those on Fractal, I suppose.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/crypto-giant-dapper-labs-takes-its-next-shot-with-genies-nft-platform-the-warehouse/"><strong>NBA Top Shot takes another shot:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Dapper Labs became known as the team behind the NBA Top Shot NFT series that was hot a while back. Now the company — worth some $7.6 billion — is back with its next product called The Warehouse. I can’t really improve on what our own Lucas Matney wrote, so here it is: The Warehouse is “an ambitious NFT storefront that the startups hope will serve as a hub for web3 digital identity, allowing users to create animated avatars and outfit them with crypto accessories.” As with all crypto projects, I have no idea if this is going to be a hit or a flop.</li>
</ul>

But now the company’s former head in the country, Manish Maheshwari, is “leaving the firm to launch an edtech startup, according to nine people familiar with the matter.” Something to keep an eye on.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/snaplogic-raises-165m-at-a-1b-valuation-to-help-enterprises-integrate-and-automate-their-disparate-apps-and-data/"><strong>SnapLogic now worth $1B:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The NFT world may get more headlines than enterprise software lately, but that hasn’t stopped the more staid parts of startupland from still doing business. SnapLogic is indicative of that fact, raising $165 million at a new, higher valuation. The new unicorn helps companies bringing their work into the digital realm connect their various data sources and workflows.</li>

<p>It&#8217;s notoriously difficult for software to mimic human conversation. Many chatbots are so inept, it makes one long for the days of <em>press 0 for an operator</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though chatbots are largely meant to handle simple customer service tasks, there is an opportunity to scale both customer service and sales messaging,&#8221; writes Raghu Ravinutala, CEO and co-founder of Yellow.ai, a conversational CX platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nike is taking a plunge deeper into the world of crypto collectibles, announcing that they&#8217;re acquiring the NFT studio RTFKT (pronounced &#8220;artifact&#8221;).</p>
<p>The acquisition announcement comes at an opportune time for the studio; RTFKT is currently behind one of the most talked-about NFT project drops of the month &#8212; a sweeping avatar partnership with artist Takashi Murakami called CloneX. Since its initial drop less than three weeks ago, the project has already seen nearly $65 million in transaction volume according to crypto tracker <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/rtfkt-clonex-mintvial/sales/summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoSlam</a>.</p>
<p>Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The startup raised an $8 million seed round back in May led by Andreessen Horowitz that valued the company at $33.3 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246884" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“This is a unique opportunity to build the RTFKT brand and we are excited to benefit from Nike’s foundational strength and expertise to build the communities we love,” RTFKT co-founder Benoit Pagotto said in a statement.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Adidas announced a partnership with NFT project Bored Apes Yacht Club.</p>
<p>In addition to building out its own NFT drops, RTFKT had collaborated with other crypto creators to design items like physical shoes that utilized imagery in other NFT projects, including CryptoPunks and Bored Apes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A women-led startup called <a href="https://joinhoneycomb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honeycomb</a> is launching its private social app for families, backed by $4 million in seed funding led by Peter Boyce at Stellation Capital. Now out of private beta, the app offers families a way to curate and share their favorite moments and memories via their smartphone as an alternative to using a more public social media platform, like Facebook, or group texting, where photos and videos can be easily lost.</p>
<p>Of note, Honeycomb is the first startup Boyce is backing with his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/peter-boyce-stellation-capital/">new firm, Stellation Capital,</a> founded this year after he left General Catalyst. Other participants in the round include <a href="https://www.dcm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DCM</a> (Kyle Lui), <a href="https://www.blingcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bling Capital</a> (Ben Ling) and <a href="https://precursorvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Precursor Ventures</a> (Charles Hudson), as well as angels including Ancestry CEO Deborah Liu, Giphy founder Alex Chung and Twitter VP of Engineering Nick Caldwell, formerly of Reddit.</p>
<p>Honeycomb itself was co-founded by CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelialin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amelia Lin</a>, previously of Udacity and Optimizely, and former Instagram product manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolewee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicole Wee</a>. The co-founders had been inspired to create an app that would connect families through private social networking, but had originally approached this with a different product, called Saga. Their first app was a social audio experience that let families <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/turn-grandmas-memories-into-a-podcast-with-the-saga-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capture and record their life stories</a> &#8212; like tales about how the grandparents first met, for example, or even just birthday wishes for a child that can be listened to later, as a sort of audio diary.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246783" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But while that app received <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnscottlewinski/2020/05/17/new-saga-app-lets-users-record-their-covid-18-tales-for-future-use/?sh=60a2b2d968ae">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/california-live/new-holiday-tech-toys-for-all-ages/2482335/">of</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/turn-grandmas-memories-into-a-podcast-with-the-saga-app/">early</a> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/11/24/11-tech-tools-to-bring-joy-2020-holidays/6386052002/">press</a>, it wasn&#8217;t necessarily what families wanted. Instead, the team kept hearing from early adopters how they wanted to store their photos and videos, too, not just audio recordings. So the team pivoted and <a href="https://medium.com/joinhoneycomb/introducing-honeycomb-94395b5950f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranded their app as Honeycomb</a> this past fall.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246837" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246837" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2246837" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246837" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Honeycomb</p></div></p>
<p>The new experience launched into private beta testing in September, offering a way for families to save their favorite photos and videos, which are combined with text and turned into a digital story of sorts. The experience as it stands today isn&#8217;t necessarily that much more robust compared with a group chat over iMessage, for instance, but it does offer an easy way to go back to revisit older shares which can be difficult to do when using text messaging. It also lets users set a reminder so they&#8217;ll remember to curate their favorite memories from the day &#8212; a feature that&#8217;s probably best for new parents who rapidly fill their phones with dozens of new photos daily as their baby hits new milestones.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246835" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246835" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2246835" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246835" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Honeycomb</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We help it become a really easy daily ritual of sorting through the best memories of the day,&#8221; explains Lin. &#8220;You pick your favorites and they automatically get compiled into this story that&#8217;s not only shared with your family, but also saved in this collection forever,&#8221; she says. However, she notes, the experience is not meant to replace users&#8217; existing photo services, like Google Photos, Apple&#8217;s Photos app or Dropbox, where people back up and save all their content &#8212; including duplicate photos and those that didn&#8217;t quite turn out well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think of that as being the curated, beautiful place that I interact with my family,&#8221; Lin says. &#8220;And then [users may have] Facebook and Instagram, but that feels really public to put my baby photos out on.&#8221; Honeycomb, by comparison, is private by default.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only your family gets to choose who is in here, and I do think that is a pretty different philosophical approach,&#8221; says Lin. Plus, she notes, &#8220;we don&#8217;t sell your photos or your data to third parties.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246834" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246834" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2246834" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-4.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-4.jpg 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-4.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-4.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-4.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-4.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-4.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-4.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-4.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246834" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Honeycomb</p></div></p>
<p>Honeycomb is also different from mainstream social apps because it will be a subscription-based service, not one that&#8217;s monetized through advertising. For now, however, the app is free as the startup gets the new app off the ground.</p>
<p>The company is working to address how to include the family&#8217;s elder users into the platform, which may include adding support for exporting its content to be shared elsewhere. But the team thinks that the draw of new baby and kid photos may be the push grandma or grandpa needs to figure out how to put the app on their phone &#8212; even if they&#8217;re not technically savvy.</p>
<p>After users download Honeycomb they&#8217;ll first gain access to a basic set of features. But soon, they&#8217;ll be opted into the new beta, which includes a more engaging story format for sharing memories with family and friends. (This opt-in won&#8217;t happen immediately, but is now rolling out, the company clarifies.)</p>
<p>The idea to return to human curation, not AI, to help users find their best photos and videos is certainly a different idea these days. But whether or not people want to sort through their daily snaps &#8212; especially after that &#8220;new baby&#8221; buzz wears off &#8212; remains to be seen.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246832" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246832" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2246832" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246832" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Honeycomb</p></div></p>
<p>Besides, AI can be useful. (Presumably, a smart AI would have known to feature a photo of a person, not a toy, as the cover photo after I made a birthday photo album in the app). AI can also help users automatically sort through photos by discarding those with poor lighting or bad exposure.</p>
<p>What users don&#8217;t want, generally, is having an AI have the final say on their &#8220;best&#8221; photos or putting together albums without any context about their lives and what they think is important. And they don&#8217;t want AI reminding them through automated &#8220;memories&#8221; of times they&#8217;d rather forget.</p>
<p>The best solution, however, may be a balance between AI and manual curation, but done in a private, social environment.</p>
<p>Because Honeycomb is effectively a new app, the startup isn&#8217;t sharing user figures. But Lin notes that engagement tripled since pivoting from Saga.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honeycomb is a truly mission-driven company, using technology to advance one of our most basic and long-standing human desires: to archive and share our family’s memories,&#8221; said Stellation&#8217;s Peter Boyce about his investment in the startup. &#8220;Honeycomb has the potential to bring the family album into the 21st century. It’s rare to find such a large problem space that is ripe for a step-function change in innovation. Families are ready for the next evolution of social apps, one that is meant to be personal and intimate, and this team is building it,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Honeycomb, now a team of seven, is planning to use the new funds for hiring, including engineers, who will work in-person from its San Mateo office space. It expects to add around 10 people.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Climate change is the issue of our time. From policymakers to the individual, every one of us has a responsibility to do our part to ensure that sustainability and green practices are implemented throughout society.</p>
<p>Indeed, governments across the world, from the U.S. to China, are increasingly taking a proactive stance on climate change, with<a href="https://ukcop26.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> COP26</a>, the recent 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, serving as a driving impetus toward the goals of the<a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement#:~:text=The%20Paris%20Agreement%20is%20a,compared%20to%20pre%2Dindustrial%20levels." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Paris Agreement</a> in inspiring climate action.</p>
<p>Corporations are also stepping forward to take greater responsibility, with many investors no longer considering financial performance alone a sufficient measure of success — ESG measures, i.e., negative externalities, are increasingly taken into account to determine the true value of business activity for society.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246517" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In this context, the process of revitalizing our financial infrastructure is increasingly under the spotlight. How well do Bitcoin and other digital assets meet ESG criteria? This question has become ever more important as crypto adoption reaches wider audiences. Multiple<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/22/valkyrie-bitcoin-futures-etf-starts-trading-joining-fray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Bitcoin futures ETFs have now been approved</a> and are trading in the U.S., while institutional adoption is also reaching new highs, with many of the world’s largest financial institutions, including<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/02/stanchart-unit-to-launch-cryptocurrency-trading-platform.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Standard Chartered</a>,<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/state-street-is-creating-a-dedicated-cryptocurrency-division.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> State Street</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d90ed3bf-2c8d-46c9-98b7-67859f6598e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citibank</a> quietly building capabilities in the space.</p>
<p>Growing regulatory clarity is also enabling a broader range of participants globally to accelerate their strategies for digital assets. The EU’s comprehensive <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-crypto-assets-1">Market in Crypto-assets (MiCA) framework</a> continues to move through the legislative process in the European Parliament. While in the U.S., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3HRyPxXtoo&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gary Gensler’s Securities and Exchange Commission</a> has also signaled its intent to clarify a framework for stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>
<p>For digital assets to truly cement their place in the mainstream and the portfolios of investors across the globe, they must be subject to the same rigorous ESG standards that every government and corporation should now address. Significantly, the industry has gradually come to terms with this need and has ramped up a process of environmental self-regulation in response to rising adoption.</p>
<p>Organizations such as the <a href="https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Mining Council</a> are working to increase transparency in the industry through higher reporting standards. Many crypto-native organizations are also joining the <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord</a>, committing to achieve net-zero emissions from electricity consumption associated with crypto-related operations by 2030.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yet, for all this activity, perhaps the single greatest contribution to the energy efficiency of digital assets has been a decision entirely out of the control of the industry. In May, China’s State Council banned cryptocurrency mining and trading. Previously the global stronghold for crypto mining activity, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/50acdea5-cad1-4f39-8e6a-9be7ab78485d">with 44% of the global share of Bitcoin mining hashrate</a>, the decision prompted an exodus of miners to other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The move has been a significant one for the energy efficiency of the Bitcoin mining industry, moving away from the coal-heavy energy production of the Chinese economy to more renewable forms of energy in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>North America has been the big beneficiary of this move, with the U.S. share of mining hashrate increasing from <a href="https://cbeci.org/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17% in April to 35% in August</a>. With the addition of a 9.5% mining hashrate in Canada, North America now dominates the global mining hashrate with close to 50% of the global supply.</p>
<p>While energy production in the U.S. is diverse across states, the shift has been a significant boon to the sustainability of Bitcoin mining. The U.S. is replete with renewable energy sources; add to the mix the fact that large mining companies are essentially competing in a low-margin industry, where the primary variable cost is energy, and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/us-beats-china-as-the-number-one-destination-for-bitcoin-miners.html">incentive is to migrate to the cheapest sources of power &#8212; which are largely renewable</a>.</p>
<p>For example, New York &#8212; one of the states with the largest share of Bitcoin hashrate, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/09/war-to-attract-bitcoin-miners-pits-texas-against-new-york-kentucky.html">according to data from Foundry USA</a> &#8212; draws a third of its in-state energy generation from renewable sources. Texas, another significant state for Bitcoin mining hashrate, is rapidly growing its share of renewable energy production, with <a href="https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/2020/august/ercot.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20% of its power</a> coming from wind in 2019.</p>
<p>In addition, the Bitcoin mining industry has a unique feature set that actually incentivizes the use of trapped sources of renewable energy that are not yet connected to the national grid. By acting as a means of monetizing the production of renewable energy, mining can thus further accelerate the building out of renewable energy capabilities.</p>
<p>This shift toward renewable energy sources has already begun to demonstrate to critics that Bitcoin and the wider digital asset industry can succeed with an ethos of sustainability. Such a transition will not be an instantaneous one, and it will take time for large mining operations to reestablish themselves in new jurisdictions. However, this transition is firmly underway.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to digital asset service providers to demonstrate the value that crypto provides is worth its consumption of energy. Significant progress has been made this year alone in reducing the carbon footprint of digital assets, and as crypto continues its sustainability journey, corporate and institutional adoption will follow suit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.whymwallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whym</a>, a conversational commerce startup founded by former Snap employees, wants to make it easier for consumers to shop online via their mobile devices. Instead of filling out long checkout forms and entering in payment card details by hand, Whym&#8217;s solution offers a single-tap checkout experience where customers can pay via Apple Pay or Google Pay or even over a text message. The startup is now announcing $4.3 million in new seed funding, following its early traction with CPG, wellness and beauty brands.</p>
<p>The round was led by Deciens Capital and included participation from DNX Ventures, Reciprocal Ventures, Unusual Ventures, Chaos Ventures and Magic Fund, as well as small investments from Sequoia, Lightspeed and Canaan Partners. Whym also has angel investments from founders and other executives from Stripe, PayPal, Venmo, Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Snapchat, Uber, Airbnb, Red Bull and Spotify.</p>
<p>The startup itself was founded in 2017 by CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellynyland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelly Nyland</a> and COO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rheneebartlett/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhenee Bartlett</a>, both previously of Snap. Nyland had headed up the consumer products and marketing division of the company, where she created the go-to-market strategy for Snap&#8217;s Spectacles. Bartlett had served as the head of event marketing and partnerships for Spectacles. In addition, founding team member and Whym&#8217;s VP of Engineering, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhornberger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Hornberger</a>, had worked at Snap after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/16/snapchat-emails-not-so-ephemeral/">acquired</a> his startup Scan, Inc., which formed the basis for Snapchat&#8217;s Snapcode.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246600" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2246753" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246753" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2246753" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246753" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Whym</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While at Snap, Nyland saw how the DM (direct messaging) screen drove Snapchat&#8217;s daily usage. She proposed that the company allow brands and consumers to communicate with each other directly through that part of the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realized through that journey that messaging was going to become a really important part of social shopping in the future,&#8221; Nyland explains.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whym&#8217;s team realized that combining messaging and commerce into a new experience where transactions could take place over a text or even a DM thread could enable a new form of social shopping. Its first product, launched into beta in June 2018, offered brands a way to let their customers &#8220;reply to buy&#8221; over a text message.</p>
<p>In the years since, Whym has expanded to offer brands a micro-storefront solution that can be paired with their current texting campaigns, allowing customers to shop a product or small set of products and their variations &#8212; like colors or sizes, for example &#8212; then immediately check out. Brands can also promote their links in other places across social media and messaging apps, like &#8220;link in bio&#8221; solutions, swipe-ups (now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/instagram-rolls-out-the-ability-for-all-users-to-share-links-in-stories-via-link-stickers/">link stickers on Instagram</a>), messaging apps and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246746" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246746" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2246746" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="567" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png?resize=768,640 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png?resize=680,567 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246746" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Whym</p></div></p>
<p>As a consumer, the solution is designed to be quicker and easier than clicking through to a traditional mobile website to check out. Instead, they&#8217;re sent to the micro-storefront to customize their cart, then can tap on Apple Pay or Google Pay to complete the sale. The company also still offers its original experience that lets customers check out over text, but will soon use consumers&#8217; mobile phone numbers in a new way, too. Starting next year, consumers will be able to enter their phone number to signal their interest in a product they may want to buy in the future, as an alternative to sending themselves a website link or taking a screenshot as many do today.</p>
<p>Over time, Whym will be able to offer consumers a universal cart where they can purchase items across brands. It will also enable brands to reach out to their customers again when it&#8217;s time to repurchase.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up and coming direct-to-consumer brands, beauty, wellness, and CPG are our main focus,&#8221; notes Nyland. &#8220;We focus on businesses that have a high repurchase cadence. What Whym can do is actually rebuild each of those customers&#8217; carts one-to-one and do a reply-to-buy repurchase experience for those brands,&#8221; she says. &#8220;So we can harness the power of text message on the backend to power repurchase experiences between brands and consumers automatically.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup today has a couple of hundred <a href="https://www.whymwallet.com/shopper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brands</a> using its service, and charges a 3% + 10¢ transaction fee on each order. Now that the company is scaling upmarket to brands between $50 million and $250 million in annual GMV (gross merchandise volume), it&#8217;s beginning to offer tiered pricing. But these rates aren&#8217;t yet publicized.</p>
<p>Brand integrations with Whym take around 10 minutes on average, via its self-serve platform. In addition, the startup has a sales team that can demo the product and walk clients through onboarding and strategy, and aid with the creation of their first campaigns.</p>
<p>The startup, a team of under 50, plans to use the funding to reach more brands and further develop its roadmap of product features, many of which have come from customer feedback. To date, Whym has raised a total of $7 million in funding.</p>

The collections of 10,000 procedurally generated JPGs earning market caps of hundreds of millions at the hands of seemingly naked speculation have bewildered skeptics and enriched acolytes.</p>
<p>The promise for most of these projects has that, given enough money and community support, a culture and brand can emerge from the ether. Such has been the pitch of Bored Apes Yacht Club (BAYC), which has become the break-out NFT project of the year as more users have raced to buy the pictures of monkeys and sent floor prices soaring to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Part of that value has been centered on the belief that BAYC can become a cultural touchstone, and the group took a big step toward that goal today, announcing that they&#8217;ve partnered with blockchain gaming unicorn Animoca Brands to release a Bored Apes-themed game next year.</p>
<p>The game has an admittedly steep challenge ahead of it, building a mainstream game around a community with a prohibitively expensive barrier to entry. Weighing the exclusivity of the core NFT project with the democratization of assets needed to build up a substantial user base is a balance that has yet to be achieved, or even attempted, at scale.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246668" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s press release announcing the title had scant details to share other than that the game will feature so-called &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; mechanics and is targeting a Q2 2022 release date. Yuga Labs, the developer behind BAYC, has previously detailed that they are working on a token tied to the project.</p>
<p>In October, Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands raised $65 million at a $2.2 billion valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security teams around the globe are scrambling to fix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/apple-icloud-twitter-and-minecraft-vulnerable-to-ubiquitous-zero-day-exploit/">Log4Shell</a>, a critical security flaw in Log4j, an open source logging software that&#8217;s found practically everywhere from online games to enterprise software and cloud data centers. Its ubiquity has put the internet on high alert as attackers ramp up their efforts to target vulnerable systems.</p>
<p>Log4Shell is a zero-day vulnerability — named as such since affected organizations have zero days to patch their systems — that allows attackers to remotely run code on vulnerable servers running Log4j, which developers use to keep a record of what&#8217;s happening inside an application as it runs. The vulnerability is tracked as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2021-44228</a> and was given the maximum 10.0 severity rating, meaning attackers can remotely take full control of a vulnerable system over the internet without any interaction from the victim — and it doesn’t require much skill to pull it off.</p>
<p>Initial reports said exploitation of Log4Shell first began last Thursday, with Minecraft outed as Log4Shell&#8217;s first big-name victim. But security researchers at Cisco Talos and Cloudflare say they found evidence that Log4Shell was first exploited two weeks earlier. Talos said it first observed attacker activity related to the flaw on December 2, while Cloudflare said it observed a successful exploit a day earlier on December 1.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246602" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Earliest evidence we’ve found so far of #Log4j exploit is 2021-12-01 04:36:50 UTC,” Matthew Prince, Cloudflare co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1469800951351427073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>. “That suggests it was in the wild at least 9 days before [it was] publicly disclosed. However, don’t see evidence of mass exploitation until after public disclosure.”</p>
<h2>Who&#8217;s affected?</h2>
<p>Since the news of Log4Shell first broke, the growing number of victims suggests thousands of big-name companies and services are likely affected by the flaw. According to <a href="https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a GitHub list that’s being regularly updated</a>, Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Google, IBM, Tesla, Twitter and Steam are among the organizations impacted. Separately, VMware released an <a href="https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0028.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advisory</a> to warn customers that many of its products are affected, and Cisco has <a href="https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that some of its products are impacted by the flaw.</p>
<p>Many of these companies have been quick to act. Cloudflare tells TechCrunch that it has updated systems to prevent attacks and saw no evidence of exploitation, Microsoft said it had issued a software update for Minecraft users, and Valve has confirmed that it &#8220;immediately reviewed&#8221; its services and concluded that there are no risks to Steam associated.</p>
<p>Apple — whose iCloud service was vulnerable — <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/12/12/last-week-on-my-mac-when-the-internet-caught-fire/comment-page-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly patched</a> its cloud service, but did not respond to our request for comment. Researchers found that iCloud&#8217;s web interface was vulnerable on December 9 and December 10, but that the exploit no longer worked on December 11.</p>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation, which maintains the Log4j software, released an emergency security patch, as well as mitigation steps for those unable to update immediately. There are also a number of third-party mitigations available; Huntress Labs has created a <a href="https://log4shell.huntress.com/">free Log4Shell scanner</a> that companies can use to assess their own systems, and Cybereason has released a Log4Shell “vaccine&#8221; that is<a href="https://github.com/Cybereason/Logout4Shell" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> available on GitHub</a> on free.</p>
<h2>How bad is the flaw?</h2>
<p>As the number of companies and services impacted by Log4Shell grows, so does the number of attacks exploiting the vulnerability. In a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/">blog post</a> over the weekend, Microsoft said it has “observed activities including installing coin miners, Cobalt Strike to enable credential theft and lateral movement, and exfiltrating data from compromised systems.”</p>
<p>Security firm Kryptos Logic also said on Sunday that it detected more than 10,000 different IP addresses probing the internet, which is 100-times the number of systems that were probing for Log4Shell on Friday.</p>
<p>Cado Security has also seen an increase in active exploitation. Speaking to TechCrunch, the company said that on December 11, there were a number of Mirai botnet activities exploiting Log4Shell, as well as Mushtik activity from a number of IP ranges. The company said it believes that, based on the typical chain of events for exploits, “there is a very strong likelihood of targeted ransomware attacks stemming from Log4Shell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the wide-ranging nature of Log4Shell, and the likelihood that ransomware will follow, this is likely the calm before the storm. Patching or mitigating the vulnerability should be at the top of every security team&#8217;s priority list.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.unique.ch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unique</a>, a video calls platform that uses AI to teach sales teams how to improve their pitches, has closed a $6 million seed round from a bunch of angel investors. These include Philipp Stauffer (U.S based founder and general partner of Fyrfly Venture Partners) and Daniel Gutenberg.</p>
<p>Unique uses AI to analyse customer conversations. The video recordings of these then help sales people work out which parts of their pitch work best.</p>
<p>It can do this in 12 languages, including tough ones like Swiss German. The upside, says the company, is that this can reduce the time to train salespeople and improve their performance. It will also capture key moments of the sales video call that are securely shared in a “Deal Room” in one place that buyers can refer back to and share with their own teams.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246676" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company was founded by serial entrepreneurs Manuel Grenacher and Andreas Hauri, following their own experiences of building and guiding a sales team at Coresystems, a B2B SaaS startup they previously sold to SAP.</p>
<p>Grenacher said: “With remote and hybrid working here to stay, sales teams are often far away from their customers, prospects, and from their own colleagues and team leaders. This makes it difficult for them to connect with customers and to learn from their team, to get feedback and to ramp up. We are building Unique to reinvent the sales process, using AI to analyse conversations to light up key moments of insight and connection to help sales teams and customers build deeper, more productive relationships.”</p>
<p>Philipp Stauffer, investor, said: “The intersection of the sales force automation and the conversational intelligence markets will see itself catapulted ahead both in terms of buying priority at Fortune500 companies as well as growth rates. The value creation opportunity to enhance sales outcomes is simply massive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unique competes with the likes of Gong.io and People.AI, (both unicorns). Where the startup may have an edge, however is with its &#8220;Deal Room&#8221; approach, plus the fact it’s built in Europe and therefore complies with strict GDPR privacy regulations. It may also eat into Zoom&#8217;s market as well, if sales teams start using it more than the latter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Poland&#8217;s competition watchdog is the latest to investigate Apple over policy changes to its mobile platform that impact how third-party apps can track iOS users by requiring they request permission before they can grab data.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Poland&#8217;s competition watchdog is the latest to investigate Apple over policy changes to its mobile platform that impact how third-party apps can track iOS users by requiring they request permission before they can grab data.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) <a href="https://www.uokik.gov.pl/news.php?news_id=18092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said today</a> that it&#8217;s opened an investigation into changes to how Apple&#8217;s mobile platform operates in relation to the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature that requires app developers to ask iOS users for permission to track them for ad targeting.</p>
<p>Apple has been contacted for comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246575" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The tech giant announced ATT back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-ios-14-ad-tracking/">summer last year</a> &#8212; launching it, after some delay and ongoing advertiser objections, with iOS 14.5 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In practice, this means that Apple has significantly reduced the ability of third-party apps to obtain personal data on iOS in order to send personalised ads,&#8221; the UOKiK writes in a press announcement of the probe. &#8220;However, this does not mean that users&#8217; information is no longer being collected and that they do not receive personalised ads. At the same time, doubts have arisen as to whether the rules established by Apple were not designed to promote their own advertising service, Apple Search Ads, which could be a violation of competition principles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The actions of digital giants are a challenge for antitrust authorities all around the world,&#8221; added Tomasz Chróstny, the president of UOKiK, in a statement<em>. &#8220;</em>During the course of our investigation, we want to examine whether Apple&#8217;s actions may be aimed at eliminating competitors in the market for personalised advertising services, the objective being to better sell their own service. We will investigate whether this is a case of exclusionary abuse of market power.&#8221;</p>
<p>France&#8217;s competition watchdog already took at look at ATT, following advertiser complaints.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/frances-competition-authority-declines-to-block-apples-opt-in-consent-for-ios-app-tracking/">earlier this year</a>, France&#8217;s Autorité de la concurrence declined to block Apple&#8217;s launch of ATT &#8212; saying, back in March, that it did not consider the introduction of the feature to be an abuse of a dominant position.</p>
<p>Although the Autorité said it would continue investigating the policy change &#8212; specifically saying it wanted to check whether Apple was applying less restrictive rules for its own apps versus third-party developers&#8217; ads (which appears to be a key part of the concern driving UOKiK&#8217;s probe).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gznIL5MQxK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/frances-competition-authority-declines-to-block-apples-opt-in-consent-for-ios-app-tracking/">France&#8217;s competition authority declines to block Apple&#8217;s opt-in consent for iOS app tracking</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;France&#8217;s competition authority declines to block Apple&#8217;s opt-in consent for iOS app tracking&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/frances-competition-authority-declines-to-block-apples-opt-in-consent-for-ios-app-tracking/embed/#?secret=gznIL5MQxK" data-secret="gznIL5MQxK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Cupertino has been accused of hypocrisy by advertisers who pointed to earlier defaults on iOS opting users into Apple&#8217;s own tracking-based ads versus the new requirement that third parties must ask for permission.</p>
<p>Back in October, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/074b881f-a931-4986-888e-2ac53e286b9d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FT</a> also reported that the switch had created what it described as &#8220;a windfall&#8221; for Apple, suggesting the company&#8217;s advertising business has more than tripled its market share in the six months after it introduced the changes that obstructed rivals from targeting ads at users. (Although it&#8217;s worth noting that Apple&#8217;s Search Ads comprise only a tiny fraction of the entire mobile ad market, so 3x of a tiny amount is still very small beer.)</p>
<p>Also noteworthy: In iOS 15, Apple quietly changed its earlier default that had opted iOS users into receiving its own personalized ads, as <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/02/apple-personalized-ads-targeting-ios-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9to5Mac</a> reported in September &#8212; when it started prompting users for their consent to its ad targeting, bringing it more in line with its policy mandate that third parties must request user permission to track.</p>
<p>Although &#8212; again important to note &#8212; iOS users have always been able to switch off tracking for Apple&#8217;s ads via their device settings, unlike some third-party apps (like Facebook) that offer users no choice over ad tracking at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting element of the Polish investigation is &#8212; therefore &#8212; not the question of whether Apple is playing fair but its observation that ATT &#8220;does not mean that users&#8217; information is no longer being collected and that they do not receive personalised ads&#8221;. Although the probe sounds more narrowly focused on whether or not Apple is self-preferencing. (We&#8217;ve reached out to the UOKiK with questions about its investigation and will update this report if the regulator responds.)</p>
<p>A <a href="https://blog.lockdownprivacy.com/2021/09/22/study-effectiveness-of-apples-app-tracking-transparency.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> of ATT&#8217;s &#8220;effectiveness&#8221; at stopping third-party tracking, carried out by an ad blocker called Lockdown Privacy and published this fall, questioned whether the feature creates merely &#8220;an illusion of privacy&#8221;, given the researchers found no difference in the total number of active third-party trackers; and what they described as &#8220;a minimal impact&#8221; on the total number of third-party tracking connection attempts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We further confirmed that detailed personal or device data was being sent to trackers in almost all cases,&#8221; the study also concluded.</p>
<p>Whether increased transparency should lead to a reduction of tracking scripts &#8212; and therefore whether that&#8217;s a good way to measure ATT&#8217;s &#8220;efficiency&#8221; &#8212; is one question to ponder.</p>
<p>Another is how the market may be shifting in response to platform flexes like ATT &#8212; or, well, <em>pretending</em> to shift.</p>
<p>Last week, another report in the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/69396795-f6e1-4624-95d8-121e4e5d7839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FT</a> suggested Apple might have reached what the newspaper described as a &#8220;quiet truce&#8221; with advertisers &#8212; claiming it was loosely interpreting the ATT policy to continue to allow third parties to collect reams of personal data, so long as the data they gobbled up is &#8220;anonymised and aggregated rather than tied to specific user profiles&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thing is, the adtech industry has a long history of making bogus claims of anonymization. While an unholy host of faceless adtech entities have spawned and proliferated in the space by trading and &#8220;syncing&#8221; user data with each other &#8212; to undermine people&#8217;s privacy and erode their ability to protect themselves from tracking exactly by re-identifying individuals (via their devices, ad IDs, cookie data etc., etc.) so they can continue the lucrative business of building profiles to target individuals with ads.</p>
<p>So whether suggestions by a handful of major advertisers cited in the FT article &#8212; including Snap and Facebook &#8212; that they&#8217;re shifting their ad targeting efforts to &#8220;cohort&#8221;-based advertising would survive careful scrutiny of what actually gets done with any in-flows of &#8220;aggregated&#8221; iOS user data remains to be seen. (And may indeed require regulatory oversight &#8212; such as through legislative proposals like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Europe&#8217;s Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act</a> &#8212; actually doing the due diligence.)</p>
<p>Ad giant Google has also &#8212; in recent years &#8212; been pressing for the industry to switch to cohort-based targeting &#8212; which it claims is better for privacy, even as its suggested &#8220;federated learning of cohorts&#8221; (aka FloCs) tech would do nothing to prevent vulnerable groups being selected for targeted manipulation. (Indeed, some critics of Google&#8217;s proposal suggest it will actually make predatory targeting worse.)</p>
<p>In the U.K., Google&#8217;s self-styled &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221; plan has attracted close regulatory interest.</p>
<p>It is currently being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">overseen by the U.K.&#8217;s competition watchdog</a> &#8212; which has said it wants to ensure that the market-shifting changes are implemented in a way that&#8217;s both fair to advertisers and Google competitors <em>and also</em> not terrible for user privacy (although oversight of the latter piece is handed off to the U.K.&#8217;s ICO, which has a reputation for roundly failing to enforce against any of the adtech industry&#8217;s myriad privacy breaches, so&#8230; ).</p>
<p>All of this is to say that the (power) balancing act is real. But also that regional regulation is far more muscular on the antitrust side than it has <em>ever been</em> in standing up for privacy and data protection &#8212; which risks an unbalanced outcome where adtech versus privacy is concerned. So the stakes for users remain eye-wateringly high.</p>
<p>The European Union, meanwhile, has been a bit of a bystander on this front.</p>
<p>It has its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">active antitrust case ongoing against Apple</a> &#8212; related to rules it applies to its App Store. However the Commission&#8217;s complaint is narrowly focused on the music streaming market, so only on concerns that Apple is potentially distorting competition in that specific segment.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s antitrust division <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/apple-pay-and-ios-app-store-under-formal-antitrust-probe-in-europe/">has its eye on Apple Pay</a> too &#8212; but, so far, the Commission hasn&#8217;t taken action in relation to ATT &#8212; which leaves national competition regulators across the bloc, such as Poland&#8217;s UOKiK and France&#8217;s Autorité de la concurrence free to pursue probes if they believe concern is merited.</p>
<p>The Commission did finally open a formal probe of Google&#8217;s adtech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">this summer</a> &#8212; which includes scrutiny of its Sandbox proposal. But it&#8217;s fair to say the EU&#8217;s executive has lagged behind on adtech scrutiny and interventions. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">As have gatekeeping national data protection regulators</a>.)</p>
<p>So a lack of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power/">joined up thinking</a> at a national level &#8212; between Europe&#8217;s competition enforcers and privacy regulators &#8212; could risk putting chilling limits on even the (limited) pro-privacy changes that a powerful platform-operating company like Apple can bring in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Our Notus algorithm identified you as the most impactful journalist for our audience.”</p>
<p>As a slight narcissist &#8212; as all writers are &#8212; I saw this line in a cold email and had two immediate thoughts: first, is the founder just saying this because they want me to write about their funding round, and second, how in the world did my name come up?</p>
<p>So, I hopped on the phone with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ybel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yuliya Bel</a>, the co-founder of <a href="https://getnotus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notus</a>, an early-stage startup that wants to help other companies identify the best journalists and influencers to work with, based on a deep scan of the social web.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246579" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ask any marketing folk and they’ll tell you about the term “earned growth,” otherwise known as the exposure that companies get naturally through other media, whether it be a podcast shout-out or heck, even a mention in this article. With that background, Bel and her co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stormtv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Storm</a>&#8216;s vision &#8212; to make companies be better at speaking to their target audience through external media &#8212; made a lot of sense. </span></p>
<p>For their fundraising announcement, Bel said that Notus first decided what the goal outcome was: tell the story of the company to data engineers and designers for eventual recruitment purposes. Then, the company began identifying different startups they think have done a good job at building networks and gaining media attention. Finally, it looked for reporters that have the most impact and are most relevant to those audiences.</p>
<p>While Bel wouldn&#8217;t share more on how she defines impact and relevance, I think it prioritizes how certain, public-facing people speak and engage on topics via Twitter (the company’s goal is to be cross-platform eventually). She said that Notus eventually found my name because I co-host <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/equity-podcast/">Equity</a>, a thrice-weekly podcast about tech and startup news.</p>
<p>This process still didn’t feel entirely clear, so I asked for more information about Notus’s algorithm. All Bel shared is that the startup analyzes an audience by looking at the interactions of their audience members, through retweets, mentions, likes, replies and more on Twitter. The algorithm then produces “a list of trending voices” for brands to explore and filter. Within the private beta, Notus has analyzed 182 million Tweets and 129 million interactions for its insights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The entrepreneur explained how one of Notus’ partners, who is well known in tech and venture capital, is trying to expand awareness of them to different demographics. “They start by picking a company or a person that already has market penetration with the target audiences they want to get in front of, and then use Notus to analyze the audiences and understand the creators and voices that they engage with,” she explained.</p>
<p>It’s not all about reaching out to fintech folks on Twitter with the most followers. The co-founder said the startup also amplifies folks “who may not have the largest audience, but they’re fanatically evangelizing this product&#8230;those are the people that you want to empower to continue to post more things but also give them more ways to create more content,” she said. “For example, giving them an exclusive look as they grow the company public; or having a VIP experience for power users.”</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s biggest challenge long-term will be around proving outcomes. Bel explained how brands &#8220;can&#8217;t create a cult-like following by buying ads.&#8221; But can they by paying a third-party platform, like Notus, to show them who is worth making a connection with? Some may think that the future needs to be organic, while others could see how more data can lead to compounded influence.</p>
<p>As you figure out where you stand, Notus has already convinced a slew of investors to pour money into the ambitious vision. The startup confirmed that Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s 776 recently led a $1.25 million round, with participation of angels from Glossier and Tesla.</p>
<p>Ohanian spoke in a statement about the importance of software, even with a goal as amorphous as influence.</p>
<p>“As the internet unbundled media, influence fragmented, so Notus is the only way a brand can understand, reach and grow their audience,&#8221; he said.</p>
