										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.stepzen.com/">StepZen</a> stepped onto the scene at the end of last year with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/stepzen-snares-8m-seed-to-build-data-integration-api/">an $8 million seed round</a> and a vision for unifying APIs. Today that vision came into clearer focus as the company announced two new free GraphQL tools to help simplify API management.</p>
<p>StepZen CEO and co-founder Anant Jhingran sees the graph as part of what he calls &#8220;a fundamental transformation that&#8217;s taking place in how applications communicate with the back end.&#8221; As companies use increasing numbers of APIs to build software and connect systems, StepZen wants the graph to be at the center of API management where it handles all of the various connections and dependencies between these APIs.</p>
<p>There is inherent complexity involved in crossing multiple applications to pull together all of the information about something that has interconnections. As an example, a company may want to pull all of the information about a customer together, but it lives in multiple systems. How do you see the connections between customer information, interaction data and previous orders. One of those comes from the CRM, one from marketing and customer service tools and one from an order management system.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238578" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What StepZen wants to do is simplify the act of making those connections. &#8220;The fundamental thing is that while there are individual sub-elements, the use cases really connect the dots because that&#8217;s where the real power of the business [lies],&#8221; Jhingran explained.</p>
<p>To help with that, the company is releasing two free tools today. The first is GraphQL Studio, which helps companies create a map or flow that shows the connections between the various APIs your company uses, whether internal private ones or the public SaaS variety.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is not the case that developers only deal with private API&#8217;s. It&#8217;s not the case that developers only deal with SaaS API&#8217;s. And what we want to do is to enable both sides of the story, and our GraphQL Studio is really starting from &#8216;here are your pre-finished API&#8217;s&#8217; that you&#8217;re going to kind of pick and choose and then add your own secret sauce,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The second piece is GraphQL Federation, a tool that can take the various graphs inside an organization and can consolidate them into a single graph of graphs that lets companies see how the various pieces fit together. Being able to federate these small graphs has been a real challenge that StepZen wants to solve with this tool.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, the idea is that in a team of teams, there&#8217;s no one graph, and therefore when you look at how applications consume data, they&#8217;ve got to connect across multiple graphs and get to a unified graph. And that&#8217;s what GraphQL Federation does,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He says that the company is offering both tools for free as a starting point for developers to build connections between various APIs, and as they move into more complex use cases, they can sign up for StepZen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once people start using the tools, some of them will say, &#8216;we need to kind of modify it a bit, or we need to add our own private data,&#8217; and that&#8217;s where we want people to sign up for StepZen, but we want people to succeed on this without even signing up.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Looking for the soundtrack from your favorite Netflix show? Now, it will be easier to find thanks to an expanded <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-23/get-even-more-squid-game-bridgerton-and-money-heist-with-our-new-netflix-collaboration-and-dedicated-hub/">partnership</a> between Netflix and Spotify. The streaming music service today introduced a new &#8220;Netflix Hub&#8221; on its app, which will offer a centralized place for finding the official soundtracks, playlists, and podcasts for top shows and movies on Netflix.</p>
<p>At launch, the Netflix Hub offers soundtracks and playlists from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXc3KPAjGyPdm">Stranger Things</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX44eggCvVygr?si=f9b67c3380de47c7">La Casa De Papel</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6lVCyaFY768wM8Xea6gTta?si=55b9325882e54b39">Narcos: Mexico</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7ahCzrtmSSap5KaeI7dJco?si=eb6b189ada23400d">Outer Banks</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3LUdxlF9Gq90Jcd9Y24ZH8?si=ou_w_CrmRuOFRgudYbT9ig&amp;dl_branch=1&amp;nd=1">Squid Game</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4d1XaejoQ5r4jdkV8k5SNJ?si=ILrT_4EBRjKTy7LTvRHRrA">tick, tick&#8230;Boom!</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX5Hl0iWtr5b3">Bridgerton</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/539jKDvQomLMWGBEkjyTWX?si=Mov_a7zMTxqb_iA2GeuTlw&amp;nd=1">Cowboy Bebop</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZWf7hUnPGOw">Virgin River</a>,  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX1R30zLwU9ZL">On My Block</a>, and others.</p>
<p>It will also include Netflix-tied podcasts, like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1v65XLQM0QVsAk1rZlpE7y?si=NoboZsnQSqOfPxWjgNz0tw&amp;dl_branch=1">Okay, Now Listen</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0e2HFBiiGl9hMjZsk4WIvW?si=TM8_sJAMTKqu85foBw_pUQ&amp;dl_branch=1">Netflix Is A Daily Joke</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/490u5TbLKuI10Bh98nTRim?si=mn2eHojwRUq_PzBVco0AWw&amp;dl_branch=1">10/10 Would Recommend</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3hDsTlBt1o1qIizN8phRzO">You Can&#8217;t Make This Up</a>, and those that delve into popular shows, like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3a2j3rZCG7cT7yVdHFrMr4?si=bCQ-kT3wREeszYgv3h6f6w&amp;dl_branch=1">The Crown: The Official Podcast</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/netflix-netflix_podcasts">Behind the Scenes: Shadow and Bone</a>, and more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238577" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Other music and fan experiences will be a part of the new destination as well, including an enhanced <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6IgPnyVYfHg?si=5ee0263deb8b4a4d">album</a> for the Netflix Western film, &#8220;The Harder They Fall,&#8221; which offers fans a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the soundtrack led by Jay-Z. In addition, there&#8217;s a content destination for &#8220;La Casa De Papel (Money Heist),&#8221; Part 5 Volume 2, and <a href="http://www.lacasadepapel.withspotify/">a character matching experience</a> where fans get to play a game to find out which &#8220;La Casa De Papel&#8221; character they are &#8211;which feels a bit like a playing a BuzzFeed quiz.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238615" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238615" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2238615" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SpotifyxNetflix_Hub.jpg?w=580" alt="" width="580" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SpotifyxNetflix_Hub.jpg 580w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SpotifyxNetflix_Hub.jpg?resize=145,150 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SpotifyxNetflix_Hub.jpg?resize=290,300 290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SpotifyxNetflix_Hub.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SpotifyxNetflix_Hub.jpg?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238615" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify/Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>The hub builds on Spotify and Netflix&#8217;s existing partnership, Spotify tells TechCrunch. The two companies have worked together on many official playlists, including most recently, the enhanced album for &#8220;The Harder They Fall,&#8221; which had been available before the Hub&#8217;s debut. They also had worked on the &#8220;Money Heist&#8221; content experience and the character-matching game ahead of today&#8217;s news.</p>
<p>Netflix didn&#8217;t purchase access to have a hub on Spotify&#8217;s app. In other words, it&#8217;s not an ad product, nor did any money exchange hands here. Instead, both companies see the potential in working together to serve their respective fan bases, where there&#8217;s naturally a lot of overlap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Netflix is not the only major company to debut a thematic &#8220;hub&#8221; on Spotify&#8217;s app. Recently, Spotify and Peleton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/spotify-partners-with-peloton-to-launch-new-playlists-featured-in-its-workout-hub/">announced a similar partnership</a> that introduced a &#8220;Curated by Peloton&#8221; Workout Hub featuring playlists from Peloton instructors. And outside its app, Spotify earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/spotify-partners-with-giphy-to-connect-users-with-artists-music-via-gifs/">partnered</a> with GIPHY to introduce users to music via artists&#8217; GIFs.</p>
<p>Making some of this Netflix content exclusive to Spotify may make sense for the streamer as the other large music and podcast provider on the market, Apple (via Apple Music and Apple Podcasts), is also now a Netflix competitor through its Apple TV+ streaming service. Spotify, at least as of yet, hasn&#8217;t expanded into Netflix&#8217;s core market, which makes them better suited as partners.</p>
<p>Spotify says that it plans to roll out more exclusive content to the Netflix Hub in the months ahead.</p>
<p>The Netflix Hub will available to all users, both Free and Premium, in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., Ireland, and India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than six months after raising a $157 million Series D round, AI-powered transcription and captioning platform <a href="https://verbit.ai/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Verbit</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> announced today it has closed $250 million </span>in a Series E round that values the company at $2 billion.<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> The latest funding brings its total raised to over $550 million.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new capital was led by <a href="https://www.thirdpointventures.com/">Third Point Ventures</a>, with participation from existing investors Sapphire Ventures, More Capital, Disruptive AI, Vertex Growth, 40North, Samsung Next and TCP.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup will use the proceeds to invest in product development and continue its vertical and geographical expansion, CEO and founder of Verbit <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-livne-a039b365/">Tom Livne</a> said, adding that it will also double down its acquisition strategy. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238498" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Verbit is a step closer to its planned IPO in the near future after closing the Series E, Livne said when asked regarding its listing plan.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Verbit was founded in 2017 by Tom Livne, who previously had a career in law. Livne often found himself dissatisfied with the slow turnaround time of transcriptions but did not have the tools as a lawyer to tackle the issue head-on. He founded the AI-powered transcription and captioning platform startup: AI-driven automated transcription services coupled with professional transcribers. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Verbit raises $31M Series B to expand its transcription and captioning service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/verbit-raises-31m-series-b-to-expand-its-transcription-and-captioning-service/embed/#?secret=bbersIvVLg" data-secret="bbersIvVLg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The transcription industry, which is estimated at around $30 billion, is very fragmented, with many small mom-and-pop companies. The market is ready for consolidation, Livne told TechCrunch via email. In May, Verbit has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/verbit-announces-acquisition-of-vitac-to-become-worlds-largest-ai-powered-transcription-and-captioning-platform-301288819.html">completed its second acquisition</a>, <a href="https://vitac.com/">VITAC</a>, for $50 million, Livne added. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Verbit, as the leading platform, aims to be this consolidator with more than 1,000 targets in our pipeline,” Livne said. </span></p>
<p>Verbit&#8217;s automated speech recognition (ASR) technology platform offers customers word-for-word, interactive and collaborative transcripts and captions.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What makes Verbit’s platform unique is that it harnesses the power of both artificial and human intelligence to provide vertical-specific transcription and captioning, building solutions that fit each industry, Livne continued. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Since our AI is trained based on the vertical and customer at hand, our platform can build custom models that improve over time. It means Verbit’s customers in the legal, education, media and enterprises sectors. Each has access to transcripts and captions that comply with their unique, industry-specific regulations and standards, such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and SOC II compliance,” Livne said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another major differentiator is that its model uses machine learning and natural language processing (NPL) to achieve over 99% accuracy with a turnaround time that is ten times faster than the industry standard, according to Livne. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Verbit serves more than 2,000 customers across the media, education, corporate, legal and government sector. Its clients include CNN, Fox, Disney, Coursera, Stanford, Harvard University, Amazon, Microsoft and AT&amp;T, Livne noted. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company is growing rapidly with 6x year-over-year revenue growth and over $100 million in annual recurring revenue, Livne continued. The company is also cash efficient and has a high customer retention rate of 163%, which are important metrics of trust by its customers, he added. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company competes with <a href="https://www.rev.com/">Rev.com</a> and <a href="https://www.3playmedia.com/">3Play Media</a> in the transcription space, he noted. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Verbit, which has a strong presence in the UK and Australia, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">plans to expand further into Europe, including Germany, France, Spain, and others, Livne said. Those countries are compelling because Verbit sees a substantial amount of inbound interest, he added.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The market opportunity is tremendous and, given our position as an industry leader, we can penetrate these markets quickly,” Livne said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Verbit has over 470 employees based in New York, Colorado, Pittsburgh, Palo Alto, Canada, Tel Aviv and Kyiv, 35,000 freelancer transcribers and 600 professional captioners globally. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“This funding round is a vote of confidence in our ability to solidify our position as the market leader within the transcription space,” said Livne. “We built a powerful technological platform to modernize this industry and our strategy to build vertically integrated, voice AI solutions has brought tremendous value to our customers and enabled their businesses to become more accessible.” </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Verbit is a special company combining exceptional technology-driven organic and inorganic growth in the transcription marketplace,” said managing partner at Third Point Ventures Rober Schwartz, who will join Verbit’s board of directors. “It’s rare to encounter such a large, fragmented market ripe for digital transformation and simultaneous consolidation.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://suborbital.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suborbital</a>, the company behind the open source <a href="https://github.com/suborbital/atmo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atmo</a> WebAssembly-centric project for building scalable server applications, today announced that it has raised a $1.6 million seed round led by Amplify Partners. A number of angel investors, including Jason Warner (former CTO of GitHub), Sri Viswanath (CTO of Atlassian), Tyler McMullen (CTO of Fastly), Jonathan Beri (founder of Golioth), Vijay Gill (SVP of engineering at RapidAPI) and Mac Reddin (founder of Commsor), also joined this round.</p>
<p>In addition, the company also today announced the public beta launch of <a href="https://suborbital.dev/compute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suborbital Compute</a>. At first glance, this may seem like somewhat of an odd product. As SaaS services look to make their products extensible beyond basic drag-and-drop integrations, they need tools that allow developers to write these extensions inside of their products. But these user functions open up a lot of security issues, too. With Suborbital Compute, SaaS developers can give their end-users the ability to write their own functions and extend their products, with the sandboxing properties of WebAssembly &#8212; the basis of Atmos and Suborbital&#8217;s other open source tools &#8212; providing many of the guardrails.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s just the start. Suborbital is nothing if not an ambitious project. Its mission, CEO and founder Connor Hicks told me, is to &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">the way we as an industry think about and deploy compute.&#8221; Hicks previously worked on the 1Password platform team, where he worked on tools like the 1Password command-line interface and its enterprise products, eventually leading the company&#8217;s R&amp;D efforts around its enterprise products. But on the side, he started dabbling in building a distributed functions-as-a-service system, first based on Docker, which proved to be too slow, and then, eventually, around WebAssemly. That turned out to be more complicated than he expected, in large part because he had to write all of the glue code to make this work &#8212; but about two years ago, things started to click into place.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238412" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I started going down this path a little more seriously, started spending more time on it, and what came out of it was this scheduler for WebAssembly functions, which today is our <a href="https://github.com/suborbital/reactr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reactr project</a>,&#8221; Hicks explained. While Reactr is a Go library, people started getting interested in seeing what a pure WebAssembly service would look like, which became the Atmo project that is now at the core of Suborbital&#8217;s efforts.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The grand experiment with Atmo was, &#8216;hey, let&#8217;s see if we can take a declarative description of a web server application and figure out how to run it without the user needing to do any boilerplate,&#8221; Hicks explained. &#8220;So we could take this declarative description &#8212; and a bunch of functions &#8212; compile the WebAssembly and we could figure out how to build this web service and make it run, and make it secure, and make it fast automatically, and the user didn&#8217;t have to worry about any of the plumbing.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Atmo, Suborbital is betting on server-side WebAssembly to allow developers to write code in a language like Rust, Swift or AssemblyScript, which is then compiled to WebAssembly and <a href="https://atmo.suborbital.dev/more-info/background" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployed and managed</a> by Atmo and run in a sandboxed environment. At the core of Atmo is a scheduler that runs the WebAssembly modules and promises to do so with near-native performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, Hicks believes, this approach could challenge the role of containers for deploying many applications, especially at the edge. &#8220;We think that WebAssembly on bare metal is going to pretty much replace the need for containers in these small, resource-constrained edge environments,&#8221; Hicks said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why then launch with such a niche product? Something like an &#8220;Atmo Pro&#8221; may seem like the more logical choice, but Hicks argues that it is still too early for that. Because the idea is still very new, the market wouldn&#8217;t have been there for a service like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t have the widespread adoption that you would need to make money off of a hosted Atmo service,&#8221; Hicks said.&#8221;After realizing that I couldn&#8217;t just make money selling a pro version of Atmo &#8212; or a hosted version of Atmo &#8212; I went back and I asked, &#8216;hey, what could we actually build that people would want to pay money for and actually build a business around?'&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Hicks tells me that the team, which currently consists of four people, has already started to ramp up its efforts around partnerships, but next year, it plans to really scale up its infrastructure and operations capabilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India plans to introduce, evaluate, and enforce a bill to prohibit &#8220;all private cryptocurrencies&#8221; in the country, according to a legislative agenda for the winter session.</p>
<p>The Indian government said Tuesday evening that the proposed law will allow &#8220;certain exceptions&#8221; to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.</p>
<p>The bill &#8212; called Cryptocurrency &amp; Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2021 &#8212; will also create a &#8220;facilitative framework&#8221; for the creation of the official digital currency for the country, the legislative agenda adds.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238593" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lawmakers in India have been discussing risks of cryptocurrency trading and trialing a government digital currency for some time. But the country is yet to have a legislation to oversee the space.</p>
<p>An increasingly growing number of Indians, many of whom have never invested in the stock market or anything else, have started to trade cryptocurrencies in recent quarters, prompting concerns among some that they might end up losing their money.</p>
<p>In the meantime, local cryptocurrency exchanges have reported growing volumes of transactions and userbase and raised capital from high-profile investors. CoinDCX, backed by B Capital, and CoinSwitch Kuber, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a16z-coinbase-coinswitch-kuber-first-india-investment/">backed by a16z and Coinbase Ventures</a>, became unicorns this year.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and several other lawmakers as well as several industry stakeholders met as recently as earlier this month to discuss the space and some of the recent developments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Many lawmakers expressed concerns about the nature of ads carried by cryptocurrency exchanges. A consensus was reached in that meeting that these &#8220;irresponsible advertisements&#8221;, that promised wild profits to consumers by investing in crypto, were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/13/india-eyes-prohibiting-irresponsible-cryptocurrency-ads/">misleading youths in the nation and must be stopped</a>, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p>
<p>Several Bollywood stars including legendary Amitabh Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana and Ranveer Singh, who have starred in several of the country’s biggest blockbusters, have promoted cryptocurrency trading in TV and newspaper ads.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have also expressed concerns around potential misuse of using crypto trading vehicles for laundering money and financing terrorism efforts.</p>
<p>Shaktikanta Das, Governor of the central bank Reserve Bank of India, said last week that the country needs to have much deeper discussions on the issue of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the central bank says that we have serious concerns from the point of view of macroeconomic and financial stability, there are far deeper issues involved,&#8221; Das said at an event. &#8220;I&#8217;m yet to see serious, well-informed discussions in the public space on these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>This is breaking news. More to follow shortly&#8230;</em></p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">You’ve likely heard of the “creator economy” already — it’s no longer a new concept, although some people are more acquainted with what it entails than others. But the creator economy needs creators. It says so right there on the label.</p>
<p>Essentially, what we call the creator economy encompasses two groups. The first is a large, decentralized and amorphous group of predominantly independent creatives connected to the digital sphere in one way or another. This includes musicians, visual artists, filmmakers, graphic designers, bloggers and influencers. The second is the companies and platforms that provide the tools that enable this creation, and, by extension, distribution and monetization.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237890" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the creator economy’s business side is fundamentally digital, and thus the domain of the tech industry. This has made it easier than ever for independent creators to make a living through their work.</p>
<p>It has also, rather remarkably, kick-started the long overdue unraveling of the superstar model — the old-school way of doing entertainment business in which a small cohort of famous stars made content for everyone, and that was it. That’s not to say subcultures haven’t flourished for decades — they have — but they’ve never made the bulk of the cash.</p>
<p>The creator economy and creator tech sprung up relatively organically. The shift was initially enabled by virality and audience access through newfangled social media channels, but creator tech is now a world unto itself. As such, its very survival depends on the continuation of this slide away from the superstar model.</p>
<h2>Kicking holes into the superstar model</h2>
<p>In a July 16 letter to shareholders, Netflix <a href="https://qz.com/1881983/netflix-says-tiktok-is-now-a-major-competitor/">acknowledged</a> TikTok as a real competitor, going so far as to note its “astounding” growth. One could even argue that Netflix’s initial begrudging acknowledgment of TikTok’s competitive edge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/netflixs-latest-experiment-is-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">happened last year</a> when the platform launched Fast Laughs, a copycat video feed with short clips culled from its comedy catalog.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regardless, Netflix has long hitched its wagon to superstars: Zac Efron travels the globe, Paris Hilton cooks, every household-name comedian has at least one special, and original movies and series net the likes of Timothée Chalamet, Jane Fonda, Sandra Oh and Anthony Hopkins, to name but a few. It’s the old guard.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the biggest stars on TikTok are not “stars” at all, but regular people who happened to be funny or clever or incisive and garnered an audience based on the luck of the algorithm and their creativity alone. They’re not names everyone knows, but many creators have found their niche and a dedicated following. They’re the new guard, and they’re siphoning off precious attention and viewership.</p>
<p>There are no “tentpoles” in the creator economy, a term used to describe a given studio’s big-budget blockbuster that does so well it secures the financial health of the studio itself. This also applies to major labels: Most albums hardly recoup the costs required to make them, but then Adele comes along, drops a record, and pays for all those records that didn’t recoup and then some.</p>
<p>Not so in the creator economy. Yes, TikTok has minted its own type of stars like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@khaby.lame?">Khaby Lame</a>, whose hilarious exasperation at overcomplicated life hacks catapulted him to global fame — <a href="https://twitter.com/Meta/status/1454499897151934464?s=20">he’s now shilling for Meta</a>.</p>
<p>But people who follow Khaby Lame don’t open the app, watch his latest video, then close it. (The algorithm is specifically designed so you don’t do this, but that’s a different story.) They also follow any number of smaller creators <em>in addition to</em> those stars, and the majority of the videos they watch are just statistically bound to be made by creators who are not internationally famous.</p>
<p>Smaller creators finding niche success and devoted audiences are changing everything, and creator tech is rising to meet their needs in real time. This is where creator welfare comes in — and why sustaining it must be paramount.</p>
<h2>Good ethics = good business</h2>
<p>It’s easy to frame the creator payment question as a purely ethical one. But that’s a well-trod argument. Obviously, artists should be paid well for their work. So let’s look at it a different way.</p>
<p>For creator economy tech platforms, fair compensation for smaller creators must be the heart of our business models. Doing so is crucial to our sustainability as platforms and companies. It shores up demand for our platforms by drawing creators to our platforms and retaining them.</p>
<p>It’s also realistic. It’s not the &#8217;90s, and there are no tentpoles in this game. Creator tech needs creator numbers. Large numbers of small creators form the very demand that creator tech relies on.</p>
<p>Creator tech must go all-in on supporting smaller creators. Without supporting small creators and fair payouts, and without continually improving platforms that connect creators to sponsorship and patronage opportunities, all the progress made against the superstar model will be for naught. Creator tech will shoot itself in the foot.</p>
<p>Business plans in which shareholders reap returns that dwarf those of the creators themselves are neither admirable nor sustainable, particularly in a climate with so much audience demand and willingness to pay. Algorithms that punish content creators for taking a day off are ridiculous and need to go. It’s high time for an overhaul of these models and the companies that use them.</p>
<p>Creator tech should continue to embrace and innovate on modern patronage. Creator tech is already fostering a competitive market of patron platforms that cater to specific creators’ needs and, in certain cases, connect brands with creators for profitable partnerships.</p>
<p>Substack is changing the game for freelance writers. Patreon bills itself as ideal for creators of all types, but it’s the unofficial go-to for podcasters. The platforms offering the most &#8212; the most money, the most visibility, the most opportunities, the most accessibility &#8212; will win.</p>
<p>Continued innovation in terms of licensing, distribution and blockchain certification is as good for artist welfare as it will be for the companies that enable these innovations. How can art auction platforms migrate beyond the legacy galleries and toward the people? Digital music, footage and image licensing is only accelerating and represents an important link within the creator economy among, for instance, video content creators, photographers and songwriters.</p>
<p>In colder terms, there’s money to be made, and no one has to be exploited in the process.</p>
<h2>Investing in smaller creators is good for the economic gander</h2>
<p>In the age of the individual creator, creator tech’s responsibility to the creators themselves is as much an ethical position as it is one of self-preservation. (No creator tech without a full thriving ecosystem of smaller creators, to err on the side of the obvious.) The superstar economy is ceding ground to independent creators with dedicated followings scattered across platforms and mediums.</p>
<p>If the creator economy is to thrive, the creators must thrive first. Patrons must come from unexpected places and the bottom up. Audiences must be easier to access. Creator tech can’t take the lion’s share and leave pennies for the creators. In other words, creator tech’s success is inextricable from creator success.</p>
<p>Tech has a bad habit of thinking its fate isn’t tied up with that of its users. From a purely business standpoint, creator tech shouldn’t make this mistake. From an ethical one, it will be glad it didn’t.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel and tourism are slowly starting to move again in the wake of Covid-19 crashing over the world and sending us to shelter in place. Today a company focused on experiences &#8212; museum visits, skydiving, local cooking classes and more &#8212; is announcing a round of growth funding on the back of seeing its own business bounce back. <a href="https://www.peek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peek</a>, which provides both a marketplace for consumers to discover and book experiences, a platform for businesses to book team building and other internal events, and tech for tourism companies to digitize, manage and run their own experience businesses online &#8212; &#8220;like a Shopify for experiences,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Ruzwana Bashir said &#8212; has raised $80 million. It plans to use the funds to continue expanding its product, hiring more talent, and taking Peek to more places, after passing some $2 billion in bookings from some 35 million customers, mostly in North America.</p>
<p>The round, a Series C, is notable in part because of who is behind it: the funding is being led by WestCap &#8212; the investment firm founded by another major player in the business of travel, the former CFO of Airbnb, Laurence Tosi. New investor Goldman Sachs Asset Management is also in the round, along with 3L, Cathay Innovation, I2BF Global Ventures, Manta Ray and Apeiron. Other high profile past backers include Jack Dorsey, Eric Schmidt, and Kayak founder Paul English.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Peek is not disclosing its valuation, but Bashir told us the figure &#8220;has increased substantially because we grew the business a lot and hit profitability this year.&#8221; Peek has now raised over $100 million in the last 10 years.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238544" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Now that we are starting to invest again, we are going into investment mode,&#8221; she added. Worth pointing out, too, that this round was originally pitched to me as a $60 million investment, and then it grew by $20 million just days ago, which speaks also to the confidence investors currently have in the travel and tourism space.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a big shift from a year ago, when travel-related companies were regrouping and trying to figure out how to continue weathering what had turned out to be a very long storm. Many of them had gone into the summer of 2020 hopeful that the pandemic (which really kicked off earlier in the year) would have subsided and led to a wave of exuberant movement in the warmer months, only to find any bounce short-lived. One of the more well-capitalized of the travel experience startups &#8212; Berlin&#8217;s GetYourGuide, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/getyourguide-picks-up-484m-passes-25m-tickets-sold-through-its-tourism-activity-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at over $1 billion</a> just 6 months before Covid-19 first started appearing &#8212; found itself raising first a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/getyourguide-closes-133m-convertible-note-as-travel-startups-continue-to-weather-the-covid-19-storm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big convertible note</a>, and then a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/travel-startup-getyourguide-secures-97m-revolving-credit-facility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big credit facility</a>, as it shored up its business as the pandemic wore on.</p>
<p>Peek was also not immune. When Covid-19 hit, &#8220;it was pretty terrifying for us. We were growing great and then, all of the sudden, bookings crashed,&#8221; Bashir, who co-founded the company with Oskar Bruening (pictured, below) said. &#8220;We then did all the hard things.&#8221; That included Peek laying off 30% of its staff to help it get through the slump.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2238586" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="496" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg?resize=768,561 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg?resize=680,496 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />Peek also took to the offensive, thinking of how it could work differently with its customers on both sides of the business. With end users, it doubled down on virtual experiences (for example, online cooking classes); and rethinking and expanding who &#8220;customers&#8221; could be by building out experiences booking for corporate and internal events.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the real key sounds like how it rethought that it worked with experience providers, where it helped them get their own emergency loans, and it equipped them with the tools to work within the &#8220;new normal&#8221; by helping them shift to focusing more on local activities for local people rather than tourists; and providing them with more software and functionality to run those businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the operating system for those merchants,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2238589" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>It turned out to be the right move: it meant that as those businesses picked up in activity, so did Peek, which found itself turning profitable in the midst of the pandemic. Software currently accounts for &#8220;the majority&#8221; of Peek&#8217;s business, she said, although that could well change over the next year as consumer travel starts to rebound and that brings more activity to Peek&#8217;s own marketplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lot of opportunity, $1 trillion in gross merchandise value, and still a lot of businesses haven’t made the leap online,&#8221; he said. Many of the experiences customers were previously using pen, paper, phone calls, and managing through spreadsheets, she said, &#8220;but [now] you can’t connect with customers now before you connect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Activities that Peek covers range from wine tours and watersports to skydiving and art classes, while Peek Pro, as the B2B2C product is called, offers tech to enable online booking, point-of-sale services, and &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of automations covering things like inventory management, dynamic pricing, waivers, and marketing analytics. Peek says that it has &#8216;thousands&#8217; customers, including businesses like the Museum of Ice Cream, Color Factory, Artechouse (the experiential art venues) and Pennekamp State Park.</p>
<p>Some of those businesses, without a doubt, target younger adults and thus were already pretty digitally savvy to begin with, but more generally Bashir believes that Peek&#8217;s success in building B2B2C tech for experiences companies is part of the bigger trend in the world of business software specifically for offline businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;People underestimate what happened in offline. There was a leap forward in e-commerce,&#8221; she said of the story that&#8217;s often told about the impact Covid-19 had on businesses that were already online. But offline businesses were faced with needing to suddenly make what she calls &#8220;a ten-year leap&#8221; to catch up. Peek is part of the battalion of tech companies have rushed to fill that void for various other use cases, such as building software for restaurants, or building logistics or curbside pickup for brick-and-mortar retailers.</p>
<p>“We have been early adopters and investors in travel technology companies, and have been following Peek.com for years,” said Tosi of WestCap, in a statement. “Ruzwana Bashir is a dynamic leader and Peek.com’s unique approach has allowed them to serve millions of people. This is a transformative solution that will allow a wider audience of travelers and locals to have meaningful experiences, and for activity operators to grow their businesses.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin has announced its next human spaceflight: A six-person launch set for December 9. This is the first time that Blue Origin is flying a full complement of six passengers on its New Shepard reusable rocket and capsule, and the group going on this trip includes Good Morning America co-host Michael Strahan; rocket namesake Alan Shepard&#8217;s daughter Laura Shepard Churchley; Voyager Space CEO Dylan Taylor; Dick Holdings managing member Evan Dick; and father and child pair Lane Bess and Cameron Bess.</p>
<p>In keeping with Blue Origin&#8217;s penchant for notching historic firsts with its human spaceflight missions, this will be the first time a parent and child make the trip to space together. Lane Bess, the Principal and Fonder of Bess Ventures, will be accompanied by Cameron Bess, a content creator and software developer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238570" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238570" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2238570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="785" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg?resize=768,589 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg?resize=680,521 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2238570" class="wp-caption-text">Upper L to R: Lane Bess, Cameron Bess, Evan Dick; Lower L to R: Dylan Taylor, Laura Shepard Churchley, Michael Strahan</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238567" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This will be Blue Origin&#8217;s third human spaceflight ever, and also the third this year. New Shepard previously flew two crews of four people each, first with a manifest that included Blue Origin and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and then just in October it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-launches-4-person-crew-including-william-shatner-to-space/"> sent up William Shatner,</a> along with Blue Origin&#8217;s Audrey Powers, DCVC partner Chris Boshuizen, and Medidata co-founder Glen de Vries, who tragically passed away in an airplane accident just weeks later.</p>
<p>The pace that Blue Origin is hitting with these launches is impressive, especially given the likely price tags for each ticket. With six person flights, the company is likely improving its margins which may lead to slightly more affordable seats for those going up, but it&#8217;s still bound to be an extreme luxury.</p>
<p>Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard flies its passengers to the edge of space, staying sub-orbital but providing them with a few minutes of weightlessness and unparalleled views of Earth, before the capsule returns slowed by parachutes to a landing in the West Texas desert.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitrise is meant to support developers who are busy running processes rather than creating new value for customers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more of the world shifts to doing everything from their smartphones, the ability to build better iOS and Android apps has to move with it. <a href="https://www.bitrise.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitrise</a> aims to be the go-to company closing the gap between that mobile demand and a company’s ability to get apps out faster while also balancing all of the moving parts and complexities.</p>
<p>Today, mobile DevOps company Bitrise announced it secured $60 million in Series C funding, led by Insight Partners, with participation from existing investors Partech, Open Ocean, Lobito, Fiedler Capital and Y Combinator.</p>
<p>The remote-first company was co-founded by Barnabas Birmacher, Daniel Balla and Viktor Benei in October 2014. Between then and now, we reported on their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/bitrise-raises-3-2m-a-led-by-openocean-to-attack-the-complexity-of-building-apps/">$3.2 million Series A</a> round back in 2017, but it also raised <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190619005574/en/Bitrise-Raises-20M-Series-B-to-Transform-the-Way-You-Build-and-Operate-Mobile-Apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 million in Series B funding</a> in 2019. The new raise was planned and executed in a few weeks, bringing Bitrise’s total funding to nearly $100 million, CEO Birmacher told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Two years ago, the company, headquartered in Budapest, went through Y Combinator’s Growth Program to scale its company, and has now tripled its headcount and opened offices in London, San Francisco, Boston and Osaka.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bitrise raises $3.2M A led by OpenOcean to attack the complexity of building apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/bitrise-raises-3-2m-a-led-by-openocean-to-attack-the-complexity-of-building-apps/embed/#?secret=tz5W48c6kh" data-secret="tz5W48c6kh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Mobile made two or three years of advancement in the last 12 months,” Birmacher said. “This means companies have to use mobile to stay competitive, but how they are developing mobile is getting more complex.”</p>
<p>Developers are busy running processes so they can’t concentrate fully on creating new value for customers, he added.</p>
<p>Bitrise aims to create an end-to-end platform for mobile development that automates core workflows, shortens release cycles and provides better understanding of how new pieces of code will affect live apps before their release, so companies can focus on getting out the next big release to customers.</p>
<p>To date, the company has over 100,000 developers using it from more than 6,000 mobile organizations. It is doubling its revenue year over year and plans to increase its employees to 300 across its engineering, product, sales and growth teams.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to hiring, the new capital will enable Bitrise to expand its product so that developers can more easily operate in the continuous integration and delivery space and have better observability into the full DevOps lifecycle.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Josh Zelman, vice president at Insight Partners, will join Bitrise’s board, while Matt Koran, also vice president at Insight, will act as a board observer.</p>
<p>“Bitrise has been building towards the current moment in mobile since its launch eight years ago,” Zelman said in a written statement. “Mobile has become a primary means of communication, entertainment and commerce for people around the world, and Bitrise has enabled enterprises to keep up with mobile innovation at an ever-increasing pace. Bitrise was purpose-built for mobile, and the company has become a leader in the mobile DevOps space.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Klarna has doubled its customer base in the United States to over 21 million customers. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. consumers now have the choice to use Klarna’s “Pay Now” service to pay immediately and in full at any online retailer where Klarna is available.</p>
<p>This adds to the global retail bank, payments and shopping giant’s stateside offerings, where Klarna has doubled its customer base to more than 21 million customers.</p>
<p>In addition to Pay Now, Klarna will be introducing its Klarna Card to U.S. customers, which will enable them to make interest-free payments in four installments using a physical card format, either in stores or online. It works with the Klarna app and also can be added to Apple Pay and Google Pay.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238362" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>U.S. users were already able to use Klarna’s Express button for a seamless checkout, now live at Macy’s and Coach, and its subscription service, a first-of-its-kind tool for paying subscriptions and memberships in four, interest-free payments. Klarna works with over 250,000 retail partners.</p>
<p>Launching these services in the U.S. is a natural extension of what the company has already experienced in its other markets, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. For Klarna, Europe’s volume of Pay Now represents 50%, he added.</p>
<p>“We are super excited to launch a card in the U.S.,” he said. “As we have seen in other markets, we want people to use Klarna everywhere. Some will occasionally use Klarna on websites and the app, but when you give them a piece of plastic, they are also highly appreciative and people love it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though <a href="https://www.similartech.com/compare/klarna-vs-paypal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behind in market share</a> versus competitors like PayPal, Klarna’s approach as a way to pay online and its share of checkout is providing some competition. Merchants are telling Klarna that its share of checkout is steadily growing after being in the U.S. market for just two years, Siemiatkowski said.</p>
<p>“It feels like a good opportunity to give them a good challenge,” he added.</p>
<p>This latest offering follows a number of updates the company made recently, including <a href="https://www.klarna.com/us/blog/the-future-of-shopping-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releasing its super app</a> earlier this month to provide one app for the entire customer journey from discovery to returns.</p>
<p>And, in October, Klarna <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/klarna-travel-inspirock-acquisition/">acquired Inspirock</a>, an online trip planner using artificial intelligence and local expertise, to add a travel agent component for Klarna’s 90 million users.</p>
<p>While discussing the Inspirock acquisition, David Sandstrom, Klarna CMO, said the super app was an opportunity to bring capabilities seen in other countries, like China, to the Western world and connect a lot of pain points for consumers.</p>
<p>“With the app, we took a look at what more problems beyond payments could we do,” Sandstrom added. “Moving into the space, the online shopping journey is typically spread out to 20 different apps, one each for processes like discovery, payment and return management. The super app is a framework to launch features at mass scale. We can now continuously launch products into the app, and will eventually open it up to third parties.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Mosaic Foods is removing the "taste" excuse from trying plant-based foods by providing delicious frozen meals that come ready to eat.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mosaicfoods.com/">Mosaic Foods</a>, a plant-based food company, announced Tuesday $6 million in seed funding as it continues to develop more products.</p>
<p>The New York-based company came onto the food scene in 2019, co-founded by Matt Davis and Sam McIntire, with its line of frozen veggie bowls that includes recipes like peanut tofu bowl and butternut squash and sage pasta.</p>
<p>Prior to Mosaic, Davis, CEO, and McIntire, CRO, worked with each other at Bain Capital Ventures. They realized that to eat better and adopt a plant-based diet, it takes some work, especially to find flavorful dishes that won’t make you miss meat.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238089" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At the core of Mosaic Foods, the co-founders believe that we should all be eating more plants and less meat. However, the excuse they heard most often was lack of taste as a reason not to go plant-based.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238093" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238093" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2238093" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg" alt="Matt Davis, Sam McIntire, Mosaic Foods" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg 5287w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238093" class="wp-caption-text">Mosaic Foods co-founders Matt Davis and Sam McIntire. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mosaic Foods</p></div></p>
<p>“If we take the excuse out of eating more plants and make it delicious, people will look forward to eating more plants, and it will have a huge impact,” McIntire told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We want to make eating plant-based as easy as ordering takeout,” Davis added. “We ended up cooking our own favorite recipes, and the first six dishes came out of our own kitchen.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s how Mosaic works: choose a meal plan — eight or 12 meals, with the flexibility to skip or cancel; select from the breakfast, lunch and dinner options; you will receive the fast-frozen items to store in your freezer; and it comes with instructions for no chopping, cooking or cleanup. Meals cost, on average, $4.99 per serving.</p>
<p>Two years after launching, the company has gone from six to 50 products, grown 15 times in revenue, opened a 16,000-square-foot kitchen in New Jersey and expanded shipping to California. It has also expanded its product line to include oat bowls, soups and family meals, while also starting Mosaic+, a curated collection of meals created in partnership with top chefs and food personalities.</p>
<p>Gather Ventures led the seed round and was joined by Greycroft and Alleycorp. The latest investment brings Mosaic’s total funding to about $10 million.</p>
<p>“We knew working with Adam (Slutsky) would be going after a huge opportunity,” Davis said. “By raising capital, we would be able to affect more lives faster.”</p>

<p>Slutsky, co-founder of Moviefone, former CEO of Mimeo.com and former president of Tough Mudder, founded Gather in 2019 and only invests in plant-based companies.</p>
<p>The sector is a personal one for him — he was diagnosed with heart disease at 42 years old and had to change his diet. Slutsky’s investment strategy is very hands-on, so he invests in about four companies per year.</p>
<p>“I am a big believer in this as the world moved from convenience to now health, environment and other ethical issues,” he said. “If you can do it for a price point, it makes sense, and these guys are it.”</p>
<p>The company now has 30 employees and is covering approximately 50% of the country, mainly on the eastern seaboard (but most recently added California in July). It is also on track to hit 1 million meals sold by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to build on the team already in place, invest in infrastructure, which involves continuing to own and operate its own kitchens, and launch new products. The co-founders expect to be selling via other channels, in addition to DTC, by this time next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more companies adopt low-code/no-code tools to build their line-of-business applications, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that we are now seeing a new crop of services in this ecosystem that focus on keeping these tools secure. These include Tel Aviv-based <a href="https://zenity.io/">Zenity</a>, which is coming out of stealth today and announcing a $5 million seed funding round. The round was led by Vertex Ventures and UpWest. A number of angel investors, including the former CISO of Google, Gerhard Eschelbeck, and the former CIO of SuccessFactors, Tom Fisher, also participated in this round.</p>
<p>Zenity argues that as employees start building their own applications and adopt tools like robotic process automation (RPA), this new class of applications also opens up new avenues for potential breaches and ransomware attacks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238410" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238410" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2238410" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="75" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png 1147w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2238410" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zenity</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238381" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Companies are heavily adopting Low-Code/No-Code, without realizing the risks it employs nor their part in the shared responsibility model,&#8221; said Zenity co-founder and CEO Ben Kliger. &#8220;We empower CIOs and CISOs to seamlessly govern their Low-Code/No-Code applications and prevent unintentional data leaks, disturbance to business continuity, compliance risks or malicious breaches.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Zenity platform helps businesses build a catalog of low-code/no-code apps in their organization, mitigate potential issues and set up a governance policy for their organization that can then be automatically enforced. The company argues that the methods of traditional security services don&#8217;t transfer to low-code/no-code applications, yet the need for a tool like this is only growing, especially given that most of the developers that use don&#8217;t have a security background (or maybe any software development background at all).</p>
<p>The company was founded by CEO Kliger and CTO Michael Bargury, who both previously worked on the Azure and cloud security teams at Microsoft.</p>
<p>“The challenge is mitigating the risks and security threats associated with Low-Code/No- Code solutions without disturbing the business,” said Tom Fisher, Zenity advisor and former CIO of Oracle, Qualcomm, CTO of eBay. “Zenity provides the perfect combination of governance and security tools with a pro-business approach that helps business developers build with confidence.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Streetlogic wants to help e-bike riders have a safer experience on the road. The company announced a $2.1 million pre-seed raise, as well as the launch of its flagship product, a surround-view camera that can predict front, side and rear collisions and notify riders in order to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Starting Tuesday, customers in the U.S., Canada and Europe can pre-order Streetlogic&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) for e-bikes with a down payment of $30. The final retail price will be around $300 to $400, and the first batch of mass produced systems is expected for delivery by the end of 2022, according to Jonathan Denby, CEO and founder of Streetlogic. Customers based in San Francisco, where Streetlogic is based, will be eligible to try one of the systems sooner via a limited, invite-only beta deployment program beginning early next year.</p>
<p>Streetlogic isn&#8217;t the first to come up with a micromobility ADAS system. Last year, Israeli startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/ride-vision-raises-7m-for-its-ai-based-motorcycle-safety-system/">Ride Vision introduced a similar</a> AI-based system that analyzes traffic around a rider in real time, providing forward collision alerts, blind spot monitoring and warnings for riding too close behind another vehicle. Like Streetlogic, Ride Vision&#8217;s system can also just record the ride, acting as a dashcam that saves a record of safety incidents to review later.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238409" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>More recently, c<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">omputer vision companies like Luna or Drover AI have developed similar tech for e-scooters that&#8217;s operated by the likes of shared micromobility operators Voi and Spin, respectively. The technology here is similar, but the target markets are different.  </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The difference is that we are custom tailoring the vision system to give smart safety features to the riders, whereas they&#8217;re using the vision system to get the riders of scooters to play more nicely on city streets,&#8221; Denby told TechCrunch. &#8220;Their features are sidewalk detection or parking compliance features that the scooter operators need to show that they&#8217;re keeping riders playing nice. Ours is just all about safety of the rider themselves, like if you&#8217;re riding in traffic this gives you an early warning if there&#8217;s a car on a collision path with you so you can keep yourself safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other major difference is that Luna and Drover can connect to the scooter&#8217;s OS and take over, causing the rider to slow to a stop if they&#8217;re riding on sidewalks or inappropriately. Streetlogic&#8217;s product is strictly a collision warning system, but that can still be a very useful tool, especially in cities.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Advanced rider assistance systems: Tech spawned by the politics of micromobility&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/embed/#?secret=vd6PDyf7Lx" data-secret="vd6PDyf7Lx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;From a safety aspect, you don&#8217;t have eyes all around you at all times – you can&#8217;t, and when you&#8217;re going to work, it&#8217;s kind of like your retreat time, so you&#8217;re often thinking, or at least for me, I&#8217;m not thinking about safety. I&#8217;m just thinking about getting to work or all the things I have to do that day,&#8221; said Taylor, one of Streetlogic&#8217;s early beta testers who rides her e-bike to work everyday, in a <a href="https://www.streetlogic.ai/">testimonial on the company&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
<p>The number of preventable cyclist deaths in the U.S. <a href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/home-and-community/safety-topics/bicycle-deaths/">increased 6% in 2019 from 793 in 2010 to 1,089</a> in 2019, and of those <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/bicyclists">843 were killed in crashes with motor vehicles</a>. Even as e-bike sales soar, cars are still a threat to the adoption of micromobility in cities, where 78% of fatal cycling accidents happen. Consumers looking to replace their cars with e-bikes may want to ensure they&#8217;re riding something that has similar safety features, like an ADAS system.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have this utopian vision where I think the world would be great if there were more e-bikes on the roads and cities than cars, in general,&#8221; Denby told TechCrunch. &#8220;You need a few cars out there, but the majority can be bikes, so I think making your e-bike a more dependable tool in your daily life as your primary way to get around is the key to making that happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Streetlogic&#8217;s system, which is mounted to both the front and the rear of the bike, is based on computer vision done entirely on-device. It tracks the behaviors and movements of vehicles surrounding the rider, giving an early warning if the rider is on a potential collision path with a car. The processing and alerts are all done on a completely closed loop onboard system, so it doesn&#8217;t require any connectivity to the cloud and works even if the rider is in an area with no service.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238461" style="width: 988px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/POV-Alert-I.webp"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238461" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2238461" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/POV-Alert-I.webp" alt="POV of Streetlogic computer vision product that warns e-bike riders of potential car collisions" width="978" height="554" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/POV-Alert-I.webp 978w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/POV-Alert-I.webp?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/POV-Alert-I.webp?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/POV-Alert-I.webp?resize=768,435 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/POV-Alert-I.webp?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/POV-Alert-I.webp?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2238461" class="wp-caption-text">POV of Streetlogic computer vision product that warns e-bike riders of potential car collisions.</p></div></p>
<p>Riders will hear an audio warning first, which comes from the hardware itself and might say something like &#8220;car back&#8221; if a car is coming up quickly behind the rider, for example. There&#8217;s an accompanying visual alert on the rider&#8217;s smartphone that simply points in the direction of the potential obstacle and only requires a quick glance, but this feature only makes sense if the rider attaches their phone to a handlebar phone mount.</p>
<p>Drover AI and Luna have systems that can already detect objects like pedestrians and lanes, but don&#8217;t actively warn e-scooter riders about potential collisions, although given the state of their tech, it&#8217;s not outside the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>Alex Nesic, CEO of Drover AI, told TechCrunch e-bike warning systems make sense as a &#8220;next level&#8221; feature in the high end market, but &#8220;they&#8217;re not likely to be low cost enough for shared applications, which is what we are currently focusing on.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early days for Streetlogic, but Denby says the tech has worked &#8220;surprisingly well&#8221; in alpha testing. The system only tracks cars for the moment because collisions or near-misses with cars are the most prevalent issues for cyclists, says Denby.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the nice thing about vision is then you can add more behavior to it over time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Like it could track cyclists and pedestrians, potholes and cracks on the road, animals running out into the street. These are all things we can build into it over time. Even starting with just cars, we&#8217;ve covered the vast majority of incidents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Streetlogic will have to collect more data to train its ML models on so that it can build in those detections. That&#8217;s in large part what the funding is for. The pre-seed round, which comes from <span style="font-weight: 400;"> LDV Capital, Trucks Venture Capital and angel investors like Luc Vincent, Lyft&#8217;s former EVP of autonomous driving, will be used to scale the team, according to the company. The startup currently has six full time staffers after hiring two additional team members last week, but is hoping to expand its payroll so that it can both deliver on preorders and have the capacity to add maturity to the system.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got an awesome team of super hard hitters from Apple and Uber on the hardware side and then Cruise on the software side,&#8221; said Denby.</p>
<p>Denby himself came from Uber where he advised on computer vision systems for the company&#8217;s Jump scooters, which were later purchased by Lime, and he also led the team that built the Rylo 360 degree action camera.</p>
<p>While Streetlogic is launching as a B2C product to get off the ground quickly, the company would like to pursue integrations with bike manufacturers in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile income tax software <a href="https://www.columntax.com/">Column Tax</a> announced today that it raised $5.1 million in seed funding and is launching its first commercial product, which will provide users with early access to their tax refunds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bain Capital Ventures led the seed round alongside South Park Commons, Core Innovation Capital, and Operator Partners. Some prominent angel investors also participated in the round, including Opendoor founder Eric Wu and former Wealthfront CEO Adam Nash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Column Tax’s “Tax Refund Unlock” becomes available today to 2 million users of cash advance app </span><a href="https://www.joinklover.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klover</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who tend to be millennial and Gen Z Americans, Klover CEO Brian Mandelbaum told TechCrunch in an email. Advance access to tax refunds serves as an interest-free loan, r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">educing the need for users to take out expensive loans or accrue credit card debt, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mandelbaum said.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238285" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product runs on an API from payroll provider </span><a href="https://atomic.financial/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atomic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing users to receive their tax refund earnings in their paychecks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Column Tax’s tax prep product, “Tax Filing,” will also launch in February 2022 in time for the upcoming tax season, the company told TechCrunch. The seed round proceeds will help the company’s 8-person team grow to over 20 employees by the end of next year with the goal of expanding both products, CEO and founder Gavin Nachbar told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Column Tax’s software differs from that of incumbents like TurboTax and H&amp;R Block in that it is mobile-only and will be embedded into a customer’s existing bank account, allowing for year-round integration that the company says will cut down users’ time spent on tax prep.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wealthy Americans have access to CPAs and accountants and tax advice people watching over their finances year-round. We think we can take a lot of that, embed into software and give people access to that year-round,” Nachbar said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nachbar, who previously served as head of operations strategy and infrastructure at Waymo, said that payroll data companies have created “a whole new wave of opportunity” for fintechs looking to build tech solutions around income and payroll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before Atomic, it wouldn&#8217;t be possible to understand someone&#8217;s tax position mid-year without them downloading a pay stub and sending it to you via email,” Nachbar said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Column Tax only supports federal income tax filings today, it plans to eventually add state tax offerings, starting with New York and California, Nachbar added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nachbar sees growth potential for embedded tax solutions that are integrated with other financial platforms, pointing to Cash App’s takeover of Credit Karma Tax as one notable example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re entering this new era of embedded taxes,” Nachbar said. “The income tax engine is really complex. It&#8217;s a large technical problem. We&#8217;re building a large engineering team to tackle that.”</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Data is a company’s most powerful asset. Yet, many businesses cannibalize this valuable asset by selling it to third parties when they should be using it to make their businesses stronger and more sustainable.</p>
<p>Nearly all digital businesses collect some type of data from their users, so there has been growing concern from privacy rights groups about how that data is used. Yet, data collection is not wrong in and of itself. It’s the why, how and what is done with it that matters most when it comes to building a profitable and sustainable business that simultaneously respects the privacy of its users.</p>
<p>In the majority of cases, there is no nefarious man behind the curtain collecting data for evil. Most companies rake in as much data as they can under the assumption that you never know when and how data might be useful at some point down the line.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this is starting to change, and data scientists at data-driven companies are leading the charge. Collecting data based on a vague hypothetical scenario indicates a lack of intuitive understanding of what kinds of data are actually important to have from users, but smart companies are rightly asking only for the data that is needed to provide products and services to the end users.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Invading user privacy by collecting data just to sell it is an unimaginative waste of time and business intelligence.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Making data work for you through AI and a data fabric</h2>
<p>Instead of selling user data to make money, data-driven companies have opted to analyze this data to understand how to gain the most useful insights. Know Your Customer (KYC) initiatives are dependent on data, using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the information to uncover preferences that users might not be talking about in online reviews.</p>
<p>Companies like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-pepsico-scours-restaurant-menus-and-tweets-for-consumer-trends-2020-10">Pepsi are leading the way in using AI</a> for consumer product development purposes, and digital businesses can and should follow suit. Online platforms that want to go this route should beef up their in-house capabilities by hiring more data scientists and AI experts.</p>
<p>In addition to helping improve customer experience by enabling better personalization and customization options, AI can assist in making the onboarding process smoother and seamless for products and services.</p>
<p>As data becomes more complex, companies are trying to make more efficient use of their troves of data by implementing a data fabric — an interconnected layer of data and processes that supports composite data and analytics, as well as their various components.</p>
<p>A data fabric lets companies reuse and combine different styles of data science, enabling them to reduce integration design time by up to 30%, deployment by up to 30% and support by as much as 70%. In addition, a data fabric allows firms to use existing skills and technologies from data hubs, data lakes and data warehouses, as well as introduce new approaches and tools for the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Only a few months ago, <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vercel</a>, the company behind the popular <a href="https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Next.js</a> framework for front-end developers, announced a $102 million Series B funding round that took its valuation to $1.1 billion. Today, it&#8217;s announcing a $150 million Series C round that puts its valuation at $2.5 billion. The round, which brings Vercel&#8217;s total funding to $131 million, was led by GGV Capital, with participation from existing investors Accel, Bedrock Capital, CRV, Geodesic Capital, Greenoaks Capital, GV, 8VC, Flex Capital, Latacora, Salesforce Ventures and Tiger Global, as well as new investor SV Angel.</p>
<p>Vercel sits at the nexus of a number of industry trends, but maybe most importantly, it is part of the Jamstack movement that prioritizes fast, static sites &#8212; but with just enough dynamic capabilities to enable modern, personalized experiences. It was only last week that Vercel&#8217;s fellow Jamstack player Netlify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/netlify-snags-105m-series-d-to-fuel-jamstack-focused-web-development/">raised $105 million</a>, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we saw a few more of these rounds in this space in the coming months.</p>
<p>Vercel, which monetizes its open source efforts by offering a hosted serverless platform for running Next.js-based applications, saw a lot of growth in the previous months, with Next.js having grown to 2 million weekly npm installs now and traffic on its edge network growing 700% since April 2020. It now serves more than 24 billion requests on its network.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238326" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We were already an investor. The company had set very high expectations for itself for this year &#8212; and they were blowing those expectations away from a financial plan standpoint,&#8221; GGV managing partner Glenn Solomon told me. &#8220;We could see what was happening with the Next.js community, with the Vercel business model and how it really snaps together with the Next.js community. The whole world is in love with the concept of product-led growth [&#8230;]. At GGV, we&#8217;ve had the good fortune of being involved with companies like Square, Slack, HashiCorp and others, which are companies where there really was &#8212; at least for a period of time &#8212; an underlying product-led growth dynamic that really helped catapult growth. That is what&#8217;s going on at Vercel in a major way right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Vercel co-founder and CEO Guillermo Rauch noted, raising a new funding round now was a &#8220;function of our ambitions.&#8221; &#8220;If we look at Vercel as becoming this end-to-end platform where all software development on the web happens, from idea to production through getting your analytics on what to improve next, to the next idea &#8212; we definitely need [the funding],&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think the alignment with GGV came from our values. We&#8217;re big fans of their motto: &#8216;go long.&#8217; They&#8217;re fans of open source as this new model of creating highly profitable companies. I think the combination was there and then the mechanics were efficient. We&#8217;re all about performance at Vercel, so it was that match made in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vercel plans to use the new funding to hire across teams, but especially to expand its go-to-market efforts. Rauch also noted that the company is looking at strategic acquisitions as it builds out its end-to-end platform. Rauch specifically noted that Vercel started building more analytics features in 2020, which helped the company to add another dimension to its platform beyond the framework and its hosting service.</p>
<p>The team is also looking at improving the overall development workflow for developers on its platform. With the launch of <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/checks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Checks</a>, it recently started pushing more into this direction, but that&#8217;s only the start, Rauch noted. &#8220;That&#8217;s another logical area of investment for us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We hear a lot that the framework is great, the hosting is great, but the workflow Vercel provides makes all the difference.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[The Seaya Cathay Latam Fund will invest in between 12 to 15 companies and will write check sizes of between $5 and $10 million.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture capital firms <a href="https://seayaventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seaya Ventures</a> and <a href="https://cathayinnovation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cathay Innovation</a> have created a joint fund aimed at startups across Latin America that are redefining their industries and society.</p>
<p>The two firms &#8212; Seaya is based in Spain, and Cathay in France &#8212; formally came together in April and have since opened an office in Mexico City, where they will manage the $125 million <a href="http://sclatam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seaya Cathay Latam Fund</a> that will focus on Series A and B investments, with reserves for follow-on rounds.</p>
<p>Beatriz Gonzalez, founder and managing partner of Seaya Ventures, said the connection between Spain and Latin America remains strong — her firm was started in 2013 and its second investment in Mexico was in Sin Delantal, which was <a href="https://novobrief.com/just-eat-acquires-sin-delantal-mexico/2094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Just Eat</a> a year later.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238054" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“At the time, Spanish companies in industries like banking and utilities were all expanding into Latin America,” she said in an interview. “There were not many funds when we started in 2013, and today, the market is competitive. You can’t just bring funding to the table, you have to have funding, network and support. That combination is powerful because it is needed now by the ecosystem.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leading the fund locally is Federico Gómez Romero, who previously led LatAm activities for seed fintech fund Accion Venture Lab. It targets consumer and enterprise companies developing technologies in areas like fintech, proptech, mobility, healthtech, food, agriculture and cybersecurity. The fund also incorporates Cathay’s corporate ecosystem as investors and strategic partners.</p>
<p>The team’s first investment was made in September when it went in on Chilean fintech <a href="https://medium.com/cathay-innovation/behind-the-term-sheet-how-xepelin-is-helping-latams-smes-flourish-e2ff7530a81b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xepelin’s $230 million round.</a> As solo firms, both have been active in the region making other investments in Mexico’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/20/get-used-to-hearing-about-machine-learnings-operations-mlops-startups/">Kueski</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/lana-has-launched-in-latin-america-to-be-the-one-stop-shop-for-gig-workers-financial-needs/">Lana</a>, Brazil’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/brazilian-social-commerce-marketplace-facily-quietly-raises-366m-in-less-than-a-year-now-valued-at-850m/">Facily</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/alt-bank-brazils-latest-fintech-targeting-the-unbanked-raises-5-5m/">alt.bank</a>, and Colombia’s RobinFood and Chile’s Fracttal.</p>
<p>The Seaya Cathay Latam Fund will invest in 12 to 15 companies and will write check sizes of between $5 million and $10 million, Jacky Abitbol, managing partner of Cathay Innovation, said. Having already worked together on other investments, he said it made sense for his firm and Seaya to come together.</p>
<p>“Our intentions are to be a global player, and we saw opportunities to be part of the local ecosystem,” he said. “We share a lot of values and the same way of thinking, so we decided to partner to support bigger tickets and put to work a platform we built with an initial investment to support founders.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global investors continue to be drawn to LatAm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://truepay.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TruePay</a>, a one-year-old São Paulo-based &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; startup, announced today that it has raised $32 million in a Series A funding round led by Lee Fixel’s Addition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment marks Addition’s first time leading a Series A in Latin America. It comes just three months after  Kaszek and Monashees co-led an $8.5 million seed round that also included participation from ONEVC and Global Founders Capital.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237531" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TruePay’s mission is to build a B2B &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; network where sellers (industries) can grant credit without being exposed to default risk and where buyers (merchants) access credit to buy inventory from their suppliers seamlessly and costlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by former VCs Pedro Oliveira and Luis Eduardo Cascão, TruePay says it has clients in all states of Brazil, with a merchant base that is “in the thousands” after just five months of operations. Growth, its founders say, has fluctuated month-over-month from 100% to 200% in 2021. The company expects to grow between “ten-to fifteen-fold” in 2022.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2020, Oliveira and Cascão left their jobs as venture capitalists at Kaszek and DNA Capital, respectively, to start the fintech company. TruePay differs from other other BNPL offerings, they say, in that it aims to turn retailer’s credit card receivables (also known as merchant cash advances) into purchasing power. By using such receivables as collateral, the company claims it can guarantee the payment to the supplier. By removing default risk barriers, TruePay aims to streamline the commercial relationship between merchants and their suppliers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using TruePay, CEO Oliveira said, retailers have access to better payment terms with their suppliers, which allows them to make larger purchases with more time to pay and ultimately freeing up working capital for their operation.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Suppliers are no longer exposed to merchants’ default risk and hence are able to grant more credit and thus, increase sales,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money will largely go toward further hiring. Presently, the company has 50 employees and has the goal of expanding to 100 by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The strength of TruePay’s solution lies in the convergence of a real and untapped need amongst retailers to unlock credit and free up working capital, a large addressable market and a talented team,” said Fixel in a statement. “We look forward to supporting the company as it continues to develop its innovative, convenient and low-cost payment technology.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’re reported in the past, many startups in Latin America are building technology not just for the sake of innovation but to boost financial inclusion in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retailers in Brazil are the victims of a scenario where average receiving terms are long, while average paying terms are short &#8212; creating a gigantic working capital gap, according to Cascão.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “These companies bear the country&#8217;s economy on their shoulders, but don’t have any source of capital at a minimally fair cost to address this gap,” he said. “Therefore, they end up resorting to other solutions such as factoring receivables at high rates with payment processing companies and seeking credit at abusive interest rates from banks. The suppliers of these retailers, in turn, often end up having to choose between not selling or extending them credit, running the risk of default, which they are usually unequipped to do &#8212; resulting in a negative credit cycle. TruePay was created precisely to break this negative spiral and transform the relationship into a flywheel.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well that was quick. UK-based hyper fast grocery delivery startup Weezy &#8212; which only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">raised a pre-seed </a>for its 15min delivery services of supermarket fare last year, after founding the biz in 2019 &#8212; has been bagged by Turkish 10min-delivery-app Getir.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest slice of consolidation to hit Europe&#8217;s hyper competitive on-demand &#8216;quick commerce&#8217; convenience shopping apps.</p>
<p>The value of the deal is not being announced but Weezy has raised over $25M per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/weezy">Crunchbase</a>, including a $20M Series A this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/uk-on-demand-supermarket-weezy-raises-20m-series-a-led-by-nycs-left-lane-capital/">January</a> &#8212; which was led by New York&#8217;s Left Lane Capital. Other investors include DN Capital, Heartcore Capital and angels, such as Chris Muhr, the Groupon founder, plus some former execs from the supermarket and on-demand food delivery sectors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238538" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Getir, meanwhile, has been dialling up its attention on the UK market following its launch (in London), this January &#8212; <a href="https://getir.uk/press-releases/getir-covers-3-4-million-miles-one-bikes-and-e-mopeds/">announcing</a> last month that it planned to invest around £100M (~$134M) in the country to establish a nationwide network of local stores (which it claimed would create &#8220;up to 10,000 new and permanent jobs&#8221;).</p>
<p>Presumably its acquisition of Weezy accounts for a chunk of that planned splurge &#8212; as it&#8217;ll be picking up the latter&#8217;s dark stores, which includes micro fulfilment centers in London, Manchester, Brighton and Bristol.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK on-demand supermarket Weezy raises $20M Series A led by NYC&#8217;s Left Lane Capital&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/uk-on-demand-supermarket-weezy-raises-20m-series-a-led-by-nycs-left-lane-capital/embed/#?secret=9M6FMukUmb" data-secret="9M6FMukUmb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Back in January Weezy said it planned to open an additional 40 sites across the UK by the end of this year &#8212; in addition to two in London. While Getir&#8217;s own UK footprint <a href="https://getir.uk/press-releases/getir-covers-3-4-million-miles-one-bikes-and-e-mopeds/">prior to the acquisition</a> stood at between 9 and 15 cities and towns &#8212; including Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Turkish on-demand giant isn&#8217;t short of funds to shop for rivals. This summer it topped up its war-chest by raising a further $555M in Series D funds from investors including Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital and Mubadala Investment Company &#8212; and has pulled in close to a billion in funding this year (and tripled its valuation to $7.5BN), per <a href="https://www.retail-insight-network.com/comment/getir-grocery-delivery-expansion/">reports</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Getir said its business &#8212; which was founded back in 2015, so long before the pandemic arrived to supercharge online grocery shopping &#8212; is now worth $7.7BN.</p>
<p>Commenting on the acquisition in a statement, Turancan Salur, Getir UK general manager said: &#8220;Teaming up with Weezy, which has quickly established itself across the UK, is an exciting opportunity and one that complements our people-first belief and business approach. We look forward to welcoming Weezy’s customers, employees and partners to the enlarged group.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In another supporting statement, Weezy CEO and co-founder, Kristof Van Beveren, added: “We are incredibly excited to continue our journey in disrupting the skyrocketing ultrafast grocery market. Getir has an unparalleled track-record of achievements and experience with an equally ambitious team. Our alignment in purpose and culture is a winning formula for expansion globally and we will continue to deliver an exceptional offering to consumers in minutes.<strong>”</strong></p>
<p>Germany rival Gorillas also grabbed almost $1BN in funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">last month</a>, announcing a Series C close. So startups which have raised relative peanuts raised are obvious targets for rapacious, better resourced and established rivals &#8212; whose goal is to beat the competition by scaling faster to win the market for instant groceries.</p>
<p>Weezy is not Getir&#8217;s first acquisition &#8212;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/"> this summer</a> it picked up a small player in Southern Europe to expand into Spain and Italy. It has also recently (this month) kicked off a service in the US where it&#8217;s squaring up to major US rivals.</p>
<p>One of which, GoPuff, has also been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/after-acquiring-dija-and-fancy-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-launches-in-the-uk-en-route-to-european-expansion/">on a European acquisition spree lately</a> &#8212; starting with the UK market, where it&#8217;s been trying to muscle in on Getir&#8217;s territory, giving the latter added incentive to bulk up its own UK presence.</p>
<p>In all, Getir is now operating in nine countries (Turkey, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and the US) &#8212; offering app-based services including super speedy urban delivery of groceries from dark stores where it stocks some 2,000 &#8220;everyday items&#8221; that can be delivered day or night.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Polestar Precept sedan — the concept vehicle turned production project — has a new name and an official launch date. The company, the electric performance brand that spun out from Volvo Car Group, has dubbed the shark-nosed sedan Polestar 5 and announced it will go into production in 2024.</p>
<p>When Polestar first revealed the Precept in early 2020 it was viewed as a mere concept car, albeit a striking one meant to signal where this new company was headed. By September that same year, Polestar announced the Precept would be headed to production. At the time, Polestar didn&#8217;t indicate when that might happen beyond a vague sometime &#8220;before 2025.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since then, Polestar has been trickling out teasers and a few details of its Precept sedan, including a couple of YouTube videos meant to give an inside look at the entire design, development and presumably the production process. Polestar&#8217;s <a href="https://youtu.be/GmVsIdWZknA">newest video</a> focuses on what inspired the exterior design.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238455" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The video spends the bulk of its near 4-minute time with Nahum Escobedo, the exterior design manager of the Precept. So what inspired the sharp exterior lines? Sharks and airplanes — at least partially, Escobedo said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238469" style="width: 1826px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/polestar-5-aerial.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238469" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2238469 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/polestar-5-aerial.jpg" alt="polestar 5 precept" width="1816" height="1008" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/polestar-5-aerial.jpg 1816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/polestar-5-aerial.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/polestar-5-aerial.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/polestar-5-aerial.jpg?resize=768,426 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/polestar-5-aerial.jpg?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/polestar-5-aerial.jpg?resize=1536,853 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/polestar-5-aerial.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1816px) 100vw, 1816px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2238469" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Polestar/screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;For this project we also wanted something that was very elegant, but also something that has a certain speed,&#8221; he says in the video. &#8220;So for me, the shark had this certain feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dramatic rear end of the Polestar 5 shows the long aero blade light, another early design feature that appears to be sticking around for the production version.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Polestar did not share any specs like battery range or the powertrain in this new video. We do know it will follow the Polestar 3, an all-electric SUV, is expected to go into production in 2022.</p>
<p>Polestar&#8217;s first production vehicle was the plug-inn hybrid grand tourer Polestar 1. The all-electric Polestar 2 sedan followed in 2020. No word yet on what Polestar 4 is — assuming the company will continue with the numeric nomenclature.</p>
<p>The latest insight into Polestar 5, the electric vehicle formally known as the Precept, follows two major expansion and financial moves by the company earlier this year. Polestar announced in late September it reached an agreement to go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition with Gores Guggenheim Inc. in a deal that is expected to value the combined company $20 billion. Once the merger closes, the combined company will be held by a new public company named Polestar Automotive Holding UK Limited. The company is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol &#8220;PSNY.&#8221;</p>
<p>In June, the company announced it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/polestar-to-build-its-first-all-electric-suv-in-the-united-states/">manufacture the Polestar 3</a> in the United States. The Polestar 3 will be assembled at a plant shared with Volvo Cars at a factory in Ridgeville, South Carolina. Production of Polestar 3 is expected to begin globally in 2022.</p>
