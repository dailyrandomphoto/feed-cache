										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If there&#8217;s one thing that the ongoing COVID-19 crisis has proven, it&#8217;s that the healthcare system in the U.S. is in drastic need of major transformation. One of the biggest issues to be highlighted by the pandemic in particular is the iniquity in access to care, but there are signs that one of the effects of COVID-19 will be a stepping up of accessibility reform driven in particular by technology.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt 2021</a>, we&#8217;re thrilled to have three guests onstage for a panel discussion all about how tech companies are working to address access gaps in healthcare. From Cityblock Health, we&#8217;ll host co-founder and Chief Health Officer Toyin Ajayi; from Carbon Health, co-founder and CEO Eren Bali; and from Forward, CEO and co-founder Adrian Aoun.</p>
<p>Cityblock Health is the first tech-driven provider for communities with complex health and social needs &#8212; bringing better care to neighborhoods where it’s needed most. Cityblock&#8217;s goal is to foster a model of care that meets individuals where they are, delivering highly personalized primary care, behavioral healthcare and social services to its members, with a focus on those who access Medicaid, are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare, and others living in lower-income neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Carbon Health has a goal of making good healthcare accessible to all, with same-day appointment booking, telehealth services and prescription delivery, facilitated through partnerships with some of the leading insurers and payers in the U.S. The company has taken a central role in vaccine administration in California, and continues to evolve its model of modular healthcare delivery to reach communities where primary care hasn&#8217;t traditionally been readily available.</p>
<p>Forward is an AI-based healthcare system combining world-class private doctors with new technology to enable proactive, data-driven primary care. Starting with cutting edge in-clinic and at-home biometric data measurement, Forward aims to tailor its primary care to individuals in a combination that delivers both scalability and personalization. The company also espouses a direct-to-consumer, subscription-based model of care that it argues avoids some of the traditional pitfalls of insurance-backed care.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to be able to dig in to these very different approaches to healthcare, that still all share the fundamental goal of making a higher-quality standard of care available to more people.</p>
<p>During the three-day event, writer, director, actor and Houseplant co-founder Seth Rogen will be joined by Houseplant Chief Commercial Officer Haneen Davies and co-founder and CEO Michael Mohr to talk about the business of weed, BioNTech co-founder and CEO Uğur Şahin will dive into what&#8217;s next for mRNA technologies after COVID, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong will dig into the volatile world of cryptocurrency and his company’s massive direct listing earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Too busy to tune in? Still asleep when it all went down? Here&#8217;s the slimmed down version of everything you need to know.</p>
<h2>Galaxy Watch 4</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2188130" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188130" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188130" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188130" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Samsung is back with another set of smartwatches, this time with a twist: after years of focusing on their own operating system with Tizen, these latest watches are back on Google&#8217;s Wear OS. Or, at least, Samsung&#8217;s take on it — this software build will be called &#8220;Wear OS Powered by Samsung&#8221;, and will borrow some of the best bits of Tizen while being Wear OS at its core.</p>
<p>Samsung went deep on health metrics this time around, focusing much of the announcement on the Watch&#8217;s ability to constantly monitor things like blood pressure, blood oxygen, and body composition.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s watch comes in two forms: Galaxy Watch 4, and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. The standard Watch 4 is a bit thinner and lighter, with a touch-sensitive bezel for controlling the interface; Watch 4 Classic bulks things up a bit, with a bezel that physically spins. Watch 4 starts at $250 and comes in 40mm or 44mm, while Watch 4 Classic bumps the base price to $350 and comes in 42mm or 46mm.</p>

<h2>Galaxy Z Fold 3</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2188125" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188125" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188125" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188125" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Pricey and with plenty of problems to work out of the earliest versions, folding smartphones haven&#8217;t exactly taken over the world. Hell, most people probably still haven&#8217;t seen a folding phone in person. But Samsung isn&#8217;t done in this space just yet!</p>
<p>This morning the company announced the Galaxy Z Fold 3, its third iteration on the hotdog-style folding phone approach. They&#8217;ve managed to drop the price tag a bit (from $2000 to $1800), while bumping up the overall build quality — its got a stronger aluminum frame, a more durable folding display, and it&#8217;s waterproofed (a first for the Samsung foldables!) up to an IPX8 rating. (One catch: that &#8220;x&#8221; means it&#8217;ll survive an accidental dunk in the tub, but you still want to keep it away from dust/debris.)</p>
<p>The Fold 3 will be the first Samsung device with an under-display camera — an awesome trick, albeit one that generally comes at the expense of picture quality. The back of the device brings in three more (more standard, less hidden) lenses — ultra wide, wide-angle, and telephoto, all coming in at 12 megapixels each. Oh, and it supports the S Pen stylus now!</p>
<p>Expect this one to start shipping on the 26th of this month.</p>

<h2>Galaxy Z Flip 3</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2188119" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188119" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188119" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9783.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9783.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9783.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9783.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9783.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9783.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9783.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9783.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9783.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188119" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>While the flagship Fold 3 took up most of the folding spotlight today, Samsung&#8217;s relatively entry-level (clamshell!) foldable gets an update too with the announcement of the Galaxy Z Flip 3.</p>
<p>The Flip 3 will get many of the same durability improvements coming to the aforementioned Fold 3, including the improved aluminum body, more durable display, and IPX8 water resistance. It&#8217;s got a 10MP selfie cam on the inside, with two 12MP cameras (ultra wide and wide Angle) on the outside. At $999 — nearly $400 less than the last one — it&#8217;s the first time Samsung has managed to drag its foldable line into the sub-$1k price range. It&#8217;s got a bigger cover screen (the screen that shows whenever the device is folded shut) this time around, at 1.9&#8243; versus last-gen&#8217;s 1.1&#8243;.</p>
<p>As with everything else announced today, it starts shipping on August 26th. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/samsung-latest-galaxy-z-flip-starts-at-1000/">Find our full post on the Flip 3 here.</a></p>
<h2>Galaxy Buds 2</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2188163" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188163" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9745.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9745.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9745.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9745.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9745.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9745.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9745.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9745.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9745.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188163" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Samsung also debuted a new generation of its entry-level wireless earbuds today, and everything you need to know could fit in a tweet: they&#8217;re smaller and lighter and have active noise cancellation, and will ship on August 26th for $149.</p>
<p>Want more details? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/samsung-brings-active-noise-cancellation-to-its-entry-level-galaxy-buds/">Here&#8217;s the full post.</a></p>
<h2>Less plastic!</h2>
<p>They kinda snuck this one in at the end, but it&#8217;s worth a highlight: Samsung is committing to eliminating all single-use plastic <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/phones-from-ocean-plastic-samsungs-plan-to-green-by-2025-will-apple-and-others-follow/">from its phone packaging by 2025</a>, with plans to dramatically increase its use of recycled material across its mobile products by the same year. Given that Samsung ships more phones per quarter than any other company on the planet, thats huge — and, hopefully, an example others will follow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck company Hyzon Motors said Wednesday it is ramping up operations in the wake of its merger with blank-check firm Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp., including shipping its first trucks to European customers.</p>
<p>The company, which reported second-quarter earnings Wednesday, said it is also preparing to start its first customer trials in the United States.</p>
<p>Like other transportation companies that have gone public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition fund, Hyzon doesn’t yet have any revenue to speak of. Instead, Hyzon is banking on the huge injection of capital from the transaction – more than $500 million – and growing customer orders to take it to positive cash flow.</p>
<p>As of now, the company reported a net loss for the quarter of $9.4 million, including $3.5 million in R&amp;D expenses. It had a negative adjusted EBITDA of $9.1 million. The company has $517 million in cash on hand, enough to reach free cash flow by 2024 without having to sell additional equity, Hyzon CFO Mark Gordon said during a second quarter earnings call.</p>
<p>In addition to manufacturing hydrogen fuel cell powertrains, Hyzon is also investing in hydrogen fuel production hubs, a key piece of infrastructure for technology uptake. In April, the company signed a MOU for a joint venture with renewable fuels company Raven SR for up to 100 hydrogen production hubs. Gordon confirmed the first two will be in the Bay Area.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hyzon Motors&#8217; hydrogen fuel ambitions include two US factories&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/hyzon-motors-hydrogen-fuel-ambitions-include-two-us-factories/embed/#?secret=86VijeROT7" data-secret="86VijeROT7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He also said that the company is on track to deliver 85 fuel cell vehicles by the end of this year, with the company’s first revenue coming next quarter. Orders and memoranda of understanding under contract has grown to $83 million from $55 million as of April, but many of the MoUs are non-binding. An agreement with Austrian grocer MRPEIS for 70 trucks next year is one such example. Similarly, Hyzon faces a slightly uphill battle in terms of technological adoption, as many of their customers have never seen or used a hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle before.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Many customers are getting their hands on the first fuel cell vehicles they’ve ever seen in the next six to 12 months,” CEO Craig Knight said during the call. That is a genuine kind of technology validation process and the customers need to feel comfortable the vehicles function well in their use case.”</p>
<p>While many of Hyzon’s sales are for a small number of trucks, Knight said he sees the purchasing timeline from initial sale to fleet conversion growing shorter – at least in Europe, where there is significantly more hydrogen availability. “Whereas, earlier I would have said, it&#8217;s a 12-to-18 month process to go from getting your first fuel cell truck and trying it out and then maybe getting a few more and figuring out what fleet conversion would look like over time, and then kicking off that fleet conversion process – I actually think that&#8217;s compressing,” Knight said.</p>
<p>The company is focused on mostly on back-to-base operations rather than long-haul freight haulage, as the latter requires a more extensively built-out hydrogen refueling network. The U.S. customer trial with logistics company Total Transport Services Inc is high-utilization (trucks can run up to 18-20 hours per day) use case, but the truck will only ever need to access the single refueling station in Wilmington, California. “It&#8217;s a good application for hydrogen, and we&#8217;re not introducing the complication of having to find hydrogen stations across the country,” Knight said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin has made headlines over the past year for a number of reasons: It’s home to Oracle’s new headquarters. Tesla is building a </span><a href="https://austin.culturemap.com/news/innovation/07-27-21-new-photos-show-construction-of-teslas-austin-factory-is-in-high-gear/#slide=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">massive gigafactory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Texas capital. And people, mostly tech workers, are leaving the Bay Area in droves to settle in the city, driving up home prices in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just tech workers. A number of venture capitalists have set up shop in Austin, including </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/facebook-investor-jim-breyer-picks-austin-as-breyer-capitals-second-home/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, who said last year he was </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/palantir-co-founder-joe-lonsdale-leaving-silicon-valley.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moving his venture capital firm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 8VC, from Silicon Valley to the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest VC to call Austin home is </span><a href="https://www.bedrockcap.com/geoff-lewis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geoff Lewis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ounder &amp; managing partner of Bedrock Capital, a four-year-old early-stage venture capital firm with $1 billion in assets under management. Lewis started his investing career at Founders Fund, where he was a partner for several years. He either serves or has served on the board of companies such as Lyft, Nubank, Vercel and Workrise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis also led early investments in Wish, Upstart, Tilray, Canva, Rippling, ClearCo, Flock Safety and a number of other unicorns. He’s largely credited with popularizing the phrase “narrative violation” to des</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cribe </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">promising companies that are overlooked or underestimated because they are incongruent with popular narratives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In making the move to Austin, the investor said he had grown disillusioned with Silicon Valley and the region’s continued lack of focus on solving what he described as real-world problems. In a recent Medium </span><a href="https://medium.com/bedrock/why-im-bullish-on-texas-81ef231c2de4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Lewis said he was first introduced to Austin after backing Workrise (formerly called RigUp), a marketplace for skilled trade workers. In fact, he </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was the company’s first seed investor eight years ago, and has gone on to invest in the company eight subsequent times. Today, Workrise is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/workrise-once-known-as-rigup-raises-300m-at-a-2-9b-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">valued at nearly $3 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis said he was drawn to the company, not just because it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“going to be huge” but also because it was “much more concerned with real people and real places than today’s Silicon Valley behemoths.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Put simply,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it is a more humane technology company,” Lewis writes. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s my search for this more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> humane genre of technological innovation that brought me to Texas. I’ve lived on the coasts and built my career as a Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur and investor, but I’ve never felt</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the coasts or as an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">insider </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Silicon Valley &#8212; I didn’t go to Stanford nor grow up rich.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch talked with Lewis to get more details around his decision to move his firm to Austin, learn more of his views on why Silicon Valley is too much of “a bubble” (spoiler alert: they may not be popular with many of you!) and how he plans to invest in more of Texas’ nexus of startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: I understand that you grew up in Canada. How did you first get involved in the tech industry to begin with?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: I started off as an entrepreneur myself, building a SaaS company in the travel space [Topguest]. I founded that business in New York City and in 2009, ended up moving my team to San Francisco. I spent most of my career from 2009 to 2021 mostly bouncing between New York and SF. We ended up selling that company in 2011 and it was a reasonably okay outcome. I joined Founders Fund in 2012, where I just fell in love with investing. I ended up really having a special trajectory there and 2012 was a great time to be a young VC in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. I ended up specializing in marketplaces, both consumer and enterprise, backing companies like Lyft and Canva early. I also did the firm’s first fintech investment in Latin America, backing Nubank, and now that company has a $30 billion valuation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grew up with pretty modest means and by 2017, I figured I had done well enough as a VC and I should strike out on trying to get back to what I wanted to do, which was more entrepreneurial. So we founded Bedrock in late 2017. We’re on Fund III now and really it&#8217;s been consistent with the investment philosophy I pursued &#8212; trying to find what we call narrative violations, or these counter narrative companies that are being overlooked or underestimated. We were very early investors in Cameo, which is now obviously a pretty well-known business, for example.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: You initially chose to base Bedrock in New York. Why?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: When I was at Founders Fund I had a home in both cities (SF and NYC) so I was the kid who grew up in Calgary, Canada, and wanted to live on the coasts and be in the center of the action. But we decided to actually headquarter Bedrock in New York in 2017 because we had an inclination that Silicon Valley was becoming a little bit overly self-referential and wanted to be a bit outside of the noise. New York is less of a one-horse town, so we decided to base the firm there, but really invested in, and continue to invest, everywhere across the country, and quite honestly around the world. We invested in WorkRise in the early days, and more recently in Argyle and Lambda School.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: Tell me about this migration to Austin. At what point did you decide this is where you want to be and what drew you here? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: My first visit was in 2012 when I invested in Workrise, so I came to Austin quarterly for board meetings for years. And then a family member of mine actually got a position at UT (University of Texas). So that made me more excited about spending more time here. And then the real impetus I&#8217;d say happened, as I think it did for many people, during the pandemic. I remember in February, my partner Eric [Stromberg] and I had this conversation where we were like, “OK, COVID is going to have a deeper impact on New York City.” We saw it coming and decided we should get out of New York. At first, I moved to Hawaii and it was just a bit too isolated to live year-round, so I was like, “What’s a place that combines access to nature that’s not being in a big city but still has a nexus of smart, interesting people. I also was looking for a place where it would be easy to hop on a plane and get to either coast. Austin was the obvious choice. So many of my friends from the Bay Area were moving there, one after another, and loving it. So by January 2021, we had made the decision to move our firm here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t believe everyone should move to Austin. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right for everyone, but I do think it&#8217;s right for us.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: Having myself lived in both the Bay Area and Austin, I actually see a number of growing similarities between the two. What do you say to that? Do you also feel like the culture is spilling over here?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: I have friends who are locals and have been here in some cases for like a generation-plus, and in other cases, have lived here since they were kids. They are really alarmed by how the city is changing, certainly like the real estate crisis, especially if you&#8217;re anywhere close to the core, is just absolutely insane. They’re definitely not used to the California and New York transplants. I definitely think it&#8217;s a problem that the city somehow does not quite have the infrastructure from a housing standpoint and from a transportation standpoint to support the growth on that; it&#8217;s a very big problem. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a healthy long-term dynamic where you&#8217;ve got locals that really don&#8217;t like the newcomers coming in. So I think that is a big problem and I don&#8217;t quite know what the solution is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I think the wealth inequality is far less of a problem here than it is in the Bay Area. To me, that’s the number one thing that&#8217;s much better about Austin. Yes, there’s a homeless problem and yes there are people struggling here, but we&#8217;re not anywhere near the wealth inequality situation that exists in the Bay Area, which is like the most unequal &#8212; from a wealth standpoint &#8212; place in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People can still get by here. And then I think the fact that it&#8217;s a blue city in a red state is actually really important. I&#8217;m pretty much an apolitical person and not that engaged in American politics but I do think there&#8217;s a dynamic where you&#8217;ve got a diversity of views and a diversity of opinions. There’s a natural tension that doesn&#8217;t exist in San Francisco and I think that leads to a more healthy set of policies over time.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: I know you&#8217;re planning to invest in more startups in Austin and Texas but not exclusively, right? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: Yes, we will invest anywhere and everywhere but already we have four investments in companies we met here in Austin, three of which we have made just since April. One is a Dallas-based company, Leadr, that has built a leadership development platform for enterprises. Another is a stealth company based here in Austin and we’ve also put money in a cryptocurrency analytics company that is not technically based here but has an office in Austin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I definitely expect we’ll be making more investments in Texas than we used to now that we’re on the ground here.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: In your blog post, you made the statement that “innovators in Texas seem to care about real people in real problems more than the obstructions from reality to animate too much of Silicon Valley.” And I thought that was interesting and probably could stir up some controversy and backlash. Can you elaborate on that?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: I think there&#8217;s sort of this cultural dynamic where you have people that truly do live in these bubbles and so when you&#8217;re in the technology industry in San Francisco or quite honestly the entertainment industry in Los Angeles, I think folks just live entirely in this sort of self-referential bubble. And you only communicate and only ever interact with people that are in the same industry as you, and I think that leads to just a very, quite honestly parochial sort of inward looking worldview. There is something about a place that is less dominated by technology. When you think about Texas as a state &#8212; yes, tech is a major employer in Austin, but tech does not dominate the state of Texas by any means. It&#8217;s a huge state, there are lots of people here. There is a much smaller tech community. So definitionally, I think people tend to be friends with people from different walks of life. And I think people are just much more keyed into practical problems and issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a Houston company that I&#8217;m not an investor in but that I&#8217;m really excited about the business, Solugen. It’s innovating chemical manufacturing in more environmentally sustainable and cost-effective ways, which to me is very much more of a real-world, practical problem type company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve got Leadr, which is trying to do leadership development for churches and faith organizations, using software. It feels like a company that just would never get started out of San Francisco where nobody is religious, and no one goes to church. So I do just think it&#8217;s a much different vibe here where you&#8217;ve got people that are less siphoned off from the real world versus living in this bubble, which is quite unhealthy. I don’t want to spend my time on another widget. I want to invest in things that are gonna actually have an impact on the world.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: This will likely be an unpopular opinion with many, and your comments might provoke some defensiveness. What would you say to any counterarguments?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: It’s not zero sum. The vibe here is I think a healthier one for me but I realize it’s not for everyone. Obviously there are many companies that have dramatically improved the world that have come out of the Bay Area. There are also companies that arguably have been net negative for society. These things are always open to debate. Whether something&#8217;s good for the world or bad is fundamentally subjective. I think at the very least Texas is a place where there&#8217;s a little bit more freedom to debate those opinions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://airtable.com">Airtable</a>, the makers of the no code relational database, announced its first acquisition today, acquiring <a href="https://bayes.com/">Bayes</a>, an early stage visualization startup. The purpose of the purchase is to enhance the data visualizations on the Airtable platform. The companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>Much like Airtable, Bayes focuses on a no-code approach and the two companies have a shared vision about simplifying activities that once required engineering talent to pull off. Airtable CEO and co-founder Howie Liu says that while he hasn&#8217;t really been thinking about acquisitions, this opportunity came along and he liked how the team and product fit in with the Airtable no-code philosophy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We fell in love with the team and the product that they had built insofar as it showed us their vision for for doing data visualization in a really interesting and user friendly way that we thought would be applicable&#8230;and in spirit to be able to apply that kind of design thinking to Airtable&#8217;s product and enable our customers to basically better visualize their data,&#8221; Liu said.</p>
<p>Bayes&#8217;s four employees have joined Airtable and the plan is to shut down the product and incorporate the functionality into Airtable in the coming months.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Don&#8217;t hate on low-code and no-code&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/embed/#?secret=UguaxV6KSp" data-secret="UguaxV6KSp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Will Strimling, company co-founder says his startup matched up well with Airtable, which he said was a huge inspiration for his company since it launched in 2019. He said that it seemed like they could be better together after the two companies began talking. &#8220;After comparing our respective roadmaps and future plans, it became clear that by working together we could build something that is greater than the sum of its parts &#8212; an Airtable with even more insights, visualizations, and reporting features that will continue to improve the way teams manage workflows,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While Airtable does provide some basic visualization in the current product, Liu says that with Bayes it will really take that capability to a different level, allowing customers to create a custom interface on top of Airtable. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to provide much more advanced ways of graphing and reporting on your data. We&#8217;re also going to invest into giving our customers the ability to create truly a custom interface on top of the product,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Liu said up until now the company really lacked the scale to think about acquisitions, but with 500 employees in the fold he feels that they are sufficiently large, and also they have the talent on the executive team to execute on acquisitions now. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s harder to absorb acquisitions when you&#8217;re a very small company yourself, whereas now I think we&#8217;re at the scale where it starts to make sense to accelerate our roadmap by acquiring talent,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Airtable was founded in 2013 and has raised over $600 million. The most recent round was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding/"> a $270 million Series E</a> at a fat $5.77 billion valuation, so from that perspective they have some financial flexibility to make these kinds of moves, and may consider additional purchases moving forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.doxel.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doxel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has developed software that uses computer vision to help track and monitor progress on construction job sites, announced today that it has raised $40 million in Series B funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insight Partners led the round, which included participation from existing backers Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Amplo and brings the startup’s total raised to $56.5 million since its December 2015 inception. A16z has participated in each of Doxel’s rounds &#8212; from seed to Series B. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to its institutional investors, Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev also put money in Doxel’s Series A round as an angel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO Saurabh Ladha said he could not disclose the valuation at which the capital was raised, but that it was “over a 4x multiple” from its $12 million Series A in early 2020. He described the Series B as an &#8220;opportunistic raise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We raised because we could, at a phenomenal valuation. The full</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series A is still in the bank. We didn’t touch it even,” he told TechCrunch. “Our growth and bookings traction has actually been so high that we’ve been cash flow neutral in that period of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ladha was inspired to start Doxel after his family nearly suffered from financial catastrophe after a two-year delay on a major construction project in India in which his father was involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I almost thought we’d lose our house. It was the first time I was made aware of the impact construction can have on livelihoods,” Ladha told TechCrunch. “Even as a child, I realized that predictability is what keeps projects on time and on budget.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty years later, when Ladha graduated from Stanford University, he learned that 90% of projects are delayed and delivered over budget.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ladha then teamed up with Robin Singh, Doxel’s CTO, in 2015 to found Doxel to build a “computer-vision-powered predictive analytics platform” designed to help owners and contractors “navigate problems before they happen.” Or put more simply, Doxel is building what it describes as the “Waze for Construction” platform.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Construction tech startups are poised to shake up a $1.3-trillion-dollar industry&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/construction-tech-startups-are-poised-to-shake-up-a-1-3-trillion-dollar-industry/embed/#?secret=bNDwYcD1kY" data-secret="bNDwYcD1kY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s biggest differentiator from competitors, according to Ladha, is that it provides forward-looking insight on the construction field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of companies offer backward-looking analytics,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re the only player offering a forward-looking solution that’s predictive&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In much the same way drivers have come to rely on satellite technology to avoid traffic accidents and slow-downs ahead of them, Doxel’s customers have come to rely on our AI-powered Project Controls platform.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doxel, Ladha added, does monitoring for project teams, so they can focus on solving problems rather than on finding them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our predictive analytics gives building owners and general contractors a way to identify critical risk factors that threaten to derail their project before they even know the risks exist,” he said. “So they are not finding out about problems when it’s too late to actually solve them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The premise is that by the time potential risk factors are discovered, it’s too late and cost overruns and project delays are unavoidable. Over the years, with all the data it has gathered, Doxel has built out what it describes as a “Construction Encyclopedia” that helps it in identifying those potential risk factors.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188450" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188450" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2188450 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Saurabh-Robin-e1628634629479.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188450" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Co-founders Saurabh Ladha (CEO) and Robin Singh (CTO) / Doxel</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that its technology has helped its customers come in up to 11% below budget on projects and see an average 38% increase in productivity, according to Ladha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doxel’s platform works by tapping into multiple real-time data sources on a project, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">such as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 360-degree images, Building Information Models (BIM) &#8212; also known as 3D designs &#8212; as well as budget and schedule in an effort to provide both predictability and control to building owners and contractors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The goal is to help prevent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a domino effect of delays and heightened costs, so that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> building owners and contractors are better able to stay on time and on budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Other companies don’t bridge all silos across field, accounting and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">schedule management,” Ladha said. “These are three disparate entities that operate separately and without the knowledge silos being bridged.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides cost overruns, the loss of revenue associated with projects not being available for use per plan is exponentially disastrous, Ladha noted. For example, a multifamily developer expecting to make money by selling or renting condo units will lose income the longer it takes for project completion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, Doxel says it has tracked tens of billions of capital expenditures for “a diverse group” of Fortune 500 companies, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaiser Permanente and Royal Dutch Shell. Doxel claims to have saved companies “tens of millions” of dollars with its predictive technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our users are senior execs tasked with making multibillion-dollar decisions with little information on a week to week basis,” Ladha said. “They need to know if they are on cost and on time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikhil Sachdev, managing director at Insight Partners, said his firm was really excited about the size of the problem Doxel is going after in addition to the traction the company has “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with some of the world’s largest enterprises, and their highly defensible AI-first software.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversations with customers revealed that prior to using Doxel’s technology, they did not have a way to accurately predict the future state of their construction projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most construction management software tools are still dependent on manual data entry or photos tagged to blueprints, which requires weeks of manual mining to extract insights on a project’s cost &amp; schedule performance,” Sachdev wrote via email. “Doxel is the only tool we&#8217;ve found that can ingest all of the relevant data, process it using their AI, and make the leap to what the project will look like in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Redwood City, California-based Doxel plans to use its new capital to scale its platform and hire across its engineering, sales, marketing and product staff. Currently, Doxel has 75 employees across offices in the U.S. and Bangalore. It’s looking to roughly double the size of its team over the next year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The link-in-bio business is heating up as more mobile website builders compete for a coveted slice of real estate on a creator&#8217;s TikTok, Instagram or Twitter. <a href="http://linktr.ee">Linktree</a> leads the space, securing a recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/">$45 million Series B raise</a> to build out e-commerce features, but <a href="http://beacons.ai">Beacons</a> boasts competitive creator monetization tools with just a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/beacons-seed-round-creator-profiles/">$6 million seed round</a> in May. Now, <a href="http://snipfeed.co">Snipfeed</a> enters the ring with its own $5.5 million seed round, including investments from CRV, Abstract Ventures, Crossbeam (Ali Hamed), id8, Michael Ovitz (founder of CAA), Michael Bosstick, Diaspora Ventures and others.</p>
<p>Linktree has been around since 2016 and has more funding than its up-and-coming competitors. But for creators seeking to monetize their following, these newer platforms may be more attractive to some creators, since they already have built-in tools to help them monetize their followings. Linktree currently supports tipping on the platform for users subscribed to its $6 Linktree Pro platform, but Snipfeed offers a wider range of monetization options; some creators are making more than $20,000 per month on the platform, according to CEO and co-founder Rédouane Ramdani.</p>
<p>Snipfeed started as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/20-startups-take-center-stage-at-berkeley-skydecks-demo-day/">content discovery platform</a> with 44,000 weekly active users &#8212; but when Snipfeed added a creator monetization tool to its platform, it became its most popular feature. So, in February 2020, with little to no funding left, the company completely pivoted to its current link-in-bio business. Since then, Snipfeed has amassed 50,000 registered users, with the user base growing 500% in the last six months (Linktree, for comparison, has more than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/">12 million users</a>).</p>
<p>Based in Paris and Los Angeles, Snipfeed&#8217;s 15-person staff is particularly interested in the &#8220;long tail&#8221; of creators, which it says encompasses more than 46 million people.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Content creator</em> doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you&#8217;re going to be the next Addison Rae or a TikTok star,&#8221; explained Ramdani. &#8220;It means that you might be a doctor or lawyer, and on top of that, you&#8217;re going to have a TikTok where you explain how to file your taxes and that kind of stuff. They have this expertise, and they’re wondering, &#8216;How can I turn that into a side-hustle?&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188271" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188271" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188271" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="415" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png 2828w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=680,415 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=1536,936 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=2048,1248 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188271" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snipfeed</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to a standard tipping tool, Snipfeed allows users to sell digital goods, like on-demand video, e-books, access to livestreams and one-on-one consultations. But Snipfeed&#8217;s biggest differentiator is its Cameo-like system for selling personalized content. For example, TikToker <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@maylikethemonthh?lang=en">maylikethemonthh</a> uses <a href="https://link.snipfeed.co/maylikethemonthh">Snipfeed</a> to sell asynchronous, video-recorded tarot readings. While asking a single, personalized astrology question costs $5, a more in-depth reading can cost up to $20 or $40.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Snipfeed is free to set up, but if you make sales, the company takes 15% &#8212; this percentage is inclusive of any transaction fees. Through Snipfeed&#8217;s referral program, creators can make 5% of sales from anyone they onboard to the platform (this comes out of Snipfeed&#8217;s commission).</p>
<p>“We decided to go with this model because we really want to have a relationship where we help the creators really make money. We only make money if they make money,&#8221; Ramdani said.</p>
<p>If a creator or celebrity were to sell personalized videos on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/celebrity-video-request-site-cameo-reaches-unicorn-status-with-100m-raise/">Cameo</a>, they&#8217;d lose <a href="https://help.cameo.com/what-percentage-do-i-earn-from-each-completed-cameo-video--BkMyCbLlu#:~:text=For%20Cameo%20Videos%20requested%20through,our%20Talent%20Terms%20of%20Service).">25% to the platform</a>. Meanwhile, Beacons takes 9% of sales from its <a href="https://pricing.beacons.ai/">free version</a>, and 5% from its $10 per month version, which offers more customization, integrations and analytics.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188273" style="width: 351px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188273" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2188273" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_65C780819BD9-1.jpeg?w=341" alt="" width="341" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_65C780819BD9-1.jpeg 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_65C780819BD9-1.jpeg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_65C780819BD9-1.jpeg?resize=151,300 151w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_65C780819BD9-1.jpeg?resize=768,1530 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_65C780819BD9-1.jpeg?resize=341,680 341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_65C780819BD9-1.jpeg?resize=771,1536 771w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_65C780819BD9-1.jpeg?resize=1028,2048 1028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_65C780819BD9-1.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188273" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snipfeed</p></div></p>
<p>Still, depending on the type of creator, the features that each link-in-bio startup offers might matter more than the cost. Beacons allows users to share a shopping-enabled TikTok feed, which could be a huge money-maker for creators that often share product recommendations with affiliate links, which give them a commission from sales. Ramdani said that astrologers have been particularly successful on Snipfeed, since fans can book a variety of asynchronous services at a wide range of prices. But these features could benefit any creator who can profit from answering followers&#8217; specific questions &#8212; a chef could offer recipe ideas based on what&#8217;s in a fan&#8217;s fridge, or a life coach could make a personalized video if a follower requests advice.</p>
<p>With its $5.5 million in seed funding, Snipfeed plans to build out its e-commerce tools so that creators can sell physical products on their link-in-bio (Beacons and Linktree are also working on this with their recent funding rounds &#8212; but Beacons&#8217; and Snipfeed&#8217;s seed rounds are small compared to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/">Linktree&#8217;s Series B</a>). The company also wants to develop educational content to show its users how to best monetize their platform &#8212; if Snipfeed can help its creators make money, then it&#8217;ll make more money too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s $1.5 billion air cargo hub in Northern Kentucky opened Wednesday, the latest effort by the e-commerce giant to connect a network of 40 sites and control all aspects of delivery as demand for speed and convenience accelerates.</p>
<p>The Amazon Air Hub operations, located at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, will be the center of its U.S. cargo network. The hub opened after more than four years of planning and construction. Amazon said the U.S. hub will eventually <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/welcome-to-the-amazon-air-hub">operate a dozen flights per day</a> and process millions of packages every week.</p>
<p>The hub is comprised of an 800,000-square-foot sortation building located on a 600-acre campus that includes seven buildings, a new ramp for aircraft parking and a multistory vehicle parking structure.</p>
<p>Amazon said that eventually more than 2,000 people will be employed there. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The air hub will also rely on robotics technology, specifically robotic arms to move and sort packages and mobile drive units to transport packages across the building.</span></p>
<p>Amazon Air launched in 2016 and has grown into a network of more than 40 locations. Last year, Amazon Air launched its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/amazon-launches-its-first-amazon-air-regional-hub-in-europe/"> European air hub</a> at Germany&#8217;s Leipzig/Halle Airport, a 215,000-square-foot facility that hosts two Amazon-branded Boeing 737-800 aircraft.</p>
<p>Amazon Air also has regional air hubs at airports in Texas, Puerto Rico and Florida in the U.S., and plans to expand to San Bernardino International Airport in California in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp users will finally be able to move their entire chat history between mobile operating systems &#8212; something that&#8217;s been one of users&#8217; biggest requests to date. The company today introduced a feature that will soon become available to users of both iOS and Android devices, allowing them to move their WhatsApp voice notes, photos and conversations securely between devices when they switch between mobile operating systems.</p>
<p>The company had been <a href="https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1410974816216227847">rumored</a> to be working on such functionality for some time, but the details of which devices would be initially supported or when it would be released weren&#8217;t yet known.</p>
<p>In product leaks, WhatsApp had <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/26/whatsapp-chat-android-ios-data-transfer-tool/">appeared to be working on</a> an integration into Android&#8217;s built-in transfer app, the Google Data Transfer Tool, which lets users move their files from one Android device to another, or switch from iOS to Android.</p>
<p>The feature WhatsApp introduced today, however, works with Samsung devices and Samsung&#8217;s own transfer tool, known as <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/smart-switch">Smart Switch</a>. Today, Smart Switch helps users transfer contacts, photos, music, messages, notes, calendars and more to Samsung Galaxy devices. Now, it will transfer WhatsApp chat history, too.</p>
<p>WhatsApp showed off the new tool at Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Unpacked event, and announced Samsung&#8217;s newest Galaxy foldable devices would get the feature first in the weeks to come. The feature will later roll out to Android more broadly. WhatsApp didn&#8217;t say when iOS users would gain access, but a spokesperson for WhatsApp told TechCrunch the team is working to bring the feature to users worldwide.</p>
<p>To use the feature, WhatsApp users will connect their old and new device via a USB-C to Lightning cable, and launch Smart Switch. The new phone will then prompt you to scan a QR code using your old phone and export your WhatsApp history. To complete the transfer, you&#8217;ll sign into WhatsApp on the new device and import the messages.</p>
<p>Building such a feature was non-trivial, the company also explained, as messages across its service are end-to-end encrypted by default and stored on users&#8217; devices. That meant the creation of a tool to move chat history between operating systems required additional work from both WhatsApp as well as operating system and device manufacturers in order to build it in a secure way, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Your WhatsApp messages belong to you. That&#8217;s why they are stored on your phone by default, and not accessible in the cloud like many other messaging services,&#8221; noted Sandeep Paruchuri, product manager at WhatsApp, in a statement about the launch. &#8220;We’re excited for the first time to make it easy for people to securely transfer their WhatsApp history from one operating system to another. This has been one of our most requested features from users for years and we worked together with operating systems and device manufacturers to solve it,&#8221; he added.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Singapore is home to fewer than six million people, making it one of the smallest ASEAN countries, in terms of population. It is a young country as well — having gained independence in 1963 — and resides in a neighborhood with far larger economies, including China, Indonesia, and Vietnam. When the country first became independent, its mandate was to simply survive rather than thrive.</p>
<p>So how does a country evolve from a position of relative uncertainty, with comparatively few resources, to one that leads the ASEAN region in venture capital investment and has been home to 10 unicorns?</p>
<p>Countries around the world examine Singapore’s ecosystem from a distance, hoping to learn from, and emulate, its story. The World Bank Group recently published a report, <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35328">The Evolution and State of Singapore’s Start-up Ecosystem</a>, documenting the country’s experience in building its startup ecosystem and the challenges facing it.</p>
<p>This article presents an overview of the report’s key findings and offers a few key recommendations on what other countries can learn from Singapore’s experience, as well as what Singapore itself can do to maintain progress.</p>
<h2>A glimpse into Singapore’s current startup ecosystem</h2>
<p>As of 2019, Singapore had over <a href="https://www.preqin.com/insights/research/reports/preqin-markets-in-focus-private-equity-venture-capital-in-southeast-asia">$19 billion</a> in PE and VC assets under management, more than twice that of neighboring Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand combined. In that same year, the country was home to an estimated 3,600 tech startups and nearly 200 different intermediary and supporting organizations (accelerators, co-working spaces, coding academies, etc.) &#8211; some which have a multinational presence, such as Blk71, whose Singapore headquarters has been referred to as “<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2014/01/16/all-together-now">the world’s most tightly packed entrepreneurial ecosystem</a>.”</p>
<p>While assessing the size and strength of startup ecosystems is an evolving method, Start-up Genome priced Singapore’s ecosystem at over <a href="https://startupgenome.com/reports/global-startup-ecosystem-report-2019">$25 billion</a>, five times the global median.</p>
<p>Arguably, the most eye-catching hallmark of this ecosystem is its population of current and former unicorns. Collectively, Singapore has been home to ten unicorns, three of which have offered an IPO (Nanofilm, Razer and Sea) and two of which have been acquired &#8211; one by giant Alibaba (Lazada) and one by Chinese streaming powerhouse YY (Bigo Live). The remaining five are Trax, Acronis, JustCo, PatSnap, and Grab &#8211; the ASEAN region’s largest unicorn to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The education sector is also prominent in Singapore’s ecosystem. Universities like the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) are deeply embedded into this ecosystem, helping with R&amp;D commercialization linkages, incubation, talent/knowledge transfer, and other areas.</p>
<h2>So, how did Singapore’s startup ecosystem come to be?</h2>
<p>Numerous factors have contributed to building Singapore’s startup ecosystem, with government intervention and leadership being the dominant driving forces. The government has spent more than <a href="https://www.preqin.com/insights/research/reports/preqin-markets-in-focus-private-equity-venture-capital-in-southeast-asia">USD60 billion</a> over the past several decades to enhance the country’s R&amp;D infrastructure, create VC funds, and launch accelerators and other support organizations.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams/">Apple loosening App Store restrictions</a>, <a href="https://weedmaps.com">Weedmaps</a> users can now purchase cannabis within the popular app. This means Weedmaps users can browse, select and purchase cannabis and have it set for pick-up or delivery — all within the app. Previously, users could only locate and browse menus of local retailers thanks in part to restrictions by Apple and local and federal guidelines.</p>
<p>The updated app is now available.</p>
<p>The change comes after Apple opened up the App Store for some cannabis apps. Under the new guidance, licensed cannabis operators fall under the same restrictions (to Apple) as licensed pharmacies, allowing apps like Weedmaps, which lists licensed cannabis operators, to offer such services.</p>
<p>“Our ability to enable ordering functionality through our mobile iOS app is a game-changer that will improve accessibility for both our customers and business partners alike,” said Justin Dean, chief technology officer at WM Technology, Inc. “We commend companies like Apple that work with industry leaders to find solutions that drive innovation in our space. It’s encouraging to see policies and attitudes toward cannabis shift in a way that promises remarkable growth, and we look forward to introducing an even simpler way to order cannabis from retailers through our platform.”</p>
<p>Weedmaps sits at a unique position in the marketplace. As one of the leading cannabis apps, it&#8217;s already used throughout the country. Unlike competing delivery services, like Eaze, Weedmaps is not facilitating delivery. It’s only providing a platform for licensed delivery dispensaries to list their goods and services.</p>

<p>Under the new App Store restrictions, apps like Weedmaps must limit users to ordering within a geo-restricted area where cannabis sales are legal. This means if a user is living in a place where cannabis sales are illegal, they cannot order from a dispensary in a legal area.</p>
<p>Here’s the previous Apple App Store policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco and vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies), marijuana, or tobacco is not allowed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s the updated policy as of June 7, with the changes highlighted in bold:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco and vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies and <strong>licensed or otherwise legal cannabis dispensaries</strong>), or tobacco is not allowed.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Apps that provide services in highly-regulated fields (such as banking and financial services, healthcare, gambling, <strong>legal cannabis use</strong>, and air travel) or that require sensitive user information should be submitted by a legal entity that provides the services, and not by an individual developer. <strong>Apps that facilitate the legal sale of cannabis must be geo-restricted to the corresponding legal jurisdiction.</strong></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://neeva.com/search?q=Joby+Aviation&amp;src=nvobar">Joby Aviation</a> is now public, twelve years after JoeBen Benvirt founded the company at his ranch in the Santa Cruz mountains. The air taxi developer began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol “JOBY,” after completing a merger with special purpose acquisition company Reinvent Technology Partners.</p>
<p>As of 10:00 AM ET, the price per share was at $11.01, up 9.8% from its prior-day closing amount.</p>
<p>Joby’s post-transaction valuation now stands at $4.5 billion, the largest in the industry. It also now has the highest cash balance. All told, Joby has around $1.6 billion in total capital to take its air taxi operations to commercialization in 2024. That includes $835 million of private-investment-in-public-equity as well as more than $500 million of capital on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>RTP <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-238165/">reported</a> to the Securities and Exchange Commission that around 63% of the 69 million ordinary shares were redeemed prior to the public trading debut, giving Joby access to $255 million out of the $690 million of cash held in trust from the blank-check firm.</p>

<p>It’s a sizable amount, but creating an entirely new form of transportation is a capital-intensive business. Joby’s executive chairman Paul Sciarra told TechCrunch he thinks $1.6 billion will be enough to prepare the company for launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We think that&#8217;s enough to execute on the things that matter over the next few years, and those are […] one, ensuring that we execute on the certification program; two, showing we can demonstrate our ability to repeatedly manufacturing these aircraft in a certifiable way; and then third and finally, the opportunity to lay the groundwork for commercial launch,” Sciarra said.</p>
<p>Joby is developing a five-seat electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, which it unveiled to much anticipation in February. The company, which has backing from Toyota and JetBlue, has released a slew of announcements in recent months as it geared up for the public listing.</p>
<p>“A lot of people talk about us as a secretive company,” Benvirt said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We&#8217;re not actually a secretive company, we just choose to do the work and then show our work, rather than talking about it and then doing it.”</p>

<h2>From $RTP to $JOBY</h2>
<p>Joby’s merger with blank-check firm Reinvent, headed by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/joby-aviation-takes-flight-into-the-public-markets-via-a-spac-merger/">announced in February</a>. The transaction includes a few provisions to ensure longer-term collaboration, including a lock-up on founder shares for up to five years, as well as vesting provision with earnout not realized until the price per share reaches $50 – a $30 billion market cap.</p>
<p>SPACs are not a new instrument for going public, but they have gained a widespread presence in the transportation space, particularly amongst eVTOL startups looking to secure amounts of capital. Archer Aviation was the first developer to announce it would merge with a blank-check firm, followed by Joby, Lilium and Vertical Aerospace. But there are signs that the investment bubble may be starting to deflate: late last month, Archer cut its valuation by $1 billion in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824502/000110465921097282/tm218061d22_ex99-1.htm">“strategic reset”</a> of the transaction terms with Atlas Crest Investment Corp.</p>
<p>Such turbulence is not uncommon in markets populated by pre-revenue companies. But despite now being a public company – and having shareholders to answer to – Sciarra said Joby’s task remains unchanged. “We can’t control the markets,” he said. “[Joby] is a company that&#8217;s been executing quietly for a very long time on things that matter. I think it&#8217;s going to be incumbent upon us to do the same as we make this transition to a public company: tell folks what we&#8217;re going to do, and then go out and do them. That, quarter by quarter, is what builds credibility, what combats skepticism, and what gives investors and frankly, the broader public, confidence that this is a company that means what it says.”</p>
<p>One way to frame the fate of air taxis is whether they will be more like autonomous vehicles or electric vehicles. The AV space circa five years ago was filled with companies setting ambitious expectations about when true self-driving cars would be on the roads, only to have multiple companies collapse or sell under the weight of overshot expectations.</p>
<p>But Sciarra suggested that a better analogy to the eVTOL industry as it currently stands is the early days of electric vehicles. He pointed out that Joby’s aircraft is designed to conform to existing safety and certification standards, with a trained pilot onboard, similar to how helicopters and planes operate today. “We didn&#8217;t want to compound the technical risk of developing a new aircraft with the technical and regulatory risk of developing full autonomy from day one.”</p>
<p>“We think about our approach as a little bit more Tesla versus, say, Waymo,” he added.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This week we were back to full strength, with Danny <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> to chat through the latest venture capital brouhaha. Namely whether or not venture capital is about to get shaken to its core, or if we&#8217;re really parsing some long-term economic trends that will eventually revert.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sam Lessin kicked off the Twitter conversation <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-end-of-venture-capital-as-we-know-it">by positing</a> that venture capital as we know it is kaput, with software and later-stage investing possibly seeing the most disruption.</li>
<li>Both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/venture-capital-probably-isnt-dead/">Alex</a> and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/vcs-are-not-going-away-anytime-soon/">Crunchbase News</a> posted responses to the concept, which could best be summarized as <em>yeah, but</em>.</li>
<li>However, the point that there <em>is </em>a lot of non-venture money flooding into startups is both real and material, and worth chewing on. So, masticate we did, parsing which areas of startup investing might be the most winsome for the VCs we spend so very much time talking to,</li>
</ul>
<p>The direction and future of the venture capital world has largely been lost amidst a sea of large numbers. New megarounds. New unicorns. That sort of thing. But inside the rising tide of capital available to private companies has been a mix-shift of sorts. The question is where that goes long-term. We tried to posit a few things that could happen next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Galaxy Z Flip is probably destined to forever play second fiddle to the Fold. And with its older and larger sibling now ascending to the ranks of “flagship” with a slew of new features like S-Pen functionality, the designation is probably all but inevitable.</p>
<p>But for those seriously considering the world of foldables, there’s something to be said for the clamshell devices. It has always been the more compact and &#8212; dare I say &#8212; accessible member of the Galaxy Z family. Of course, at $1,380 &#8212; well, let’s just say “accessibility” is relative.” At today’s Unpacked event, however, Samsung announced that the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is getting an even larger price drop than the Fold.</p>
<p>At $999.99, again, we’re speaking relatively here. But at the very least, a nearly $400 price drop brings the Flip into the realm of mainstream flagship pricing (the Fold 3, while cheaper than its predecessor, is still $1,799). Add onto that the learnings that come with a third-generation device, and there’s a case to be made that this is Samsung’s (and, probably the industry’s) most mainstream foldable to date. I mean, anything beats the original Razr foldable, right?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188121" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188121" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188121" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188121" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Obviously we’re going to hold out for a review unit until we’re able to say something more definitive on the matter. But while Samsung continues to lead with the Fold, don’t sleep on the alternative. Both devices have (understandably) prioritized durability among their new features. That includes a stronger protective film made of PET plastic, coupled with a reconfiguration of the display panels aimed at reinforcing what has traditionally been the weak link on these products.</p>
<p>Also on board is Samsung’s new proprietary Armor Aluminum for the body, Gorilla Glass Victus for the exterior of the device and IPX8 water resistance. That means the new foldables can withstand significantly more water than their predecessors. The “X” in the rating means it’s not rated against debris, due to the nature of the hinges, but Samsung believes the sweeping mechanism it introduced on previous models can make quick work of particulate matter that could potentially fall behind the screen and damage it in the process of pressing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188122" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188122" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188122" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188122" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The phone has also gotten a striking redesign. When closed, I’d say it’s a considerably better-looking device than the Fold &#8212; not to mention significantly easier to port around in your pocket. The device now comes in Cream, Green, Lavender and Black, coupled with a variety of different grips and straps. If you get it online, you can also choose a Gray, Pink or White version. The internal display is effectively the same as its predecessor at 6.7 inches (2640 x 1080), but the front screen has been further increasing from 1.1 to 1.9 inches &#8212; a not insignificant bump when we’re dealing with those sizes.</p>
<p>The cameras remain roughly the same as the Flip 2:</p>
<ol>
<li>Front: 10MP Selfie. F2.4, Pixel size: 1.22μm, FOV: 80-degree</li>
<li>Rear: 12MP Ultra Wide. F2.2, Pixel size: 1.12μm, FOV: 123-degree</li>
<li>Rear 2: 12MP Wide-angle. Dual Pixel AF, OIS, F1.8 Pixel size: 1.4μm, FOV: 78-degree</li>
</ol>
<p><div id="attachment_2188117" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188117" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188117" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9777.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9777.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9777.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9777.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9777.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9777.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9777.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9777.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9777.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188117" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The battery is (understandably) a fair bit smaller than the Fold’s at 3,300mAh, split over two modules (because, folding). It supports fast-wired and wireless charging, as well as Samsung’s Wireless PowerShare for giving some juice back to your other devices. Like the Fold, the new flip is powered by the Snapdragon 888. Here that’s coupled with 8GB of RAM and either 128 or 256GB of storage.</p>
<p>Like the other devices announced today, the Flip is now up for preorder and starts shipping August 26. Preordering will get you a $150 Samsung Credit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Behold, Samsung’s latest flagship. With the Galaxy Note out of the way &#8212; for this year, at least &#8212; the company used today’s Unpacked event to breathe added legitimacy into its foldable line. The original Galaxy Fold, introduced in 2019, represent a sort of experiment for the company (along with all the hiccups that entailed), as the first foldable from a major hardware manufacture, whereas last year’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 found the company correcting some of the glaring issues with its predecessor.</p>
<p>Today’s event finds the company making the case for Galaxy Z Fold 3 as something beyond an experiment or a curiosity. The task will almost certainly be an uphill battle for the next few generations. Unlike the latest version of the Flip, which starts at a price reduced considerably from its predecessor, the new Fold drops the entry price $200, down to $1,800. Any price reduction is a step in the right direction &#8212; and something that should be increasingly feasible as the technology continues to scale. But even in the world of premium flagships, that will continue to be a tough pill to swallow.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188115" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188115" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2188115" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188115" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>What the upgraded Fold truly brings to the table, however, is a continued refinement to build materials that make the foldable screen a feasible option for day to day usage. This, of course, is precisely what hamstrung the original. Sure, the company did a lot of testing in controlled rooms, but once the product got out into the world (and into the hands of non-Samsung employees), problems of durability began cropping up, resulting in displays that were unintentionally damaged in a variety of imaginative ways.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Fold features a stronger frame made of “Armor Aluminum,” new protective film for the foldable display, Gorilla Glass Victus on the front-facing screen and an IPX8 rating &#8212; representing the first waterproof rating for the company’s foldable. Waterproofing has, of course, become something of an industry standard, but obviously things complicate quickly when you add folding mechanisms into the equation.</p>
<p>In fact, that’s why the rating has an “X” stuck in the middle of it. It’s effectively protected from accidental dunks in water, but not dust and debris. This is due to the hinge mechanism created for earlier models that allows some particulate matter through, but sweeps it away with a built in brush that moves as the device opens. That effectively protects it from getting behind the screen, where it could damage the phone with a finger press on the other side.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2188123" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188123" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2188123" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188123" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, the stronger protective film is the thing. It’s what’s (hopefully) standing between you and damaging your phone’s biggest selling point with an overzealous finger press &#8212; or, for that matter, a stylus. The Fold, after all, is following in the footsteps of Samsung’s S series by blurring the line with the Note (which handily opted to sit this round out).</p>
<p>In fact, Samsung actually went out of its way to create a special Fold Edition of the S-Pen specially designed to not damage the Fold display. It’s optional, of course, and as with the S21, there’s slot for the stylus in the handset &#8212; that’s to be expected, given the relatively fragility of the product. There will, of course, be a case with a built-in S-Pen holster.</p>
<p>The Fold Edition S-Pen is smaller and features a spring-loaded tip designed to retract so you don’t damage the screen by writing/drawing too hard. Certainly the Fold is a clear candidate for stylus functionality, given its 7.6-inch canvas that puts even the Note Ultra’s 6.9-inch screen to shame. Of course, the feasibility of this combination has been severely hampered by structural integrity issues with the screen. It will be interesting to see how the company has managed to navigate that.</p>
<p>At 7.6 inches (<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">2208 x 1768, 374 ppi), the primary screen is largely unchanged. The cover screen, too, is about the same, at </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">6.2 inches &#8212; though it now joins the main screen with a 120 Hz refresh rate. </span></p>

<p>Notably, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the first Samsung device to add an under-display camera. That, along with foldable displays, has been one of the biggest holy grails in the smartphone category for the past several years. Samsung’s not the first to introduce the technology. A handful of Chinese manufacturers, including Xiaomi and Oppo, have either released or plan to release devices sporting the technology.</p>
<p>It’s telling that the company opted to test the water with the Fold. Aside from the obvious aspect of creating a contiguous display, it gives the company the opportunity to test out another mainstream technology. The dirty little secret about the first generation of under-screen cameras is that the picture quality tends to suck. Samsung surely knows this and has opted to stick it on a device that already has a selfie camera above its front display.</p>
<p>The company describes new tech as follows, “the minimum pixels applied on top of the camera hole, Z Fold 3 features an increased viewable area so users get an unbroken canvas for their favorite apps.” The thinking here is that the internal camera simply doesn’t get as much use, save for things like teleconferencing (which is, granted, something we’ve been doing a lot more of in the past year). As currently configured, it’s a bit of a compromise on both ends. Picture quality takes a hit and the camera hole is still semi-visible. So, either the best or worst of both worlds, depending on what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>The under-display camera is four megapixels (when was the last time you saw one of those?), verses the 10-megapixel front/cover camera. The rear camera setup is virtually identical to its predecessor:</p>
<ul>
<li>12MP Ultra Wide. F2.2, Pixel size: 1.12μm, FOV: 123-degree</li>
<li>12MP Wide-angle. Dual Pixel AF, OIS, F1.8, Pixel size: 1.8μm, FOV: 83-degree</li>
<li>12MP Telephoto. PDAF, F2.4, OIS, Pixel size: 1.0μm, FOV: 45-degree</li>
</ul>
<p>The battery has taken a bit of a hit, down from 4,500 to 4,400mAh (spread out over two modules, as is the foldable way). The Fold also supports fast charge/fast wireless and Wireless Powershare to use that 4,400mAh battery to power other gadgets. Samsung generally doesn’t offer battery estimates for phones prior to release, so wait on the review for that. The whole thing is powered by a Snapdragon 888 chip (market depending), coupled with 12GB of RAM and either 256 or 512GB of storage.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the devices announced today, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is up for preorder now and starts shipping on the 26th. The $1,800 price tag continues to be a roadblock toward more mainstream adoption, though the company has moved a number of these devices to early adopters already. Preorders get a $200 Samsung Credit.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Today, the release of OpenAI Codex, a new Al system that translates natural language to code, marks the beginning of a shift in how computer software is written.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, there&#8217;s been growing talk about “no code&#8221; platforms, but this is no new phenomenon. The reality is, ever since the first programmable devices, computer scientists have regularly developed breakthroughs in how we &#8220;code&#8221; computer software.</p>
<p>The first computers were programmed with switches or punch cards, until the keyboard was invented. Coding became a matter of typing numbers or machine language, until Grace Hopper invented the modern compiler and the COBOL language, ushering in decades of innovation in programming languages and platforms. Languages like Fortran, Pascal, C, Java and Python evolved in a progression, where the newest language (built using an older language) enabled programmers to &#8220;code&#8221; using increasingly more human language.</p>
<p>Alongside languages, we&#8217;ve seen the evolution of “no-code” platforms — including Microsoft Excel, the 1980s granddaddy of no-code — that empower people to program computers in a visual interface, whether in school or in the workplace. Anytime you write a formula in a spreadsheet, or when you drag a block of code on<a href="http://Code.org"> Code.org</a> or Scratch, you&#8217;re programming, or &#8220;coding,” a computer. “No code” <em>is</em> code. Every decade, a breakthrough innovation makes it easier to write code so that the old way of coding is replaced by the new.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Does this mean coding is dead? No! It doesn&#8217;t replace the need for a programmer to understand code. It means coding just got much easier, higher impact and thus more important.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This brings us to today&#8217;s announcement. Today, OpenAl announced OpenAI Codex, an entirely new way to “write code” in the natural English language. A computer programmer can now use English to describe what they want their software to do, and OpenAl&#8217;s generative Al model will automatically generate the corresponding computer code, in your choice of programming language. This is what we&#8217;ve always wanted — for computers to understand what we want them to do, and then do it, without having to go through a complex intermediary like a programming language.</p>
<p>But this is not an end, it is a beginning. With Al-generated code, one can imagine an evolution in every programming tool, in every programming class, and a Cambrian explosion of new software. Does this mean coding is dead? No! It doesn&#8217;t replace the need for a programmer to understand code. It means coding just got much easier, higher impact and thus more important, just as when punch cards were replaced by keyboards, or when Grace Hopper invented the compiler.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, the demand for software today is greater than ever and will only continue to grow. As this technology evolves, Al will play a greater role in generating code, which will multiply the productivity and impact of computer scientists, and will make this field accessible to more and more computer programmers.</p>
<p>There are already tools that let you <a href="https://bubble.io/">program using only drag-and-drop</a>, or to <a href="https://serenade.ai/">write code using your voice</a>. Improvements in these technologies and new tools, like OpenAI Codex, will increasingly democratize the ability to create software. As a result, the amount of code — and the number of coders — in the world will increase.</p>
<p>This also means that learning how to program — in a new way — is more important than ever. Learning to code can unlock doors to opportunity and also help solve global problems. As it becomes easier and more accessible to create software, we should give every student in every school the fundamental knowledge to not only be a user of technology but also a creator.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In what has quickly become the busiest Unpacked of the virtual era, Samsung just dropped a new version of its wireless earbuds. The Galaxy Buds 2 add active noise canceling to the entry-level model, while retaining the $149 price point.</p>
<p>For those keeping track, the current Galaxy Buds offerings are Buds 2 ($149), Buds Live ($170) and Buds Pro ($200). The addition pretty clearly blurs the line between the first two. Asked for clarification on how the offerings now shake out, Samsung tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>As our premium offering, the Galaxy Buds Pro leverage cutting-edge technology to deliver immersive audio, intelligent Active noise cancelling, and effortless connectivity. For those looking to show off their unique style, the Galaxy Buds Live combine high quality sound with an eye-catching design.</p></blockquote>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9oi5kEolUI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsung-answers-apple-with-the-199-galaxy-buds-pro/">Samsung answers Apple with the $199 Galaxy Buds Pro</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So, design and sound are the differentiators. The Buds Live were, of course, introduced during a time when ANC was more of an exception than a rule for nonpremium-priced earbuds, so I wouldn’t be too surprised to see them start to be phased out.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2188137" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>As I’ve said in the past, Samsung’s earbuds have always been quietly solid. They don’t get the love of Apple or Sony in that department, but the company has consistently produced solid buds, and I don’t see any reason to expect these will be any different. Of course, the Pros still sit at the high end, in terms of sound quality, 360 audio, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Samsung says the new Buds are their smallest and lightest to date. Indeed, the Buds, the case and everything are quite compact (and surprisingly glossy!). They retain the familiar ovular shape that sits up against the wearer’s ear. They’re built specifically to pair with the company’s mobile devices, but you should be able to connect them to any Bluetooth device.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Along with a surge in connected fitness funding, it seems that rowing machines are really having their moment. In April, Ergatta announced a $30 million raise, last month, CityRow announced a $12 million round for its studios and home machines, and today, Aviron is announcing a $4.5 million round. A rising tide and all that good stuff.</p>
<p>The round, which includes Samsung Next, Formic Ventures, GFC and Y Combinator, follows $750,000 in early-stage funding. As we noted in January, the Toronto-based startup spent much of the pandemic (understandably) pivoting from gym equipment to connected home fitness. As more people look to rowing as a full-body alternative to cycling that’s much kinder on your knees than running, the company’s looking to differentiate itself through gamification.</p>

<p>“We’re going a lot harder on the gamification side of things,” founder and CEO Andy Hoang tells TechCrunch. “And that’s the biggest differentiator between, say, us and a Peloton or a Hydro. They focus almost exclusively on instructor-led classes, while we focus on these high-intensity races and fully animated games, where you’re shooting bugs or running away from zombies.”</p>
<p>Last month, however, Peloton announced plans to compete more directly on the game side of things, with plans to roll out in late-2021/early 2022. The first product is a Tron-esque racing game. “Peloton created Lanebreak to complement instructor-led classes with a fresh new experience for members, giving them more ways to stay engaged and motivated with their workouts,” the company wrote in a release last month. Aviron says it’s trying to add something deeper.</p>

<p>“What makes Aviron really different is we’re not gamifying the fitness experience by added new graphics or achievements to the end of your workout,” says Hoang. “What we’re doing is gaming the fitness experience. What makes games really fun and exciting isn’t the bells and whistles. It’s the characters, it’s the story, discovering new things and unlocking them.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company has already begun to increase headcount. Last time we checked in, Aviron was at 10 full-time employees. The company has increased to 25, roughly half of whom are involved in its game development team.</p>
<p>“We’re constantly looking for people. Content is our focus, and we’re hiring the right people for marketing and branding,” adds Hoang. “We’re doing a whole new rebrand.”</p>
