										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck shared more details on the company’s next launch, which is set to take off from its New Zealand facility on May 15. The Electron vehicle will be carrying satellites from BlackSky, but delivering that payload is only half of the mission: the other half will be recovering the booster stage after an ocean splashdown.</p>
<p>This is the second of three planned booster recovery missions, part of Rocket Lab&#8217;s long-term plan to reach reusability for its launch vehicle, an achievement most famously held by its competitor SpaceX. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/rocket-lab-makes-its-first-booster-recovery-after-successful-launch/">The first recovery mission</a>, dubbed “Return to Sender,” successfully splashed down in the Atlantic in November. While Beck told reporters Tuesday the condition of that booster “was remarkable,” this upcoming mission nevertheless features a number of component and system upgrades aimed at further fortifying the booster.</p>
<p>Most notably, the booster will be equipped with a redesigned heat shield made out of stainless steel, rather than aluminum, “designed to carry the reentry loads as well as the ascent loads,” Beck said. Electron must endure temperatures as high as 2400ºC during reentry, conditions the original equipment wasn&#8217;t intended to handle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also introducing what it’s calling the Ocean Recovery and Capture Apparatus, or ORCA, a dedicated system to help lift the rocket stage out of the water and onto the deck of a ship. Rough seas in November presented a challenge to the recovery effort, though ultimately the booster was not damaged.</p>
<p>The mission will also reuse components from the recovered booster, which (although the booster itself was dismantled) were subsequently inspected and requalified for flight. “From here on in, we should be able to reuse this system on every single launch vehicle that we&#8217;ve been bringing back,” Beck said.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab is pursuing a unique route to reusability. As opposed to the approach from SpaceX, whose Falcon 9 rockets use powered decelerations and landings, Rocket Lab’s approach with Electron is to decelerate the vehicle passively using the atmosphere and a parachute.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;&#8216;Complete Success&#8217;: Rocket Lab&#8217;s booster recovery is a big step toward reusability&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/complete-success-rocket-labs-booster-recovery-is-a-big-step-towards-reusability/embed/#?secret=drLkAA3ePq" data-secret="drLkAA3ePq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The reentry method is constrained by the size of the launch vehicle, Beck explained. “You don’t really have that ability to carry extra fuel to do maneuvers or deceleration burns or anything like that,” he said. Instead, the vehicle enters engines-first and propagates a massive shockwave on its journey back to Earth, carefully managed to reduce peak heat on its vulnerable parts. This results in a nearly negligible payload reduction: about 10%, as opposed to the 30-40% required for a propulsive landing. These are very tight margins, Beck acknowledged:</p>
<p>“This is not a simple thing to do. It sounds pretty basic – let’s just bring the stage back and put it under a parachute and splash down – but actually, doing it with no significant reentry elements and just using the atmosphere to do all the work is really challenging.”</p>
<p>The final splashdown recovery mission will take place before the end of 2021, Beck said, and will include improvements to the decelerator and a more general block upgrade. Once these missions are complete, Rocket Lab will turn to its ultimate goal: to do away with splashdown recovery altogether and to retrieve the booster mid-descent under its parachute using a helicopter.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company’s next rocket will be the Neutron, “a vehicle designed for reusability from day one,” Beck said. The Neutron will be much larger than its predecessor and capable of lifting heavier payloads to orbit. He estimated that Rocket Lab will construct one Neutron rocket per year and aim to operate a fleet of four to begin with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For Subaru diehards holding out for an electric vehicle, the wait is almost over. The Japanese automaker just announced new details about its first ever EV, which is set to hit the streets in 2022.</p>
<p>Subaru will call its first EV the Solterra, a fitting name for a brand synonymous with outdoor adventures and you know, the sun and the Earth. Also fittingly, Subaru&#8217;s first full-fledged EV will be an SUV thats ships with the manufacturer&#8217;s well-regarded all-wheel drive capabilities.</p>
<p>The Solterra is built on a new platform the company is developing in partnership with Toyota, which the latter company will use for its impossibly named BZ4X crossover (BZ stands for &#8220;beyond zero,&#8221; apparently).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Subaru has only released two teaser images so far, but given that the new SUV will share DNA with the Toyota BZ4X, Subaru&#8217;s offering will likely look like a toned-down, less aggressively styled version of Toyota&#8217;s forthcoming futuristic electric crossover.</p>
<p>Other than that, we don&#8217;t know a whole lot. If the Solterra winds up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/all-the-electric-vehicles-that-stood-out-at-the-shanghai-auto-show/">looking a lot like the BZ4X</a>, you can expect a sort of squashed RAV4, maybe somewhere between a Crosstrek and a Forester in size.</p>
<p>Subaru&#8217;s first proper EV will join the plug-in hybrid Crosstrek, which the company began selling in 2014 — currently its only option for climate-conscious drivers. The Solterra will go on sale next year in the U.S., Canada, China, Europe, and Japan.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As vice president of Innovation at <a href="https://ngpartners.com/">National Grid Partners</a>, I’m responsible for developing initiatives that not only benefit National Grid’s current business but also have the potential to become stand-alone businesses. So I obviously have strong views about the future of the energy industry.</p>
<p>But I don’t have a crystal ball; no one does. To be a good steward of our innovation portfolio, my job isn’t to guess what the right &#8220;basket&#8221; is for our &#8220;eggs.&#8221; It’s to optimally allocate our finite eggs across multiple baskets with the greatest collective upside.</p>
<p>Put another way, global and regional trends make it clear that the Next Big Thing isn’t any single thing at all. Instead, the future is about open innovation and integration of elements across <em>the entire energy supply chain.</em> Only with such an open energy ecosystem can we adapt to the highly volatile — some might even say unpredictable — market conditions we face in the energy industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

		<blockquote>
			Just as the digital internet rewards innovation wherever it serves the market — whether you build a better app or design a cooler smartphone — so too will the energy internet offer greater opportunities across the energy supply chain.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I like to think of this open, innovation-enabling approach as the &#8220;energy internet,&#8221; and I believe it represents the most important opportunity in the energy sector today.</p>
<h2>The internet analogy</h2>
<p>Here’s why I find the concept of the energy internet helpful. Before the digital internet (a term I’m using here to encompass all the hardware, software and standards that comprise it), we had multiple silos of technology such as mainframes, PCs, databases, desktop applications and private networks.</p>
<p>As the digital internet evolved, however, the walls between these silos disappeared. You can now utilize any platform on the back end of your digital services, including mainframes, commodity server hardware and virtual machines in the cloud.</p>
<p>You can transport digital payloads across networks that connect to any customer, supplier or partner on the planet with whatever combination of speed, security, capacity and cost you deem most appropriate. That payload can be data, sound or video, and your endpoint can be a desktop browser, smartphone, IoT sensor, security camera or retail kiosk.</p>
<p>This mix-and-match internet created an open digital supply chain that has driven an epochal boom in online innovation. Entrepreneurs and inventors can focus on specific value propositions anywhere across that supply chain rather than having to continually reinvent the supply chain itself.</p>
<p>The energy sector must move in the same direction. We need to be able to treat our various generation modalities like server platforms. We need our transmission grids to be as accessible as our data networks, and we need to be able to deliver energy to any consumption endpoint just as flexibly. We need to encourage innovation at those endpoints, too — just as the tech sector did.</p>
<p>Just as the digital internet rewards innovation wherever it serves the market — whether you build a better app or design a cooler smartphone — so too will the energy internet offer greater opportunities across the energy supply chain.</p>
<h2>The 5D future</h2>
<p>So what is the energy internet? As a foundation, let’s start with a model that takes the existing industry talk of digitalization, decentralization and decarbonization a few steps further:</p>
<p><strong>Digitalization:</strong> Innovation depends on information about demand, supply, efficiency, trends and events. That data must be accurate, complete, timely and sharable. Digitalization efforts such as IoE, open energy, and what many refer to as the &#8220;smart grid&#8221; are instrumental because they ensure innovators have the insights they need to continuously improve the physics, logistics and economics of energy delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Decentralization:</strong> The internet changed the world in part because it took the power of computing out of a few centralized data centers and distributed it wherever it made sense. The energy internet will do likewise. Digitalization supports decentralization by letting assets be integrated into an open energy supply chain. But decentralization is much more than just the integration of existing assets — it’s the proliferation of new assets wherever they’re needed.</p>
<p><strong>Decarbonization:</strong> Decarbonization is, of course, the whole point of the exercise. We must move to greener supply chains built on decentralized infrastructure that leverage energy supply everywhere to meet energy demand anywhere. The market is demanding it and regulators are requiring it. The energy internet is therefore more than just an investment opportunity — it’s an existential imperative.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How one founder realized the potential of sustainable energy stored deep below our feet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/08/how-one-founder-realized-the-potential-of-sustainable-energy-stored-deep-below-our-feet/embed/#?secret=3g3Uliqoic" data-secret="3g3Uliqoic" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Democratization:</strong> Much of the innovation associated with the internet arose from the fact that, in addition to decentralizing technology physically, it also democratized technology demographically. Democratization is about putting power (literally, in this case) into the hands of the people. Vastly increasing the number of minds and hands tackling the energy industry’s challenges will also accelerate innovation and enhance our ability to respond to market dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity:</strong> As I asserted above, no one has a crystal ball. So anyone investing in innovation at scale should diversify — not just to mitigate risk and optimize returns, but as an <em>enablement</em> strategy. After all, if we truly believe the energy internet (or Grid 2.0, if you prefer that term) will require that all the elements of the energy supply chain work together, we must diversify our innovation initiatives across those elements to promote interoperability and integration.</p>
<p>That’s how the digital internet was built. Standards bodies played an important role, but those standards and their implementations were driven by industry players like Microsoft and Cisco — as well as top VCs — who ensured the ecosystem’s success by driving integration across the supply chain.</p>
<p>We must take the same approach with the energy internet. Those with the power and influence to do so must help ensure we aggressively advance integration across the energy supply chain as a whole, even as we improve the individual elements. To this end, National Grid last year kicked off a new industry group called the <a href="https://ngpartners.com/change-is-coming-time-for-a-conversation/">NextGrid Alliance</a>, which includes senior executives from more than 60 utilities across the world.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe it’s essential to diversify thinking within the energy ecosystem as well. National Grid has sounded alarms about the <a href="https://www.nationalgrid.com/document/126256/download">serious underrepresentation</a> of women in the energy industry and of female undergraduates in STEM programs. On the flip side, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/deloitte-review/issue-22/diversity-and-inclusion-at-work-eight-powerful-truths.html">research by Deloitte</a> has found diverse teams are 20% more innovative. More than 60% of my own team at NGP are women, and that breadth of perspective has helped National Grid capture <a href="https://ngpartners.com/snapshot-of-innovation/">powerful insights</a> into companywide innovation efforts.</p>
<h2>More winning, less predicting</h2>
<p>The concept of the energy internet isn’t some abstract future ideal. We’re already seeing specific examples of how it will transform the market:</p>
<p><strong>Green transnationalism:</strong> The energy internet is on its way to becoming as global as the digital internet. The U.K., for instance, is now receiving <a href="https://www.nationalgrid.com/our-businesses/national-grid-ventures/interconnectors-connecting-cleaner-future">wind-generated power</a> from Norway and Denmark. This ability to leverage decentralized energy supply across borders will have significant benefits for national economies and create new opportunities for energy arbitrage.</p>
<p><strong>EV charging models:</strong> Pumping electricity isn’t like pumping gas, nor should it be. With the right combination of innovation in smart metering and fast-charging end-point design, the energy internet will create new opportunities at office buildings, residential complexes and other places where cars plus convenience can equal cash.</p>
<p><strong>Disaster mitigation:</strong> Recent events in Texas have highlighted the negative consequences of not having an energy internet. Responsible utilities and government agencies must embrace digitization and interoperability to more effectively troubleshoot infrastructure and better safeguard communities.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the myriad ways in which an open, any-to-any energy internet will promote innovation, stimulate competition and generate big wins. No one can predict exactly what those big wins will be, but there will surely be many, and they will accrue to the benefit of all.</p>
<p>That’s why even without a crystal ball, we should all commit ourselves to digitalization, decentralization, decarbonization, democratization and diversity. In so doing, we’ll build the energy internet together, and enable a fair, affordable and clean energy future.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With more than 200,000 customers, a market cap of nearly $56 billion, and the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/twilio-acquires-segment">recent acquisition of</a> Segment for $3.2 billion, Twilio is a SaaS behemoth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine companies like Twilio as anything but a giant. But everybody starts out small, and you can usually trace success back to key decisions made in the early days.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			First, you need to have a product that developers can actually sign up for. This means ditching demos for real-time free trials or freemium tools.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For Twilio, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/11/an-inside-look-at-bessemer-venture-partners-investment-process-for-twilio/">a big differentiator</a> was being one of the first technology-focused SaaS organizations that focused on empowering and building for the end user (which in their case is developers) with a self-service function. Another differentiator was, the executive team designed the organization to create tight feedback loops between sales and product with national roadshows, during which CEO Jeff Lawson frequently met with users.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1447669/000119312516733893/d237988ds1.htm">Twilio’s “secret sauce” per their S-1</a> is a developer-focused model and a strong belief in the future of software. They encourage developers to explore and innovate with Twilio’s flexible offering, which led to an incredible 155% net-dollar expansion rate at the time of the IPO.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Twilio put the product in the hands of teams before the sale happened, standing by to answer hard questions about how Twilio would fit into their infrastructure. This was pretty rare at the time — sales engineering resources aren’t cheap — and it was a strong differentiating factor. So much so that when the company went public, they were growing at 106% annually.</p>
<p>Twilio sells to developers at large enterprises by solving a problem that developers come up against regularly: Getting in touch with customers.</p>
<p>But as more successful public software companies emerge, it’s clear that Twilio’s secret sauce can and will be replicated.</p>
<h2>Why traditional marketing doesn’t work on developers</h2>
<div class="p-rich_text_section">Before I started looking at successful developer-focused businesses, I understood the developer-focused playbook to look a little like this:</div>
<ol class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__ordered" data-stringify-type="ordered-list" data-indent="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="0">Don’t hire marketing (or sales, either). If you do, hire someone super experienced from an enterprise sales background. And then fire them within three to six months.</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0">Just hire someone who’s passionate about the product to “manage the community.” What is community management? Lots of swag. Cool meetups. Publish 1–2 articles as a stab at content (bonus points if they’re listicles). Oh, wait. How can we show the ROI here? Make the community manager do that until she quits. Repeat.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s beginning to feel a bit like 2020, as yet another major manufacturer has announced that it won’t be attending MWC’s upcoming in person event in Barcelona. Roughly a month and a half out, Samsung is joining a growing list of companies that already includes Google, IBM, Nokia, Sony, Oracle and Ericsson.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of our employees, partners and customers is our number one priority, so we have made the decision to withdraw from exhibiting in-person at this year’s Mobile World Congress,” the company said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. &#8220;We look forward to participating virtually and continuing to work with GSMA and industry partners to advance new mobile experiences.”</p>
<p>In the lead up to last year&#8217;s event, there was something of a domino effect, as companies ducked out, one by one, ultimately leading up to the event&#8217;s cancelation. Obviously things are fairly different more than a year later. The virus is certainly less of an unknown, but its effects are still have a massive impact on much of the world. Even in those places where vaccination rollout has been swift, there are still plenty of question marks when it comes to attending a global event in massive, tightly-packed spaces. MWC had already been pushed back several months from its standard February-March timeframe, but organizers have so far been confident about the inevitability of an in-person event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MWC&#8217;s governing body &#8212; the GSMA &#8212; recently told TechCrunch, &#8220;We appreciate that it will not be possible for everyone to attend <span class="il">MWC</span> Barcelona 2021, but we are pleased that exhibitors including Verizon, Orange and Kasperksy are  excited to join us in Barcelona. To ensure everyone can enjoy the unique <span class="il">MWC</span> experience, we have developed an industry-leading virtual event platform. The in-person and virtual options are provided so that all friends of <span class="il">MWC</span> Barcelona can attend and participate in a way that works for them. &#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out for an additional comment following Samsung&#8217;s statement. The GSMA has been positioning MWC as something of a hybrid event &#8212; similar to the upcoming Computex in Taipei. It&#8217;s difficult to say at this point what the in-person aspect is going to look like when so many high profile companies have opted out. Either way, it seems safe to assume that &#8212; even as things return to relative normal &#8212; the virtual aspect won&#8217;t be going away any time soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s the golden age of collectibles and legacy institutions are looking to move beyond trading cards, embracing new tech that brings the fandom together online. <a href="http://sequoiagames.com/">Sequoia Games</a>, a new game studio launching out of stealth, is aiming for a hit with its tabletop AR game that&#8217;s looking to find an audience in a post-Top Shot world.</p>
<p>With a game that seems to be trading cards meets Catan meets NFTs meets augmented reality, Flex NBA is aiming to capture some of the magic that Dapper Labs did with NBA Top Shot, albeit with a title reliant on physical collectibles and a tabletop game.</p>
<p>Collectibles are incredibly hot right now and while there&#8217;s been a lot of attention on digital-only collectibles, Sequoia Games&#8217; hybrid approach is probably one that will likely find some new audience segments. The game is centered around these hexagonal discs that function like trading cards but can be tracked inside its mobile app with 3D animations of the players superimposed on top of them. With mechanics similar to other popular trading card games, users can augment those tiles with power-up tiles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Users get a handful of tiles that vary depending on the tier of their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flexnba/the-worlds-first-pro-sports-ar-board-game">Kickstarter</a> pledge, but going forward, the startup is planning to sell the tiles in randomized packs as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150568" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150568" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2150568 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/af59d273e07f264ed8190e6683ab4405_original.png" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/af59d273e07f264ed8190e6683ab4405_original.png 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/af59d273e07f264ed8190e6683ab4405_original.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/af59d273e07f264ed8190e6683ab4405_original.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/af59d273e07f264ed8190e6683ab4405_original.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150568" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Sequoia Games</p></div></p>
<p>Users register these tiles inside their app where the ownership of individual tiles is tracked across the network using something that sounds an awful lot like a blockchain &#8212; though that&#8217;s a word the team was very careful to avoid using. What&#8217;s interesting is that once the tiles are registered users can play the game in-person or online. The company is working on first-party marketplace for the tiles, though buyers will have to actually purchase and ship the physical tiles even if they are only playing on mobile.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Like Top Shot, Sequoia Games boasts an official partnership with the NBA and national players&#8217; association. Unlike Dapper Labs, they&#8217;re not currently sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars of venture money. The startup&#8217;s founder says they&#8217;ve raised a modest seed round and are in the process of closing a more sizable Series A. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Also unlike Top Shot, which can &#8212; and has been able to &#8212; rapidly adjust supply of new moments to meet demand, Sequoia Games is stuck in the physical world and is thus a little more supply-confined &#8212; one of the reasons they&#8217;ve chosen to do a </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kickstarter</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to gauge interest from potential users early-on.</span></p>
<p>Prices for the tiers of Kickstarter tiers vary pretty wildly, with a $35 basic pack that includes the most common tiles and a $699 &#8220;Supreme Flex Domination Pack&#8221; that boast rarer items like MVP-level player tiles. The startup plans to start shipping out packs in July.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African e-commerce giant Jumia today <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/836376591/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Jumia-Q1.21-11.05.21.pdf">shared its earnings</a> for the first quarter of 2021 that ended in March</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While its customer count grew, a drop in the company&#8217;s revenues spoke to the fact that it is still reeling from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most areas in Africa where Jumia operates have lifted their lockdown restrictions, but some countries like Morocco and Kenya still have curfews</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia said while these measures didn&#8217;t lead to meaningful changes in consumer behavior, its supply and logistics chain &#8212; especially for its food delivery business JumiaFood &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was disrupted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia, which raised more than $570 million over the past six months to strengthen its balance sheet, posted first-quarter revenues of €27.4 million. This is a 6% drop from the €29.3 million that it reported in Q1 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its operating loss for Q1 2021 came to €33.7 million, while its more forgiving adjusted EBITDA loss stood at €27.0 million. The two numbers fell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 23% and 24%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the company continues its slow march toward profitability</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia has never turned a profit, but its co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec have made it clear in the past that the company wants that to change</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was also a point of reference in their investor comments today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drivers remain consistent: selective and disciplined usage growth, gradual monetization, and continued cost discipline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first quarter of 2021 was the sixth consecutive quarter of positive gross profit after fulfillment expense, which reached €6.2 million, more than doubling year-over-year, while Adjusted EBITDA loss contracted by 24% year-over-year, reaching €27.0 million,” they said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to falling losses, Jumia had other positive metrics to share. The giant e-tailer saw its active customer base grow 7% year-over-year to 6.9 million. And orders also increased by 3% to 6.6 million, a reversal of the declining trend observed over the preceding two quarters. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the total worth of goods sold via Jumia this quarter (GMV) was just €165.0 million, a 13% decrease from the €189.6 million it recorded in Q1 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s gross profit also reached €20.4 million in 2020, representing a year-over-year gain of 11% from €18.4 million in Q1 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia cited two reasons for this drop. One was currency</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> devaluation of Nigeria&#8217;s naira, Egypt&#8217;s pound and Kenya&#8217;s shilling against the euro, the currency in which it reports</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the company, the trio dropped 15%, 9% and 19%, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the euro in Q1 2021. And second, the company&#8217;s best-performing product category (phones and electronics) did </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">poorly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Q1 2020, those items accounted for 45% of its GMV volume, which fell to 37% this quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JumiaPay, the payments arm of the company, continued to post modest growth. This time last year the product processed 2.3 million transactions worth €35.5 million. In Q1 2021, JumiaPay transactions rose 6.7%, to 2.4 million transactions on a year-on-year basis. The recent quarter&#8217;s total payment volume also grew 21% to €42.9 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the report, Jumia has broadened the capabilities of its payment product. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It now offers SMEs on the continent access to short-term credit by leveraging business and transactional data of its sellers to pre-score credit on an anonymized basis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company said it disbursed 380 loans in Q1 2021, up 90% from Q1 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These loans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were given</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 291 sellers across its platform, representing a 62% increase from the number of sellers that accessed last year&#8217;s loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia reported €485.6 million of unrestricted cash at the end of the first quarter of 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes gross proceeds of about €205 million it secured from the offering completed on March 30, 2021, and €88 million cash booked in April 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The tabletop gaming industry has exploded over the last few years as millions discovered or rediscovered its joys, but it too is evolving — and <a href="https://lastgameboard.com/">The Last Gameboard</a> hopes to be the venue for that evolution. The digital tabletop platform has progressed from crowdfunding to $4M seed round, and having partnered with some of the biggest names in the industry, plans to ship by the end of the year.</p>
<p>As the company&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Shail Mehta explained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/tc-early-stage-pitch-off-the-last-gameboard/">in a TC Early Stage pitch-off earlier</a> this year, The Last Gameboard is a 16-inch square touchscreen device with a custom OS and a sophisticated method of tracking game pieces and hand movements. The idea is to provide a digital alternative to physical games where that&#8217;s practical, and do so with the maximum benefit and minimum compromise.</p>
<p>If the pitch sounds familiar&#8230; it&#8217;s been attempted once or twice before. I distinctly remember being impressed by the possibilities of D&amp;D on an original Microsoft Surface&#8230; <a href="https://vimeo.com/7132858">back in 2009</a>. And I played with another at PAX many years ago. Mehta said that until very recently there simply wasn&#8217;t the technology and market weren&#8217;t ready.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People tried this before, but it was either way too expensive or they didn&#8217;t have the audience. And the tech just wasn&#8217;t there; they were missing that interaction piece,&#8221; she explained, and certainly any player will recognize that the, say, iPad version of a game definitely lacks physicality. The advance her company has achieved is in making the touchscreen able to detect not just taps and drags, but game pieces, gestures and movements above the screen, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Gameboard does, no other existing touchscreen or tablet on the market can do — it&#8217;s not even close,&#8221; Mehta said. &#8220;We have unlimited touch, game pieces, passive and active&#8230; you can use your chess set at home, lift up and put down the pieces, we track it the whole time. We can do unique identifiers with tags and custom shapes. It&#8217;s the next step in how interactive surfaces can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s accomplished via a not particularly exotic method, which saves the Gameboard from the fate of the Surface and its successors, which cost several thousand dollars due to their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/05/microsofts-surface-garage-a-cross-department-development-team-with-pizza-and-beer/">unique and expensive makeups</a>. Mehta explained that they work strictly with ordinary capacitive touch data, albeit at a higher framerate than is commonly used, and then use machine learning to characterize and track object outlines. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t created a completely new mechanism, we&#8217;re just optimizing what&#8217;s available today,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150079" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150079" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2150079" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg" alt="The Last Gameboard's interface, showing games available to play on the tablet's surface." width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg 1504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2150079" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Last Gameboard</p></div></p>
<p>At $699 for the Gameboard it&#8217;s not exactly an impulse buy, either, but the fact of the matter is people spend a lot of money on gaming, with some titles running into multiple hundreds of dollars for all the expansions and pieces. Tabletop is now a more than $20 billion industry. If the experience is as good as they hope to make it, this is an investment many a player will not hesitate (much, anyway) to make.</p>
<p>Of course, the most robust set of gestures and features won&#8217;t matter if all they had on the platform were bargain-bin titles and grandpa&#8217;s-parlor favorites like <em>Parcheesi</em>. Fortunately The Last Gameboard has managed to stack up some of the most popular tabletop companies out there, and aims to have the definitive digital edition for their games.</p>
<p>Asmodee Digital is probably the biggest catch, having adapted many of today&#8217;s biggest hits, from modern classics <em>Catan</em> and <em>Carcassone</em> to crowdfunded breakout hit <em>Scythe</em> and immense dungeon-crawler <em>Gloomhaven</em>. The full list of partners right now includes Dire Wolf Digital, Nomad Games, Auroch Digital, Restoration Games, Steve Jackson Games, Knights of Unity, Skyship Studios, EncounterPlus, PlannarAlly, and Sugar Gamers, as well as individual creators and developers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150078" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/grab-board.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150078" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2150078" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/grab-board.gif" alt="Animation of two players grabbing dots on a screen and moving them around." width="800" height="588" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2150078" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Last Gameboard</p></div></p>
<p>These games may be best played in person, but have successfully transitioned to digital versions, and one imagines that a larger screen and inclusion of real pieces could make for an improved hybrid experience. There will be options both to purchase games individually, like you might on mobile or Steam, or to subscribe to an unlimited access model (pricing to be determined on both).</p>
<p>It would also be something that the many gaming shops and playing venues might want to have a couple of on hand. Testing out a game in-store and then buying a few to stock, or convincing consumers to do the same, could be a great sales tactic for all involved.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a unique and superior digital version of a game, the device can connect with others to trade moves, send game invites, and all that sort of thing. The whole OS, Mehta said, &#8220;is alive and real. If we didn&#8217;t own it and create it, this wouldn&#8217;t work.&#8221; This is more than a skin on top of Android with a built-in store, but there&#8217;s enough shared that Android-based ports will be able to be brought over with little fuss.</p>
<p>Head of content Lee Allentuck suggested that the last couple years (including the pandemic) have started to change game developers&#8217; and publishers&#8217; minds about the readiness of the industry for what&#8217;s next. &#8220;They see the digital crossover is going to happen — people are playing online board games now. If you can be part of that new trend at the very beginning, it gives you a big opportunity,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Allentuck, who previously worked at Hasbro, said there&#8217;s widespread interest in the toy and tabletop industry to be more tech-forward, but there&#8217;s been a &#8220;chicken and egg scenario,&#8221; where there&#8217;s no market because no one innovates, and no one innovates because there&#8217;s no market. Fortunately things have progressed to the point where a company like The Last Gameboard can raise $4M series A to help cover the cost of creating that market.</p>
<p>The round was led by TheVentureCity, with participation from SOSV, Riot Games, Conscience VC, Corner3 VC, and others. While the company didn&#8217;t go through HAX, SOSV&#8217;s involvement has that HAX-y air, and partner Garrett Winther gives a glowing recommendation of its approach: &#8220;They are the first to effectively tie collaborative physical and digital gameplay together while not losing the community, storytelling or competitive foundations that we all look for in gaming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mehta noted that the pandemic nearly cooked the company by derailing their funding, which was originally supposed to come through around this time last year when everything went pear-shaped. &#8220;We had our functioning prototype, we had filed for a patent, we got the traction, we were gonna raise, everything was great&#8230; and then COVID hit,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;But we got a lot of time to do R&amp;D, which was actually kind of a blessing. Our team was super small so we didn&#8217;t have to lay anyone off — we just went into survival mode for like six months and optimized, developed the platform. 2020 was rough for everyone, but we were able to focus on the core product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the company is poised to start its beta program over the summer and (following feedback from that) ship its first production units before the holiday season when purchases like this one seem to make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>(This article originally referred to this raise as The Last Gameboard&#8217;s round A — it&#8217;s actually the seed. This has been updated.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SPACs are desperate and asset prices are high as media recovers some and digital ad sales spike. SPAC now or forever hold your peace. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sorry for all the SPAC coverage today, but a host of richly valued private companies that have an ocean of venture capital funds under their belt are going public. We have to pay attention.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The market is more risk-on than you&#8217;ve been led to believe; SPACs are still hunting for deals.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/digging-into-digital-mortgage-lender-better-coms-huge-spac/">TechCrunch covered</a> the brand-new Better.com SPAC deal that will take the digital mortgage provider public. But it was hardly the only company working to combine with a blank-check company that demanded our attention today. There are a few media companies looking to do the same: Vice and the previously named Bustle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that we&#8217;re discussing SPAC deals for media companies at all because a few days ago, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/08/digital-media-companies-slow-public-rush-as-spac-market-cools.html">CNBC reported</a> that such efforts had come into doubt, noting that the recent SPAC slowdown had led to &#8220;digital media companies [reassessing] their timeline on going public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Writing this to you as someone currently being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">spat out from a phone company</a> into the hands of private equity, I was not terribly surprised that companies in my business were not enjoying the warmest of public receptions. After all, we&#8217;d seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing/">some software companies delay their IPOs</a> in recent weeks &#8212; though those efforts are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/as-q2s-lull-fades-unicorn-ipos-are-revving-up/">now back on, largely</a> &#8212; so to see the ever-less-attractive media concerns of the unicorn realm hold off on their offerings simply didn&#8217;t shock. Especially as <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/spac-ipos-fall-out-of-favor-after-hot-streak-nikola-lordstown-51619198468">SPAC stocks have taken a hammering</a>.</p>
<p>And then, today.</p>
<p>Earlier this morning, <a href="https://www.axios.com/bustle-rebrand-bdg-ipo-c9fcf2f2-47e9-4375-830a-1af142b40045.html">Axios reported</a> that Bustle, now BDG, still intends to pursue a SPAC-led public debut later this year. Per our friends over at Big Bullet Point, Bustle is not disputing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bustle-m-a/bustle-digital-hires-bank-to-explore-deal-to-go-public-source-idUSKBN29C33T">reports</a> that it is targeting a valuation of around $600 million. Sure, that&#8217;s the value of a single, late-stage fintech investing round, but for the media world, it&#8217;s not an exit to mock.</p>
<p>And yesterday, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vice-media-targets-valuation-of-nearly-3-billion-in-proposed-spac-deal-11620644403">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> that Vice Media Group is also moving ahead with a SPAC-led combination with 7GC &amp; Co Holdings, a blank-check company that <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/74375/7GC-and-Co.-Holdings-a-SPAC-formed-by-7GC-and-Hennessy-Capital-prices-upsiz">priced</a> back in December 2020.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? A few things, we reckon: The market is more risk-on than you&#8217;ve been led to believe; SPACs are still hunting for deals as their countdown timers tick; record asset prices more generally; and, finally, a booming advertising market coupled with rising belief in consumer-media subscriptions. For an industry that has been a reported venture-backed letdown in recent years &#8212; see this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/with-cuts-at-vice-quartz-buzzfeed-even-medias-savviest-digital-players-are-hurting/2020/05/19/f15d3dde-96e9-11ea-91d7-cf4423d47683_story.html">from 2020</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/business/media/buzzfeed-layoffs.html">this from 2019</a>, <a href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/vox-media-layoffs-50-employees-1202706362/">2018</a> and so on &#8212; it could be just about as good a moment as any to get out the door.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Taking media public</h2>
<p>There are actually three media companies that could be going public via a SPAC, with BuzzFeed part of the crew alongside BDG and Vice, again <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/08/digital-media-companies-slow-public-rush-as-spac-market-cools.html">per CNBC</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll dig into each company&#8217;s known venture capital and revenue results shortly. But first, the market. <em>Why</em> are we still seeing media companies pursue SPAC-led debuts now? Here&#8217;s a breakdown of our market view:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber and Lyft will provide free rides to any user traveling to get the COVID-19 vaccine through an agreement reached with the White House.</p>
<p>The free rides will last through July 4, the date when President Joe Biden wants 70% of U.S. adults to be vaccinated,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-lyft-to-provide-free-rides-to-covid-19-vaccine-sites-until-july-4-11620745200?mod=e2tw"> according to the WSJ</a>, which was the first to report on the partnership between the ride-hailing companies and the White House.</p>
<p>Lyft and Uber separately told TechCrunch the companies will cover the costs of the free rides. The White House will help advise on the product and how it is rolled out as well as share data on the more than 80,000 vaccination sites in the country, an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Uber didn&#8217;t provide a specific launch date for the program, only noting that it is expected to become available in the coming weeks. Lyft riders will be able to get a free ride code beginning May 24 via the app or website.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vaccines are our best hope to beat this pandemic and soon everyone in America will be able to take a free Uber to get their shot,&#8221; Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement. &#8220;We are honored to deepen our previous global commitments, and partner with the White House and Lyft to provide free rides to vaccination sites across the US. This is a proud moment for me, for Uber, and for our country. More and more Americans continue to get vaccinated every day &#8212; let&#8217;s keep moving forward, together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uber hasn&#8217;t released further details about how its program will work. Lyft said its ride codes will cover $15 each way and noted that based on previous rides given to vaccination sites, the company expects that figure will cover most, if not all, fares. Ride codes can be used for Lyft ride-hailing, bike or scooter rides during standard pharmacy operating hours of 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vaccine is the key to getting us all moving again, and we&#8217;re proud to do our part to move the country forward,&#8221; John Zimmer, co-founder and president of Lyft, said in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always believed transportation has the power to improve people&#8217;s lives, and this initiative makes that truer than ever. Helping more Americans get vaccinated helps the Lyft community of drivers and riders, and we&#8217;re grateful to the Biden Administration for prioritizing access.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement builds off of efforts by Lyft and Uber to provide free and discounted rides to underserved communities as well as roll out features to make it easier to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/uber-and-moderna-partner-on-covid-19-vaccine-access-and-information/">access vaccine information</a> and point-of-distribution sites. Uber first rolled out a COVID-relief program in March to offer free rides and deliveries. In December, the company said it would give an additional 10 million free or discounted rides.</p>
<p>Last month, Uber said it was launching more than a half-dozen new features, including one that will let users book vaccine appointments at Walgreens and reserve a ride to get their jab.</p>
<p>Lyft kicked off in December a <a href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/lyft-launches-vaccine-access-campaign">universal vaccine access campaign</a>, a coalition of partners that includes JPMorgan Chase, Anthem and United Way, to provide 60 million rides to and from vaccination sites for low-income, uninsured, and at-risk communities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer credit reporting agency TransUnion recently announced it had invested an undisclosed sum in Spring Labs, which is building out a blockchain-based data-sharing platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, TechCrunch has exclusive details on the size of that round and the nature of the relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, the fact that <a href="https://www.transunion.com/">TransUnion</a>, a public company with a $20 billion market cap, chose to back and partner with four-year-old <a href="https://www.springlabs.com/">Spring Labs</a> is significant in and of itself. A number of fintechs have popped up as of late aiming to disrupt the traditional model of evaluating an individual’s creditworthiness.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Labs is one of them. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he startup uses blockchain with the aim of creating a richer network effect of data that allows credit bureaus and others to predict the creditworthiness of people who are not in the traditional credit bureau system. It’s raising a $30 million Series B, led by TransUnion &#8212; one of the largest incumbents in an industry that Spring Labs is looking to shake up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Labs founder and CEO Adam Jiwan told TechCrunch that the two companies’ recent partnership evolved out of a series of discussions that began a couple of years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We knew a relationship with TransUnion in particular had the capacity to significantly accelerate our business,” he said. “And they said ‘if we’re going to help develop your business into something very significant, we’d like to have skin in the game.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Jiwan would not reveal the valuation at which this Series B is being raised (it actually hasn’t officially closed yet, although the majority of the round has been funded), he did say it’s a “meaningful step up” from the </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spring-labs-closes-23-million-series-a-investment-round-to-transform-how-financial-institutions-share-information-300865496.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$23 million Series A </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">it raised in June 2019. GreatPoint Ventures and August Capital, among other existing investors, are participating in the Series B round as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe we&#8217;ve built a fundamentally better mousetrap for the exchange of sensitive information, as well as a series of products and services that allow lenders and others to ideally make better identity verification, fraud prevention and underwriting decisions,” Jiwan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Labs is hoping to “revolutionize” the way consumer financial data is stored and shared among financial services institutions with a network foundation known as the Spring Protocol. The information exchange promises to preserve privacy, giving competitive parties the ability to “collaborate for the common good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering with TransUnion will give Spring Labs the ability to leverage the company’s sales force (four versus 100) and access over 10,000 of its financial institution customers contractually, according to Jiwan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They see a lot of opportunities to leverage our technology,” he said. “They view it as something that can really unlock siloed data and bring new information that moves the needle on things like financial inclusion. We’re exploring standing up unique information sharing networks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said there is also interest in how Spring Labs’ technology can be used to bridge the digital asset world and the regulated financial ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the funding, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Chaouki, president of U.S. Markets at TransUnion, is taking a seat on Spring Labs’ board. Brian Brooks, former head of the OCC and ex-Coinbase counsel, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/blockchain-and-taking-the-politics-out-of-tech/">recently joined the company</a> as its first independent director.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Blockchain and taking the politics out of tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/blockchain-and-taking-the-politics-out-of-tech/embed/#?secret=qtLdSWRdb8" data-secret="qtLdSWRdb8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaouki told TechCrunch that there were “many” reasons for working strategically with, and investing in, Spring Labs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The financial aspect is important but strategically, the amount of time we intend to spend working with them is even more of a valuable asset,” he said. “This is a pretty big move for us. We’re not a PE firm. If we’re making an investment, it’s to build something collaboratively with the partners who we’re investing in.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marko Ivanov, a TransUnion vice president, said the credit reporting giant was impressed with the “real-life applications” that Spring Labs has demonstrated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to collaborate to scale up their existing networks, and sign up more clients in the network, which is important to resolve those issues related to fraud,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re also really excited about collaborating with them to build new networks, and taking the protocol they’ve built so companies can share information anonymously or protect consumer privacy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TransUnion sees a number of use cases beyond fraud, namely “any kind of risk-related use case,” according to Ivanov.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than attempt to build out the technology itself, TransUnion recognizes the value of investing in a company that’s already built out technology capabilities in spaces in which it has not yet invested as much, according to Chaouki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have way more ideas than we have capacity to serve the market,” he said. “It’s not easy to just ramp up capacity. Investing in companies like Spring Labs helps us move into adjacent spaces we want to play.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube is giving <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">its TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts</a>, an injection of cash to help it better compete with rivals. The company today introduced the YouTube Shorts Fund, a $100 million fund that will pay YouTube Shorts creators for their most viewed and most engaging content over the course of 2021 and 2022. Creators can&#8217;t apply for the fund to help with content production, however. Instead, YouTube will reach out to creators each month whose videos exceeded certain milestones to reward them for their contributions.</p>
<p>The company expects to dole out money to &#8220;thousands&#8221; of creators every month, it says. And these creators don&#8217;t need to be in the YouTube Partner Program to qualify &#8212; anyone is eligible to receive rewards by creating original content for YouTube Shorts.</p>
<p>YouTube declined to share more specific details about the fund&#8217;s operations at this time, including how creators will be vetted or what specific thresholds for receiving payments YouTube has in mind. It also wouldn&#8217;t offer details as to whether YouTube creators could receive multiple payments in the same pay period if they had several videos that would qualify, or any other details.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And while the company stressed that only &#8220;original&#8221; content would gain rewards, it didn&#8217;t clarify how it will go about checking to ensure the content isn&#8217;t already uploaded on another platform, like Reels, Snapchat, or TikTok.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126699" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126699" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126699" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png 2166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=1535,2048 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126699" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>Instead, YouTube said that more details about the payments and qualifications would be available closer to the fund&#8217;s launch, which is expected sometime in the next few months. It pointed out also that it has paid out over $30 billion to creators, artists and media companies over the last three years, and it expects the new fund will help it to build a long-term monetization model for Shorts on YouTube going forward.</p>
<p>YouTube isn&#8217;t the only platform to take on the threat of TikTok by throwing cash at the problem.</p>
<p>Snapchat has been paying <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html">$1 million per day to creators</a> for their top-performing videos on Spotlight, its own TikTok clone, minting several millionaires in the process. Facebook-owned Instagram, meanwhile, made lucrative offers to top TikTok stars to use its new service, Reels, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-to-reel-in-tiktok-creators-raising-stakes-in-social-media-rivalry-11595928600">The WSJ reported</a> last year.</p>
<p>Despite the size of these efforts, TikTok&#8217;s own Creator Fund remains a competitive force. It <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-the-200-million-tiktok-creator-fund/">announced</a> its fund would grow to over $1 billion in the U.S. in the next three years and would be more than double that on a global basis. This March, it also <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-the-200-million-tiktok-creator-fund/">added</a> another requirement to receiving the fund&#8217;s payments, including having at least 100K authentic views in the last 30 days &#8212; a signal that it&#8217;s setting the bar even higher, given its current success.</p>
<p>Alongside the debut of YouTube&#8217;s Shorts Fund, the company also noted it&#8217;s expanding its Shorts player feature across more place on YouTube to help viewers discover this short-form video content, will begin testing ads for Shorts, and will be rolling out the new &#8220;remix audio&#8221; feature to all Shorts creators.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126698" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126698" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126698" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png 2166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=1535,2048 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126698" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>This somewhat controversial feature allows Shorts creators to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10343433?hl=en#yt_desktop_shorts_rmx">sample sounds</a> from other YouTube videos for use in their Shorts, instead of only using song clips or original audio. Some YouTube creators were <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/youtube-allows-videos-to-be-sampled/405710/">surprised</a> to find the feature was opt-out by default &#8212; meaning their content could be used on YouTube Shorts unless they took the time to turn this setting off or removed their video from YouTube.</p>
<p>Since its launch, YouTube has also rolled out other features to Shorts, including support for captions, the ability to record up to 60 seconds with the Shorts camera, the ability to add clips from your phone&#8217;s gallery to your recordings made with the Shorts camera, and the ability use basic filters to color correct videos. YouTube says more effects will arrive in the future.</p>
<p>But even as YouTube tries to catch up with TikTok on feature sets, TikTok has been expanding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/as-competition-heats-up-tiktok-announces-six-new-interactive-music-effects-for-creators/">its own effects lineup</a> and becoming more YouTube-like by supporting longer videos. Some TikTok creators, for example, <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1334125358103277575">have recently been given the ability</a> to record videos 3 minutes in lengths, instead of just 60 seconds.</p>
<p>YouTube says the new fund will roll out in the coming months and it will listen to the feedback from the creator community to develop a long-term program designed for YouTube Shorts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Long before COVID-19 precipitated &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; across the world of work, customer services and support was built to run online and virtually. Yet it too is undergoing an evolution supercharged by technology.</p>
<p>Today, a startup called <a href="https://sightcall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SightCall</a>, which has built an augmented reality platform to help field service teams, the companies they work for, and their customers carry out technical and mechanical maintenance or repairs more effectively, is announcing $42 million in funding, money that it plans to use to invest in its tech stack with more artificial intelligence tools and expanding its client base.</p>
<p>The core of its service, explained CEO and co-founder Thomas Cottereau, is AR technology (which comes embedded in their apps or the service apps its customers use, with integrations into other standard software used in customer service environments including Microsoft, SAP, Salesforce and ServiceNow).

<p>This is used by, say, field service engineers coordinating with central offices when servicing equipment; or by manufacturers to provide better assistance to customers in emergencies or situations where something is not working but might be repaired quicker by the customers themselves rather than engineers that have to be called out; or indeed by call centers, aided by AI, to diagnose whatever the problem might be. It&#8217;s a big leap ahead for scenarios that previously relied on work orders, hastily drawn diagrams, instruction manuals and voice-based descriptions to progress the work in question.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like to say that we break the barriers that exist between a field service organization and its customer,&#8221; Cottereau said.</p>
<p>The tech, meanwhile, is unique to SightCall, built over years and designed to be used by way of a basic smartphone, and over even a basic mobile network &#8212; essential in cases where reception is bad or the locations are remote. (More on how it works below.)</p>
<p>Originally founded in Paris, France before relocating to San Francisco, SightCall has already built up a sizable business across a pretty wide range of verticals, including insurance, telecoms, transportation, telehealth, manufacturing, utilities and life sciences/medical devices.</p>
<p>SightCall has some 200 big-name enterprise customers on its books, including the likes of Kraft-Heinz, Allianz, GE Healthcare and Lincoln Motor Company, providing services on a B2B basis as well as for teams that are out in the field working for consumer customers, too. After seeing 100% year-over-year growth in annual recurring revenue in 2019 and 2020, SightCall&#8217;s CEO says it&#8217;s looking like it will hit that rate this year as well, with a goal of $100 million in annual recurring revenue.</p>

<p>The funding is being led by InfraVia, a European private equity firm, with Bpifrance also participating. The valuation of this round is not being disclosed, but I should point out that an investor told me that <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/52338-88/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook&#8217;s estimate</a> of $122 million post-money is not accurate (we&#8217;re still digging on this and will update as and when we learn more).</p>
<p>For some further context on this investment, InfraVia invests in a <a href="https://infraviacapital.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of industrial businesses</a>, alongside investments in tech companies building services related to them such as recent investments in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/jobandtalent-takes-120m-from-softbank-to-enter-the-us-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jobandtalent</a>, so this is in part a strategic investment. SightCall has raised $67 million to date.</p>
<p>There has been an interesting wave of startups emerging in recent years building out the tech stack used by people working in the front lines and in the field, a shift after years of knowledge workers getting most of the attention from startups building a new generation of apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/workiz-locks-in-13m-for-productivity-tools-aimed-at-home-services-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workiz</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jobber</a> are building platforms for small business tradespeople to book jobs and manage them once they&#8217;re on the books; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/bigchange-raises-102m-for-a-platform-to-help-manage-service-fleets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BigChange</a> helps manage bigger fleets; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/hover-secures-60m-for-a-3d-imaging-platform-used-to-assess-and-fix-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hover</a> has built a platform for builders to be able to assess and estimate costs for work by using AI to analyze images captured by their or their would-be customers&#8217; smartphone cameras.</p>
<p>And there is <a href="https://www.streem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streem</a>, which I discovered is a close enough competitor to SightCall that they&#8217;ve acquired AdWords ads based on SightCall searches in Google. Just ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic breaking wide open, General Catalyst-backed Streem was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191205005459/en/Frontdoor-Acquires-Streem-a-Leader-in-Advanced-Technology-to-Transform-the-Service-Experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Frontdoor</a> to help with the latter&#8217;s efforts to build out its home services business, another sign of how all of this is leaping ahead.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting in part about SightCall and sets it apart is its technology. Co-founded in 2007 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tcottereau/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cottereau</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoine-vervoort-37308925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antoine Vervoort</a> (currently SVP of product and engineering), the two are long-time telecoms industry vets who had both worked on the technical side of building next-generation networks.</p>
<p>SightCall started life as a company called Weemo that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/19/weemo-brings-its-webrtc-powered-video-chat-solution-to-ios-android-and-phonegap-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built video chat services</a> that could run on WebRTC-based frameworks, which emerged at a time when we were seeing a wider effort to bring more rich media services into mobile web and SMS apps. For consumers and to a large extent businesses, mobile phone apps that work &#8220;over the top&#8221; (distributed not by your mobile network carrier but the companies that run your phone&#8217;s operating system, and thus partly controlled by them) really took the lead and continue to dominate the market for messaging and innovations in messaging.</p>
<p>After a time, <a href="https://sightcall.com/weemo-changes-name-sightcall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weemo pivoted</a> and renamed itself as SightCall, focusing on packaging the tech that it built into whichever app (native or mobile web) where one of its enterprise customers wanted the tech to live.</p>
<p>The key to how it works comes by way of how SightCall was built, Cottereau explained. The company has spent 10 years building and optimizing a network across data centers close to where its customers are, which interconnects with Tier 1 telecoms carriers and has a lot of latency in the system to ensure uptime. &#8220;We work with companies where this connectivity is mission critical,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The video solution has to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he describes it, the hybrid system SightCall has built incorporates its own IP that works both with telecoms hardware and software, resulting in a video service that provides 10 different ways for streaming video and a system that automatically chooses the best in a particular environment, based on where you are, so that even if mobile data or broadband reception don&#8217;t work, video streaming will. &#8220;Telecoms and software are still very separate worlds,&#8221; Cottereau said. &#8220;They still don&#8217;t speak the same language, and so that is part of our secret sauce, a global roaming mechanism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tech that the startup has built to date not only has given it a firm grounding against others who might be looking to build in this space, but has led to strong traction with customers. The next steps will be to continue building out that technology to tap deeper into the automation that is being adopted across the industries that already use SightCall&#8217;s technology.</p>
<p>“SightCall pioneered the market for AR-powered visual assistance, and they’re in the best position to drive the digital transformation of remote service,” said Alban Wyniecki, partner at InfraVia Capital Partners, in a statement. “As a global leader, they can now expand their capabilities, making their interactions more intelligent and also bringing more automation to help humans work at their best.”</p>
<p>“SightCall’s $42M Series B marks the largest funding round yet in this sector, and SightCall emerges as the undisputed leader in capital, R&amp;D resources and partnerships with leading technology companies enabling its solutions to be embedded into complex enterprise IT,” added Antoine Izsak of Bpifrance. “Businesses are looking for solutions like SightCall to enable customer-centricity at a greater scale while augmenting technicians with knowledge and expertise that unlocks efficiencies and drives continuous performance and profit.”</p>

<p>Cottereau said that the company has had a number of acquisition offers over the years &#8212; not a surprise when you consider the foundational technology it has built for how to architect video networks across different carriers and data centers that work even in the most unreliable of network environments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to stay independent, though,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I see a huge market here, and I want us to continue the story and lead it. Plus, I can see a way where we can stay independent and continue to work with everyone.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This year, the whole notion of how we work and where we work is going to change yet again.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic forced many employees <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/06/what-to-consider-when-employees-need-to-start-working-remotely/">to begin working from home</a>, and, in doing so, may have changed the way we think about work. While some businesses have slowly returned to the office, depending on where you live and what you do, many information workers remain at home.</p>
<p>That could change in the coming months as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/30/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases">more people get vaccinated</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/covid-cases-dropping/2021/04/30/0f0bb988-a845-11eb-bca5-048b2759a489_story.html">infection rate begins to drop</a> in the U.S.</p>
<p>As that happens, it is likely that more offices will reopen. We&#8217;ve already heard from major employers like Salesforce, which indicated it will be allowing <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/global-return-to-the-office-the-salesforce-approach/">a percentage of its workforce back to the office</a> this month, starting with the company&#8217;s San Francisco headquarters. The CRM giant plans to move slow and follow the government&#8217;s lead, allowing 20% capacity at first and hoping to build to 70% over time.</p>
<p>Most companies aren&#8217;t the size of Salesforce, which boasts a worldwide workforce of more than 50,000 employees. These smaller companies often don&#8217;t control entire skyscrapers, as Salesforce does in San Francisco. That creates complicating factors, including managing people who aren&#8217;t willing to be vaccinated, dealing with social distancing and masking, and sharing buildings or floors with other companies.</p>
<p>Even more, many companies have discovered that their employees work just fine at home. And some workers don&#8217;t want to waste time stuck on congested highways or public transportation now that they&#8217;ve learned to work remotely. But other employees suffered in small spaces or with constant interruptions from family. Those folks may long to go back to the office.</p>
<p>On balance, it seems clear that whatever happens, for many companies, we probably aren&#8217;t going back whole-cloth to the prior model of commuting into the office five days a week.</p>
<p>Last August, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/amid-pandemic-returning-to-offices-remains-an-open-question-for-tech-leaders/">we spoke to a number of tech company executives</a> about what returning to the office could look like. We recently went back to most of those same executives, as well as a Rhode Island state official and a medical expert we spoke to then to revisit the idea and talk about what&#8217;s changed and what work could look like as move slowly toward the post-pandemic era.</p>
<h2>The office will never be the same</h2>
<p>While their approaches vary, all of the executives I spoke to said that they foresee adopting a hybrid model when they can return in earnest, although there were definitely different interpretations of what that means, and what the office structure will look like.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a>, the continuous delivery pioneer, announced a $100 million Series F today on a $1.7 billion valuation. At the same time, the company announced it has acquired <a href="http://vamp.io">Vamp</a>, a release orchestration startup that should fit nicely in the CircleCI platform. The companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>The funding was led by Greenspring Associates with participation from Eleven Prime, IVP, Sapphire Ventures, Top Tier Capital Partners, Baseline Ventures, Threshold, Scale, Owl Rock and Next Equity Partners. Today&#8217;s round comes a little over a year since the late-stage startup announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/continuous-delivery-pioneer-circleci-scores-100m-series-e/">a $100 million Series E</a>, and brings the total raised to more than $315 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>CircleCI CEO Jim Rose says part of the reason for taking on $200 million in two years is because even though the company was founded in 2011, the continuous delivery approach is still really just getting started.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe in the development space that it&#8217;s really early days [&#8230;] and there&#8217;s so much potential growth in front of us, and so many opportunities to create centers of gravity in the development space [&#8230;] and we expect to be one of those [key companies], and we are doing everything we can from an investment perspective and from an operations perspective to make sure that we fulfill that vision,&#8221; Rose told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hCJO3ohiNk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/4-enterprise-developer-trends-that-will-shape-2021/">4 enterprise developer trends that will shape 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 enterprise developer trends that will shape 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/4-enterprise-developer-trends-that-will-shape-2021/embed/#?secret=hCJO3ohiNk" data-secret="hCJO3ohiNk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like so many kinds of automation, Rose says that he has seen things accelerate during the pandemic as software development teams look for ways to eliminate manual processes as they moved to work from home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once everyone got pushed remotely they realized, holy moly, we need to automate more and more of this process because that&#8217;s the only way that we can actually deliver things, but it&#8217;s also the way that we can build a system that&#8217;s resilient to these kinds of shocks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As for the acquisition, acquiring Vamp takes care of what happens after the application gets deployed, and that fills in a big missing piece in the product map.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just a great opportunity not just for us to accelerate roadmap, and just sort of accelerate the addition of this kind of solidification from a first class perspective on our platform, but it was also a great way for the Vamp team to continue to realize their vision, to continue to invest in this problem that they&#8217;ve been focused on for awhile, and we can learn from it,&#8221; Rose said.</p>
<p>Vamp launched in 2013 in Amsterdam and raised around €3 million, according to Crunchbase data. Vamp CEO Nico Vierhout sees a natural fit between the two companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have worked hard over the last eight years to build a platform that makes software releases self-driving and self-healing for users. Joining CircleCI was an organic fit that will provide enhanced visibility and control for developers to build software in a more streamlined way,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The 15 member Vamp team will be joining CircleCI and continuing to support the product, even as the functionality gets folded into the broader platform. CircleCI now has over 550 employees, a number that has doubled since last year.</p>
<p>While a Series F with a fat valuation sometimes signals the end of the private fundraising cycle, Rose wasn&#8217;t quite ready to talk IPO just yet, even while acknowledging his investors would want to cash out at some point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously investors are going to expect liquidity at some point, but we are less focused on what the next kind of funding event, or what the next kind of company event in that transition will be and more focused on figuring out how to stay close to the customer and what&#8217;s necessary to build this out. The rest of it kind of takes care of itself,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.builtbysnowman.com/">Snowman</a>, the small studio behind award-winning iOS games Alto&#8217;s Adventure, Alto&#8217;s Odyssey, Skate City and <a href="https://www.builtbysnowman.com/">others</a>, is spinning out a new company, <a href="https://playpokpok.com/">Pok Pok</a>, that will focus on educational children&#8217;s entertainment. Later this month, Pok Pok will debut its first title, <a href="https://playpokpok.com/">Pok Pok Playroom,</a> aimed at inspiring creative thinking through play for the preschool crowd.</p>
<p>The launch takes Snowman back to its roots as an app maker, not a games studio.</p>
<p>In fact, the company&#8217;s first iOS app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/17/checkmark-brings-better-geofenced-reminders-to-iphone-mac-version-in-the-works/">Checkmark</a>, had been in the productivity space, offering location-based reminders to iPhone users. But Snowman later shifted to making games, tapping into the demand for mobile games with early launches like Circles and Super Squares. But it wasn&#8217;t until Alto&#8217;s Adventure came out that Snowman really kicked off its foray into gaming.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve never really considered Snowman to be a video game studio,&#8221; explains Snowman co-founder and creative director Ryan Cash. &#8220;A lot of people would assume that because it&#8217;s really all that we&#8217;re known for at the moment. It&#8217;s kind of our core business. But we like to think of ourselves more as like a team of tinkerers who like working on creative stuff. And for now, it happens to be video games, but you never know kind of what might be around the corner,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Pok Pok actually emerged from Snowman&#8217;s culture of tinkering.</p>
<p>Snowman employees <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathijs-demaeght-172b4930/">Mathijs Demaeght</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/esther-huybreghts-3391b8209/">Esther Huybreghts</a>, now Pok Pok design director and creative director, respectively, went looking for an app to entertain their young son James when he was a toddler. They soon found that there weren&#8217;t many options that fit what they had been hoping to find.</p>
<p>They had wanted something that wouldn&#8217;t rile him up, something that wasn&#8217;t too technical and something that wasn&#8217;t gamified, Esther explains.</p>
<p>When they later had their second son, Jack, they decided to just built the app they wanted for themselves. After showing a rough prototype to Ryan, he saw the potential and told them to run with it.</p>
<p>Ryan&#8217;s sister, Melissa Cash, whose background was in developing products at Disney for babies and toddlers, had been helping with the Alto&#8217;s Odyssey launch at the time. When she saw what Esther and Mathijs were working on, she was impressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked in the kid space for five years, and I&#8217;ve never seen anything that&#8217;s even remotely like this. And then, I just knew this is what I wanted to work on for the next 20 years,&#8221; she says. Melissa became involved with the project and is now CEO of the Pok Pok spinout.</p>
<p>Although legally a distinctive entity, Pok Pok remains closely tied to Snowman.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been incubating the company within Snowman. We moved desks to a corner and we all work together as mentor, colleagues, and collaborate as a group,&#8221; Melissa notes. Ryan is still involved, as well. &#8220;Ryan is everything &#8212; our advisor, our helper &#8212; we haven&#8217;t even come up with a title for him,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>Today, the Pok Pok team is six full-time employees, but works with contractors and educators on its projects. Snowman, meanwhile, is over 20 people, mostly in Toronto. However, some Snowman employees spend 30% to 50% of their time on Pok Pok, Ryan says.</p>
<p>For the time being, Pok Pok is self-funded thanks to Snowman&#8217;s success on other fronts, which not only includes the Alto&#8217;s series, but also Apple Arcade&#8217;s Where Cards Fall and Skate City, both of which are now expanding to PC and console. The company is also working on <a href="http://playdistant.com/">DISTANT</a>, a collaboration with Slingshot and Satchel.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/T68_cEL_wvI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://playpokpok.com/">Pok Pok Playroom</a>, which is aimed at kids ages two to six, will be the first title to go live from Pok Pok, arriving on May 20. The app itself will initially contain six &#8220;digital toys,&#8221; so to speak, which encourage kids to creatively play. These toys also grow with the child as they age up.</p>
<p>For example, a stacking blocks toy could appeal to toddlers who just want to move the shapes around, but an older child might build a town with them. A drawing toy can encourage scribbles at younger ages or become a real canvas for art when the child is older. There&#8217;s also a calming toy called &#8220;musical blobs&#8221; that&#8217;s sort of like a lava lamp with differently shaped blobs that bounce around and respond to touches.</p>
<p>All the toys are designed to be open-ended &#8212; there&#8217;s no right or wrong way to use them. And Pok Pok Playroom is not a game. There are no levels to beat or objectives to achieve. There&#8217;s nothing to buy.</p>
<p>What is different about Pok Pok Playroom, compared with games and &#8220;digital toys&#8221; from rivals like Toca Boca, for example, is that it&#8217;s designed to be more educational and realistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We take a more educational approach, and we still plan to do that for future apps and for whatever Pok Pok Playroom will grow into after launch,&#8221; says Esther. &#8220;For example, we have no unicorns or no wizards in Pok Pok Playroom. Everything is grounded in reality. I think we want to explore with children what the world looks like and how it works. We have tons of ideas for taking a more education-based approach for all the children, as well, that isn&#8217;t necessarily the ABCs, 1,2,3&#8217;s pedagogical, so to speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pok Pok also won&#8217;t use talking animals or fantasy characters in order to avoid the subject of diversity. Instead, its apps will features all races, all genders, all family constructs, all different sorts of abilities and disabilities, as they&#8217;re built.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s very important to us to have kids be able to recognize themselves, and family members and friends in the app,&#8221; says Esther. &#8220;It&#8217;s really important to our entire team that everyone feels respected in who they are and what their family looks like, and&#8230; I think that&#8217;s still really lacking in the kid space right now. We want to be the front-runner there,&#8221; she notes.</p>
<p>The new app, which has been in development for nearly three years, will be priced on a subscription basis, with more &#8220;digital toys&#8221; added over time.</p>

<p>Though Pok Pok will aim more at the preschool crowd, the company envisions a future where it designs creative projects for the next age group up and for other types of learning.</p>
<p>Pok Pok Playroom has been beta tested with around 250 families ahead of its launch.</p>
<p>It will be available on iPhone and iPad starting on May 20 at 9 a.m. ET, with a 14-day free trial. It will then be priced at $3.99 per month or $29.99 per year, and will not feature in-app purchases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Hamburg data protection agency has banned Facebook from processing the additional WhatsApp user data that the tech giant is granting itself access to under a mandatory update to WhatsApp&#8217;s terms of service.</p>
<p>The controversial WhatsApp privacy policy update has caused widespread confusion around the world since being announced &#8212; and already been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">delayed by Facebook for several months</a> after a major user backlash saw rivals messaging apps benefitting from an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/">influx of angry users</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/india-tells-court-to-block-whatsapps-policy-update-says-new-change-violates-laws/">Indian government has also sought to block the changes to WhatApp&#8217;s T&amp;Cs in court</a> &#8212; and the country&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/india-antitrust-body-orders-investigation-into-whatsapp-privacy-policy-changes/">antitrust authority is investigating</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Globally, WhatsApp users have until May 15 to accept the new terms (after which the requirement to accept the T&amp;Cs update will become persistent, per a <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-happens-when-our-terms-and-privacy-policy-updates-take-effect">WhatsApp FAQ</a>).</p>
<p>The majority of users who have had the terms pushed on them have already accepted them, according to Facebook, although it hasn&#8217;t disclosed what proportion of users that is.</p>
<p>But the intervention by Hamburg&#8217;s DPA could further delay Facebook&#8217;s rollout of the T&amp;Cs &#8212; at least in Germany &#8212; as the agency has used an urgency procedure, allowed for under the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to order the tech giant not to share the data for three months.</p>
<p>A WhatsApp spokesperson disputed the legal validity of Hamburg&#8217;s order &#8212; calling it &#8220;a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose and effect of WhatsApp&#8217;s update&#8221; and arguing that it &#8220;therefore has no legitimate basis&#8221;.</p>
<p>“Our recent update explains the options people have to message a business on WhatsApp and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. As the Hamburg DPA’s claims are wrong, the order will not impact the continued roll-out of the update. We remain fully committed to delivering secure and private communications for everyone,&#8221; the spokesperson added, suggesting that Facebook-owned WhatsApp may be intending to ignore the order.</p>
<p>We understand that Facebook is considering its options to appeal Hamburg&#8217;s procedure.</p>
<p>The emergency powers Hamburg is using can&#8217;t extend beyond three months but the agency is also applying pressure to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to step in and make what it calls &#8220;a binding decision&#8221; for the 27 Member State bloc.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the EDPB to ask what action, if any, it could take in response to the Hamburg DPA&#8217;s call.</p>
<p>The body is not usually involved in making binding GDPR decisions related to specific complaints &#8212; unless EU DPAs cannot agree over a draft GDPR decision brought to them for review by a lead supervisory authority under the one-stop-shop mechanism for handling cross-border cases.</p>
<p>In such a scenario the EDPB can cast a deciding vote &#8212; but it&#8217;s not clear that an urgency procedure would qualify.</p>
<p>In taking the emergency action, the German DPA is not only attacking Facebook for continuing to thumb its nose at EU data protection rules, but throwing shade at its lead data supervisor in the region, Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) &#8212; accusing the latter of failing to investigate the very widespread concerns attached to the incoming WhatsApp T&amp;Cs.</p>
<p>(&#8220;Our request to the lead supervisory authority for an investigation into the actual practice of data sharing was not honoured so far,&#8221; is the polite framing of this shade in Hamburg&#8217;s <a href="https://datenschutz-hamburg.de/assets/pdf/2021-05-11-press-release-facebook.pdf">press release</a>).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the DPC for a response and will update this report if we get one.</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s data watchdog is no stranger to criticism that it indulges in creative regulatory inaction when it comes to enforcing the GDPR &#8212; with critics charging commissioner Helen Dixon and her team of failing to investigate scores of complaints and, in the instances when it has opened probes, taking years to investigate &#8212; and opting for weak enforcements at the last.</p>
<p>The only GDPR decision the DPC has issued to date against a tech giant (against Twitter, in relation to a data breach) was disputed by other EU DPAs &#8212; which wanted a far tougher penalty than the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">$550k fine eventually handed down</a> by Ireland.</p>
<p>GDPR investigations into Facebook and WhatsApp remain on the DPC&#8217;s desk. Although a draft decision in one WhatsApp data-sharing transparency case was sent to other EU DPAs in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/whatsapp-facebook-data-sharing-transparency-under-review-by-eu-dpas-after-ireland-sends-draft-decision/">January</a> for review &#8212; but a resolution has still yet to see the light of day almost three years after the regulation begun being applied.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;WhatsApp-Facebook data-sharing transparency under review by EU DPAs after Ireland sends draft decision&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/whatsapp-facebook-data-sharing-transparency-under-review-by-eu-dpas-after-ireland-sends-draft-decision/embed/#?secret=QByfuOR6pv" data-secret="QByfuOR6pv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In short, frustrations about the lack of GDPR enforcement against the biggest tech giants are riding high among other EU DPAs &#8212; some of whom are now resorting to creative regulatory actions to try to sidestep the bottleneck created by the one-stop-shop (OSS) mechanism which funnels so many complaints through Ireland.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/confusion-over-whatsapps-new-tcs-triggers-privacy-warning-from-italy/">Italian DPA also issued a warning</a> over the WhatsApp T&amp;Cs change, back in January &#8212; saying it had contacted the EDPB to raise concerns about a lack of clear information over what’s changing.</p>
<p>At that point the EDPB emphasized that its role is to promote cooperation between supervisory authorities. It added that it will continue to facilitate exchanges between DPAs &#8220;in order to ensure a consistent application of data protection law across the EU in accordance with its mandate&#8221;. But the always fragile consensus between EU DPAs is becoming increasingly fraught over enforcement bottlenecks and the perception that the regulation is failing to be upheld because of OSS forum shopping.</p>
<p>That will increase pressure on the EDPB to find some way to resolve the impasse and avoid a wider break down of the regulation &#8212; i.e. if more and more Member State agencies resort to unilateral &#8217;emergency&#8217; action.</p>
<p>The Hamburg DPA writes that the update to WhatsApp&#8217;s terms grant the messaging platform &#8220;far-reaching powers to share data with Facebook&#8221; for the company&#8217;s own purposes (including for advertising and marketing) &#8212; such as by passing WhatApp users&#8217; location data to Facebook and allowing for the communication data of WhatsApp users to be transferred to third-parties if businesses make use of Facebook&#8217;s hosting services.</p>
<p>Its assessment is that Facebook cannot rely on legitimate interests as a legal base for the expanded data sharing under EU law.</p>
<p>And if the tech giant is intending to rely on user consent it&#8217;s not meeting the bar either because the changes are not clearly explained nor are users offered a free choice to consent or not (which is the required standard under GDPR).</p>
<p>&#8220;The investigation of the new provisions has shown that they aim to further expand the close connection between the two companies in order for Facebook to be able to use the data of WhatsApp users for their own purposes at any time,&#8221; Hamburg goes on. &#8220;For the areas of product improvement and advertising, WhatsApp reserves the right to pass on data to Facebook companies without requiring any further consent from data subjects. In other areas, use for the company&#8217;s own purposes in accordance to the privacy policy can already be assumed at present.</p>
<p>&#8220;The privacy policy submitted by WhatsApp and the FAQ describe, for example, that WhatsApp users&#8217; data, such as phone numbers and device identifiers, are already being exchanged between the companies for joint purposes such as network security and to prevent spam from being sent.&#8221;</p>
<p>DPAs like Hamburg may be feeling buoyed to take matters into their own hands on GDPR enforcement by a recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">opinion </a>by an advisor to the EU’s top court, as we suggested in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/confusion-over-whatsapps-new-tcs-triggers-privacy-warning-from-italy/">coverage</a> at the time. <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-01/cp210001en.pdf">Advocate General Bobek took the view</a> that EU law allows agencies to bring their own proceedings in certain situations, including in order to adopt &#8220;urgent measures&#8221; or to intervene &#8220;following the lead data protection authority having decided not to handle a case.”</p>
<p>The CJEU ruling on that case is still pending &#8212; but the court tends to align with the position of its advisors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We'll have to wait to see how public investors value the company once it begins to float later this year. But as far as unicorn SPAC deals go, there have been worse ones that we've viewed.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Better.com, a venture-backed digital mortgage lender, announced this morning that it will combine with a SPAC, taking itself public in the second half of 2021. The unicorn&#8217;s news comes as the American IPO market is showing signs of fresh life after a modest April.</p>
<p>The Better.com deal comes just over a month after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/mortgage-is-suddenly-sexy-as-softbank-pumps-500m-in-better-com-at-6b-valuation/">sold $500 million of its existing shares to SoftBank</a> at a valuation of $6 billion. At the time, TechCrunch described the deal as &#8220;further proof&#8221; that unsexy industries were able to secure attractive valuations despite their relative lack of pizzazz.</p>
<p>The SoftBank secondary round was hardly Better&#8217;s only recent mega-deal; the company raised a $200 million round <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-invest-500-million-in-mortgage-startup-better-11617899907">at a $4 billion valuation in November 2020</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But the company&#8217;s SPAC combination will affix an even higher price than its April round managed, providing <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bettermortgage/company_financials">the Kleiner-Perkins-backed Better</a> with what <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210511005602/en/Digital-Homeownership-Platform-Better-to-Become-a-Publicly-Listed-Company-via-Merger-with-Aurora-Acquisition-Corp.-Company-is-Redefining-the-Homeownership-Experience">it describes</a> as a &#8220;post-money equity value of approximately $7.7 billion.&#8221;</p>
<p>SoftBank is doubling down on Better, putting together a $1.5 billion private investment in the deal&#8217;s public equity, or PIPE, in effect repricing its own preceding investment. For the Japanese telecom and investing powerhouse, making successive bets in companies at ever-higher prices is essentially gospel. So, don&#8217;t read <em>too</em> much into the commitment.</p>
<p>As with all SPAC combinations, we have a pile of new data from the company that is going public as part of the transaction. So, this morning, we&#8217;re getting our hands dirty.</p>
<p>Our goals are simple: We want to understand whether Better is a weak business, an acceptably strong business or a great business. To get there, we&#8217;ll have to start by digging into how the company functions. From there, we&#8217;ll discuss its valuation stacked against its trailing metrics. We&#8217;ll also take a look at its growth expectations and bring in the recent Compass IPO, a company that focuses on a different part of the mortgage market, to see if we can get a better handle on Better&#8217;s new valuation.</p>
<p>Ready? The deck is <a href="https://aurora-acquisition.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/better-roadshow-deck.pdf">here</a>. Let&#8217;s have some fun.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Better.com?</h2>
<p>If you have heard of Better but really had no idea what it does before this morning, welcome to the club. Mortgage tech is like pre-kindergarten applications &#8212; it applies to a very specific set of folks at a very particular moment. And they care a lot about it. But the rest of us aren&#8217;t really aware of its existence.</p>
<p>For the rest of us: Better is an online mortgage lender that aims to offer lower-than-standard fees to consumers looking for credit to help them buy a house. As the company <a href="https://better.com/content/how-does-better-make-money/">explains</a> on its website, it generates income by selling loans that it helps generate. Per its investor deck, Better also derives top line from selling insurance products.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that has built a neobank specifically to address the needs of freelancers and sole traders has picked up a growth round to continue expanding its business after seeing its usage grow by 1,500% in a year.</p>
<p><a href="https://lili.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lili</a>, which provides a way for freelancers to use a single account both to manage their work and personal financial lives, along with tools to help manage the particular financial and accounting demands that come with being a one-person business, has picked up $55 million in a Series B round that it will be using to continue expanding its platform.</p>
<p>Today the company already provides users with a single account and payment card that can be used both for personal and business expenses, and an &#8220;assistant&#8221; that analyses expenses and budget for paying future taxes based on your incomings. Down the line it will also be expanding into invoicing, payment management and credit (e.g. loans or cash advances) for its customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is about financial services for freelancers,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Lilac Bar David said in an interview. &#8220;We are redefining a new kind of user, who is between a consumer and a business and has specific needs. If you look at the economy and what the future of work will look like, this really needs to be addressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lili is based out of New York and Israel, and its focus is primarily on the U.S. market, where Bar David said the opportunity is big enough to keep Lili occupied for some time. It is estimated that currently 40% of workers are freelance, and that proportion is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/921593/gig-economy-number-of-freelancers-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projected</a> to rise to just over 50% of all working people by 2027.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Group 11, a VC with a <a href="https://group11.vc/portfolio/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong focus on fintech</a>, with Target Global, AltaIR and previous investors also participating. (That list of past backers includes Zeev Ventures, Foundation Capital and the Google for Startups accelerator.) The company has now raised $80 million and is not disclosing its valuation yet.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Which neobanks will rise or fall?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/embed/#?secret=liJJzo0ptN" data-secret="liJJzo0ptN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Launched in January 2020, just before the pandemic really kicked off, Lili has picked up 200,000 customers to date, Bar David tells me.</p>
<p>Its growth was very much on the back of a significant shift in the working world put into motion by the COVID-19 crisis, both in terms of a new cadre of potential users and in terms of how the product is delivered.</p>
<p>On new users, while freelancers have always been present in the economy, their numbers suddenly swelled.</p>
<p>In some cases, people were being forced into pausing their normal employment, for example when say a public venue like a theater had to temporarily close its doors. In others they were simply laid off as businesses no longer appeared viable. In both cases, it led to a sudden surge of people becoming enterprising with their skills to make a living, rather than trying to apply for new full-time work during the pandemic.</p>
<p>It turns out this was a particularly acute predicament for women. More than 5 million women lost jobs in the wake of the pandemic, Bar David said, and many of them turned to freelance work. Lili says that more than half, almost 60%, of its new users are women.</p>
<p>In terms of the technology, Bar David noted that those looking for a new kind of account to help manage finances needed something flexible and completely usable without the need to visit a physical bank branch.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;We were definitely in the right place at the right time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Not only did COVID have an impact on the freelance economy, but it meant no access to bank branches. That meant a greater willingness to adopt a service like ours, and that had a huge effect.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p5">Freelancing &#8212; whatever your actual skill or profession happens to be &#8212; has a lot to recommend it.</p>
<p class="p5">You are, as they say, your own boss: you can choose which hours you work, what work you take on, how to execute it, and whether you want to promote yourself to work on other things without worrying if your manager will endorse or beat down or perhaps worst of all ignore or dismiss your ambition. You have only your own motivation, and luck, to praise or constructively criticize or sympathize with in your annual reviews with yourself about how you have been doing.</p>
<p>But &#8212; and I can say this from very direct experience &#8212; it can also be a real pain in the ass.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jJIr8xGNJZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/lili-series-a/">Freelancer banking startup Lili raises $15M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Freelancer banking startup Lili raises $15M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/lili-series-a/embed/#?secret=jJIr8xGNJZ" data-secret="jJIr8xGNJZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>You have to figure out how to healthily manage your time well, and not take on too much, or panic when not enough work is coming in. You are constantly fighting your own corner when those contracting your services exploit you or underpay you, with the understanding that pushing back too much might find you out of a job altogether. You may not get the chances and work you were hoping to get, and then you don&#8217;t get paid for the shots you never take.</p>
<p>And that is before the considerable efforts you need to put in to effectively become your own business manager.</p>
<p>That includes tracking your expenses, deciding how to itemize things that you spend money on to align them with your taxes, and of course budgeting yourself each month based on your incomings, and using that budget wisely in ways that make the most sense for you as a consumer in the world, and you as a business person. And if this kind of stuff is not your strongest suit, well, that&#8217;s tough. You have to do it anyway.</p>
<p>Lili is an interesting and catchy idea because of how it&#8217;s identified all of those transactional issues, and is building tools to help people manage all of it.</p>
<p>This is not just about having a business card to manage payments, but a bigger system that tracks what you are spending and learns from it to give you advice on how to manage your taxes and expenses, what you should be keeping back each month to pay toward income tax filings, and more. Typically, freelancers either do this on the fly from their personal accounts or set up separate business accounts to try to manage it, but neither of those options really presents a clean and easy to use user experience.</p>
<p>Over time, the plan will be to continue adding in more tools and integrate with a wider set of third-party applications that freelancers might use to invoice customers or pay out invoices themselves. It already has integrations with Venmo and QuickBooks, and more will be coming, Bar David said, &#8220;w<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">hatever a self-employed person needs to be successful,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p>There are now dozens of neobanks on the market, but Lili&#8217;s specific focus on these self-employed freelancers is what has helped it stand out.</p>
<p class="p5">“We anticipate the freelancer economy will continue to robustly grow well beyond the pandemic tailwinds,&#8221; said Group 11 founding partner Dovi Frances, in a statement. &#8220;Lili is poised to see exponential growth by continuing to offer this demographic essential, effective and intuitive tools to manage what was previously an extremely complex and inefficient way of doing business.”</p>
<p class="p5">And to be honest, Lili is not the only neobank out there targeting freelancers &#8212; others include all of the usual neobanks as well as specialists like <a href="https://www.lancebank.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lance Bank</a> &#8212; but it&#8217;s putting everything it can into tech to try to make itself the most effective and best at it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://datarobot.com/">DataRobot</a>, the Boston-based automated machine learning startup, had a bushel of announcements this morning as it expanded its platform to give technical and nontechnical users alike something new. It also announced it has acquired <a href="https://www.zepl.com/">Zepl</a>, giving it an advanced development environment where data scientists can bring their own code to DataRobot. The two companies did not share the acquisition price.</p>
<p>Nenshad Bardoliwalla, SVP of Product at DataRobot says that his company aspires to be the leader in this market and it believes the path to doing that is appealing to a broad spectrum of user requirements, from those who have little data science understanding to those who can do their own machine learning coding in Python and R.</p>
<p>&#8220;While people love automation, they also want it to be [flexible]. They don&#8217;t want just automation, but then you can&#8217;t do anything with it. They also want the ability to turn the knobs and pull the levers,&#8221; Bardoliwalla explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To resolve that problem, rather than building a coding environment from scratch, it chose to buy Zepl and incorporate its coding notebook into the platform in a new tool called Composable ML. &#8220;With Composable ML and with the Zepl acquisition, we are now providing a really first-class environment for people who want to code,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Zepl was founded in 2016 and raised $13 million along the way, according to Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zepl-3ee7">data</a>. The company didn&#8217;t want to reveal the number of employees or the purchase price, but the acquisition gives it advanced capabilities, especially a notebook environment to call its own to attract those more advanced users to the platform. The company plans to incorporate the Zepl functionality into the platform, while also leaving the standalone product in place.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gEZV629kQM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/how-artificial-intelligence-will-be-used-in-2021/">How artificial intelligence will be used in 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How artificial intelligence will be used in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/how-artificial-intelligence-will-be-used-in-2021/embed/#?secret=gEZV629kQM" data-secret="gEZV629kQM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Bardoliwalla said that they see the Zepl acquisition as an extension of the automated side of the house, where these tools can work in conjunction with one another with machines and humans working together to generate the best models. &#8220;This [generates an] organic mixture of the best of what a system can generate using DataRobot AutoML and the best of what human beings can do and kind of trying to compose those together into something really interesting [&#8230;],&#8221; Bardoliwalla said.</p>
<p>The company is also introducing a no-code AI app builder that enables nontechnical users to create apps from the data set with drag and drop components. In addition, it&#8217;s adding a tool to monitor the accuracy of the model over time. Sometimes, after a model is in production for a time, the accuracy can begin to break down as the data on which the model is based is no longer valid. This tool monitors the model data for accuracy and warns the team when it&#8217;s starting to fall out of compliance.</p>
<p>Finally, the company is announcing a model bias monitoring tool to help root out model bias that could introduce racist, sexist or other assumptions into the model. To avoid this, the company has built a tool to identify when it sees this happening both in the model-building phase and in production. It warns the team of potential bias, while providing them with suggestions to tweak the model to remove it.</p>
<p>DataRobot is based in Boston and was founded in 2012. It has raised more than $750 million and has a valuation of over $2.8 billion, according to PitchBook.</p>
