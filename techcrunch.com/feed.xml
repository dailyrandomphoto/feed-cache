										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Latin America startup ecosystem is having a great year, with mega-rounds being announced at breakneck speed and new unicorns minted almost monthly. This is mostly due to the clearly maturing startup scene in the region, with proven successes such as Nubank, Cornershop, Gympass and Loggi helping to bolster LatAm&#8217;s credibility.</p>
<p>Interestingly, many of the region’s rounds are led by or saw participation from investors based elsewhere. Firms such as SoftBank, Tiger Global Management, Tencent, Accel, Ribbit Capital and QED Investors are pouring money into LatAm. Some are even seeing more opportunity than in the U.S. — Latin America, they believe, has historically been ripe for disruption, especially in the fintech and proptech sectors, due to the significant underbanked and unbanked population in the region and the relatively unstructured real estate industry.</p>
<p>Last month, my colleagues Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/">found</a> that structural factors such as <a href="https://docsend.com/view/49zkutri8yxtbgmu">strong digital penetration</a> and <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/latin-america-ecommerce-2020">quick e-commerce growth</a> are among the key reasons Latin America is breaking venture capital records this year. One Mexico-based VC even declared that the story was about &#8220;talent, not capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>Local VCs are raving about the human capital in the region, but for some global investors, the appeal of Latin America extends beyond the talent to the general populace. Shu Nyatta, a managing partner at SoftBank who co-leads its $5 billion Latin America Fund, pointed out a dynamic that might seem obvious but is rarely articulated: Technology in LatAm is often more about <em>inclusion</em> rather than <em>disruption</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vast majority of the population is underserved in almost every category of consumption. Similarly, most businesses are underserved by modern software solutions,&#8221; Nyatta explained. &#8220;There’s so much to build for so many people and businesses. In San Francisco, the venture ecosystem makes life a little better for individuals and businesses who are already living in the future. In LatAm, tech entrepreneurs are building the future for everyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Accel Partner Ethan Choi says the region’s consumer markets are growing rapidly thanks to a fast-growing middle class and &#8220;technology permeating through every aspect of consumers’ lives.&#8221; This has spurred demand for digital offerings, which has led to more startups, and consequently, investor interest.</p>
<h2>Brazil and Mexico riding the gravy train</h2>
<p>One look at the dollars pouring into LatAm this year is enough to convince anyone of the skyrocketing interest.</p>
<p>Latin America saw a total of $6.2 billion in incoming venture capital in the first half of 2021, more than double the $2.6 billion in the same period last year, and even beating the $4.1 billion invested across all of 2020, according to preliminary data from <a href="https://lavca.org/">LAVCA</a> (the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America — LAVCA used a different methodology than CB Insights, in case you’re wondering).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in 2015, researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek remotely hacked into a Jeep Cherokee <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/">driven by a Wired reporter</a>, Andy Greenberg, in an attempt to warn the auto industry of potential pitfalls in their software and inspire legislation around automotive cybersecurity. It did that and more. Fiat Chrysler, which owns Jeep, ended up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/25/business/fiat-chrysler-recalls-1-4-million-vehicles-to-fix-hacking-issue.html?_r=1">recalling 1.4 million vehicles</a> and <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/2015/07/27/fiat-chrysler-nhtsa-fine-recalls/30693265/">paying $105 million in fines</a> to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration.</p>
<p>Aside from a massive hit to Jeep’s brand image, Yoav Levy, co-founder and CEO of automotive cybersecurity company Upstream, reckons this stunt cost the automaker over $1 billion in losses from recalls. On Tuesday, Israel-based Upstream announced a Series C funding raise of $62 million that it will use to bolster its automotive cloud-based security to ensure remote hacks like this don’t happen.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xuvO5oA1Xy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/12/upstream-security-reels-in-9m-series-a-to-protect-connected-cars/">Upstream Security reels in $9M Series A to protect connected cars</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Upstream Security reels in $9M Series A to protect connected cars&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/12/upstream-security-reels-in-9m-series-a-to-protect-connected-cars/embed/#?secret=xuvO5oA1Xy" data-secret="xuvO5oA1Xy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“From the automaker’s cloud, we monitor all the data that is being sent toward the vehicle before the vehicle is actually getting it, and if we’re doing a good job, we can actually block these messages before they get to the car,” Levy told TechCrunch. “We analyze connected car data and telematics data that is being uploaded from the vehicles, analyzing data from mobile phone applications or over-the-air updates and we’re looking for anomalies in the data.”</p>
<p>Aside from scaling its security operations further, Upstream also intends to use the fresh funds to expand its offerings in data analytics, insurance telematics, predictive analytics and business intelligence, the company said. Levy said Upstream often finds anomalies in the data it analyzes that are unrelated to cybersecurity and thinks this is a chance to build out additional applications targeted at OEMs to provide further insights.</p>
<p>That said, Upstream might do just fine by focusing exclusively on automotive cybersecurity, a market that is projected to increase from <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cyber-security-automotive-industry-market-170885898.html">$1.9 billion in 2020 to $4 billion in 2025</a>. Reinforcement mandates are partially responsible for this growth. The<a href="https://unece.org/transport/vehicle-regulations/wp29-world-forum-harmonization-vehicle-regulations-wp29"> World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP 29)</a> has issued cyber vehicle regulation compliance that requires manufacturers selling cars in Europe, Japan and Korea to monitor their vehicles 24/7 with a vehicle security operations center (VSOC). A VSOC is a control room of sorts full of analysts monitoring the infrastructure, cloud, data and firewalls at all times. Although the U.S. doesn’t have any cybersecurity mandates in place for the automotive industry, automakers still increasingly want to produce their product and brand image, lest they fall prey to the same fate as Chrysler-Fiat.</p>

The company offers automakers a dashboard with cloud-based analytics.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside its cloud-based analytics tools and dashboard, VSOC is also a service that Upstream offers. The company currently has close to four million connected vehicles from six different OEMs on its platform across the United States, Europe and Japan, said Levy. He expects that number to continue to grow as more connected vehicles hit the streets.</p>
<p>“Cars are getting more connected each year and OEMs are doubling the amount of data they collect every year,” said Levy. “It’s not only the car and the cloud, but also vehicle-to-vehicle infrastructure, much more sophisticated modules and computers inside the car that are doing edge computing, ADAS systems, computer vision, level two autonomous and soon level three. So with the complexity of connectivity, it’s inevitable that there’s going to be software bugs that could be exploited by hackers who will take control of and inject their own code.”</p>
<p>While the idea of having someone hijack your car remotely and start blaring music as it crashes you into a wall is scary, Levy says most hackers aren’t after violence, or even your car. They want your data. This is especially salient with fleets, and it often manifests in ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>“Think of it like it’s Christmas Eve and you’re a last-mile delivery company, and suddenly you cannot unlock your doors or start your engines,” said Levy. “This is not good for business.”</p>
<p>Levy says this is where cloud-based security comes in handy as well. Rather than seeing into one car at a time, you get a bird’s eye view of the fleet and all of the connected devices, as well as any data incoming from the internet that could be malicious.</p>
<p>Upstream’s path to market is mainly focused on convincing car manufacturers that this technology is necessary, but Levy says fleets are the next big opportunity for the company within the next year or so.</p>
<p>With this latest round, the company has raised a total of $105 million since its founding in 2017. The Series C was led by Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance and was joined by new investors I.D.I. Insurance, 57 Stars’ NextGen Mobility Fund and La Maison Partners. Existing investors Glilot Capital, Salesforce venture, Volvo Group  Venture Capital, Nationwide, Delek US and others also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Levy said some of its historic investors are also customers. Upstream is privately funded by Alliance Ventures (Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi), Volvo Group Venture Capital, Hyundai, Nationwide Insurance, Salesforce Ventures, MSI, CRV, Glilot Capital Partners and Maniv Mobility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is today opening up access to Podcast Subscriptions to all podcast creators in the U.S., after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/spotify-launches-paid-podcasts-through-new-anchor-feature/">first launching the service</a> for testing with a smaller number of creators back in April. Through Spotify’s podcast creation tool <a href="https://anchor.fm/">Anchor</a>, podcasters of all sizes will now able to mark select episodes as subscriber-only content, then publish them to Spotify and other platforms. Since launch, over 100 podcasts have adopted subscriptions, Spotify says. Based on the early feedback from these creators, the company is <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-08-24/opening-up-podcast-subscriptions-to-all-u-s-podcasters/">now making</a> a couple of key changes to both pricing and functionality as the service becomes more broadly available.</p>
<p>Before, creators could choose between one of three price points: either $2.99, $4.99, or $7.99 per month. Creators were able to choose which price point made the most sense for their audience.</p>
<p>But the company learned that creators wanted even more flexibility in pricing, which is why it&#8217;s now expanding the number of price points to 20 options, starting as low as $0.49 and then increasing all the way up to $150.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193061" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193061" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2193061" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193061" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spotify explained that its research found that creators wanted some sense of where to start with pricing, rather than offering a completely open-ended system. That&#8217;s why the pricing isn&#8217;t something creators today manually enter. Going forward, Spotify will show the three price points that tested well &#8212; $0.99, $4.99 and $9.99 &#8212; before listing the other 17 options. Of those three, the company told us $4.99 was the best performing.</p>
<p>In addition to the ability to set pricing and gain access to a private RSS feed that can be used by listeners who prefer using a different podcast app, Spotify will now offer podcast creators the ability to download a list of contact addresses for their subscribers. This allows them to further engage with their subscriber base to offer them more benefits, the company notes. It could also be a selling point for creators who would otherwise not want to get on board with a paid subscription offering like this, if it meant losing out on a more direct relationship with their customer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spotify is not the only service offering paid podcasts. Apple recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">announced</a> its own podcast subscription platform. But Spotify&#8217;s is currently the more affordable of the two. Apple will take a 30% cut from podcast revenue in year one, dropping to 15% in year two &#8212; similar to other subscription apps. Spotify, meanwhile, is keeping its program free for the next two years, meaning that creators keep 100% of revenues until 2023. After that, Spotify plans to take just a 5% cut of subscription revenues.</p>
<p>With this first step into a marketplace model, it&#8217;s notable to see Spotify &#8212; a staunch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457400/spotify-horacio-gutierrez-apple-app-store-interview-decoder">Apple critic</a> in the antitrust fight &#8212; taking such a small percentage of creator revenues. Spotify has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">argued</a> for years that Apple&#8217;s cut of Spotify&#8217;s own subscription business is an anticompetitive practice, especially since Apple is a business rival via its subscription-based Apple Music service, and now, its podcast subscriptions, too.</p>
<p>Today, Spotify hosts a number of subscription-based podcasts, including bigger names like NPR (which is on Apple&#8217;s paid podcasts service, too), as well as independent creators like Betches U Up?, Cultivating H.E.R. Space, and Mindful in Minutes. Creators who choose to work with Spotify aren&#8217;t locked in &#8212; they can share private RSS fees with their customers and publish to other platforms, like Apple Podcasts.</p>
<p>The news of Spotify&#8217;s broader launch follows a growing chorus of complaints from podcasters that Apple&#8217;s own subscriptions service is off to a rough start. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630517/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-launch-dashboard">A report from The Verge</a> documented creators&#8217; complaints about bugs, confusing user interfaces, interoperability issues, and more. In the meantime, Spotify claims its waitlist for creators interested in its podcast subscriptions had &#8220;thousands&#8221; of sign-ups.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tango is designed to help employees get back as much as 20% of their workweek spent searching for that one piece of information or tracking down the right colleague to assist with a task.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ken Babcock and his co-founders, Dan Giovacchini and Brian Shultz, were in the midst of Harvard Business School in March 2020 when they felt the call to start <a href="https://www.tango.us">Tango</a>, a Chrome extension that auto-captures workflow best practices so that teams can learn from their top performers.</p>
<p>“This window of opportunity was driven by the pandemic as we saw a lot of companies become distributed and go remote,” CEO Babcock told TechCrunch. “Team leaders were remotely onboarding people, for perhaps the first time, and accelerating ramp times. There was no longer the opportunity to tap on people’s shoulders in the office, so much of the training was left to people’s own devices.”</p>
<p>They dropped out of their program to start Los Angeles-based Tango, and today, announced a $5.7 million seed round for its workflow intelligence platform. Wing Venture Capital led the round and was joined by General Catalyst, Global Silicon Valley, Outsiders Fund and Red Sea Ventures. A group of angel investors also joined, including former Yelp executive Michael Stoppelman, former Uber head of data Jai Ranganathan, KeepTruckin CEO Shoaib Makani and Awesome People Ventures’ Julia Lipton.</p>
<p>Tango is designed to help employees, particularly in customer success and sales enablement, get back as much as 20% of their workweek spent searching for that one piece of information or tracking down the right colleague to assist with a task. Its technology creates tutorials by recording a users’ workflow — actions, links to pages, URLs and screenshots — and turns that into step-by-step documentation with a video.</p>
<p>Previously the co-founders bootstrapped the company, and decided to go after seed funding to expand the product and growth teams and invest in product development so that Tango could take a product-led growth strategy, Babcock said. The team now has 13 employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since starting last year, Tango has secured 10 pilots to figure out the data and capabilities before it is set to launch publicly in September. Babcock said the company will always have a free version of the product, as well as premium and enterprise versions that will unlock additional capabilities.</p>
<p>“The big thing is around integrations and meeting people where the consumer content is,” Babcock added. “We are reducing that burden of creating documentation, and for companies that already have Wikis or other materials, learning how to inject ourselves into those systems.”</p>
<p>Zach DeWitt, partner at Wing Venture Capital, said he met the company three years ago through a mutual friend.</p>
<p>His firm invests in early-stage, business-to-business startups unlocking a novel data set. In Tango’s case, the company was creating a new data set for the enterprise and business, where users can analyze workflow.</p>
<p>With the average tech company using 150 SaaS apps, up from 20 a decade ago, there are permutations about which app to use, how to use them, what happens if the user gets stuck and what if none of the data is being captured, Dewitt said. Tango works in the background and captures workflow, which is the foundation to the business’ success.</p>
<p>“I was blown away by the approach,” he added. “You have to meet people where they get stuck and even anticipate where they get stuck so you can serve the Tango tutorial to get unstuck. It can also change the company’s culture when it rewards people to share knowledge. The whole idea is beneficial to multiple parties: to those who are getting stuck and to new hires. That is powerful.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cora.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cora</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Brazilian digital lender to small-and-medium-sized businesses, has raised $116 million in a Series B round led by Greenoaks Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a large Series B by any standards, but particularly so for a Latin American startup. It’s also notable that São Paulo-based Cora only raised its $26.7 million Series A round &#8212; led by Silicon Valley VC firm Ribbit Capital &#8212; in early April. The startup has now raised a total of $152.7 million since its 2019 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company wasn’t actively in the market, according to CEO and co-founder Igor Senra, but was approached by existing backer Greenoaks and other investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Tiger Global and Tencent are first-time backers in Cora with this latest round, joining existing investors Greenoaks, Kaszek, QED and Ribbit Capital.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tboq8duB2G"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/ribbit-capital-leads-26-7m-round-for-brazilian-fintech-cora/">Ribbit Capital leads $26.7M round for Brazilian fintech Cora</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ribbit Capital leads $26.7M round for Brazilian fintech Cora&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/ribbit-capital-leads-26-7m-round-for-brazilian-fintech-cora/embed/#?secret=tboq8duB2G" data-secret="tboq8duB2G" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Greenoaks came to us and said they were very impressed, and ready to lead our Series B,” Senra said. “Their main goal was they didn’t want us to spend time on fundraising, but instead stay focused on building the company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pattern is similar to previous ones for Cora, which saw existing backers lead its previous rounds as well, which the company sees as a “strong signal that everything is going in the right direction.” The company declined to comment on valuation.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Cora got its license approved from the Central Bank of Brazil, making it a 403 bank. The fintech then launched its product in October 2020 and today </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offers a checking account combined with a software layer that aims to help SMBs manage their financials. It is currently in beta with a limited group of users for a corporate credit card. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192846" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192846" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192846 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192846" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cora</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Credit limits in general increase as customers use their accounts to receive money and pay their expenses,” he said. “We see this product evolving over time to solve all the financial needs that a small business owner could have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch last October, Cora has been growing its customers 40% per month, according to Senra. During that same period, the company has seen its transaction value/revenue grow by nearly 60% monthly. Today, the startup has more than 120,000 customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s nice to see that volume is growing even higher than our customer base,” Senra told TechCrunch. “Our business must gain trust in order to gain volume. Once our customer base believes we are doing a good job serving them, the way to demonstrate that is to give us more volume.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it is not yet profitable because it’s focused on growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we already have a positive unit economics per customer,” Senra added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a number of other fintechs, Cora’s model is that most of its offerings are free for its customers but it mostly makes money off of interchange fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the company is focused on growing in Brazil, which is large and complex enough, Senra noted. It may consider going abroad in three to four years, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Cora has 150 employees, up from 68 at the end of last year and 40 a year ago. About 130 of its employees are “partners” in the company, Senra said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the startup plans to use its new capital toward product development, growth, operations and building out a credit offering. It is using the data it is generating “to provide way better credit” for its customers, Senra said, starting with credit cards, then receivables and other kinds of credit such as emergency credit or credit for investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to deeply understand our customers’ needs and trying to create products they love,” Senra told TechCrunch. “We consider ourselves the opposite of traditional banks, which are usually not good at taking care of their customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Cora is focused on the B2B service providers, but Senra expects that by the beginning of next year, it can start exploring “other segments” such as other kinds of SMBs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is a total addressable market of 5 million companies, so there is a lot of room to grow,” he added. “But we are pushing ourselves to expand other verticals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Patrick Backhouse of Greenoaks Capital believes that Brazil has an “enormous” SME economy that has historically been “underserved by incumbent banks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Existing services are expensive and inefficient, creating opportunities for technology enabled service providers to offer better and cheaper services,” he said. “We believe Cora is a once in a generation company building efficient digital finance tools for small businesses. Since investing in the company&#8217;s Series A, we’ve seen accelerated momentum and proof that this is an enormous addressable market.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the growing volume of</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ransomware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and supply chain security attacks, there is a need for organizations to more rapidly detect threats. It&#8217;s that opportunity that startup Hunters is looking to capitalize on as the company today announced that it has raised a $30 million Series B round led by</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bessemer-venture-partners/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bessemer Venture Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BVP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hunters, which has offices in Newton, Mass. and Tel Aviv, Israel, was founded in 2018 and has raised a total of $50.4 million to date. The company raised a</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/hunters-ai-raises-4-5m-for-its-autonomous-threat-hunting-solution/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">seed round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of $5.4 million in May 2019 led by YL Ventures and Blumberg Capital. A $15M Series A round followed in June 2020 with participation from Microsoft’s</span><a href="https://m12.vc/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">M12</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.usvp.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Venture Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. An additional</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/hunters-raises-additional-growth-funding-from-snowflake-ventures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth round</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was announced in December 2020, with Snowflake Ventures investing in Hunters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup  builds a technology known as Extended Threat Detection and Response (XDR) which pulls in data from different sources and sensors. All that data is then correlated and analyzed to &#8216;hunt&#8217; for potential indicators of compromise. Hunters co-founder and CEO Uri May explained that his company&#8217;s Open XDR platform can help to identify the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that attackers use to gain access and exploit an organization. The goal is to help reduce the time to detection and accelerate the time to response for a potential security incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The involvement of Snowflake Ventures as an investor as well as Snowflake as a partner for Hunters is one of the reasons that attracted Bessemer to the company. Alex Ferrara, partner at BVP said that from his perspective while there are other vendors in the same space as Hunters, none of them have partnered with a cloud data warehouse vendor like Snowflake, which was a big differentiator for him. Overall, it&#8217;s the market landscape and current state of cyberattacks that makes Hunters an interesting startup for Ferrara and his firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are excited about Hunters because you know we are seeing the institutionalization of ransomware,&#8221; Ferrara, told TechCrunch. &#8220;So I think there is a need for something like Hunters that can be more proactive in a world where I think many enterprises and mid-market companies have already been compromised.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another key market trend that Ferrara sees Hunters fitting into is with the need to help fill the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gap for talented security professionals. Hunters’ technology makes use of automation and machine learning, such that security analysts are able to be more effective in a shorter amount of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">May said that the new funding will help to move Hunters to the next stage of the startup company&#8217;s evolution. To date, he said the company has hit its own internal milestones for customer acquisition and revenues, finding a good market fit for its XDR technology. Now he&#8217;s looking to scale the business, growing the go-to-market sales and marketing initiatives and partner efforts. May emphasized that he&#8217;s also keen to use the funding to cut through the increasingly noisy business of security technology with new innovations that will disrupt the market, providing even more capabilities to users.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the new innovations that Hunters is working on is enhanced machine learning technology to better understand and correlate sources of information. Expanding sources for the Hunters platform is another area where May expects to expand his company&#8217;s platform, with the future integration of more threat intelligence data feeds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a very elaborate and unique roadmap that we&#8217;re working on in terms of innovation that is related to the research that we&#8217;re conducting around cybersecurity,&#8221; May said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During a banner year for connected fitness, Peloton stumbled, as its two treadmills – the Tread+ and Tread – drew the scrutiny of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The two eventually collaborated for the planned recall of 125,000 Tread+ units, while offering fixes to 6,450 Treads – the budget model had a pre-launch go out in limited quantities (largely in Canada).</p>
<p>Today the company is announcing the full launch (or re-launch) of the Tread, which will hit the U.S., Canada and U.K. on August 30 for $2,495 USD /$3,295 CAD / £2,295. It will also arrive in Germany for €2495, this fall. Following the recall, the press release for the Tread features no fewer than eight instances of the word “safety” – clearly a big focus this time around.</p>
<p>The new Tread requires a four-digit safety code to unlock a new workout, as well as a physical safety key that can be pulled out for a quick stop. Users can also remove the key and take it with them to avoid unauthorized usage. The Tread is compact at 68 x 33 x 62 inches and features a 28.8-inch touchscreen that tilts 50 degrees.</p>

<p>After initial pushback, Peloton agreed to the recall of the Tread+ after, “a six-year-old child recently died after being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. In addition, Peloton has received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.”</p>
<p>The Tread, meanwhile, suffered an issue with a touchscreen that could potential detach, fall off and injure users while running. Those who purchased the early version of the tread are entitled to a free repair of the touchscreen. Those changes will be incorporated into new units to avoid the initial issue.</p>
<p>Owners of the Tread+, meanwhile, have until November 6, 2022 for a full refund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating single-family homes for the homeless using 3D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">printing robotics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Developing construction systems to create infrastructure and habitats on the moon, and eventually Mars, with NASA. </span>Delivering what is believed to be the largest 3D-printed structure in North America &#8212; a barracks for Texas Military Department.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just some of the things that Austin, Texas-based construction tech startup </span><a href="http://www.iconbuild.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been working on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the company is adding a massive $207 million Series B raise to its list of accomplishments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been covering ICON since its $9 million seed round in October of 2018, so seeing the company reach this milestone less than three years later is kind of cool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norwest Venture Partners led the startup’s Series B round, which also included participation from 8VC, Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), BOND, Citi Crosstimbers, Ensemble, Fifth Wall, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">LEN</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">x</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Moderne Ventures and Oakhouse Partners. The financing brings ICON’s total equity raised to $266 million. The company declined to reveal its valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON was founded in late 2017 and launched during SXSW in March 2018 with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">first permitted 3D-printed home in the U.S. That 350-square-foot house took about 48 hours (at 25% speed) to print. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON purposely chose concrete as a material because, as co-founder and CEO Jason Ballard put it, “It’s one of the most resilient materials on Earth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the startup says it has delivered more than two dozen 3D-printed homes and structures across the U.S. and Mexico. More than half of those homes have been for the homeless or those in chronic poverty. For example, i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n 2020, ICON delivered 3D-printed homes in Mexico with nonprofit partner New Story. It also completed a series of homes serving the chronically homeless in Austin, Texas, with nonprofit Mobile Loaves &amp; Fishes.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup broke into the mainstream housing market in early 2021 with what it said were the </span><a href="https://www.east17thstreetresidences.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first 3D-printed homes for sale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. for developer 3Strands in Austin, Texas. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the four homes are under contract. The remaining two homes will hit the market on August 31. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And recently, ICON revealed its “next generation” Vulcan construction system and debuted its new</span><a href="https://www.iconbuild.com/updates/icon-unveils-its-next-gen-3d-printer-and-introduces-house-zero"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Exploration Series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of homes. The first home in the series, “House Zero,” was optimized and designed specifically for 3D printing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some context, ICON says its proprietary Vulcan technology produces “resilient, energy-efficient” homes faster than conventional construction methods and with less waste and more design freedom. The company’s new Vulcan construction system, according to Ballard, can 3D print homes and structures up to 3,000 square feet, is 1.5x larger and 2x faster than its previous Vulcan 3D printers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the company’s early days, Ballard has maintained ICON is motivated by the global housing crisis and lack of solutions to address it. Using 3D printers, robotics and advanced materials, he believes, is one way to tackle the lack of affordable housing, a problem that is only getting worse across the country and in Austin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON’s list of future plans include the delivery of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social, disaster relief and more mainstream housing, Ballard said, in addition to developing construction systems to create infrastructure and habitats on the moon, and eventually Mars, with NASA.</span></p>
<p>ICON also has two ongoing projects with NASA. Recently, Mars Dune Alpha was just announced by NASA, ICON and BIG – and ICON so far has finished printing the wall system and is onto the roof now. Also, NASA is recruiting for crewed missions to begin nextfFall to live in the first simulated Martian habitat 3D printed by ICON.</p>
<div>Project Olympus represents ICON&#8217;s effort to develop a space-based construction system for future exploration of the Moon and &#8220;to imagine humanity&#8217;s home on another world.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Our goal is to have ICON tech on the Moon in the next decade,&#8221; Ballard said.</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked, Ballard said the most significant thing that has happened since the company&#8217;s $35 million Series A last August has been the “the radical increase in demand for 3D-printed homes and structures.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That single metric represents a lot for us,” Ballard told TechCrunch. “People have to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">want</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these houses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tackle the housing shortage, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the world needs to increase supply, decrease cost, increase speed, increase resiliency, increase sustainability&#8230; all without compromising quality and beauty, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Perhaps there are a few approaches that can do some of those things, but only construction scale 3D printing holds the potential to do all of those things,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON has seen impressive financial growth, with 400% revenue growth nearly every year since inception, according to Ballard. It’s also tripled its team in the past, year and now has more than 100 employees. It expects to double in size within the next year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The series B funds will go toward </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more construction of 3D-printed homes, “rapid scaling and R&amp;D,” further space-based tech advancements and creating “a lasting societal impact on housing issues,” Ballard said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have already stood up early-stage manufacturing and are in the process of upgrading and accelerating those efforts in order to meet demand for more 3D-printed houses even as we close the round,” Ballard said. “In the next five years, we believe we will be delivering thousands of homes per year and on our way to tens of thousands of homes per year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norwest Venture Partners Managing Partner Jeff Crowe, who is joining ICON’s board as part of the financing, said his firm believes that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON’s 3D printing construction technology will “massively impact the housing shortage in the U.S. and around the globe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is “enormously difficult” to bring together the advanced robotics, materials science and software to develop a robust 3D printing construction technology in the first place, Crowe said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is still harder to develop the technology in a way that can produce hundreds and thousands of beautiful, affordable, comfortable, energy efficient homes in varying geographies with reliability and predictability &#8212; not just one or two demonstration units in a controlled setting,” he wrote via e-mail. “ICON has done all that, and&#8230;has all the elements to be a breakout, generational success.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City based startup NS1 got its start providing organizations with managed DNS services to help accelerate application delivery and reliability. With its new NetBox Cloud service that is being announced in preview today, NS1 is expanding its services into a new area beyond DNS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can often be a challenging task for a network administrator in an enterprise to understand where all the networking infrastructure is and how it&#8217;s all supposed to be connected.  That&#8217;s a job for an emerging class of enterprise technology known as Infrastructure Resource Management (IRM) that NS1 is now jumping into. TechCrunch profiled NS1 in a wide-ranging</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">EC-1 series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month. The company provides DNS as a service, for some of the biggest sites on the internet. DNS, or domain name system is about connecting IP addresses to domain names and NS1 has technology that helps organizations to intelligently optimize application traffic delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new NetBox Cloud service, NS1 is providing a managed service for <a href="https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">NetBox</a> which is a popular open source IRM tool that was initially built by developer Jeremy Stretch, while he was working at cloud provider</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/digitalocean/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">DigitalOcean</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Stretch joined NS1 as a distinguished engineer in April of this year, with NS1 now supporting the open source project.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XaBDQ2VIC8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1/">The NS1 EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The NS1 EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1/embed/#?secret=XaBDQ2VIC8" data-secret="XaBDQ2VIC8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stretch recounted that at one point during his tenure at DigitalOcean he was using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to track IP address management. Using a spreadsheet to track IP addresses doesn&#8217;t scale, so Stretch coded the initial version of NetBox in 2015 to address that need. Over the last several years, NetBox has expanded with additional capabilities that will now also help users of NS1’s NetBox Cloud service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stretch explained that Netbox&#8217;s role is primarily in modelling network infrastructure in an approach that provides what he referred to as a &#8220;source of truth&#8221; for network infrastructure. The basic idea is to enable organizations to model their desired state of their networks and then from that point they can draw in monitoring to verify that the operational state is the same as the desired state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So the idea of this source of truth is that it is the actual documented authoritative record of what is supposed to be configured on the network,&#8221; Stretch said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NetBox has continued to grow over the years as a popular open source tool, but it hasn&#8217;t been particularly accessible to enterprises that required commercial support to get started, or that wanted a managed service. The goal with the new service is to make it easier for organizations of any size to get started with NetBox to better manage their networks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NS1 co-founder and CEO Kris Beevers told TechCrunch that while Stretch has done a solid job of building the NetBox open source community, there hasn&#8217;t been a commercial service for NetBox. Beevers said that while NetBox has had broad adoption as an open source effort, in his view there are a lot of enterprises that will want commercial support and a managed service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key theme that Beevers reiterated time and again in the Extra Crunch EC-1 series is that NS1 is very experimental as a business, and that same theme holds true for NetBox. The primary objective for the initial beta release of the NetBox Cloud is all about figuring out exactly who is trying to adopt the technology and learning what challenges commercial users will face. Fundamentally, Beevers said that NS1 will be actively iterating on NetBox Cloud to make sure it addresses the things that enterprises care about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From the NS1 point of view, this is just such a compelling open source product and community and we want to drive barriers to adoption as low as we possibly can,&#8221; Beevers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NS1 was founded in 2013 and has raised $118.4 million in funding, including a $40 million </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/ns1-nets-40m-true-coronavirus-fundraise-amidst-surging-customer-demand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which the company closed in July 2020.</span></p>

<p>The feature arrives at a time when the online grocery delivery market is <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/grocery-apps-get-smart-during-the-pandemic/581935/">booming due to the pandemic</a>. But this market shift has also led to a number of newer shoppers joining the gig economy who don&#8217;t have the same level of experience as others.</p>
<p>Today, you&#8217;ll come across some shoppers who excel at picking quality items, making great substitutions, and staying in close communication with their customers. Others, meanwhile, are checking out before you even have time to respond to their text about the product replacements they&#8217;ve made or the refunds they&#8217;ve put through. That can leave consumers feeling like online grocery shopping is an unreliable experience. The Preferred Shoppers feature aims to change that.</p>
<p>As Shipt explains, customers who rate their shopper with five stars after their order is complete will be presented with the option to add the shopper to their Preferred Shoppers list. If the shopper accepts this request, they&#8217;ll be prioritized to shop for those customers in the future. (If the shopper declines, however, that won&#8217;t be shown the customer.) This list can be edited at any time, and if a customer downrates a shopper on a future order, they&#8217;ll be removed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192964" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192964" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2192964" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192964" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shipt</p></div></p>
<p>The feature was developed in response to feedback from both shoppers and Shipt regulars, the company says. Consumers, in particular, had been asking for a way to be paired with their favorite shoppers who they already trusted to handle their orders correctly. But until now, whether or not that shopper would be available to grab the customer&#8217;s order was left mostly up to chance. The shopper would have had to see the order come in as it arrived, then grab it before someone else did.</p>
<p>During early <a href="https://shoppers.shipt.com/preferred-members?from_search=59171061">tests</a>, which included the <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:iVJFtfPQR0MJ:https://help.shipt.com/preferred-shoppers-(detroit-metro)+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">Detroit</a> metro, Shipt found the feature impacted its own bottom line and increased shoppers&#8217; tips. Without providing specific metrics, the company said that customers using the feature would order more often and would rate their experience highly. Shoppers also benefitted because they were now serving customers who valued their work and who were expressing their appreciation with a larger tip.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The more often a shopper shops for a customer, the more they learn about that customer’s wants and needs and are able to deliver a tailored shopping experience,&#8221; said Karl Varsanyi, Chief Experience &amp; Product Officer at Shipt, in a statement. &#8220;Preferred Shoppers helps customers get the exceptional service they enjoy again and again,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2192962" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></p>
<p>The feature could also motivate shoppers to focus on building up a quality clientele, so they had a better shot at being assigned orders from customers they enjoyed working with and where they could expect to see higher tips. Over time, as customers add more shoppers to their Preferred Shopper list, the likelihood of being paired with a highly-rated shopper would improve, too. This could perhaps help to address some gig workers complaints over their work being undervalued, where bonuses are placed out of reach and customers are stingy with tips.</p>
<p>The idea for personal shoppers is not new. A startup called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/dumpling-launches-to-make-anyone-become-their-own-instacart/">Dumpling has been developing a platform</a> that allows gig economy workers to transition their clients off apps like Shipt and Instacart to a service where shoppers set their own rates and get to keep all their tips. But many consumers aren&#8217;t aware of Dumpling unless a shopper they know markets the service to them directly. Plus, usage of Dumpling isn&#8217;t free.</p>
<p>In addition, while Shipt offers delivery from a number of top retailers, being owned by Target has other advantages. The service is now integrated into Target&#8217;s own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/target-launches-a-dedicated-shopping-site-for-same-day-delivery-powered-by-shipt/">website</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/target-integrates-shipts-same-day-delivery-service-into-its-mobile-app/">mobile app</a>, and Target products aren&#8217;t marked up on an individual basis, like you sometimes see on other services.</p>
<p>Currently, Shipt&#8217;s membership is $99 per year, offering free delivery on all orders over $35. The Preferred Shoppers feature will be made available to all U.S. members, starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the promise of an interconnected virtual world coming into focus and user-crafted gaming content exploding, Infinite Canvas is looking to apply lessons learned in the esports boom to the metaverse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Metaverse&#8221; is the hot buzzword right now, but it’s not an empty term. Ten different people would probably define the metaverse in ten different ways, but it’s generally used as shorthand for the web of emerging virtual spaces full of personalized avatars, games and digital goods that are already shaping our world.</p>
<p>Much like the realm of esports boasts individual standout players who command their own followings, the social gaming world has its own stars who make original in-game content. But right now, creators making hit content in Fortnite, Roblox and Minecraft are mostly operating on their own, without the supportive infrastructure that quickly professionalized the esports world. And like the early waves of esports players, those content creators skew young and lack some of the resources that would make it smoother to scale the digital brands they’re building.</p>
<p>Founded by Tal Shachar and Sebastian Park, Infinite Canvas is looking to connect creators who craft content for the world’s most popular online games with the financial resources, tools and experience they need to grow their businesses beyond what would be possible in isolation.</p>
<p>Shachar, the former growth strategist at Buzzfeed Studio and Chief Digital Officer at Immortals Gaming Club, and Park, previously VP of Esports for the Houston Rockets where he founded League of Legends franchise team Clutch Gaming, envision a hybrid talent management company and game publisher modeled after the success they’ve seen in the esports world. The pair liken the new venture to “an esports team for the metaverse.”</p>
<p>To grow their vision, Infinite Canvas has raised $2.8 million in pre-seed funds led by Lightshed Venture Partners, the venture firm founded by media analyst Richard Greenfield. BITKRAFT Ventures, Day One Ventures, Crossbeam, and Emerson Collective also participated in the funding round.</p>
<p>“We are just at the beginning of seeing what the metaverse market opportunity can be,” said Greenfield. “While the path to monetization is clear on platforms like YouTube, in virtual worlds Infinite Canvas is pioneering a network that will unite creators, players, and content partners to enhance the earning power of the talent building new virtual empires.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Out of the gate, Infinite Canvas has partnered with some big names in Roblox, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEMOZ_fY37Eeu7vIAynxKUg">Russoplays</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/deeterplays">Deeterplays, </a>Sabrina and DJ Monopoli from Terabrite Games as well as a handful of other Roblox developers, Fortnite map makers and streamers who combined reach more than 4.5 million subscribers.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Wj-qLFN044?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>For the team, this nascent era of user-generated gaming content looks a lot like another now-ubiquitous creator platform once did.</p>
<p>“Roblox in particular, but really all of these UGC gaming platforms really reminded me a lot of YouTube. Which is to say that they were enabling a new type of person to distribute a content format that was previously kind of locked right behind like barriers of distribution and also of skills set and capital, quite frankly,” Shachar told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>After getting curious, Shachar and Park dove into the creator community and found a diverse array of generally self-taught young people from all around the world crafting custom in-game content for Fortnite, Roblox and Minecraft. Much of that content, whether intentionally or not, offered players more digital spaces to connect during the pandemic-imposed social isolation, which saw interest in online social spaces take off.</p>
<p>“Everyone was pretty negative about the world writ large and we&#8217;re just talking to these like 17, 16, 18 19 year old guys, gals and non-binary pals from all over the world just like straight up making cool stuff,” Park said.</p>
<p>In those conversations, Park and Shachar realized that while the world of user-generated gaming content can produce huge hits, creators were mostly isolated from support that could help them take their work to the next level.</p>
<p>“It felt very siloed — you have people making content over here on the right and then people developing these games on the left and then players kind of in the center there and that didn&#8217;t really make a ton of sense to us,&#8221; Shachar said. &#8220;Especially because it was super clear that there was this really strong loop of content creation leading to gameplay leading to content creation.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9G_NABUJKMw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>With Infinite Canvas, they want to provide that missing framework, offering creators crafting content in virtual worlds everything from marketing support to capital and tech tools. As creator monetization channels within virtual worlds mature, Infinite Canvas hopes to even be able to broker ad and brand opportunities and empower creators to expand their own brands across platforms.</p>
<p>“What if we built a new kind of organization that blended parts of being a game publisher, parts of being an esports team, parts of being a capital and tech backend to basically enable these people to do what they do but better and bigger?” Shachar asked.</p>
<p>“For the metaverse — whatever word you want to use — to really exist, it&#8217;s going to take all of these independent people to actually populate it and bring it to life and make all of these experiences and there&#8217;s just an insane amount of talent out there that we think can be unlocked.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than five months after raising $115 million, spend management startup </span><a href="https://ramp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced today it has raised $300 million in a Series C round of funding that values the company at $3.9 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s more than double the $1.6 billion that New York-based Ramp was valued at in April at the time of its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders Fund led the latest round, which brings the fintech’s total equity and debt raised to date to over $625 million since its March 2019 inception. Redpoint Ventures, Thrive Capital, D1 Capital Partners, Spark Capital, Coatue Management, Iconiq, Altimeter, Stripe, Lux Capital, A* Partners, Definition Capital and other existing backers participated in the financing. Founders Fund also led Ramp&#8217;s $15 million Series A in February 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a good year for Ramp, which first launched its corporate card in August of 2019. Since the beginning of 2021, the company says it has seen its number of cardholders on its platform increase by 5x, with more than 2,000 businesses currently using Ramp as their “primary spend management solution.” The transaction volume on its corporate cards has tripled since April, when its last raise was announced. And, impressively, Ramp has seen its transaction volume increase year over year by 1,000%, according to CEO and co-founder Eric Glyman. Given the company&#8217;s business model (it makes money mostly off interchange fees), Ramp also saw its revenue increase by the same amount during that time frame.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spend management startup Ramp confirms $115M raise at a $1.6B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/embed/#?secret=tHzrQ3dMAu" data-secret="tHzrQ3dMAu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wide range of customers use Ramp from startups/unicorns such as Ro, DoNotPay, Better, ClickUp and Applied Intuition to established businesses like Bristol Hospice, Walther Farms, Douglas Elliman and Planned Parenthood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pace of growth in the business has been a lot faster than people expected and so that&#8217;s a big part of what&#8217;s underpinning this new investment and valuation,” Glyman told TechCrunch. “Even in August, we’re experiencing what is shaping up to be the fastest percentage growth all year, if not ever.”  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, such big growth numbers are more commonly seen in the very early stages of a company, and tend to lessen over time as a company matures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says Founders Fund’s Keith Rabois: “</span>As the company has grown, I&#8217;ve continued to invest heavily because it&#8217;s rare to find a business with a growth rate that is actually increasing as it gets larger. Typically growth slows as a company scales, but demand for Ramp’s product is only accelerating as the team builds awareness and strengthens their product offering.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramp also today announced its acquisition of </span><a href="https://www.buyer.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a “negotiation-as-a-service” platform that claims to save its clients an average of 27.3% on big-ticket purchases, such as annual software contracts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the addition of the 10-person Buyer team, Glyman said Ramp will be able to offer its customers a “customized and proactive approach” to savings on large purchases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are more B2B growth SaaS companies than ever before, and they’re better at charging than they’ve ever been,” he noted. “Buyer is viewed as the leader of a generation of startups that are trying to flip the tables and actually help customers negotiate rates down. Very large companies might have procurement departments to negotiate rates, but for those who don’t, Buyer is very skilled at identifying what new contracts are coming up and negotiating them down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has saved its customers about 27% on SaaS contracts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re looking forward to adding those figures to the savings we’ve helped businesses incorporate,” Glyman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The buy follows a partnership that was forged earlier this year before Ramp realized that it could “be even stronger by having them fully as a part of the Ramp team, and and really build out even further.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramp  intends to expand its product offering as a result of the acquisition. By combining Buyer’s team with benchmarking spend data from millions of transactions on its platform, Ramp says it wants to help its customers negotiate the best rate on “anything that can be purchased with a card, from travel to software &#8212; with the goal of shifting purchasing power back into the hands of buyers.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192740" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192740" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192740 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192740" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ramp</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other ways Ramp helps its customers save include offering 1.5% cash back “on everything,” helping them identify ways to spend less, such as identifying and canceling duplicitous subscriptions and identifying redundancies in licenses. It also shows companies when better pricing is available. One example of this is letting them know they can save 20% by switching to an annual rate, as opposed to monthly. It also has helped customers save by getting rid of software like Concur, Expensify or Bill.com by helping them manage their expenses. Ramp claims that its customers on average save 3.3% annually by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">switching their corporate card spending to Ramp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/ramp-adds-merchant-blocking-to-corporate-credit-card/">added merchant blocking to its corporate credit card</a>, which Glyman says has probably become one of the company’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most used features since adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to use its new capital to speed up the development of its finance automation platform. It’s also going to naturally continue to hire, adding to its nearly 150-person team. For context, Ramp started the year with 65, people and employed about 100 at the time of its April raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hiring is going to be the biggest use of our capital,” Glyman told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is also going to invest heavily in product development, including expansion into broader B2B payments, and marketing and awareness. It’s also going to look for more acquisition targets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Ramp currently makes money mostly by interchange fees, Glyman told me previously that the two-year-old startup thinks of itself as a SaaS operator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our long-term strategy is to develop great software,” he said.</span></p>
<p>No doubt the spend management space is heating up. Last week, Brex announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/brex-buys-weav-a-universal-api-for-commerce-platforms-for-50m/">acquiring one-year-old Weav</a> for $50 million in its first significant acquisition. Founded in 2017, San Francisco-based Brex earlier this year was valued at $7.4 billion after raising a $425 million Series D led by Tiger Global. It is more focused on earlier-stage startups, whereas Ramp tends to serve larger, more established companies.</p>

<h2>Virgin Orbit plans $3.2B SPAC</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1894751" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Virgin-Orbit-87.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1894751" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1894751" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Virgin-Orbit-87.jpg" alt="Virgin Orbit 87" width="1024" height="571" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Virgin-Orbit-87.jpg 3066w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Virgin-Orbit-87.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Virgin-Orbit-87.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Virgin-Orbit-87.jpg?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Virgin-Orbit-87.jpg?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Virgin-Orbit-87.jpg?resize=1536,857 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Virgin-Orbit-87.jpg?resize=2048,1142 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Virgin-Orbit-87.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1894751" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Virgin Orbit</p></div></p>
<p>The past year has been a real dam-break in terms of exit events for space-focused startups, and it&#8217;s hard to attribute that to anything other than the rise in popularity of the SPAC merger path to public markets. Virgin Galactic began the fad, and now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/virgin-orbit-to-go-public-via-3-2b-spac-deal/">Richard Branson&#8217;s other space company, Virgin Orbit, is following suit</a>.</p>
<p>Virgin Orbit, which also launches its spacecraft from a modified commercial airplane at high-altitude, but which focuses on small satellite payloads instead of flying people, stands to gain nearly half-a-bilion dollars in on-hand cash from the merger.</p>
<p>SPACs remain something that most retail investors and market observers should be wary of, but Virgin Orbit does appear to have some solid business in fundamentals in place, now that it&#8217;s actually an active launch services provider. The company reached orbit for the first time in January, and then flew its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/virgin-orbit-successfully-launches-its-first-commercial-payloads-to-space/">first commercial mission for paying customers in June</a>.</p>
<h2>Relativity&#8217;s first launch slips, but Astra&#8217;s is on track</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2125089" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125089" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125089" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg" alt="Relativity Space's Terran 1 rocket, artist's rendering" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125089" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Relativity Space</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other newbie launch provider news, 3D-printed rocket startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/relativity-is-pushing-back-the-demo-launch-of-its-terran-1-rocket-to-early-2022/">Relativity Space has pushed its first flight to 2022</a>. The company&#8217;s debut Terran 1 rocket needs a bit more time, owing to no individual factor, but because of various refinements to the design, a new engine design, better construction materials — and yes, the impact of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The company is still aiming to have that launch done by &#8220;early 2022,&#8221; so it doesn&#8217;t sound like it&#8217;s slipping in terms of target time very much. Of course, in the space industry, you can never be sure of when a rocket is taking off until it actually takes off.</p>
<p>Astra is another provider looking to join the club of active launch companies by the end of 2021. While the company has done well with its test launches to date, but it hasn&#8217;t technically achieved orbit. It&#8217;ll look to add that notch to its belt, along with getting its first commercial launch done for a paying customer, with a launch window that opens later this week. It got the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/astra-given-regulatory-green-light-for-its-first-commercial-orbital-launch-at-the-end-of-the-month/">green light from the FAA to fly the mission last week</a>, setting the stage for the attempt.</p>
<h2>Taiwan and Australia&#8217;s commercial launch moves</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2192645" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192645" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2192645" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2192645" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.industry.gov.au/policies-and-initiatives/australian-space-agency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Space Agency <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Taiwanese launch startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/taiwan-innovative-space-will-conduct-a-test-launch-of-its-hapith-i-rocket-in-australia-later-this-year/">Tispace has also gotten a regulatory green light for its first commercial launch</a>. The company is looking to fly a test flight of its two-stage suborbital rocket, and will do so from a launch complex in Southern Australia. Both Australia and Taiwan have young but potentially promising space industries, so this should be a mission to watch once it gets a firm schedule for later this year.</p>
<h2>Join us at TC Sessions: Space in December</h2>
<p>Last year we held our first dedicated space event, and it went so well that we decided to host it again in 2021. This year, it&#8217;s happening December 14 and 15, and it&#8217;s once again going to be an entirely virtual conference, so people from all over the world will be able to join — and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">you can, too</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung Group, South Korea’s tech giant, announced on Tuesday that it will invest $205 billion (240 trillion won) in their semiconductor, biopharmaceuticals and telecommunications units over the next three years to enhance its global presence and lead in new industries such as next-generation telecommunication and robotics.</p>
<p>The investment will be led by Samsung affiliates including Samsung Electronics and Samsung Biologics. It also unveiled mergers and acquisitions plan to fortify its technology and market leadership.</p>
<p>With setting aside $154.3 billion (180 trillion won) for home ground, Samsung expects to create 40,000 new jobs by 2023 through the investment.</p>
<p>This announcement comes days after Samsung Electronics vice chairman Jay Y. Lee was released on parole on 13 August right before South Korea’s Liberation Day. People speculated Samsung would be able to move forward with major investment once he was freed from prison, <a href="https://www.etnews.com/20210809000233">according to local media reports.</a></p>

<p>Samsung’s latest investment will be used for semiconductor, biopharmaceuticals and the next-generation telco units, according to the company’s statement.</p>
<p>Samsung Electronics plans to develop advanced process technology and expand the business with artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers for its system semiconductors while it will focus on up-to-date technology such as EUV-based sub14-nanometer DRAM and over 200-layer V-NAND products for the memory business. Samsung had <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210513004500320">announced in May</a> the company will invest $151 billion in its logic chip and foundry sector, to be the top logic chip maker, by 2030.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Samsung Biologics and Samsung Bioepis plans to establish two new plants, in addition to a fourth factory that is under construction, for expanding the contract development manufacturing organization (CDMO) business, the statement said.</p>
<p>South Korea’s largest conglomerate also will support its ongoing R&amp;D in new technologies and emerging application in areas such as AI and robotics along with the next generation OLED, quantum-dot display and high-energy density batteries development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London based <a href="https://www.plentific.com/en-gb/">Plentific</a>, which operates a marketplace SaaS platform targeting the property management space, has closed a $100 million Series C. The funding round is led by new investors Highland Europe and Brookfield Technology Partners &#8212; the VC arm of the eponymous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/how-to-land-startup-funding-from-brookfield-asset-management-which-manages-600-billion-in-assets/">real estate giant</a> &#8212; along with Mubadala Investment Company and RXR Digital Ventures, as well as existing investors A/O PropTech and Target Global.</p>
<p>The 2013-founded startup provides a cloud platform for landlords, property and<span lang="EN-GB"> facilities managers, and service providers &#8212; taking aim at legacy software with a joined up digital marketplace for locating tradespeople, managing repairs, keeping tenants informed and generating analytics to support data-driven property service delivery. </span></p>
<p>Live in the UK, Germany and the US, it says the new financing will go on significantly growing its<span lang="EN-GB"> presence in the US as well as further global expansion. Its total equity raised to date with this latest round is $140M.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Plentific says it intends to spend on</span><span lang="EN-GB"> accelerating its engineering and product development to further fire up digitalisation across the property and facilities management space &#8212; with a plan to integrate Internet of Things (IoT) into its platform and also build out asset management solutions. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">It&#8217;s also eying baking in machine learning and AI to help commercial and residential landlords increase returns and &#8220;make smarter decisions&#8221;, per its pitch. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="il">Series C funds will also go on beefing up </span>its offer for service provider &#8212; such as by increasing its CRM (Customer Relationship Management) functionality so it can better position itself to pull in contractors of all sizes.</span></p>
<p>The home improvement trend that boomed during the pandemic lockdown certainly seems to have been very positive for Plentific&#8217;s business: Per its <a href="https://www.plentific.com/en-gb/">website</a>, 350,000+ properties are now managed by the platform across its three (current) markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup also told TechCrunch it has 100+ &#8220;large clients&#8221;, at this stage, and more than 16,000 contractors on its marketplace. While the number of properties Plentific has under management has grown 17-fold in the last three years, per a spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Plentific targets its property management tools broadly, at a range of customers and sectors, from private landlords and those running short term lets; to those responsible for managing social housing or student accommodation; and to property managers in sectors like education, hospitality, sport/fitness and social care. (So &#8212; unlike startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/mashroom/">Mashroom</a>, which are trying to disrupt the traditional managed service letting agency model &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t play in the lettings side of the market and would instead be hoping to win such agencies as customers for its tools.)</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series C in a statement, Cem Savas, CEO and co-founder of <span class="il">Plentific</span>, said: “We had a phenomenal year of growth, more than doubling headcount to almost 200 employees, opening an office in the United States and cementing our position in the UK and German markets. Our next step is to rapidly expand in the US, as well as look to begin operating in new geographies. We have only just scratched the surface of a $2.5 trillion potential market opportunity. We will now be rapidly expanding both our global footprint and the solutions we offer to become the de facto digital partner for landlords and service providers across the world.”</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Josh Raffaelli, managing partner at Brookfield, added: “We are thrilled to partner with Plentific as it seeks to fully digitize the repairs and maintenance process. As one of the world’s largest real estate owner, operator and investor we have first-hand knowledge of how lowering operating costs can help drive efficiencies. We look forward to leveraging that knowledge and experience to help fuel Plentific’s growth and expand its global footprint.”</p>
<p>Another growing area of focus Plentific flags is supporting customers to expand their Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) credentials &#8212; saying it will expand capabilities in this &#8220;critical area&#8221;. Here it works with clients through its PropertyLab accelerator program which it says aims to develop solutions to strengthen ESG initiatives and make reporting more robust through enhanced analytics, in addition to trying to tackle the carbon footprint of properties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A Bahraini human rights activist&#8217;s iPhone was silently hacked earlier this year by a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/toolkit-nso-pegasus-iphone-android/">powerful spyware</a> sold to nation-states, defeating new security protections that Apple designed to withstand covert compromises, say researchers at Citizen Lab.</p>
<p>The activist, who remains in Bahrain and asked not to be named, is a member of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, an award-winning nonprofit organization that promotes human rights in the Gulf state. The group continues to operate despite a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2004/09/29/bahrain-rights-center-closed-crackdown-expands">ban imposed by the kingdom</a> in 2004 following the arrest of its director for criticizing the country&#8217;s then-prime minister.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab, the internet watchdog based at the University of Toronto, analyzed the activist&#8217;s iPhone 12 Pro and found evidence that it was hacked starting in February using a so-called &#8220;zero-click&#8221; attack, since it does not require any user interaction to infect a victim&#8217;s device. The zero-click attack took advantage of a previously unknown security vulnerability in Apple&#8217;s iMessage, which was exploited to push the Pegasus spyware, developed by Israeli firm NSO Group, to the activist&#8217;s phone.</p>
<p>The hack is significant, not least because <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/08/bahrain-hacks-activists-with-nso-group-zero-click-iphone-exploits/">Citizen Lab researchers</a> said it found evidence that the zero-click attack successfully exploited the latest iPhone software at the time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/">both iOS 14.4</a> and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/apple-just-dropped-a-whole-bunch-of-os-updates-and-wwdc-info/">iOS 14.6</a>, which Apple released in May. But the hacks also circumvent a new software security feature built into all versions of iOS 14, dubbed BlastDoor, which is supposed to prevent these kinds of device hacks by filtering malicious data sent over iMessage.</p>
<p>Because of its ability to circumvent BlastDoor, the researchers called this latest exploit ForcedEntry.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab&#8217;s Bill Marczak told TechCrunch that the researchers made Apple aware of the efforts to target and exploit up-to-date iPhones. When reached by TechCrunch, Apple would not explicitly say if it had found and fixed the vulnerability that NSO is exploiting.</p>
<p>In a boilerplate statement re-released Tuesday, Apple&#8217;s head of security engineering and architecture Ivan Krstic said: &#8220;Apple unequivocally condemns cyberattacks against journalists, human rights activists, and others seeking to make the world a better place … Attacks like the ones described are highly sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop, often have a short shelf life, and are used to target specific individuals. While that means they are not a threat to the overwhelming majority of our users, we continue to work tirelessly to defend all our customers, and we are constantly adding new protections for their devices and data.”</p>

	</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Apple said BlastDoor was not the end of its efforts to secure iMessage and that it has strengthened its defenses in iOS 15, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/7-new-security-features-apple-quietly-announced-at-wwdc/">slated</a> for release in the next month or so.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab said the Bahraini government was likely behind the targeting of the Bahraini human rights activist, as well as eight other Bahraini activists between June 2020 and February 2021.</p>
<p>Bahrain is one of several authoritarian states known to be government customers of Pegasus, including Saudi Arabia, Rwanda, the United Arab Emirates and Mexico; though, NSO has repeatedly declined to name or confirm its dozens of customers, citing nondisclosure agreements.</p>
<p>Five of the targeted Bahrainis&#8217; phone numbers were found on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/toolkit-nso-pegasus-iphone-android/">the Pegasus Project list</a> of 50,000 phone numbers of potential surveillance targets of the Pegasus spyware, which gives its government customers near-complete access to a target&#8217;s device, including their personal data, photos, messages and location.</p>
<p>One of those listed phone numbers belongs to another member of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, which Citizen Lab said was targeted months earlier and with a different zero-click exploit, called Kismet, which predates ForcedEntry. Citizen Lab says Kismet no longer works on iOS 14 and later since BlastDoor was introduced, but still poses a risk to devices running older iPhone versions.</p>
<p>Two other Bahrainis, who now live in exile in London and consented to be named, also had their iPhones hacked.</p>
<p>Moosa Abd-Ali, a photojournalist who was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7861645/finfisher-spyware-let-bahrain-government-hack-political-activist">previously targeted by FinFisher spyware</a> sold to the Bahraini government, had his iPhone hacked while living in London. Citizen Lab said it has only seen the Bahraini government spy in Bahrain and in neighboring Qatar, and said it suspects that another foreign government with access to Pegasus may have been responsible for the hack. Recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/21/uae-linked-to-listing-of-hundreds-of-uk-phones-in-pegasus-project-leak">reporting found</a> the United Arab Emirates, a close ally of Bahrain, is the &#8220;principal government&#8221; for selecting phone numbers in the U.K. Abd-Ali&#8217;s phone number was also on the list of 50,000 phone numbers.</p>
<p>Bahraini activist Yusuf Al-Jamri also had his iPhone hacked, believed by the Bahraini government, some time before September 2019, though it is not known if Al-Jamri&#8217;s iPhone was hacked while in Bahrain or in London. Al-Jamri was granted asylum in the U.K. in 2017.</p>
<p>The seven unnamed Bahrainis continue to work in the kingdom despite a long history of human rights violations, internet censorship and widespread oppression. Reporters Without Borders ranks Bahrain&#8217;s human rights record as <a href="https://rsf.org/en/bahrain">one of the most restrictive</a> in the world, ranked only behind Iran, China and North Korea. A 2020 report by the U.S. State Department on Bahrain&#8217;s human rights said the country cited considerable violations and abuses, and noted that the government &#8220;used computer programs to surveil political activists and members of the opposition inside and outside the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>When reached, NSO Group did not answer specific questions nor would it say if the Bahraini government was a customer. In a statement attributed only as an NSO spokesperson sent via its external public relations firm Mercury, NSO said that it had not seen Citizen Lab&#8217;s findings and that it would &#8220;vigorously investigate the claims and act accordingly based on the findings.&#8221;</p>
<p>NSO <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/21/shalev-hulio-nso-surveillance/">recently claimed</a> it cut off five government customers&#8217; access to Pegasus for human rights abuses.</p>
<p>Zainab Al-Nasheet, a spokesperson for the Bahraini government, told TechCrunch in a statement: &#8220;These claims are based on unfounded allegations and misguided conclusions. The government of Bahrain is committed to safeguarding the individuals’ rights and freedoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abd-Ali, who said he was arrested and tortured in Bahrain, said that he thought he would find safety in the U.K. but that he still encounters digital surveillance but also physical attacks, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/03/digital-violence-nso-group-spyware/">many victims of spyware experience</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of protecting me, the U.K. government has stayed silent while three of their close allies — Israel, Bahrain and the UAE — conspired to invade the privacy of myself and dozens of other activists,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Khatabook, a startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/indias-khatabook-raises-60-million-to-help-merchants-digitize-bookkeeping-and-accept-payments-online/">helping merchants in India digitize their bookkeeping and accept online payments</a>, said on Tuesday it has raised $100 million in a new financing round as it prepares to launch financial services.</p>
<p>The startup’s new financing round &#8212; a Series C &#8212; was led by Tribe Capital and Moore Strategic Ventures and valued the two-and-a-half-year-old Bangalore-headquartered startup at &#8220;close to $600 million,&#8221; its co-founder and chief executive Ravish Naresh told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>As part of the new round &#8212; which was oversubscribed and also saw participation of Balaji Srinivasan and Alkeon Capital as well as many other existing investors including Sriram Krishnan, B Capital Group, Sequoia Capital, Tencent, RTP Ventures, Unilever Ventures, and Better Capital &#8212; Khatabook said it is also buying back shares worth $10 million to reward its current and former employees and early investors. The startup said it is also expanding its stock options pool for employees to $50 million</p>
<p>Even as hundreds of millions of Indians came online in the past decade, most merchants in the South Asian nation are still offline. These merchants, who run neighborhood stores, rely on traditional ways for bookkeeping &#8212; maintaining ledgers on paper &#8212; that are both time-consuming and prone to errors.</p>
<p><a href="https://khatabook.com">Khatabook</a> is attempting to change that by providing these merchants with a suite of products to digitize their bookkeeping and manage their expenses and staff. The startup, which employs over 200 people, said it has amassed over 10 million monthly active users who are spread across nearly every zip code in the country.</p>
<p>Scores of firms from young startups such as Khatabook and Dukaan to Facebook, Amazon and India&#8217;s largest retail chain Reliance Retail are aggressively attempting to tap into neighborhood stores in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>There are about 60 million small and medium-sized businesses in India, a fraction of which are neighborhood stores &#8212; also popularly known as kirana in South Asia &#8212; that dot tens of thousands of Indian cities, towns, and villages. These mom-and-pop stores offer all kinds of items, pay low wages and little to no rent. And on top of that, their economics is often better than most.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At Tribe, we believe strongly in the power of the network effect and how it can create moats for businesses. Khatabook has successfully built such a network by empowering this seismic shift among MSME businesses to move from paper to digital, literally,&#8221; said Arjun Sethi, co-founder and partner at Tribe Capital, in a statement. &#8220;Despite its large early success and fast adoption to date, the company is early in its path to power the segment. We’re thrilled to be a part of its growth as it leverages its network to build additional scale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Khatabook, which also counts Emphasis Ventures (EMVC) among its backers, has expanded its product offerings in recent years to lure more businesses. Later this year, Naresh said, the startup will provide lending to merchants. &#8220;We are currently testing the product with both retailers and distributors,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Online lending has boomed in India in recent years, but very few companies are today attempting to cater to small- and medium-sized businesses. “The unaddressed SME credit demand in India is ~$300-$350 billion, with more than 90% of current demand being met by banks. A typical digital SME lender focusses on 1-5 million Indian rupees ($13,575 to $67,875) ticket size with no collateral, average tenure ~12-18 months, and with some ecosystem anchor,” analysts at Bank of America wrote in a report.</p>
<p>As with scores of other firms, the pandemic was not good news for Khatabook, which lost a significant portion of the business last year after Indian states enforced lockdown to restrict mobility. But the startup has since bounced back. The month of July, said Naresh, was its all-time high. &#8220;MSMEs have come back very strongly and businesses were not as impacted by the second wave this year as they were by last year&#8217;s,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A one-year-old startup that is building a business-to-business marketplace for merchants in Pakistan and also helping them digitize their bookkeeping is the latest to secure a mega round in the South Asian market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bazaar-tech.com">Bazaar</a> said on Tuesday it has raised $30 million in a Series A round. The new financing round &#8212; the largest Series A in Pakistan &#8212; was led by Silicon Valley-based early stage VC Defy Partners and Singapore-based Wavemaker Partners.</p>
<p>Scores of other investors including current and former leaders of Antler, Careem, Endeavor, Gumroad, LinkedIn and Notion as well as new investors Acrew Capital, Japan’s Saison Capital, UAE’s Zayn Capital and B&amp;Y Venture Partners and existing investors Indus Valley Capital, Global Founders Capital, Next Billion Ventures, and Alter Global also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>One way to think about Bazaar is &#8212; especially if you have been following the Indian startup ecosystem &#8212; that it’s sort of a blend between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/indian-b2b-e-commerce-startup-udaan-raises-280-million/">Udaan</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/indias-khatabook-raises-60-million-to-help-merchants-digitize-bookkeeping-and-accept-payments-online/">KhataBook</a>. “That’s a good way to describe us,” said Hamza Jawaid, co-founder of Bazaar in an interview. “We had this benefit of hindsight to not just look at India but other emerging markets,” he said.</p>
<p>“We saw lots of synergies between these two. If you look at commerce, you have to acquire every single merchant in every single category differently. Whereas with Khata, merchants in any city and category can download it. So effectively, it’s a great customer acquisition tool for you,” he said on a WhatsApp call, adding that this also provides greater insight into businesses.</p>
<p>Bazaar’s business-to-business marketplace, which provides merchants with the ability to procure inventories at a standard price and choose from a much larger catalog, is currently available in Karachi and Lahore, the nation’s largest cities, while Easy Khata is live across the country.</p>
<p>At stake is a booming $170 billion retail market in the world&#8217;s fifth-most populous nation that is yet to see much deployment of technology, said Saad Jangda, Bazaar&#8217;s other co-founder. Both of them have known each other since childhood and reconnected in Dubai a few years ago. At the time, Jawaid was at McKinsey &amp; Company while Jangda was working with Careem as a product manager for ride-hailing and food delivery products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are about 5 million micro, small, and medium-sized businesses in Pakistan. Like India, even as a significant portion of the population has come online, most merchants remain unconnected, said the founders, who surveyed shops going door-to-door.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193087 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>“We’ve been investing in FMCG B2B marketplaces across the region since 2017. After working with Hamza and Saad over the past year, we’ve been impressed by their customer-centric approach to product development and the speed of their learning and execution,” said Paul Santos, Managing Partner at Wavemaker Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p>“It’s no surprise that they’ve received glowing reviews from their customers and partners. We’re excited to support Bazaar as they solidify their market leadership and digitize Pakistan’s retail ecosystem,” he added.</p>
<p>The startup said it has amassed over 750,000 merchants since launch last year. And it appears to have solved a problem that many of its South Asian peers are still grappling with: Retention. Bazaar said it has a 90% retention rate.</p>
<p>I asked Jangda if he plans to expand to the ‘dukaan’ category. Several startups in Asia are currently building tools to help merchants set up online presence and accept digital orders. He said the market is currently not ready for a dukaan product just yet. “The B2C market is still developing, so there is not so much demand from the consumer side yet,” he added.</p>
<p>Instead the current new focus is financial services. In recent months, the startup said it has tested a buy now pay later product and early results have shown a 100% repayment.</p>
<p>“Bazaar is going after a massive opportunity with the ultimate aim of creating a generational story in and from Pakistan. In a country with incredible talent and huge market opportunity, it&#8217;s about time we create an inspirational story that brings together the country’s best talent who can go on to create many such stories in the future,” said the founders.</p>
<p>Bazaar eventually wants to become a super app, or a broader operating system for retail in Pakistan. It plans to deploy the fresh funds to expand its services to more cities across Pakistan and build and scale more products.</p>
<p>“What Bazaar has managed to accomplish in the last year is incredible. We are extremely impressed by the speed and robustness with which they build and deploy. As Defy’s first investment into Pakistan’s burgeoning tech ecosystem, we feel Bazaar is on its way to create a category defining company for the country” said Kamil Saeid &#8211; Partner at Defy Partners.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s announcement comes a week after Airlift, another Pakistan’s startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/pakistans-airlift-raises-85-million-for-its-quick-commerce-startup-eyes-international-expansion/">announced a big round</a> as high-profile global investors begin to explore the South Asian market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few months ago, brothers Hai Nam Bui and Hai Long Bui were developing a bookkeeping app for small retailers in Vietnam. Called <a href="https://sobanhang.com/">SoBanHang</a> (or “sales book”), it would help businesses that usually rely on paper ledgers digitize their operations, similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/indias-khatabook-raises-60-million-to-help-merchants-digitize-bookkeeping-and-accept-payments-online//">Khatabook</a> in India and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bukukas-gets-50m-from-investors-including-doordashs-gokul-rajaram-and-transferwise-co-founder-taavet-hinrikus/">BukuKas</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/bukuwarung-a-fintech-for-indonesian-msmes-scores-60m-series-a-led-by-valar-and-goodwater/">BukuWarung</a> in Indonesia. Then a new COVID-19 outbreak hit Vietnam. The businesses SoBanHang had been working with, which are often family owned and have less than five employees, struggled to cope. The team held a hackathon and came up with a new product for retailers to create online stores and manage orders. Since launching three months ago, SoBanHang’s “hyper local e-commerce enabler” has signed up almost 20,000 merchants, many selling online for the first time.</p>
<p>The company announced today that it has raised $1.5 million in seed funding, with participation from investors including FEBE Ventures, Class 5 and Kevin P. Ryan, founder of businesses like Gilt Groupe, Business Insider and MongoDB.</p>
<p>Before launching SoBanHang, Hai Nam Bui founded Datamart Solutions, a data analytics and automation platform, and served leadership roles at Lazada. Hai Long Bui also spent several years in management at Lazada, before holding the chief analytics and chief technology officer positions at Landers Superstore, a Philippines supermarket chain.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;India&#8217;s Khatabook raises $60 million to help merchants digitize bookkeeping and accept payments online&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/indias-khatabook-raises-60-million-to-help-merchants-digitize-bookkeeping-and-accept-payments-online/embed/#?secret=iIu01qktIg" data-secret="iIu01qktIg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The idea for SoBanHang was planted when Hai Nam Bui visited a grocery store while wearing a Lazada T-shirt. The store’s owners saw the shirt and asked him how they could start selling online. So he helped them register an account on Shoppe and start uploading product photos and descriptions.</p>
<p>“After I had everything set up, they got their first order and asked, ‘how can I ship the product?’” Hai told TechCrunch. “I said that a third-party logistics provider will come and pick up the goods. And then they asked about the money. They didn’t understand the process and they didn’t feel comfortable giving goods to a third-party logistics providers.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193073" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193073" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2193073" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SBH_merchant.jpg" alt="A photo of a merchant in Vietnam looking at a smartphone" width="450" height="273" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SBH_merchant.jpg 1279w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SBH_merchant.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SBH_merchant.jpg?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SBH_merchant.jpg?resize=768,466 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SBH_merchant.jpg?resize=680,413 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SBH_merchant.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193073" class="wp-caption-text">One of SoBanHang&#8217;s clients</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since the majority of e-commerce orders in Vietnam are paid through cash on deliveries, the store’s owners also had questions about payment. Hai explained that the customer would hand cash to the rider, who would then give it to Shoppe and, in turn, Shopee would deposit it into the store owner’s digital wallet.</p>
<p>“And they asked ‘where is the wallet? How can I withdraw money to a bank account if I don’t have a bank account?’ That was an a-ha moment, when I realized that a lot of e-commerce platforms are still not touchable to about 90% of retailers in Vietnam,&#8221; said Hai. &#8220;The systems are still way too complex for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hai and his brothers started working on a digital bookkeeping app to help businesses digitize their operations, but when the outbreak and lockdowns hit, it became imperative to help them start selling online immediately. Based on SoBanHang’s research, there are about 16 million &#8220;nano&#8221; to micro-sized businesses in Vietnam. Many are very local, serving customers within a couple kilometers. In fact, businesses on SoBanHang often perform their own deliveries on foot.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;BukuKas gets $50M from investors including DoorDash&#8217;s Gokul Rajaram and TransferWise founder Taavet Hinrikus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bukukas-gets-50m-from-investors-including-doordashs-gokul-rajaram-and-transferwise-co-founder-taavet-hinrikus/embed/#?secret=aPhF6nP8gk" data-secret="aPhF6nP8gk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“That was our second a-ha moment about the retailers, which is that they are selling to customers in their neighborhoods. The buyers and sellers are actually within walking distance. When they connect with buyers, they can make that order transaction, and then retailers deliver the good themselves and collect the money at the customer’s doorstep,” said Hai. This eliminates the need for SoBanHang to have complex logistics or payment systems, or for merchants to use third-party delivery apps that charge high commission fees.</p>
<p>Many of SoBanHang’s clients previously managed most of their transactions on paper and didn’t have a point-of-sale system or laptop, so the app is the first time they have digitized their operations. SoBanHang can be used for all kinds of retailers, but during the COVID-19 outbreak, it’s seen the most adoption from food and convenience stores.</p>
<p>The retailers are small enough that their customers can just message them orders, but SoBanHang makes the process smoother and enables them to sell more. Having an online storefront also helps prepare retailers for other COVID-19 outbreaks and maintain relationships with their customers.</p>

<p>For example, SoBanHang has a strategic partnership with <a href="https://vietteltelecom.vn/">Viettel</a>, the largest telecommunications company in Vietnam. This lets them offer discounted SMS to businesses so customers can see special offers even if they haven&#8217;t installed SoBanHang&#8217;s app and don&#8217;t get its push notifications. For example, if a grocery store wants to sell out their inventory of fresh fish, they can send out a text blast to shoppers.</p>
<p>After lockdown restrictions are lifted, Hai said SoBanHang can help small retailers continue competing against larger players like supermarket and convenience store chains. Their advantage is that “they have a very good relationship with their customers, they know them well and they sit and wait for their customers to come. We want to turn that relationship into a new sales strategy for them.”</p>
<p>In the future, SoBanHang plans to continue working on its original plans for bookkeeping app. Like other bookkeeping apps, it plans to add financial services, like working capital loans that can be disbursed even without a digital wallet or bank account. But in the near-future, the startup will continue helping small retailer sell online for the first time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">American automaker General Motors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/general-motors-issues-third-recall-for-chevrolet-bolt-evs-citing-rare-battery-defects/">expanded its recall of Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles</a> on Friday due to fire risks from battery manufacturing defects. The automaker said it would seek reimbursement from LG Chem, its battery cell manufacturing partner, for what it expects to be $1 billion worth of losses.</p>
<p>Following the news of the recall, the third one GM has issued for this vehicle, LG Chem shares fell by 11% on Monday, and its stock price lost $6 billion in market value. GM&#8217;s shares were down 1.27% at market close.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time LG Chem&#8217;s batteries have resulted in a recall from automakers. Earlier this year, Hyundai recalled 82,000 EVs due to a similar battery fire risk at an estimated cost of about $851.9 million. Hyundai&#8217;s joint battery venture was with LG Energy Solution, the specific battery unit of LG Chem, which is preparing for its initial public offering in September, but experts say the IPO could be delayed due to the recall cost.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s investigation into the problems with its batteries found battery cell defects like a torn anode tab and folded separator. The recall comes a week after a fire involving a Volkswagen AG ID.3 EV with an LG Energy Solution battery. Earlier this year Volkswagen, as well as Tesla, began making moves to shift from LG Chem&#8217;s brand of pouch-type lithium-ion battery cells and towards more prismatic-type cells, like those made by CATL and Samsung SDI.</p>
<p>The recall leaves GM without any fully electric vehicles for sale in North America, which means it can&#8217;t compete with Tesla and other automakers as EV sales are on the rise. The loss in sales, the safety risks and the possibility of better tech on the horizon might cause GM to take its business elsewhere.</p>
<p>For now, there&#8217;s still work to be done together. GM said it will replace defective battery modules with new modules in the Chevy Bolt EVs and EUVs, which it says accounts for the $1 billion in losses. This is on top of the $800 million GM already is spending for the original Bolt recall last November. Battery packs are the most expensive components of the electric vehicle, on average costing about $186 per kWh, according to data from energy storage research firm Cairn ERA. GM pays about $169 per kWh, and the Bolt has a 66 kWh battery pack.</p>
<p>LG Chem and GM did not respond to requests for comment, so it&#8217;s not clear whether the two plan to move forward on plans announced in April to build a second U.S. battery cell factory in Tennessee. The joint venture, dubbed Ultium Cells, would aim to produce more than 70 GWh of energy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
