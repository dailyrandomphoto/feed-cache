<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multinationals like Amazon and Alibaba have leveraged logistics infrastructure such as UPS and FedEx to create large businesses. It’s not the same in Africa, where few third-party infrastructure players exist to provide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> end-to-end logistics to e-commerce companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://paps.sn/">PAPS</a>, a Senegal-based logistics and delivery company, is filling this gap in its region by offering customers various logistics services. Today the company is announcing that it has raised a $4.5 million pre-Series A round to expand its tech-enabled logistics solution across the Francophone region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was co-led by pan-African venture capital firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/4dx-ventures-closes-second-fund-with-60m-adds-dikembe-mutombo-as-senior-advisor/">4DX Ventures</a> and regional telecom operator Orange</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Participating investors include existing funds Uma Ventures and Saviu Ventures and new investors Yamaha Motor, LoftyInc Capital, Proparco, Google Ventures, To.org, Kepple Ventures and Enza Capital.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259133" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sn.linkedin.com/in/bamba-l%C3%B4-%E8%92%82%E5%B8%83%E5%85%B0-54972031">Bamba Lo</a> founded PAPS in 2016 to provide end-to-end logistics solutions for businesses with offline and online operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, PAPS operated a consumer-to-consumer logistics model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it immediately pivoted after noticing how infrequent and disorganized most requests were. It was hard to precisely predict</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the delivery flows in the space, which is different from the B2B model, where deliveries are planned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform caters to small to large businesses, assisting them with their logistics needs, from storage and international transport to last-mile delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PAPS also provides merchants with visibility features to track and know the status of deliveries from takeoff to the point of destination. Merchants can also schedule deliveries on the platform.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we launched PAPS, the first thing we wanted to give to our clients was visibility on their transactions, they had to know when the driver has picked their goods up, where the goods are during transit, and when it arrives,” Lo, the chief executive, told TechCrunch on a call. “So that’s what we are trying to do to build &#8212; an infrastructure that can serve all B2B clients from warehousing and dispatching to the last-mile delivery.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senegalese company owns the warehouses used to store clients’ goods and parcels. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also owns motorcycles, vans, cars and trucks to carry out inter- and intra-city logistics and deliveries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Additionally, the logistics company has a relay network of hubs close to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its clients that act as delivery points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chief executive said that PAPS wants to create that infrastructure and an enabler for those businesses to access clients they cannot reach today because of logistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The gap that we are filling is one that all these big corporations didn’t want it to address, which is the domestic market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one addressed the domestic market except PAPS and that’s why we want to give quality and reliability,” he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PAPS clients span a range of industries, such as banking, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals (Lo said that the company currently handles distribution for 70% of all pharmacies in Senegal).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major logistics players such as DHL and FedEx and consumer and business-focused e-commerce brands like Jumia, Glovo and Sokowatch also use PAPS for their operations in Senegal and Ivory Coast, the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, PAPS claims to be the largest last-mile fleet in Senegal, making over 10 million deliveries across its two markets since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And according to Lo, the company’s delivery numbers are growing 150% year-on-year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will use this pre-Series A round to strengthen its tech team, build out physical infrastructure to onboard more warehouses, hubs and fleets and extend its offering to more African companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walter Baddoo, co-founder and general partner at 4DX Ventures, said in a statement, “We have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been impressed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Paps team’s execution thus far and their dedication to creating a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> innovative business in the logistics space. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology has a critical role to play in modernizing Africa’s logistics infrastructure and we look forward to further partnering with Bamba and the paps team on this next phase of their growth”.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lattice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lattice</a>, a platform that helps with workforce people management &#8212; tools to run performance reviews, employee feedback, and praise; tools to set and track goals and other long-term career plans; and analytics to get a bigger picture of how a workforce is working &#8212; has really come into its own as a business in the last two years, as our concepts of &#8220;office&#8221; and &#8220;team&#8221; have been stretched by the challenges of a global health pandemic. Now, the startup of the same name has closed a big funding round at a big valuation &#8212; $175 million, a Series F that values Lattice at $3 billion &#8212; underscoring the ground it has gained in the market, and the ambitions it has for the future.</p>
<p>Thrive Capital, Elad Gil, Tiger Global, and Dragoneer led the round, with previous backers Founders Fund, HighSage Ventures, Shasta Ventures, Fuel Capital, Khosla Ventures, and several new angel investors, also participating. The funding, which brings the total raised by Lattice to $330 million, comes just 10 months after the company last raised (a Series E at a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lattice-raises-60m-in-series-e-funding-round-at-1-billion-valuation-301253586.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 billion valuation</a>). Jack Altman, the founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that it was proactively approached this time around on the back of strong growth.</p>
<p>The company today focuses on desk-based, so-called &#8220;information&#8221; or &#8220;knowledge&#8221; workers, with its 3,550 businesses are up by more than 1,000 since that last round. Lattice&#8217;s customer base is heavy on tech companies that are resident in its own backyard and includes the likes of Slack, Turo, Clio and many more. Front-line, deskless employees are not currently part of Lattice&#8217;s remit &#8212; they require a significantly different set of tools and, often, priorities from those sitting at computers all day, but Altman didn&#8217;t rule out that this would be a segment it would like to tackle ahead.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259313" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lattice&#8217;s growth in the market is partly because its tools match today&#8217;s work climate. The world of work has changed significantly in the last two years. Thanks to Covid-19, many people who had traditionally gone into offices are now working at home or other smaller, more localized environments. What hasn&#8217;t changed, though, is that this workforce still needs to operate as a cohesive team, where people can communicate about what they are achieving, and what they want to do, and managers can get a picture of what they&#8217;re doing to reward them or identify ways to work better.</p>
<p>Lattice had been growing at a steady pace for several years before Covid-19 descended on the world, but it was the pandemic that really put a spotlight on how important people management could be when it is effective (and being effective means having tools that people are actually willing to use, since there are so many out there now that feel more like chores than helpful aides).</p>
<p>&#8220;We’d built many products and got a lot of traction [before the pandemic] but the world we’re living in today has accelerated things for a lot of reasons,&#8221; Altman said in an interview. &#8220;The office environment allows for a lot of interpersonal exchanges, connection, and apprenticeship. It’s not that you don’t need software for people management in the office environment but when you don’t have those connections you still need to feel like you work for a bigger purpose. We are staring at a box all day now, and we don’t have a manger who comes by and says great job and makes us feel appreciated. Systems like Lattice give a process for how we connect and interact and make sure that I know that I am cared for by our manager as a professional and a person. Covid-10 created that tailwind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another surprise has been the economy: many presumed in the spring of 2020 that everything would tank, and some things indeed struggled, but the whole economy did not collapse, unemployment stabilized, and some employees even started to realize that they had some bargaining power due to hiring demands. This too led to a bigger drive for better people management tools.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Altman characterized the thinking as: &#8220;&#8216;Geez, we&#8217;ve got to invest in people more if we want to keep them.&#8217; That became the economic backdrop.&#8221;</p>
<p>People management as a wider part of enterprise IT has seen a lot of evolution in the last several years: companies like Workday, which dominate HR software, have created wide toolsets within their bigger platforms to manage areas like performance and compensation; and there are a number of pure-play companies like 15Five that also focus specifically on areas like goals and praise. Lattice both partners with larger platforms and also competes against them. I suspect that the latter will become a more dominant part of those relationships as Lattice continues to add more functionality to its own platform. (In the last several years it has added performance management, and then engagement surveys, and now a host of career development tools.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The longer term plan is to keep building and expanding,&#8221; Altman said.</p>
<p>The widening of the platform and the functionality within it, serving a fast-growing base of customers, holds a lot of promise for investors.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve seen a few broad trends come together in recent years — the rise of remote work, the evolution of the role of HR — that have fuelled the HR market,” said investor Elad Gil, in a statement. “Lattice&#8217;s approach of creating a broad suite of interconnected offerings has resonated and led to really exciting growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! --></p>
<p>In a move rarely made by Western venture capitalists, QED Investors announced today that it has hired an African partner, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/gbengaajayi">Gbenga Ajayi</a>. He will focus on Africa investments as part of QED’s international team.</p>
<p>Last September, the fintech-focused venture capital firm announced closing $1.05 billion for its oversubscribed seventh fund.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258747" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/qed-investors-closes-on-1-05b-to-invest-in-fintech-companies-globally/">reported</a> that Fund VII, made up of a $550 million early-stage fund and a $500 million growth-stage fund, will be used to back “fintech companies primarily in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Latin America and Southeast Asia.” Today’s announcement adds Africa to the mix.</p>
<p>On a call with TechCrunch, QED co-founder and managing partner <a href="https://www.qedinvestors.com/team/nigel-morris">Nigel Morris</a> said that adding Africa is the final jigsaw puzzle that makes QED Investors a fully global fintech-specialist firm.</p>
<p>Preparations for QED to get into Africa started some 18 months ago when the firm began seeing a lot of inbounds and pitches from the region. This period &#8212; particularly throughout 2021, during which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/african-tech-took-center-stage-in-2021/">five unicorns were minted &#8212;</a> saw an explosion in venture capital like never before as seasoned founders emerged with willing local and international VCs to back them.</p>
<p>With so much demand for capital on a continent with more than a billion people but low financial inclusivity, adding Africa as QED’s next frontier was a no-brainer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We do fintech. It’s all we do; it’s what we know. And we are subject-matter deep, and hopefully, potentially experts, in the space,” Morris said. “Gbenga and I talked at length on how the traditional banks try to engage through an analog distribution system of branches when its population is a mobile-native generation that desires to be able to engage via mobile.</p>
<p>“So, as we saw investable opportunities starting to come to us and as we started to be avalanched by inbound from Africa, it became really clear that there was enormous amounts of demand in those markets like what we had seen across other geographies, particularly in other developing countries.”</p>
<p>The fintech-focused firm isn’t the only investor to notice these opportunities. Other global investors have as well, but most of their multiple investments have been led by partners without local market know-how.</p>
<p>But QED decided not to take this approach. By hiring an African partner to lead its charge, the firm may be setting an example of how foreign VCs will operate on the continent in the future.</p>
<p>Before QED Investors, Ajayi worked in different roles across Africa and global fintech/tech. He worked at Google as product partnerships lead in Europe and Africa before transitioning to other positions within the company, including managing telecom industry partnerships and leading parts of the internet giant’s mobile app business in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The partner was also a product director for SMB growth at Wise, a global cross-border remittance fintech. He also worked as head of strategic partnerships at Europe’s biggest neobank, Revolut.</p>
<p>Away from operational roles, Ajayi is also the co-founder of Kanza Ventures, a boutique seed investment and advisory firm focused on fintech in Africa.</p>
<p>As an investor and operator with experience working in different regions across Africa, Ajayi brings much-needed experience, especially in a region where fintechs seemingly face more troubling regulatory and compliance hurdles than their counterparts globally.</p>
<p>“Being able to be part of the fintech and tech boom that we have today and helping large tech companies that have now become household names take off means that I’ve had the opportunity and the privilege to sit at the very forefront,” Ajayi said.</p>
<p>“And so combining that and my fintech experience, and the fact that I’ve worked with a bunch of companies, I think it’s like a collective coming together to join QED.”</p>
<p>Ajayi is the first of two African investor professionals hired this past month by QED. The firm also brought on <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/chidinma-iwueke-b1b8491a">Chidinma “Chid” Iwueke</a> as a principal.</p>
<p>Iwueke, who was previously an equity research associate at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and a partner at Nigeria-based early-stage venture capital firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/early-stage-african-vc-firm-microtraction-reports-portfolio-boom-despite-the-weight-of-covid-19/">Microtraction</a>, will focus on domestic and international investments for the firm.</p>
<p>“We started off to find one wonderful person, and we found two. And I think that speaks louder than bombs about how much talent there is in Africa,” Morris said.</p>
<p>As a global firm, QED has hubs in Washington, D.C., New York and London. On the call, Morris said Ajayi would be based out of London and Iwueke in New York.</p>
<p>Both hires are based off the continent to connect founders and startups to valuable resources such as making hires and getting customers outside of Africa. Yet, they will spend lots of time on the ground, as a large part of their job will be forming partnerships and sourcing deals with local VCs, accelerators and founders across Africa, said Ajayi.</p>

<p>QED expects its upcoming portfolio companies to take advantage of its specialization in fintech, operational expertise and willingness to roll up its sleeves to build and scale financial products Africa’s mass-market needs.</p>
<p>But despite the seeming commitment, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">QED doesn’t have a dedicated amount of capital or range of ticket sizes to deploy in the continent’s startups. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/qed-investors-closes-on-1-05b-to-invest-in-fintech-companies-globally/">In an interview last September</a>, the firm mentioned that it plans to invest between $5 million and $15 million in 40 to 50 companies via its early-stage fund and $10 million to $40 million in 20 to 25 startups in its growth fund).</span></p>
<p>Thus, no one knows what to expect of QED’s deal-making process yet. Morris opines that people shouldn’t read that to mean a lack of activity and non-commitment. “We will build something special here. But we’ll do it in a very balanced and thoughtful businesslike way,” he said.</p>
<p>One thing is sure, though: Just as it is with its global strategy, QED, which has invested in 23 unicorns with over $4.6 billion AUM, will back African companies across the entire spectrum of investing, from pre-seed stage to IPO.</p>
<p>The company has made 170 investments globally. It’s yet to make its first in Africa, but hiring two investment professionals on the continent &#8212; a partner and principal &#8212; is a welcome start for the continent’s tech ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenyan B2C e-commerce company <a href="https://copiaglobal.com/">Copia Global</a> has raised $50 million in a Series C equity round led by Goodwell Investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new financing round welcomed new investors such as Zebu Investment Partners, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), and Koa Labs, as well as past investors Lightrock, German development finance institution DEG, and Perivoli Innovations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round comes three years after Copia’s Series B round of $26 million. According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/copia-global">Crunchbase</a>, the company has raised $53 million. But including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">its Series C</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Copia’s total funding since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2013 now stands at $103 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258885" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copia Global </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Kenya by Tracey Turner and Jonathan Lewis as a B2C e-commerce platform to serve Africa’s middle- and low-income African consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said in a statement that it harnesses mobile technologies, a network of local agents, and proprietary Copia Logistics to reach a market that traditional retail and Western e-commerce models cannot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer spending in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is projected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach over $2 trillion in the next three years, according to the IMF</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The continent’s middle class is the primary driver of this growth. However, their shopping needs are not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">adequately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> served because of the high logistics costs that make Western-style e-commerce companies such as Jumia operate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unprofitably. The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> African e-commerce giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/jumia-narrows-losses-as-its-payment-service-grows-financial-results/">has not turned a profit</a> since going public as its losses continue to increase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copia, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, runs a profitable business because of how it approaches the market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The e-commerce company focuses on customers in rural areas that struggle to access the same goods and services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> choice, price value and reliability that similar consumers in urban areas or of higher income levels can access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though this target market can be hard to locate and individuals may have smaller wallet sizes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, their number &#8212; which Copia says is about 750 million people across Africa &#8212; and collective purchasing power present an opportunity, especially when a company thinks hyperlocal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The whole premise of Copia was to find a solution that was sustainable and profitable to serve consumers that we could improve their quality of life and that of their families,” said CEO Tim Steel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is building a sustainable business that involves a three-way relationship with customers and 30,000 agents in different communities across Kenya and Uganda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a well-known fact that low-income customers in Africa often distrust e-commerce platforms. Most of them would prefer to go to a physical store and get what they want, even if it means traveling long distances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a strategy, Copia recruits small business owners, who have already established some level of familiarity and trust with customers, and trains them to become agents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They wear branded Copia uniforms and advertise the platform to individual customers within their communities, eventually getting them to make their first transaction on the e-commerce store. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, these agents play a second role as aggregated delivery points</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copia’s value proposition is solid with goods not generally available in proximity to the average consumer, said the CEO. Goods such as building materials or medicine where c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ustomers would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> travel to the nearest city or send a relative to get. On average, rural Kenyans spend over an hour and $4 per commute to buy such goods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Copia, for instance, 20 customers within a particular location can make various orders, and the company will deliver them to its agents, whose shops and stores are close</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to customers in that location. This way, customers can pick up their orders whenever they want. Copia says it also facilitates deliveries to customers’ homes upon request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This helps to create the viability of the model from a cost and unit economics perspective. But it also means that we don’t suffer the same issues many e-commerce companies face</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where deliveries fail because the receiver is not available at the location. Our agents are always there because they’re running their businesses,” Steel said about how logistics costs don’t affect Copia the same way it does others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urban and diaspora-based consumers can also use the service to shop for loved ones in rural areas. So instead of buying the goods themselves and driving to their home location or sending the goods or money home on a bus, these middle- to high-income consumers can purchase the products through Copia’s website or app and send them to their families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agent network model allows customers to choose how they interact with Copia – online or offline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The e-commerce company pays agents a commission on every sold product, increasing their income by more than 30%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And of the 30,000 agents of the company, 77% are women, the company said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes Copia between 24 and 48 hours to get products to its customers. According to Steel, Copia doesn’t charge customers a delivery fee, which is a big differentiator from other e-commerce models. Copia offsets these delivery costs by streamlining traditional supply chain processes as it gets many goods </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from suppliers and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copia has roughly 1.4 million unique customers and a CAGR of about 200%, Steel said. In a statement, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copia said it delivers products to thousands of customers daily and has fulfilled more than 10 million orders to date</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kenyan company intends to use the Series C funding to grow its model across East Africa, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Kenya, Steele believes Copia can access 80% of its serviceable market over the next couple of years, up from 50% currently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copia is eyeing other African markets and, depending on what socioeconomic and political macroeconomic conditions dictate, might expand into Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, South Africa, Zambia, Mozambique and Malawi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Copia’s e-commerce model is built for the unique requirements of the African market and will save many Africans a lot of time and money. We see it as one of the next big leapfrogging technologies; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like mobile phones leapfrogged landlines and solar power leapfrogged the grid, Copia is leapfrogging retail</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,”</span> Els Boerhof, the managing partner at Goodwell Investments, said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bikayi is in talks to raise about $50 million in a new financing round, four people familiar with the matter told me, as the Indian startup looks to scale its platform that helps small businesses set up and run their e-commerce stores.</p>
<p>Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India are holding conversations with the Indian startup to lead its Series B round, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the deliberations are ongoing and private. Sequoia Capital India, which led Bikayi&#8217;s $10.8 million Series A funding in September last year, is positioning to lead the round, two sources said.</p>
<p>Spokespeople for Bikayi, Sequoia Capital India, and Tiger Global declined to comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259272" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://bikayi.com">Bikayi</a> allows businesses to collate and fulfil orders from various online and offline sources and accept payment digitally. Its platform also helps businesses set up their e-commerce stores on WhatsApp and also launch their own apps that they can distribute to customers.</p>
<p>The startup additionally maintains partnerships with delivery firms to help businesses ship products to customers. As one of its investors describes it, Bikayi is “building a powerful tool that integrates the entire infrastructure of commerce onto one single platform.”</p>
<p>Several of Bikayi’s offerings are available to businesses at no charge. But it takes a small fee if they wish to broaden their online product catalogs, it says on its website.</p>
<p>“The entire platform has been designed to enable easy integration with other applications to make it a single dashboard for everything the merchants need. It’s even more exciting to see the impact their product is having on small businesses – and the country’s employment rate,” wrote Shraeyansh Thakur, a principal at Sequoia Capital India, in <a href="https://india.sequoiacap.com/build/bikayi-enabling-indias-fast-growing-e-commerce-ecosystem/">a blog post</a> last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Scores of firms, including Reliance Retail (the nation’s largest retail chain), e-commerce giant Amazon as well as startups such as Nexus Venture Partners-backed Jumbotail, Tribe Capital-backed Khatabook and Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Dukaan, are helping merchants &#8212; sometimes in similar, but also in their own unique ways &#8212;  digitize their businesses and reach more customers.</p>
<p>DotPe, another startup operating in the space, has amassed over 9 million customers and is clocking $4 million in ARR, according to an investor deck dated last month and reviewed by TechCrunch. The startup, which counts Google and Info Edge among its backers, has facilitated over 26 million transactions, it revealed in the investor deck.</p>
<p>ElasticRun, which is helping hundreds of thousands of neighborhood stores across hundreds of Indian cities and towns secure inventory and working capital, is in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/softbank-in-talks-to-back-india-elastic-run/">talks with SoftBank</a> to raise about $200 million at a $1 billion valuation, TechCrunch reported earlier this month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kenyan fintech <a href="https://www.zanifu.com/">Zanifu</a> is set to upgrade its platform and grow the number of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) it extends stock-financing to after securing $1 million in Seed funding.</p>
<p>Saviu Ventures, which invested in the startup’s pre-seed round early 2020, Launch Africa Ventures, Sayani Investments and a number of angel investors from Kenya and Nigeria participated in the round. This latest round brings the total funding so far received by the startup to $1.2 million.</p>
<p>Zanifu provides short-term stock-financing of up to $2,000 to MSMEs in Kenya and is eyeing an additional 15,000 FMCG retailers in the next one year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259265" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We serve FMCG retailers, especially the ones that are too small to access traditional bank finance for their businesses. The only option these MSMEs have has been digital consumer loans, which are not always suitable for them. We are filling a critical gap in providing stock financing, which enables small businesses to grow their turnovers by more than 40%,&#8221; said Zanifu co-founder and chief operating officer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevebikoke/?originalSubdomain=ke">Steve Biko</a>.</p>
<p>“The FMCG segment has the highest working capital needs within MSMEs, and the velocity of the goods they sell allows us to safely underwrite unsecured business credit to them.”</p>

<p>Biko and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-kilimo-1570a240/?originalSubdomain=ke">Sebastian Mithika</a> launched the financing business a year after founding the startup in 2017. The startup said it has to date extended 85,000 working capital loans worth over $13 million to 7,000 businesses in Kenya.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mithika said that Zanifu is playing its role in bridging the $20 billion (as estimated by the World Bank) MSME financing gap in the country experienced by 5 million small businesses, most of which are informal.</p>
<p>The informal businesses in Kenya are an integral part of the economy contributing 33.8% of the country’s GDP and <a href="https://www.knbs.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Economic-Survey-2021.pdf">providing 83.4% of employment</a> outside of small-scale agriculture. However, <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/262361468914023771/pdf/106986-WP-P151793-PUBLIC-Box.pdf">access to financing</a> remains the main impediment to growth for these micro and small businesses. And thus, over the last few years fintech companies like Zanifu have introduced products that are tailored to the financing needs of the MSMEs.</p>
<p>Zanifu works with a number of manufacturers and distributors to extend the credit to these small businesses with retailers already sourcing products from the startup’s partners qualifying for the financing. Zanifu has created platforms for manufactures, distributors and retailers that ensure seamless ordering, payment, tracking and fulfillment.</p>
<p>Retailers borrow through Zanifu’s loan app, where they upload information that includes historical purchase data. The retailers are then assigned a credit limit, after its algorithm scores them, within six hours after signing up. Retailers have up to a month to pay back the loans, which attract an interest rate of 3.5 to 5%.</p>
<p>Zanifu, which has a presence throughout Kenya, is now eyeing Ghana and Uganda. A regional presence will step-up competition for the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/mfs-africa-leads-2-3m-seed-round-in-ugandan-fintech-startup-numida/">Uganda’s Numida</a> and Nigeria’s Payhippo, some of the fintechs providing unsecured financing to small businesses.</p>
<p>Numida, founded in 2017, extends unsecured credit of up to $3,500 in less than two hours while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/nigerias-lender-payhippo-raises-3-million-in-seed-funding-to-extend-quick-loans-to-smes/">Payhippo, in a past interview, said</a> it disburses average loans of $1,300, with the minimum being about $200. As alternative finance providers, these digital lenders are closing the financing gap for small businesses, but at a higher interest rate when compared to formal banking institutions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Prior to starting Pixis, the co-founders spoke to potential marketing customers about how to scale SaaS companies quickly in a “cookie less” world.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pyxis One, now <a href="https://pixis.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pixis</a>, closed on $100 million in Series C funding to continue developing what it touts as “the world’s only contextual codeless AI infrastructure for complete marketing optimization.”</p>
<p>SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led the round and was joined by new investor General Atlantic, and existing investors Celesta Capital, Premji Invest and Chiratae Ventures. The fresh capital comes just four months after Pixis announced its $17 million Series B to bring its total funding to date to $124 million.</p>
<p>The California-based company was founded three years ago by Shubham A. Mishra, Vrushali Prasade and Hari Valiyath. This is the second company the team has started together; its first was artificial intelligence in the gaming space, Mishra told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259132" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the company progressed, the team realized that most people were spelling “Pyxis” with an “i” instead of a “y,” so to make it super clean and symmetrical, the company changed its name, he said.</p>
<p>Prior to starting Pixis, the co-founders spoke to chief marketing officers and chief revenue officers about how to scale SaaS companies quickly in a “cookie-less” world that would require companies to deploy their own systems to respect privacy for customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Not many are ready to do that,” Mishra said. “We are solving that by building a no-code AI solution that can be deployed in less than eight seconds.”</p>
<p>In fact, the company has 50 AI models now for self-evolving neural networks to add AI optimization to marketing campaigns and plans to scale to 200 in the next six months. Pixis believes in the vision that people will partially be data scientists driven by no-code solutions, Mishra said.</p>
<p>And it’s not just a ploy saying it’s “no code,” it’s actually no code, he noted. The infrastructure was built like a spectrum of offerings so that you could go full-out and tweak the AI marketing models, gather a team of data scientists and develop something, or just take 30 minutes of training and press a button to deploy the products and plug-ins.</p>
<p>The Series C follows 600% revenue growth since 2018. Pixis will close out January with more than 100 customers, all in the mid to large enterprise range, Mishra said. Customers using the Pixis AI infrastructure saw a 20% decrease in acquisition costs in addition to hours of manual work saved every month, he added.</p>
<p>The funding will help to scale the AI platforms and plug-ins as it expands across North America, Europe and APAC.</p>
<p>“This year is a new horizon for us,” Mishra said. “Last year, we were launching our solution to the BTC and DTC marketing, and by the end of the first quarter of this year, we will have a solution for B2B and software companies.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Priya Saiprasad, partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said via email that Pixis is unique in that it is a true end-to-end infrastructure for demand generation that “equips marketing functions with cutting-edge data science capabilities to drive better decision-making in a cookie-free world.”</p>
<p>She believes that is a “game-changer” because marketing is a big budget item for companies, but much of the spend is wasted when companies lack the tools for messaging and visuals and therefore don’t target the right customers via the right channel at the right time.</p>
<p>“A validation of Pixis’s product-market fit is the impressive growth rate the company has achieved in just three years since launching, buttressed by a loyal and engaged customer base of large global enterprises,” Saiprasad added. “We believe there is significant runway for Pixis to continue this momentum because of the size of the market — companies spent an estimated $455 billion on digital marketing in 2021 — and Pixis’s sector-agnostic platform enabling it to scale across different verticals.”</p>
<p>Shantanu Rastogi, managing director of General Atlantic, also noted that with the marketing ecosystem shifting, as a result of new limitations on data sharing, Pixis is addressing this and creating new return on investment for customers by leveraging predictive AI models to deliver marketing efficiency.</p>
<p>“Pixis is bringing automation and orchestration to an industry that, until now, has accepted platforms that we believe lean on outdated technology as ‘good enough,’” Rastogi added. “We are thrilled to support the talented team in its efforts to grow and scale globally with this investment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buy now pay later (BNPL) startups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bnpl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proliferating around the world</a> and the Philippines is no exception. Today, one of the country’s biggest BNPL providers, <a href="https://billease.ph/">BillEase</a>, announced it has raised an $11 million Series B. The round was led by BurdaPrincipal Investments, growth capital arm of Hubert Burda Media. Other participants included Centauri, a joint investment vehicle between MDI Ventures and KB Investment, and Tamaz Georgadze, CEO and co-founder of Raisin DS.</p>
<p>Operated by fintech First Digital Finance Corporation BillEase launched in 2017, with shopping marketplace Lazada as its first merchant partner. It can now be used at more than 500 merchants, including consumer electronics seller Kimstore and Philippine Airlines. Its BNPL is also available through payment gateways Xendit, Paynamics, 2C2P, Dragonpay and BUX, and it offers an app with personal loans, top-ups for digital wallets like GCash, PayMaya, Coins.ph, GrabPay and Shopee Pay and mobile phone and gaming credits.</p>
<p>Since the Philippines’ payment sector is fragmented, customers can pay back their BNPL loans through a variety of ways, including digital wallets, bank transfers, direct debit, linking their bank account or over-the-counter payments in physical stores like 7-11.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259251" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new funding brings BillEase’s total raised to about $15 million in equity, and will be used for customer acquisition, developing new products and hiring.</p>

<p>One of the main ways BillEase differentiates from other BNPL services in the Philippines is that it allows customers to build formal credit records.</p>
<p>Georg Steiger, First Digital Financial Corporation’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch in an email that BillEase’s target segment is the Philippines’ emerging middle class, specifically Gen Z and millennials who are early in their careers. “About 80% of our customers are new to the formal credit system and do not have a credit record.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For those customers, BillEase also serves as an on-ramp to the financial system—we are the only credit app in the Philippines that is a member of TransUnion.” It is also part of the state-owned Credit Information Corporation.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mexican BNPL player Kueski secures $202M in debt &#038; equity as it nears $100M+ in ARR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/mexican-bnpl-player-kueski-secures-202m-as-it-nears-100m-in-arr/embed/#?secret=3hKKOdwpJa" data-secret="3hKKOdwpJa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Another differentiator is that BillEase built and owns its credit, fraud and payment software stack, and can approve more than 90% of BNPL loans instantly with it model. This means shorter checkout times and also enables BillEase to offer lower interest rates, at about 3.49% compared to 7% to 12% for other BNPL loans, Steiger said. It gives merchants customizable installment plans. For example, they can offer BNPL repayment terms of 10 to 30 days for smaller purchases, payment in four installments or monthly payments for larger purchases, and decide if those loans will be interest-free or not.</p>
<p>Since most of BillEase’s customers don’t have a credit record, it uses “a wide variety of alternative data sources to triangulate and get a good picture of our customers,” including telecom usage, phone metadata, network data and behavioral data points,” Steiger said.</p>
<p>“Credit scoring is also something we constantly tinker with,” he added. “As new data comes in or new variables become available, we upgrade our models. At any given time we usually run a few A/B tests to test new models or process improvements.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5avjJdZ-MYY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Politics and tech are certainly strange bedfellows. The Gang loves to talk about filibusters and the fall of democracy, but forget it when I try to bring up my fascination with live audio. That is understandable; we never talk about the little stuff until there’s a battling billionaire angle. So it was that Jack Dorsey’s joust with Marc Andreessen over what the meaning of web3 is is brought all the web2 superstars into the thread. Tim O’Reilly, John Battelle, Chris Dixon, Catch 22’s Milo Mindbender (ok, Moxie Marlinspike?) and even web1’s Leo Laporte weighed in.</p>
<p>Since Covid blocked physical events, we’ve reluctantly moved to another buzzword sweepstakes dubbed the Metaverse. I agree with Keith Teare that this dog won’t hunt due to the stylistic reluctance to wear large hardware objects on our forehead, but there’s a lot more to virtual events than meets the eye. Before the pandemic, more and more meetings were moving online as we tried to juggle back-to-back appointments at the office. It was easier to switch from room to room regardless of physical location, travel time or lack of it, and the innate competition with messaging systems like Slack and civilian texts over iMessage, FB Messenger, and whatever Google Chat was renamed this week. With competitive information constantly flowing in in real time, product strategy has morphed into analytic harvesting of that interactive metadata that drives feedback on the network into design, time to market, and distribution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259245" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Replacing large conferences with virtual working groups mostly goes on behind the corporate firewall, but message testing goes on in the clear. The context is the appsphere, and Clubhouse is a living tutorial in gaining scale through the same kind of access model the old conferences deployed. A gated ropeline establishes a kind of green room access where you can renew connections and establish trust with keynoters and technologists. The possibility of being asked up on stage is where the media is conscripted. Newsletter players like Josh Constine and Casey Newton advance from the tech pub ranks to serve as midwives for the startup churn and casting couch for the venture class. The elixir of media savvy and hallway access is what the conference makers charge for.</p>
<p>A few nights ago I sat transfixed as Adam McKay, the director, and two producers told the story of Don’t Look Up as the movie spooled out on Netflix. The Clubhouse room reverberated for over 2 hours as the filmmakers did a deep dive on the production of the funny, dark, and beautiful story of a meteor heading toward a fatal rendeyvous with Earth. Some of the great books of my fascination with the art and technology of making films flashed through my mind: Truffaut’s conversations with Hitchcock, Pauline Kael’s treatise on Citizen Kane, the moment in Annie Hall when Woody Allen drags Marshall McLuhan out from behind a sign to confront a know it all professor — “You know nothing of my work. How you came to be a professor of anything&#8230;.” Every frame of Kubrick’s lexicon. The great comic minds gathered around the Algonquin rountable.</p>
<p>And to hear in shared real time McKay tell his tale of what the making of the film meant to him and his team, to share the goals and strategies for producing a film which certainly resonates with the pandemic, filmed in the beginnings of the catastrophe when there were NO vaccines yet invented. The nuances of his approach to combining the script he wrote with the magical improvisations of his actors. It went on and on, and you could hear McKay’s delight at being a part of this coming together of technology and the spirit of inspiration. And you can find the link to the replay of the event for your own examination nestled at the top of the Replay list. Virtual yes but tangible in its emotion and flawless execution. I actually liked the Clubhouse a little more than the movie, yet the aftereffect was to like the movie even more for the experience. Maybe this Metaverse is a thing after all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NFT marketplace OpenSea is putting some of its freshly raised funds to good use, buying up crypto wallet startup Dharma Labs, the company <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-dharma-labs-welcomes-new-cto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today. The announcement follows a report earlier this month in <a href="https://www.axios.com/opensea-nft-dharma-acquire-f6df00d5-1cc0-463a-95fd-2f5039947ed8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a> that detailed OpenSea was in talks to buy the startup for between $110 million and $130 million.</p>
<p>Dharma&#8217;s Ethereum wallet allowed users to connect their bank accounts, and buy and swap tokens while engaging with other elements of the DeFi ecosystem. OpenSea will be shutting down Dharma&#8217;s app as part of the deal, a move that is sure to be controversial with the crypto wallet&#8217;s users who will have just one month to offload assets from the wallet to a different account.</p>
<p>As part of the deal Dharma Labs co-founder Nadav Hollander will become OpenSea&#8217;s new chief technology officer. The startup&#8217;s previous CTO Alex Atallah will be stepping into a new role &#8220;where he’ll oversee [OpenSea&#8217;s] web3 and NFT ecosystem development efforts,&#8221; the company says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259129" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our teams share a vision that NFTs will be the cultural focal point of crypto’s adoption for years to come — and that vision can only be realized if using NFTs becomes easy &amp; delightful for the average person,&#8221; OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer wrote in a blog post.</p>
<p>As the OpenSea platform has grown from mom and pop NFT shop to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/nft-kingpin-opensea-lands-13-3b-valuation-in-300m-raise-from-paradigm-and-coatue/">$13.3 billion crypto decacorn</a>, some in its user base have grown more vocal in expressing views that the platform is too centralized for the &#8220;web3&#8221; world and that early users haven&#8217;t benefitted from the startup&#8217;s swelling valuation as much as its venture capitalist backers. Despite attention being paid to competitors like Rarible, Zora and recent upstart LooksRare, OpenSea is still far-and-away the clear powerhouse in the NFT world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a month-long “</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-steps-back-as-employees-detail-how-he-led-by-fear/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">break</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Better.com CEO Vishal Garg is back at the helm of the mortgage tech company he co-founded in 2016, according to an internal memo that circulated today that has been shared with TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the memo, the Better board of directors said it was “moving forward with strong, dynamic CEO leadership.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move comes just weeks after the company announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/">laying off 900 people</a>, or about 9% of its staff, via a Zoom meeting with the affected employees that drew widespread criticism from employees and even casual observers. In the 10 days after that meeting took place, the company’s reputation took a very public beating, with senior communications and public relations executives stepping down, memes of Garg circulating on TikTok and the CEO issuing </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-apologizes-to-current-employees-for-blundering-the-execution-of-mass-layoffs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a so-called apology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for his behavior.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259208" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company hired a crisis firm in the aftermath of the botched layoffs and, according to the internal memo from the board, Better will be “implementing a company-wide training program on ensuring a respectful workplace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board also said that during this time off, Garg had been working closely with an executive coach so he could “reconnect with the values that make Better great.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following those discussions, direct input from an independent culture review and some organizational changes, the board said Garg would be officially resuming his full-time duties as CEO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the memo, the board said it was “confident in Vishal and in the changes he is committed to making to provide the type of leadership, focus and vision that Better needs at this pivotal time.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, it was a surprise to many that Garg was not asked to permanently resign. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some surmised that he had super-voting shares and thus could vote to keep himself in the role of CEO despite what others voted. But after digging into the </span><a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-326251/#rom154116_38" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S-4 filed by Better.com’s SPAC partner, Aurora Acquisition Corp.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November, TechCrunch’s own Alex Wilhelm and I realized </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/how-does-former-better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-still-have-a-job/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that is not the case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ffhnbDK8Q7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/how-does-former-better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-still-have-a-job/">How does former Better.com CEO Vishal Garg still have a job?</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While laying off employees during Zoom calls is hardly unheard of as the COVID-19 pandemic has forced more remote work, Varg was viewed as being callous and unfeeling in his delivery. As we’ve previously reported, it didn’t help that he had also sent emails to his staff in the past berating them with insults. Last year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/11/20/mortgages-fraud-claims-and-dumb-dolphins-a-tangled-past-haunts-bettercom-ceo-vishal-garg/?sh=57eee6f710f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed the contents of an email to employees from Garg: “HELLO — WAKE UP BETTER TEAM. You are TOO DAMN SLOW. You are a bunch of DUMB DOLPHINS and…DUMB DOLPHINS get caught in nets and eaten by sharks. SO STOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.”</span></p>
<p>Garg had also recently reportedly accused “at least 250″ terminated staffers of stealing from the company and customers by working just two hours a day</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better.com employees are reportedly not at all happy that Garg is not being asked to step down from his role as CEO, with one source telling TechCrunch that “everyone is upset, and many people have already quit or are planning to.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new bill seeks to dramatically reshape the online advertising landscape to the detriment of companies like Facebook, Google and data brokers that leverage deep stores of personal information to make money from targeted ads.</p>
<p>The bill, the <a href="https://eshoo.house.gov/media/press-releases/eshoo-schakowsky-booker-introduce-bill-ban-surveillance-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Banning Surveillance Advertising Act</a>, introduced by Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) in the House and Cory Booker (D-NJ) in the Senate, would dramatically limit the ways that tech companies serve ads to their users, banning the use of personal data altogether.</p>
<p>Any targeting based on &#8220;protected class information, such as race, gender, and religion, and personal data purchased from data brokers&#8221; would be off-limits were the bill to pass. Platforms could still target ads based on general location data at the city or state level and &#8220;contextual advertising&#8221; based on the content a user is interacting with would still be allowed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259162" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The bill would empower the FTC and state attorneys general to enforce violations, with fines of up to $5,000 per incident for knowing violations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;surveillance advertising&#8217; business model is premised on the unseemly collection and hoarding of personal data to enable ad targeting,&#8221; Rep. Eshoo said. &#8220;This pernicious practice allows online platforms to chase user engagement at great cost to our society, and it fuels disinformation, discrimination, voter suppression, privacy abuses, and so many other harms.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today I introduced the Banning Surveillance Advertising Act with <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAnnaEshoo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RepAnnaEshoo</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSchakowsky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RepSchakowsky</a>. With this act, advertisers will be forced to stop exploiting individuals’ online behavior for profits and our communities will be safer as a result.</p>
<p>&mdash; Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBooker) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenBooker/status/1483597574430994434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2022</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Sen. Booker called the targeted advertising model &#8220;predatory and invasive,&#8221; stressing how the practice exacerbates misinformation and extremism on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Privacy-minded companies including search engine maker DuckDuckGo and Proton, creator of ProtonMail, backed the legislation along with organizations including the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), the Anti-Defamation League, Accountable Tech and Common Sense Media.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">This was another blockbuster year for global venture funding, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/data-show-2021-was-a-bonkers-record-setting-year-for-venture-capital/">2021 breaking records across the board</a>.</p>
<p>Deal activity is at record highs. Last year, a total of $643 billion was invested globally, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-unicorns-2021-monthly-recap/?utm_source=cb_daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20220105&amp;utm_content=intro&amp;utm_term=content&amp;utm_source=cb_daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20220105#Deal%20volume" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Crunchbase News</a>, compared with $335 billion in 2020 – that’s 92% growth year over year.</p>
<p>Beyond being awash in capital, the VC industry has also seen a historic number of exits. A record number of companies went public in 2021, with many at huge valuations: 238 companies debuted on the public markets last year valued above $1 billion. In 2020, only 61 companies went public at this valuation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			VCs are paying close attention to the opportunities that are materializing not just in Silicon Valley, but all over the world.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Bigger, better capitalized and more global, the venture industry is poised to take advantage of the transformative technologies coming to market. As of Q4 last year, cumulative dry powder stood at a record $222 billion, according to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/2021-us-vc-fundraising-exits-deal-flow-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook.</a></p>
<p>Regardless of the macroeconomic challenges ahead, I anticipate startup funding will continue at an accelerated pace this year.</p>
<p>The tech world continues to evolve to meet shifting consumer needs amid a global pandemic. This has created enormous opportunities for founders everywhere to build world-class companies.</p>
<p>I’m seeing this first-hand with several of our investments, such as <a href="https://www.bukalapak.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bukalapak</a>, an Indonesian e-commerce company that went <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/indonesias-bukalapak-kicks-off-11-bln-ipo-biggest-over-decade-2021-07-09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public in August</a> and operates in a market that benefited in part from consumers staying at home and businesses selling more online during the pandemic.</p>
<p>In terms of where funds will be allocated in the year ahead, there are three transformative global technology trends that many VCs are watching closely, myself included: the rapid rise of web3, capital flows to less obvious founders, and the continued globalization of venture capital.</p>
<h2>Web3 goes mainstream</h2>
<p>In the past few months, investors and companies have been throwing around a lot of buzzwords, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/how-should-we-regulate-defi/">DeFi</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/the-irrational-exuberance-of-web3/">web3 and the metaverse</a>. The increased focus on these areas is pointing to a fundamental shift in the Internet – one that is decentralized and grounded in public blockchains, where users are in the driver’s seat and intermediaries hold less sway.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 18, 2022! Today kicked off the working week with a bang, thanks to Microsoft and another public company. But will all deals announced become deals completed? We’ll see. We also have an acre-feet of startup news items for your enjoyment. Let’s go! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-acquire-activision-blizzard/">Microsoft to buy Activision Blizzard</a>: After months of internal turbulence – what TechCrunch described as “sexual harassment controversies and ongoing executive turmoil” – Activision Blizzard is selling itself to Microsoft for a huge premium on its pre-deal share price. Microsoft has purchased other gaming studios in recent years, making the purchase not entirely impossible to parse. But we have to wonder if the transaction won’t catch the eye of regulators, given a generally more active antitrust vibe around the world today. Let’s see.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/apple-returns-to-no-1-as-global-smartphone-shipments-grapple-with-supply-chain-concerns/">Apple takes smartphone crown back</a>: Smartphone shipments grew by 1% in the final quarter of 2021, with Apple passing Samsung as the leading global manufacturer of the category. The two companies have traded the top spot over time, though — thanks to the chips crisis, global pandemic and larger supply chain snarls — volatility in this sort of metric is hardly a surprise. Still, it’s good news for Apple fans.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/chinas-digital-yuan-wallet-now-has-260-million-individual-users/">China’s digital yuan matures</a>: In the wake of China’s ban on cryptocurrencies and related activity – read: mining – the country’s own digital currency is picking up market share. Dubbed the digital yuan in English, the electronic variant of the Chinese currency has been installed by 261 million folks, or about a fifth of the country’s population.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<p>Before we dive into the startup news list, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna Heim</a> has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/for-investors-future-of-work-isnt-only-about-hr/">fascinating interview on the site</a> digging into what impact a changing workplace will have on the startup market; it’s not <em>only</em> communications software and HR tech that are going to see a changed world. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/for-investors-future-of-work-isnt-only-about-hr/">Give it a read</a>!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259039" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/wayve-raises-200m-series-b-led-by-eclipse-for-its-ai-for-autonomous-delivery-vehicles/">British startup snags $200M for autonomous delivery</a>: Wayve just landed nine figures of capital to keep working on “robo-deliveries and logistics” through the power of autonomous vehicles. This round caught my eye not simply due to its scale, but also the fact that I was, until I read it, completely unfamiliar with Wayve. The startup market is now so big that even mega-rounds can crop up seemingly from nowhere!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/roll-app-creator-platform/">Roll bets that private photos are the future of creator-fan relationships</a>: The creator economy continues to attract founder attention in 2022, today’s launch of Roll reminds us. The app wants to “give fans access to their favorite creators’ camera rolls,” per the startup’s CEO. It doesn’t <em>literally</em> give access to camera rolls as that would be, we noted, “a disaster waiting to happen,” but the idea is unpublished photos from creator to fan, for a recurring fee. Let’s see how it performs in-market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/mustard-looks-beyond-baseball-as-it-raises-another-3-75m-for-sensor-free-sports-coaching/">Mustard’s sports coaching software raises more capital</a>: After securing $1.7 million back in 2020, Mustard went back to the capital well to raise $3.75 million more, it announced today. The startup is expanding its “sensor-free approach to [sports] data capture” to new domains, TechCrunch reports. The app picked up funds from a number of athletes as part of the round, which could help it secure a larger audience.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/upward-plans-to-open-a-250000-square-foot-vertical-farm-in-pa-early-next-year/">Hell yeah, vertical farming</a>: The idea behind vertical farming — that we should grow food <em>up</em>, instead of<em> wide</em> in urban environments — rules. Why? The potential for fresher food and lower carbon footprints for our eats. Upward, a startup in the vertical farming space, announced that it is going to build a 250,000-square-foot facility in Pennsylvania next year. We want a tour.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/smart-calendar-tool-clockwise-raises-45m-to-use-ai-to-help-remote-teams-avoid-burnout/">Clockwise wants to make your clock, well, more wise</a>: Meeting culture is hell on productivity, and despite everyone claiming that their company doesn’t overly index on meetings, most do regardless. Clockwise landed $45 million in a Series C for its solution to the problem. Per TechCrunch, the startup “uses artificial intelligence to help teams free up their workdays and avoid the challenges associated with remote and hybrid workplaces, such as burnout.” If it works, it sounds pretty neat.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/appcues-nabs-32-1m-for-analytics-and-no-code-tools-to-fix-user-onboarding/">Appcues raises $32.1M for no-code user onboarding</a>: Taking the no-code approach and applying it to different pain points in the user journey is big business. Appcues’ focus on onboarding is apparently finding traction, its new funding round hints. It’s worth noting at this juncture that no-code has gone from buzzword to fad to standard business practice for startups. Why? My guess is that it’s a result of a general developer shortage around the world — and folks just got tired of waiting for eng teams to get to their ticket.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s just the start. The startup game is at full-boil this January, with news landing like raindrops in a storm. Also on TechCrunch today was news about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/castiron-serves-up-a-6m-seed-round-to-support-food-artisans/">what Castiron is up to</a> and what the term “food artisans” means, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/pinwheel-raises-50m-series-b-at-500m-valuation-for-its-income-verification-apis/">Pinwheel raising $50 million in a huge Series B</a>, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/open-source-developers-who-work-for-free-are-discovering-they-have-power/">great column from Owen Williams</a> about the open-source world and how the free workers who help keep the world running are discovering their true power – which, you know, impacts essentially every single startup in the market today.</p>
<h2 class="article__title">Will quantum computing remain the domain of the specialist VC?</h2>

<p>Quantum computing&#8217;s potential applications include machine learning and computer-aided drug design, but the industry is still very much in its early days.</p>
<p>In 2021, there were approximately 90 quantum investments that totaled $1.4 billion. A significant jump from $700 million the year before, but compared to SaaS, not even a drop in the bucket.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even so, we&#8217;re already seeing quantum exits: IonQ reached a $2 billion valuation after its 2021 SPAC, and Rigetti plans to do the same this year as it develops its superconducting quantum computer.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive market map of the quantum computing industry, Maria Lepskaya, a senior associate at Runa Capital, sorted the top companies in the space into 12</p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/snapchat-fentanyl-opioid-crisis-update/">Snap cracks down on drug deals</a>: In the wake of an external investigation into folks dying after buying pills on the social service that were laced with fentanyl, Snap claims that it is making progress in finding and removing sales-related content.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/blink-charging-to-supply-ev-chargers-to-general-motors-dealerships/">GM taps Blink Charging for EV chargers</a>: As traditional car companies push headfirst into the electric car game, they need help at times. GM, the U.S. transit behemoth, for example, is tapping an external company to help equip its dealerships with charging points. TechCrunch notes that Blink has “around 30,000 EV chargers set up across 13 countries,” meaning that it has the experience it likely needs to tackle GM’s physical footprint.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is on a mission to vertically integrate space solutions. On Tuesday the launch and space systems company announced the close of a deal to acquire SolAero Holdings, a supplier of space solar power products and precision aerospace structures, for $80 million in cash.</p>
<p>Buying SolAero, a 24-year-old, New Mexico-based company, means Rocket Lab now has another key supplier in-house for its satellite manufacturing. At the same time, having access to Rocket Lab&#8217;s resources will give SolAero the manufacturing capability needed to boost high-volume production and scale, meaning it can better supply other customers, too.</p>
<p>The acquisition helps Rocket Lab&#8217;s long term vision by supporting the company to capture more of the space market, Morgan Bailey, director of communications, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259067" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As an example, Rocket Lab may not be launching a specific spacecraft with Electron or Neutron, but by supplying solar panels or other components such as star trackers, reaction wheels, flight software, separation systems, we’re still able to capture revenue and play a role in the mission,&#8221; said Bailey. &#8220;Naturally, SolAero technology will also be incorporated into Rocket Lab’s own line of Photon spacecraft, further supporting our strategy of vertical integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deal was originally announced, pending certain closing conditions, in December 2021, just a few months after Rocket Lab announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/rocket-lab-acquires-spaceflight-software-and-mission-simulation-company-asi-for-40m/">acquisition of Colorado-based Advanced Solutions</a>, Inc. (ASI), a space software company, for $40 million. The ASI acquisition aimed to help Rocket Lab build out its Space Systems division and achieve its goal of becoming an &#8220;end-to-end&#8221; space company, one that spans spacecraft manufacture, satellite subsystems, flight software, ground operations and launch, according to the company.</p>
<p>The SolAero merger also follows the acquisitions of Planetary Systems Corporation in December 2021, a spacecraft separation systems company, and Sinclair Interplanetary in April 2020, a satellite components manufacturer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“SolAero is a highly complementary addition to Rocket Lab’s vertically integrated business model, enabling us to deliver complete space mission solutions for our customers,&#8221; said Rocket Lab CEO and founder Peter Beck in a statement. &#8220;With more than 1,000 successful missions under their belt, the team at SolAero have enabled trailblazing missions, providing space solar power solutions for the James Webb Space Telescope, and missions on Mars including InSight and Ingenuity.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Mars Insight Lander was the largest solar array ever deployed on the surface of Mars, and Ingenuity was the helicopter that successfully flew on Mars in April last year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">SolAero&#8217;s products have supplied power to NASA&#8217;s Parker Solar Probe and several Cygnus Cargo Resupply Missions to the International Space Station. The company has also provided power to OneWeb&#8217;s broadband constellation, and it has been selected to supply Solar Power Modules for NASA&#8217;s Artemis lunar exploration plans, which should enable future missions to Mars.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">SolAero&#8217;s team of 425 will be joining Rocket Lab, bringing the company&#8217;s total headcount to more than 1,100 employees across its facilities in California, Virginia, Colorado, Maryland, Toronto, New Zealand and now Albuquerque. The team will continue to be led by President and CEO Brad Clevenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen and Bosch have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore a joint venture dedicated to providing Europe with battery equipment solutions. The two companies aim to supply integrated battery production systems and on-site ramp-up and maintenance support for battery cell and system manufacturers, Volkswagen said.</p>
<p>The JV is expected to help VW reach its goal to build six cell factories by 2030, but it will also be available to serve other factories across Europe. The companies did not share how much they would invest in the venture.</p>
<p>As automakers set ever more ambitious targets to deliver millions of electric vehicles in the next few years, they&#8217;re working on becoming more self-sustaining and less reliant on getting their battery supplies from abroad, which has become even more problematic with pandemic-related supply chain issues. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/automakers-have-battery-anxiety-so-theyre-taking-control-of-the-supply/">2021 saw a string of battery joint ventures between automakers and cell suppliers</a> keen to build battery cell production facilities close to home, but VW was already there with a <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-and-northvolt-form-joint-venture-for-battery-production-5316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 JV with Northvolt</a> and its first planned production facility in Saltzgitter, Germany.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259049" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Europe has the unique chance to become a global battery powerhouse in the years to come,&#8221; said Thomas Schmall, a VW board member responsible for the automaker&#8217;s battery plans, <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-and-bosch-want-to-industrialize-manufacturing-processes-for-battery-cells-7707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a statement</a>. &#8220;There is a strong and growing demand for all aspects of battery production, including the equipment of new gigafactories. Volkswagen and Bosch will explore opportunities to develop and shape this novel, multibillion-euro industry in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Volkswagen is also joining the growing trend of automakers finding ways to diversify revenues by offering services to competitors. On Tuesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/ford-and-adt-launch-joint-venture-new-product-to-prevent-theft-from-vehicles/">Ford and ADT formed a JV</a> to provide a vehicle monitoring system that can be attached to any car make or model to help prevent thefts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our decision to actively engage in the vertical integration of the battery-making value chain will tap considerable new profit pools,&#8221; added Schmall. &#8220;Setting out to establish a fully localized European supply chain for e-mobility made in Europe certainly marks a rare opportunity in business history.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eba250.com/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Battery Alliance</a> has said a third of global batteries need to be produced in Europe by the end of the decade to cut dependence on South Korean and Chinese market dominants, but so far battery cell plants capable of generating under 900 gigawatt hours of capacity in Europe are set to make up only 16% of global production by 2029.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla is planning to build a battery plant in Berlin with a capacity of 50 GWh next to its 300-hectare site to build Model Y vehicles, but both the plant and factory are still awaiting approval from regional authorities to begin production, despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/tesla-hosts-festival-at-berlin-gigafactory-to-announce-start-of-production-by-december/">CEO Elon Musk&#8217;s earlier promises that production would begin in November or December</a> last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a37594789/vw-battery-tech-new-laboratory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volkswagen’s planned factory in Salzgitter</a> is expected to produce 40 GWh, but if the automaker succeeds in ramping up production and building a total of six factories, it should have a combined output of 240 GWh.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s a sign of the times that on the very same morning, the FTC and Justice Department <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2022/01/ftc-and-justice-department-seek-to-strengthen-enforcement-against-illegal-mergers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a thorough review of corporate merger policies</a> with an eye to preventing anti-competitive acquisitions — and a megacorp announced a $69 billion deal that would further consolidate an industry already dominated by a handful of players.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-acquire-activision-blizzard/">the Microsoft-Activision deal</a> is necessarily anticompetitive, but they certainly will have their job cut out for them in proving that it isn&#8217;t. As a publisher, platform, hardware maker and service provider in gaming, Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard puts several of the world&#8217;s most popular gaming franchises firmly in its stable — and potentially out of arch-rival Sony&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s just how competition works these days. But what this FTC review presupposes is&#8230; maybe it shouldn&#8217;t?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258923" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What exactly the new rules are to be isn&#8217;t yet set, the announcement drew very obvious dotted lines around the areas the agencies are hoping to rein in without actually naming names. In fact (as is frequently but not always the process in recasting rules) public comment is called for on all matters, so the areas of focus are ostensibly notional, though one assumes they have a draft ready now. (In fact I suspect FTC Chair Lina Khan had it in her briefcase when she was confirmed.)</p>
<p>The review would seek to revisit the conditions under which a merger or acquisition would be viewed with suspicion, such as whether it will &#8220;tend to create a monopoly,&#8221; a somewhat loose turn of phrase technically in the guidelines now but not very well defined.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4d5KDeyvdT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/amazon-betrays-its-fear-with-petition-to-sideline-ftc-chair-and-antitrust-hawk-lina-khan/">Amazon betrays its fear with petition to sideline FTC Chair and antitrust hawk Lina Khan</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon betrays its fear with petition to sideline FTC Chair and antitrust hawk Lina Khan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/amazon-betrays-its-fear-with-petition-to-sideline-ftc-chair-and-antitrust-hawk-lina-khan/embed/#?secret=4d5KDeyvdT" data-secret="4d5KDeyvdT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Also under consideration would be the way markets themselves are defined, which is key to establishing anticompetitive practices. For instance, what market is Facebook in, legally speaking? Communications, &#8220;social media&#8221; (however we define that), advertising, or what? Unless that sort of thing is pinned down, companies can slip between the cracks, arguing one day that they&#8217;re an advertiser and the next that they&#8217;re a communications provider, usually whichever suits their needs for escaping regulation. (Broadband providers have been drawing out a similar advantageous vacillation for decades.)</p>
<p>The FTC will also be looking at updating guidelines on &#8220;potential and nascent competitors,&#8221; the kind frequently snapped up for tens of billions of dollars when it looks like they can&#8217;t be contained any longer.</p>
<p>Monopsony power and how it relates to labor markets is also being looked at, which is where one company (or more than one in collusion) dominates the market for buying a particular service. Say if Uber for some reason employs 90% of all personal transportation drivers in a state, what opportunities for leverage and abuse does that offer, and how can those be counteracted?</p>
<p>The most explicit call-out, however, is certainly the final bullet on the list of items:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Unique characteristics of digital markets</strong>: The agencies seek information on how to account for key areas of the modern economy like digital markets in the guidelines, which often have characteristics like zero-price products, multi-sided markets, and data aggregation that the current guidelines do not address in detail.</p></blockquote>
<p>What exactly is the effect of things like Amazon Prime, which despite being unquestionably convenient in many ways is part of a complex market and system of markets, and as such may prove problematic from a competition standpoint? Without the ability to even ask and answer such questions, Amazon will fall through the aforementioned cracks and its policies may be blindly accepted as beneficial upon superficial inquiry.</p>
<p>Asking the general public whether they think a company amounts to a monopsony, or whether their acquisition of a competitor amounts is questionable, seems on the face of it a little unaccountable. But the public comment period does two things.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First, it creates an opportunity for soliciting broad support from the public across the U.S., establishing the process as good politics. Some canny Representative may require a bit of convincing that their constituency cares about such things. Though as we saw with the net neutrality push, this is hardly sufficient to guarantee success.</p>
<p>Second, it allows for real input from interested parties — trade associations, activists, NGOs, and so on — who can put together serious comments that make substantive policy and research suggestions. Having a basket of non-partisan think tanks to sprinkle in as footnotes justifying various approaches is a bulwark against rules being considered &#8220;arbitrary or capricious&#8221; and being nullified or challenged.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2022/01/statement-chair-lina-m-khan-regarding-request-information-merger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A highly readable statement by Khan</a> summarizes the situation well and gives important context to the idea of updating rules — it&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve been doing all along, and it&#8217;s long past time we do it again. It&#8217;s hard to put it better than she does, with the directness that made her Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox paper so compelling:</p>
<blockquote><p>Major technological and economic changes, meanwhile, have led to shifts in how businesses compete and grow, creating new interconnections and dynamics across multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that decades of mergers have been a key driver of consolidation across industries, with this latest merger wave threatening to concentrate our markets further yet.</p>
<p>While the current merger boom has delivered massive fees for investment banks, evidence suggests that many Americans historically have lost out, with diminished opportunity, higher prices, lower wages, and lagging innovation. 7 A lack of competition also appears to have left segments of our economy more brittle, as consolidated supply and reduced investment in capacity can render us less resilient in the face of shocks.</p>
<p>Just as we must revise our theories and models to fit new facts and evidence, we must ensure our merger guidelines accurately reflect the realities of the modern economy. Matching our analysis to contemporary business strategy requires that our tools be dynamic and holistic rather than static and atomistic.</p></blockquote>
<p>The comments are open now and will remain so for 60 days. <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FTC-2022-0003/document" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feel free to add your own</a>.</p>

<p>This is our <del>Monday</del> Tuesday show, our short ramp into the week where we talk about the larger picture to get our feet wet. We&#8217;re a day late due to an American holiday, and later in the day thanks to my schedule. But, better late than never; here&#8217;s what we got into:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258905" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Yet another bad day for assets: Stocks around the world were broadly lower, with software shares taking yet another hit in the key U.S. market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-acquire-activision-blizzard/">Microsoft wants to buy Activision Blizzard</a> for nearly $69 billion. It&#8217;s a lot of money for a gaming studio that was so recently covered in, well, scandal? And really, does Microsoft <em>need </em>to get any bigger? Come on. It has already consumed several gaming companies, and is worth north of $2 trillion. At what point will regulators, you know, regulate?</li>
<li>Clockwise raises $45 million! This is a very neat round from a very cool company, which <a href="https://twitter.com/aiishamalik1?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aisha Malik</a> covered for TechCrunch earlier today. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/smart-calendar-tool-clockwise-raises-45m-to-use-ai-to-help-remote-teams-avoid-burnout/">Her post is here if you need more</a>.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animoca Brands</a>, an eight-year-old, 600-person Hong Kong-based outfit that has managed to put its stamp on many of the world&#8217;s most popular NFT and metaverse brands, has raised roughly $360 million in fresh funding at a valuation of more than $5 billion, the company announced today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big leap from the $2.2 billion valuation the company was assigned in October when it raised a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/20/animoca-brands-raises-65m-at-2-2b-valuation-from-ubisoft-and-others/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$65 million</a> round. The number is even more notable considering that Animoca was valued at $1 billion in a <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/animoca-brands-completes-usd138888888-capital-raise-with-second-tranche-of-usd50000000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$138 million</a> round that closed as recently as July.</p>
<p>According to Crunchbase data, the company has now raised an estimated <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/animoca-brands-corporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$604 million</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the firm, the capital raise involved the issue of 111,173,515 new shares, which investors bought from Animoca Brands at the equivalent of $3.24 per share in a &#8220;pretty standard equity-based raise.&#8221; It&#8217;s worth noting, given that Animoca &#8212; which previously traded on the Australian Securities Exchange and was <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/delisting-faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delisted</a> in early 2020 because “it didn’t like the fact that we were dealing with crypto,” Animoca founder Yat Siu <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/a-peek-into-web3-power-player-animoca-brands/">recently told us</a> &#8212; now operates as an unlisted public company. (As Siu explained it, the company&#8217;s roughly 2,500 shareholders can sell their shares privately to other individuals. You just have to know who owns some to buy these.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Secondary placement of shares is occurring because there was high demand that could not be fulfilled in the primary placement,&#8221; added the spokesperson, &#8220;however secondary placement is not considered part of this capital raise and any sums exchanged via secondary sales do not count toward the company&#8217;s finances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty City Ventures &#8212; and earlier investor in Animoca &#8212; led the new round, along with a mix of other earlier and new investors, including 10T Holdings, C Ventures, Delta Fund, Gemini Frontier Fund, Gobi Partners Greater Bay Area, Kingsway, L2 Capital, Mirae Asset, Pacific Century Group, ParaFi Capital, Provident, Senator Investment Group, Sequoia China, Smile Group, Stable Asset Management, Soros Fund Management, Wildcat Capital Management and Winklevoss Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to appreciate Animoca&#8217;s appeal right now. As we noted in our recent piece on Animoca, the outfit controls what it describes as a &#8220;broad portfolio of game products, both centralized and decentralized, branded and original, with coverage across most primary platforms including mobile devices, game consoles, PC, web, and blockchain&#8221; with products, including games, ranging from hyper casual to hardcore, as well as collectibles, utility tokens, e-sports titles&#8221; and more.</p>

<p>Some of those products tie to subsidiaries of the company, which got its start by developing games for smartphones and tablets and dove headlong into blockchain gaming roughly four years ago. Others represents stakes that Animoca has taken in other companies, including Dapper Labs; Sky Mavis, the developer of global sensation &#8220;Axie Infinity;&#8221; and the NFT trading platform OpenSea.</p>
<p>According to Siu, those various holdings were worth around $16 billion as of late November, though their value remains theoretical for now given that Animoca has not tried exiting from those positions. “They would be really what you describe as balance sheet items; they basically just accrue to the value of the equity of Animoca Brands,” he explained.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Animoca is continuing to invest actively. Among the outfits that have announced Animoca&#8217;s involvement already this year are nCore Games, an Indian gaming firm that is preparing to enable users to &#8220;own&#8221; more of the assets they use to play and says it just raised $10 million in funding co-led by Animoca Brands and another high-profile investor in the crypto space, Galaxy Interactive.</p>
<p>Animoca also recently led a $9 million Series A round in CryptoSlam, a Kansas-based non-fungible token (NFT) industry data aggregator, and it led an $8 million Series A in Burnt Finance, a New York-based company developing an NFT auction protocol that&#8217;s built on the Solana blockchain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jibo may have breathed its last robotic breaths back in 2019, but researchers at MIT believe the social robot may have been onto something. Sure, the world wasn’t ready for a pricey social robot a few years back, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t some positives to take away from the experience &#8212; namely, the value of imbuing smart home products with more humanlike attributes.</p>
<p>A team at MIT’s media lab recently <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/hey-alexa-are-you-trustworthy-0114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a paper</a> looking into the value of attaching simple human gestures to smart home interfaces. It’s worth mentioning up front here that former Jibo CEO Cynthia Breazeal, who currently works at Media Lab, was one of four co-authors of the study, which pitted the bygone home robot against a Google Nest and Amazon Echo.</p>
<p>According to the study, users are more likely to engage with both the device &#8212; and each other &#8212; more when it exhibits some form of social cues. That can mean something as simple as the face/screen of the device rotating to meet the speaker’s gaze.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259033" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Per MIT, “In the first experiment, participants interacted with a Jibo robot, Amazon Echo, and Google Home, with no modifications. Most found the Jibo to be far more outgoing, dependable, and sympathetic. Because the users perceived that Jibo had a more humanlike personality, they were more likely to interact with it, [research assistant Anastasia] Ostrowski explains.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1192682" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1192682" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1192682 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/jibo.gif" alt="" width="400" height="225" /><p id="caption-attachment-1192682" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jibo</p></div></p>
<p>Future studies will likely include additional robots &#8212; Amazon’s Astro seems like a prime candidate, effectively serving as a rolling Echo with a built-in personality. Obviously, however, full robotic functionality comes at a much higher premium. The $1,500 robot is not going to replace the wildly successful Echo line any time soon.</p>
<p>There are those devices, like the Echo Show 10, which follow the user around the room, using object tracking. Though that technology doesn’t engender the same sort of warm feelings as a Wall-E-like robot. “Users found the modified Amazon Echo Spot to be no more engaging than the Amazon Echo Show, suggesting that repetitive movement without social embodiment may not be an effective way to increase user engagement,” the study notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Branding, too, was found to have an impact on how users perceived the devices.</p>
