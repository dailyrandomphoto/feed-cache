<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem that the outage lasted long, as services were back up and running for some less than thirty minutes after Facebook tweeted about it. But after this week&#8217;s more serious outage, the repeated lapse might spark concerns about the reliability and safety of the app. Repeated outages are especially concerning for small business owners who use Facebook&#8217;s tools to communicate with customers, or international users who use WhatsApp as their primary texting app.</p>
<p>Facebook hasn&#8217;t yet declared what caused today&#8217;s outage, or how many users it affected, but Monday&#8217;s outage was caused by <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/04/networking-traffic/outage/">configuration changes</a> to the routers in Facebook&#8217;s data centers.</p>

Dave was previously an investor with Wells Fargo’s principal investment arm and is currently the proptech vertical lead for the<a href="https://www.evca.org/"> EVCA</a>.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Venture-backed fintechs raised a record<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/fintech-trends-q2-2021/"> $30.8 billion in the second quarter of this year</a>, up 30% over the same quarter last year. And they&#8217;re raising more, and faster, than ever — the average deal size stands at $47 million this year.</p>
<p>So, with fintech founders now sitting on mountains of cash as a result, just how are they spending it all?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, data across private and public companies generally doesn&#8217;t show discernible trends in how these dollars are spent. That said, perhaps some answers to the question of how well capital can be allocated are hiding in plain sight.</p>
<h2>Looking to the leaders</h2>
<p>There are now a slew of fintech startups approaching or far surpassing $10 billion in value — the table below has a selection of the most prominent — so we can glean some insight into their capital allocation strategies by considering how they have spent to achieve their position in the ecosystem. Some may argue that the differences in business models among these companies, their disparate markets, and studying a ten-year span of capital raising might make it challenging to extract any relevant insights. But their fundraising and business building behaviors indicate otherwise.</p>
<p>Studying this selection of fintech &#8220;leaders&#8221; can give us core takeaways on how they have funded and built their businesses. Most of these companies built their business over the course of two years before launching their product and scaling rapidly with limited capital, sometimes even before a Series A — quite a departure from what&#8217;s happening in today’s fundraising environment.</p>
<p>Many of these companies nurtured early champions of their product in both customers and distribution partners, which allowed them to grow and scale without needing to sell to enterprises. All of them eventually raised monster rounds — at an astounding 174x multiple of the capital raised before launch — but they waited to do so until after their product had already been adopted by the market.</p>

<p>All of these businesses share three common traits.</p>
<h2>A valuation inflection point</h2>
<p>Despite having different business models, end markets, and being founded at different times, this sample showed a consistent valuation inflection point. Generally, these companies launched their product just after the Series A, used their Series B to pour fuel on the fire, and then hit a 5x valuation uptick at the Series C.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares of <a href="https://isoplexis.com/">IsoPlexis</a>, a company creating tools to zoom in on the flurry of protein activity surrounding a single cell, began trading on Friday. The company aims to raise about $125 million with the IPO, which will be used to build the commercial team and advance the company’s plans to play a bigger part in the creation of precision medicine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IsoPlexis was founded in 2013 and fits into the category of companies you might find in a lab during the drug research process. The company is primarily focused on single-cell proteomics (basically the study of proteins and their interactions). The company has developed instruments and software to analyze the proteins secreted by cells, from immune cells to tumor cells. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the instruments can be used to identify cells that excrete many different types of proteins. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These datasets could then be used to develop new treatments or understand how people may respond to existing ones. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215634" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our instrument we invented is able to identity subsets of cells in the body we call superhero cells,” explains CEO and co-founder Sean MacKay. &#8220;And these superhero cells are defined by a lot of activity coming from small subsets of cells you would normally miss with existing technologies today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MacKay says there are about 150 IsoPlexis units on the market as of the first half of this year. Customers include 15 global pharmaceutical companies, and, </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1615055/000162828021014106/isoplexis-sx1.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per SEC filings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, nearly half of the comprehensive cancer centers in the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IsoPlexis has raised a considerable amount of funding in the past from some notable investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-IPO, the company had secured about <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/isoplexis">$205.5 million</a> in funding, per Crunchbase. The most recent <a href="https://www.newhavenbiz.com/article/isoplexis-closes-on-135m-in-financing">Series D round</a> totaled about $135 million in financing (about $85 million in equity securities and $50 million in debt financing), and included participation from Perceptive Advisors, Ally Bridge Group, and “funds and accounts” managed by BlackRock. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, shares were initially priced around $15 each, but have slid to about $12 as of writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major part of IsoPlexis thesis is they’re the first to use proteomics and single-cell biology to link the function of cells to patient outcomes. Or in other words, among the first to show that we might be able to tell how well someone like a cancer patient may fare, by examining how individual cells and proteins interact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is published evidence that IsoPlexis’ instruments have been used to this effect, particularly when it comes to cancer treatments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01436-0#Sec13">one 2021 </a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Medicine </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">study used IsoPlexis instruments to examine immune cell activity in lymphoma patients. These patients had cancers resistant to treatment, or that had returned after remission. Specifically, they were receiving CAR-T cell therapy – a form of treatment where genetically engineered immune cells are injected into a patient, where they then help target cancerous cells. Ultimately, the study found that cytokine production (proteins involved in cell signaling), by those CAR-T cells was an important indicator of how potent those CAR-T cells actually were. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, it showed that IsoPlexis’ device might help uncover the signals that tell scientists how well CAR-T cell therapy was working. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’ve seen is that the unique cells we identify are indicative of a long-term response in patients,” says MacKay. “We published studies in various cancers where, if patients have these types of unique immune cells, these superhero cells we detect, we know that those patients are going to have this long term outcome.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people particularly interested in the minutia of cells, IsoPlexis technology might sound similar to flow cytometry – a well-established method of counting cells, identifying them, and measuring specific cell characteristics. There are some large established players in the flow cytometry world, like Thermo Fisher Scientific. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IsoPlexis, though, argues it can offer a whole new layer of information, largely, protein-based information, that flow cytometry misses. The company has licensed an invention that allows the devices to barcode protein activity present in each individual cell (now called IsoCode). One </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Reviews Chemistry</span></i><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41570-020-0162-7"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">paper suggests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that barcoding is useful because it can analyze many different proteins at once, across thousands of cells, and cells can be recovered to be used in other experiments – but that this technology can still only capture a piece of the overall action of the proteome, so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “That new layer of data, for an individual cell is very different from the technology that is on the market today,” MacKay adds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the company still has a long way to go before it can reach profitability. Per SEC documents, the company has been running a loss for the past several years. Though the company pulled in $7.5 million in revenue in 2019 and $10.4 in 2020, it lost about $13.6 million and $23.3 million in those years, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, the path to growth largely means getting more instruments into more researchers’ hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to continue to move forward at a fast clip, expanding the same type of customers we have currently, but with more depth, and that’s really by continuing to build a commercial team,” he says. </span></p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-yoo/">Diane Yoo</a> is a results-driven entrepreneur and venture capitalist with more than 15 years of experience.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Without a doubt, the COVID-19 pandemic created catastrophic effects in our communities, educational systems and, most importantly, our careers and overall global economy.</p>
<p>The pandemic has also had a disproportionate effect on women’s careers: We are <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/covid-19-and-gender-equality-countering-the-regressive-effects">1.8 times more likely</a> to be laid off than men. It is also important to note that the pandemic caused a significant rise in the need for at-home childcare services.</p>
<p>Women, traditionally expected to be homemakers, were twice as likely to leave their jobs than men in order to stay home, and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters">data</a> collected as recently as 2020 shows a significant decrease in venture capital funding for women-led startup companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2214647" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In 2019, nearly 2.8% of VC funding was used to invest in women-led startups. While considered a relatively low statistic, this was an all-time-high investment rate for women. However, 2020 <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders/">Crunchbase</a> statistics revealed that the amount of VC funding that went toward women-led startups dropped to 2.3%. When viewed realistically, this “minor” setback actually delayed women’s progress in VC by five to 10 years.</p>
<p>Many women in venture capital know that waiting for opportunities to come is never as efficient as creating your own. As a seasoned investor, venture capitalist and founding partner, I have been presented with a variety of unique opportunities to invest in different industries and niches. While I have spent years creating my own opportunities in venture capital by raising and launching funds, I have found it impossible to ignore the impacts women in VC have faced throughout the course of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, women were making consistent and tremendous strides in VC. As of 2019, women in VC<a href="https://www.axios.com/women-venture-capital-gender-equality-3811e58d-6d89-48ea-bd13-6dc3e03a8911.html"> made up nearly 12.4%</a> of all decision-makers at venture capital firms in the United States, up nearly 3.5 percentage points from data collected in 2018. Despite the rise of women entering the VC workforce, not all women working in VC are allowed to make decisions at their firms. Out of 351 venture capital firms in the United States, only 34 firms had two or more women in decision-making positions, according to an Axios analysis.</p>
<p>Despite these obstacles, I believe there is a strategic and collaborative approach to creating more opportunities for women in the aftermath of COVID-19.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Venture capital is growing exponentially. For instance, Crunchbase statistics show that venture capital in my hometown of Houston, Texas, has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/houston-venture-capital-investors">tripled in value</a> over the last four years. Investments went from $284 million in 2016 to nearly $800 million in 2021. This tremendous growth requires the support of diverse talents from all backgrounds in order to continue to build long-term, stable investments in the future.</p>
<p>As of 2021, only 6% of the VC industry is made up of women of Asian descent, such as myself, so I deeply empathize with the challenges and hardships associated with breaking barriers in VC.</p>
<p>I have made it my mission to empower and uplift individuals of all backgrounds, especially women. This ultimately led me to create a diverse team of seasoned experts, with 90% of those individuals coming from diverse ethnic backgrounds. By investing in a diverse team, we ultimately yield greater results in both revenue and diversity levels throughout VC.</p>
<p>When women venture capitalists are put in positions with decision-making power, they are actually twice as likely to invest in diverse, women-led founding teams or startups. Moreover, women have personal experiences that men often overlook. These experiences are incredibly valuable to women in VC because they allow us to further identify overlooked problems and understand market size. Additionally, women investing in women can increase the chances of a women-led firm building a record-breaking or category-defining company in the future.</p>
<p>In fact, a study conducted by <a href="https://www.kauffmanfellows.org/journal_posts/women-vcs-invest-in-up-to-2x-more-female-founders">Kauffman Fellows</a> found that when women-led startups receive funding, they are more likely to deliver higher revenue rates at nearly twice the value of the original investment. Because women are told “no” more often than they are told “yes,” women are more likely to create stronger, more concrete business plans to execute their goals and strategies. Over the course of women’s careers, I have also found an increase in resilience, adaptability and innovation &#8212; all of which are extremely valuable traits when working in VC.</p>
<p>The Kauffman Fellows study also found that women founders or women in VC are twice as likely to hire women as employees for their startup companies. This study also stated that women are drawn to work for companies that focus on making a global impact or societal contribution, as well as building long-lasting relationships with their workforce.</p>
<p>The same study found that startups with both a female and male founder would be nearly six times as likely to hire female staff members.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the solution behind creating more opportunities for women in VC, even during a post-COVID society, does not come from merely supporting women-owned businesses, but from debunking the institutional and systemic myths, biases, prejudices and thinking patterns that prevent VC firms and men in decision-making roles from investing in women-led startups.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this, the best approach would be to focus on human-centered business models. These models stand out because they tend to focus on fulfilling societal needs such as creating additional job functions, increasing employee satisfaction rates and creating a healthy work environment that supports and empowers employees through career advancement opportunities.</p>
<p>Venture capital is not a safe industry, by any means. It takes courage, empathy, intuition, determination and resilience to truly break through as an investor and become successful over time. Given the risky nature of VC, there is no way to know for sure what will bring success and profitability.</p>
<p>However, my own experience in VC has only proven that taking risks leads to further innovation and evolutionary strides. It’s time to take that risk on women and bet on a brighter future in VC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Whether or not we&#8217;re at some kind of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">tipping point</a> right now, venture investors, old and new, have done very well in recent years, with their limited partners notching the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/university-endowments-mint-billions-in-golden-era-of-venture-capital-11632907802">biggest gains in decades</a>.</p>
<p>Among the newer VCs to be having a time of it is Bradley Tusk, the political strategist, lobbyist and founder of Tusk Ventures, whose firm is just six years old but whose exits already include the insurtech company Lemonade, which<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/02/lemonade-lmnd-ipo-shares-more-than-double-in-public-debut.html"> went public</a> in July of last year; the smart lock company Latch, which went <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2021/06/07/proptech-firm-latch-gains-in-first-day-of-trading/">public this year</a> through a blank-check company; FanDuel, which <a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/46229/flutter-acquire-remainder-fanduel/">was acquired</a> and may now get spun off into a public company <a href="https://www.onlinepokerreport.com/55304/fanduel-ipo-2022-preview/">next year;</a> and Coinbase, which staged a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/business/how-did-coinbase-stock-do.html">highly successful</a> direct listing in April. Tusk Ventures has more companies set to become publicly traded, too, through tie-ups with blank-check companies, including the mobility company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-to-go-public-via-spac-at-an-implied-value-of-2-3b/">Bird</a> and, if it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-05/crypto-firm-circle-says-it-got-subpoena-from-u-s-sec-in-july">passes muster</a> with the SEC, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/cryptocurrency-company-circle-to-go-public-in-spac-deal/">Circle Financial</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me,&#8221; says Tusk. &#8220;It&#8217;s like, &#8216;Oh, yeah, of course, that&#8217;s how [venture investing works] works.&#8217; And people who&#8217;ve been VCs for a long time are like, &#8216;No, that&#8217;s not how it works. We&#8217;re in the middle of a crazy market right now.&#8217; &#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215174" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We talked with Tusk earlier this week about some of his most recent bets, including that Andrew Yang would become mayor of New York (a Tusk deputy was Yang’s co-campaign manager). He also let slip that he is helping to incubate a new social network with a focus on religion and that on the heels of a $300 million SPAC he formed last year, he has another up his sleeve. Excerpts from our conversation follow, edited for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Because it was just in the news, I&#8217;m seeing you were blamed by &#8220;<a href="https://www.theuprising.info/p/yang-presidential-campaign-advisers">multiple sources</a>&#8221; in Yang&#8217;s camp who say your team was responsible for his disappointing finish in the race. How do you feel about that, and what went wrong?</strong></p>
<p>BT: Whenever you win a campaign, you get the credit. So if you lose a campaign, you deserve the blame, and I&#8217;ll take it, I recruited Andrew into the race because I felt like New York City just needed a better option than the people who are running for mayor [and that] he&#8217;d be able to hire based on talent; he&#8217;d be able to attract really talented people. But halfway through the campaign, two things happened. One, the vaccine became available, and violence and crime really spiked in New York City. So the zeitgeist shifted from COVID recovery to crime and violence, and Eric Adams, who won the race, had been a police officer for 22 years and was far and away the candidate most associated with being able to deal with that one issue, and my hope is that he will be a good mayor.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Wearing your political strategist hat, if you were marshaling Facebook&#8217;s lobbyists, how would you try and respond to the testimony this week of whistleblower Frances Haugen?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BT: Obviously, they don&#8217;t listen to me. But I would take a step back and just stop the charade. Part of the reason why people don&#8217;t trust Facebook is they are endlessly pretending you can have your cake and eat it too. And everyone knows that&#8217;s not true. You are making a transaction with them, where in order to use this free service, you&#8217;re allowing them to monetize your data and to sell that to advertisers to pitch you on stuff. I actually think consumers can handle that trade-off. Instead, by Facebook constantly lying and saying, &#8216;No, no, no, we&#8217;ve got you covered, we&#8217;re not doing any of that,&#8217; no one believes it about anything.</p>
<p>Facebook just needs to level with the people and say, &#8216;Look, this is our business model. This is how we make money. If you want it to be for free, here&#8217;s what we need to do. If you&#8217;d rather pay for a subscription, we could do that instead.&#8217; I think until they do that, all the spin and all the lobbying in the world isn&#8217;t going to change [people&#8217;s perception of the company].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you see broader cultural changes happening in the startup world?</strong></p>
<p>BT: Yes and no. When I think what we talk to our founders about &#8212; and we&#8217;re talking about politics and regulation and media &#8212; it&#8217;s a lot more cautionary than it probably would have been 10 years ago. On the other hand, if you&#8217;re an Uber or Lyft &#8212; whoever it is &#8212; and your ability to operate depends on whether or not you get permission from government or you just go ahead and launch anyway, if it&#8217;s existential, you&#8217;re still going to take that risk. Because if you don&#8217;t take the risk, you don&#8217;t exist in the first place.</p>
<p>But the demise of Facebook&#8217;s reputation &#8212; and the same thing for Google and others &#8212; has created an opportunity to have startups that really are more privacy focused. I&#8217;m working on a social media platform right now for religion, where it is built by religious leaders for people in the religious community, and the idea is to be the anti-Facebook and we protect your data. We don&#8217;t monetize it. We don&#8217;t even have control over it; the community manager and leader do, and so there are business opportunities to come out of [this backlash].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Does &#8220;working&#8221; on this social network mean you are helping to build it or you&#8217;re investing in it?</strong></p>
<p>BT: We came up with the idea, we diligenced it, we funded the seed round and we&#8217;re now in beta testing.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is incubating startups something new for Tusk Ventures?</strong></p>
<p>BT: It&#8217;s the first incubation that we&#8217;ve done out of Tusk. We&#8217;re working on a new one now in the esports gambling space. When we see a hole in the marketplace, especially because people are misunderstanding the regulatory climate, sometimes the answer is just go ahead and build it yourself. And I think we now have the infrastructure here, the talent, and the money to do that. And so we&#8217;ve gotten our first couple going, and our hope is to probably incubate about two companies a year.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have such a range of investments. You&#8217;ve got a men&#8217;s wellness company, Ro, a lawn care company, Sunday. I used to think of the outfit as one that finds startups that could use your political expertise, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be uniformly the case anymore.</strong></p>
<p>BT: It&#8217;s still the case. As an early-stage investor, we&#8217;re looking for all of the same things as every other early-stage investor. We&#8217;re looking at the founder and the TAM and the underlying technology, but then we&#8217;re also asking ourselves two other questions. One, is there a gating regulatory issue or opportunity that if it were solved, could really drive growth and valuation? And two, if so, can we solve it?</p>
<p>Using Ro as an example, [co-founder] Zach Reitano really wanted to be able to offer people prescriptions obtainable via text message as opposed to having to go see your doctor . . . and our view was like, yes, if you can prescribe via text, it really will lead to an increase in business. Other times &#8212; take Sunday, as an example &#8212; the original idea was that we would run campaigns in really left-wing cities like Portland or Austin, where we would mandate the use of organic fertilizer and use that to really create a market for the product. But it turned out that Sunday grew so fast, so quickly, they just never needed to do it. Sometimes you just get lucky and the political problem that you think you&#8217;re going to have never really materializes.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mention having enough money to invest. You closed your last fund with $70 million in 2019. Is there a new fund announcement coming?</strong></p>
<p>BT: I can&#8217;t really talk about it. We are investing out of our third fund, and the fund that you&#8217;re talking about is fund two. So, by deduction, yes.</p>
<p><strong>TC: By deduction, based on the growth of funds generally, is it safe to assume this will be at least twice the size of that second fund?</strong></p>
<p>BT: [It&#8217;s] significantly bigger to allow us to hopefully lead at least half the deals that we do. But at the same time, we still really like being an early-stage fund. Every deal that we do we think has to be able to return to find, and you can only take those swings at the seed and A stage. So while on the one hand, it&#8217;s good to be well-capitalized, valuations are increasing so much that you need more and more capital now to be able to win deals. If you have a $400 million Series A fund, then you&#8217;ve gotta have like five Birds in your portfolio just to hit a 3x. I&#8217;d rather just raise more and more funds and have them be smaller and be able to with a couple of clear winners in each fund to deliver a really good return to my investors.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You also raised a <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/70929/Leisure-SPAC-IG-Acquisition-files-for-a-$300-million-IPO">$300 million</a> SPAC last year. You&#8217;ve already told me you can&#8217;t talk about this. Out of curiosity, is another SPAC coming?</strong></p>
<p>BT: There&#8217;s another one that we&#8217;ve lined up. The combination of not having announced the first deal yet, plus the SPAC market obviously taking a beating right now, has caused us to not go ahead yet and raise the money. But there are lots of places where the right regulatory expertise, combined with the right company &#8212; and this is true whether we&#8217;re incubating something or investing out of out of the fund or doing a SPAC &#8212; can be really valuable. It&#8217;s really limited mainly by how hard I work, and I&#8217;m willing to work pretty hard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is announcing <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/helping-brands-unlock-the-power-of-music-and-sound-on-tiktok">new partnerships</a> aimed at making it easier for brands to tap into music and sound on the platform. The company has expanded its TikTok Marketing Partners program and introduced six certified partners that will help brands create &#8220;sound-on&#8221; strategies for the platform. TikTok notes that it essentially wants to connect brands with trusted partners that will be able to help them leverage its &#8220;sound-on&#8221; environment to engage with consumers.</p>
<p>The company’s new sound partners will offer audio with two categories: custom sound and subscription sound. The new custom sound partners are KARM, MassiveMusic and The Elements Music. TikTok notes that custom sound partners create tracks that aim to increase community participation around challenges and campaigns.</p>
<p>The new subscription sound partners are Epidemic Sound, Songtradr and UnitedMasters. These new partners offer music offerings through monthly, yearly or project-based licensing plans. TikTok says the two categories will support a variety of campaign objectives for brands on its platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215570" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Sound is the universal language of TikTok, and brands need to embrace music and sound in order to show up authentically on the platform. Our new Sound Partners have a proven track record of helping marketers develop strategies for TikTok, and offer scalable options for brands of all sizes,” Tiktok’s head of ecosystems, Melissa Yang, said in a <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/helping-brands-unlock-the-power-of-music-and-sound-on-tiktok">blog post</a>. “We&#8217;re excited to see more brands tap into sound on TikTok and make meaningful connections with the community through creative, sound-on strategies.&#8221;</p>
<p>TikTok prides itself on having a sound-on environment that allows brands to get involved with audiences by remixing trending sounds or creating their own jingle. Although some marketers may be used to creating sound-off advertising to reach more people, TikTok says sound on its platform has introduced a new storytelling dynamic for brands. For instance, TikTok notes that 65% of users prefer content from brands that feature original sounds, while 68% say they remember brands better if they feature songs they like in their ads.</p>
<p>TikTok has been looking for ways to make it easier for brands on its platform to connect with users while also bringing on more brands to its roster. Last week, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/tiktok-new-ad-products-invite-users-to-interact-with-taps-swipes-likes-and-more/">introduced plans to launch</a> new interactive ad formats, ranging from clickable stickers to “Choose Your Own Adventure”-type ads. Further, this latest sound partner expansion comes a week after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">announced a slate of new brand partners</a> for TikTok Shopping, including Square, Ecwid and PrestaShop. TikTok plans to add Wix, SHOPLINE, OpenCart and BASE soon.</p>
<p>The platform is among several digital giants looking for ways to help brands reach more audiences and connect better with users with a differentiated feature set. For instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/pinterest-rolls-out-new-shopping-features-for-advertisers/">Pinterest rolled out new shopping features</a> for brands earlier this week aimed at getting users to purchase more items at once. Additionally, YouTube made ads on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/youtube-making-ads-on-connected-tvs-more-shoppable/">connected TVs more shoppable</a> earlier this week to help advertisers drive more online sales and grow their businesses. As digital companies continue their push into e-commerce, they&#8217;re finding ways to keep both brands and users engaged on their platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The outlook for managed services providers (MSPs) remains positive, as increasing complexity and security concerns — driven by the work-from-anywhere environment and high-profile hacking incidents — have moved IT management from being a cost center to a core strategic priority for the C-suite.</p>
<p>A key driver of the growth of such providers is the fact that the requisite skills needed to manage and secure complex IT environments are in high demand, making it difficult for many businesses to develop and maintain internal IT teams that are up to the task.</p>
<p>As a result, an increasing number of companies will continue to outsource some, or all, of their IT management to highly skilled managed service providers. Some industry insiders estimate that only 30%-40% of the managed services market has been penetrated, so there is a huge gap that MSPs can fill.</p>
<p>Private equity investors have taken notice of these tailwinds and many are highly interested in investing in the sector, which will fuel the currently ongoing consolidation.</p>
<p>MSPs have all the ingredients that private equity loves — a strong demand trend, low risk of obsolescence, a &#8220;sticky&#8221; service that attracts long-term customers and high recurring revenues, strong cash flow margins and a relatively &#8220;asset-light&#8221; business. In addition, with approximately <a href="https://www.mspresources.org/blog/how-many-msps-in-the-us-and-worldwide">40,000</a> MSPs in the U.S. [as of 2019], the industry remains very fragmented, leaving massive opportunities for private equity players to build large companies via acquisitions.</p>
<p>Many private equity firms are already invested in the sector. Cowen tracks approximately 50 private equity-owned MSPs, many of which have already acquired other MSPs. The table below shows a few such private equity-backed MSPs that are expected to be catalysts for continued consolidation in the sector. Most of these firms have already completed multiple acquisitions.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Having spent time in the trenches with many startups, I’ve been lucky to see why many growth marketing engines don’t work correctly. I say I’m lucky because the issues I’ve seen have taught me an immense amount about what makes a well-oiled, polished growth marketing engine fire on all cylinders. My experience at Postmates taught me more through mistakes than triumphs, and I learned how to correctly scale a growth engine while marching us toward an exit.</p>
<p>A common thread of mistakes connects most startups that try their hand at growth marketing. Some frequent errors include performance metrics not being correctly measured, product and growth teams working in silos, low testing velocity and failure to consider the entire marketing funnel.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there aren’t unique problems at each startup. I&#8217;m only saying that there a few that are ubiquitous.</p>
<h2>Low testing velocity</h2>
<p>The day is far in the future when you&#8217;ll be able to flip a switch for paid acquisition, lifecycle, social media and content, and have all of it run automatically. Until that day arrives, the need to continue testing is paramount.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2215221" style="width: 892px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215221" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2215221 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png" alt="A visualization of how a “rapid testing” framework can accelerate CAC reductions." width="882" height="700" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png 882w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png?resize=150,119 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png?resize=300,238 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png?resize=768,610 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png?resize=680,540 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2215221" class="wp-caption-text">A visualization of how a “rapid testing” framework can accelerate CAC reductions. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jonathan Martinez</p></div></p>
<p>It’s simple: Test more and the results will come to fruition sooner. While the concept is simple, you will need a proper testing framework — one that defines the number and type of weekly tests that are being deployed. A sample weekly test plan can look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paid acquisition: Two creative concepts x three copy iterations = six creative assets.</li>
<li>Lifecycle: Two copy variations x five emails = 10 email variations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a testing framework and, most importantly, stick to it. The results will follow.</p>
<h2>Reliance on incorrect measurements</h2>
<p>When measuring the success of a campaign, whether on social media for paid acquisition or with a retention series on lifecycle, it’s vital to have the correct metrics before taking action — this is the foundational pillar of any growth marketing stack.</p>
<p>But what if your performance metrics are inaccurate? And if they are, why? I’ve listed the top three reasons for not having correct metrics below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attribution source.</li>
<li>Attribution loss.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An environmental document that needs U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approval before SpaceX can begin testing the world&#8217;s largest rockets is missing key details about where its fuel will come from, experts say.</p>
<p>The draft programmatic environmental assessment (PEA) for SpaceX&#8217;s Starship and Super Heavy launch vehicles, which Elon Musk hopes will soon be shooting into orbit and then on to Mars, was issued last month by the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/">FAA for public comment</a>. The 142-page document covers construction and daily operations at SpaceX&#8217;s Boca Chica facility in Texas, which Musk is hoping to incorporate as a city called Starbase. These include pre-flight operations, rocket tests, launches and landings, as well as fuel, water and electricity supplies.</p>
<p>A new pre-treatment system will purify and cool natural gas into liquid methane fuel for the Starship and Super Heavy rockets. Much more gas will be needed for a new 250-megawatt gas-fired power station. A power plant this big typically serves over 100,000 homes and can <a href="https://www.powermag.com/new-michigan-gas-fired-plant-will-replace-existing-coal-plant/">cost hundreds of millions of dollars</a>. But while rocket launches get a lot of coverage in the PEA, the new power plant receives only a cursory mention. In particular, it is unclear how the <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1209/ML120960701.pdf">tens of millions of cubic feet of gas</a> required daily will get to SpaceX&#8217;s remote facility near the Mexican border.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215332" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Failing to mention this in the PEA is unusual, and possibly contravenes the federal National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), says Pat Parenteau, professor of law and senior counsel in the Environmental Advocacy Clinic at Vermont Law School.</p>
<p>&#8220;NEPA is what we call the look-before-you-leap law,&#8221; Parenteau said. &#8220;It&#8217;s designed to inform federal decision-makers about the environmental impacts of their actions and ways to avoid them.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pipeline is the usual way to transport natural gas to a power station. A<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">n official at a federal agency told TechCrunch that earlier this year SpaceX inquired about reusing a defunct natural gas pipeline running through the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They want to reactivate the pipeline for transporting methane via pipeline rather than by truck as they do now,&#8221; wrote the official, who asked not to be named.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, that pipeline was permanently abandoned in 2016, according to the official <a href="https://gis.rrc.texas.gov/GISViewer/">and state records</a>. The official told TechCrunch that the defunct pipeline now houses fiber optic cable for a University of Texas Rio Grande Valley internet connection.</p>
<p>Trucking in enough natural gas to support both a large power plant and regular rocket launches would be a considerable undertaking. It would require thousands of tanker deliveries every year, according to one engineer TechCrunch spoke to.</p>
<p>SpaceX has even suggested that it would be interested in drilling for gas itself, as first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/spacex-plans-to-drill-for-natural-gas-next-to-texas-launchpad">reported by Bloomberg</a> earlier this year. In a dispute over the ownership of some abandoned gas wells, the company later wrote: &#8220;SpaceX [has] a unique ability to utilize natural gas with different economic incentives that do not depend on transportation or sale to gas markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regardless of which method SpaceX opts for, the environmental impact should have been disclosed in the PEA, according to Parenteau.</p>
<p>&#8220;Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas and the courts have said, whenever you&#8217;re proposing a project that involves methane, you have to look all the way back to the wells, at distribution through pipelines, and at the downstream effects where the gas is burned,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://esghound.substack.com/p/spacex-2-the-gang-solves-the-gas">blog of an environmental engineer</a> who has been studying the Starbase, the PEA also makes no mention of other equipment that would be typical for gas power stations and gas treatment plants, including a thermal oxidizer, ammonia storage tanks and gas flare. All of these have environmental impacts, including a carbon footprint and air pollution.</p>
<p>The FAA provided the following statement: &#8220;The draft assessment was written in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and other applicable environmental laws and regulations.&#8221;</p>
<p>SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment, but Musk did refer to the company&#8217;s reliance on fossil fuels at a Tesla shareholders&#8217; meeting on Thursday. &#8220;People say a carbon tax would benefit Tesla,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Yeah, but it would hurt SpaceX.'&#8221; He then noted that (atmospheric) methane eventually breaks down into carbon dioxide. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry too much about methane,&#8221; he concluded.</p>
<p>Although the gas power station&#8217;s exact location is still uncertain, it will be about 5.4 acres in size, have structures up to 150 feet tall, and operate continuously year-round, day and night. There is also a small (1 megawatt) solar farm that SpaceX hopes to expand, according the PEA report<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>SpaceX needs the gas power station to run a new desalination plant that will produce the millions of gallons of fresh water needed annually for sound and fire suppression during launches. Large amounts of electricity will also be used to make liquid oxygen from the air.</p>
<p>NEPA is not the only federal rule that applies. A 250-megawatt power station would normally qualify as a major new source of air pollution under the Clean Air Act, according to Parenteau and another expert. This would trigger another lengthy environmental review.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than 50 years after NEPA [was enacted], I&#8217;m pretty surprised to see an agency doing this,&#8221; Parenteau said. &#8220;Perhaps they&#8217;re hoping that nobody notices?&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the close of the public comment period on November 1, the FAA will either issue a final PEA that will clear SpaceX to proceed &#8212; subject to the FAA&#8217;s safety findings &#8212; or declare its intent to prepare a much more detailed Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which usually takes years to prepare.</p>
<p>If the final PEA does not appear to meet the requirements of NEPA or the Clean Air Act, local community or environmental organizations could sue to force the FAA to prepare an EIS, potentially delaying a Starship orbital launch further.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.productfy.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Productfy Inc.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that aims to build “DeFi for traditional finance,” has raised $16 million in a Series A round of funding led by CM Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Point72 Ventures, 500 Startups and Envestnet | Yodlee also participated in the financing, which brings its total raised since its 2018 inception to nearly $19 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a growing number of BaaS companies, which all essentially have the same end goal &#8212; to make it faster and easier for fintechs and other companies to launch financial services and products. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215382" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Productfy aims to stand out with its mission to build DeFi for traditional finance, according to founder and CEO Duy Vo. From a product architecture standpoint, Productfy has been built “from the ground up,” he said, to operate with multiple banking partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not something our competitors are built for,” Vo said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional banks will not last if they can&#8217;t decentralize.” (More on this topic later.)</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QDQwVQ2Vni"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/who-needs-a-baas-partner-anyway/">Who needs a BaaS partner, anyway?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Who needs a BaaS partner, anyway?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/who-needs-a-baas-partner-anyway/embed/#?secret=QDQwVQ2Vni" data-secret="QDQwVQ2Vni" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put more simply, Productfy wants to be the “Shopify of embedded finance.” The company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> claims that with its platform, developers can “configure in hours, integrate in days, and go from idea to full stack deployment in as little as three weeks.”  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Productfy, unlike many other BaaS companies, is not just focused on developers. Its team is building beyond the API layer to produce more white label user interfaces. So while the company, of course, wants to be robust for developers, Vo says it is even more focused on brands that lack technical resources or domain expertise. Since July, the startup has seen 119% month over month revenue growth. It currently has eight clients, including HatchCard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CM Ventures evaluated a number of BaaS and embedded finance companies and had discussions with around “30 different players” before deciding to place its bet on Productfy, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vagan Khranyan, managing partner of lead investor CM Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We concluded that Productfy has the only market-ready solution to be sold to customers,” Khranyan told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see massive parallels in what Productfy is building and larger movements in distributed and decentralized finance across the industry.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, he said, is working to simplify an otherwise complicated process with multiple bank partners, data and card vendors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Productify’s partners include Equifax, card issuing platform Marqeta, card fulfillment partner Arroweye and financial data provider Envestnet | Yodlee. The startup has also teamed up with Stearns Bank National Association as it works on developing “expanded access” to money movement, digital banking and card issuance products “via easily embeddable APIs, widgets and pre-approved customer interfaces.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Productfy platform is unlike any we’ve seen in the market,” said Josh Hofer, chief risk and information security officer of Stearns Bank. “Aligning our technology roadmap with the Productfy platform enables both companies to succeed by making banking products more accessible and scalable for the entire ecosystem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the startup says that its partnership with Stearns Bank gives fintech entrepreneurs and non-fintech businesses a way to launch money movement and card programs with stacked workflows and unified due diligence, “eliminating months of development, compliance hurdles, and third-party integrations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been building our basic infrastructure and compliance and technology,” Vo told TechCrunch. “When we launched these programs, we learned a ton. Now, we’re taking those learnings to build the next iteration of our product, which will essentially be a white label ‘fintech in a box’ solution, which will allow any organization to launch a financial product or retail banking experience within days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vo says he was motivated to start Productfy because he believed that the financial services industry has “largely failed the most vulnerable people in our society.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re always asking ourselves how can we create a financial ecosystem that is kinder, more compassionate and more socially just,” Vo said. “The way that we believe that we can solve this problem is to create a decentralized financial infrastructure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He emphasizes that while DeFi has traditionally been associated with cryptocurrency, his startup has “nothing to do with cryptocurrency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re creating a DeFi for traditional banking,” Vo told TechCrunch.” Because banks are the origin servers, and if AWS can dynamically route traffic based on usage, that takes power away from users and spreads it around to small banks and the organizations that work with end users.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vo’s goal is that if this can be nailed down in the U.S., Productfy could add a node in countries such as Uganda and Libya and create the “first true distributed financial infrastructure” that would allow for near-instant funds transfers, for example, “easily, securely and at less than a penny globally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the startup will use its new influx of capital to further scale its offerings and compliance-as-a-service capabilities and continue improving its core data and card issuance offering, with a focus on building new integrations and partnerships and launching its first cohort of customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the fourth quarter, Productfy plans to launch a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new Card-Issuance-as-a-Service solution, dubbed “Latinum,” aimed at helping brands improve their customer experience and build greater loyalty. The idea around the branded debit card is to give say, members of a church congregation, the ability to use a card where the interchange fees would be used to lend money to fellow congregation members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Productfy’s target is to allow brands to go live in as little as three weeks. Today, they still have to have an engineering team to do that. But by the fourth quarter, Vo says, they won’t need engineering or compliance teams because its white-label solution will be available. And the process will only take days, the company claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re moving the ability to offer retail banking services to the edge,” Vo said. So that religious organizations, schools, gaming companies, e-commerce brands or any organization with “a strong following” can launch a debit card program with deposits, money movement, KYC (Know Your Customer), compliance and servicing built in.</span></p>
<p>Other BaaS companies that have raised capital this year include Unit, which in June raked in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/unit-raises-51m-in-accel-led-series-b-to-grow-its-banking-as-a-service-platform/">$51 million in a Series B round</a> to further its goal of making it possible for companies and fintechs alike to build banking products “in minutes.” In July, Solarisbank, a Berlin startup that provides a range of financial services by way of some 180 APIs that others use to build end-user-facing products, raised $224 million at a $1.65 billion valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has said it will provide 10,000 &#8220;high-risk&#8221; users with free hardware security keys, days after the company warned thousands of Gmail users that they were targeted by state-sponsored <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/hackers/">hackers</a>.</p>
<p>The warning, sent by Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), alerted more than 14,000 Gmail users that they had been targeted in a state-sponsored <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a> campaign from APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, said to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/justice-department-charges-fancy-bear-hacking/">made up of operatives</a> of Russia&#8217;s GRU intelligence agency. Fancy Bear has been active for more than a decade but it&#8217;s widely known for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/14/dnc-discovers-russian-hackers-yearlong-access-to-data/">hacking into the Democratic National Committee</a> and its disinformation and election influencing campaign in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>&#8220;These warnings indicate targeting not compromise. If we are warning you there&#8217;s a very high chance we blocked,&#8221; Google&#8217;s TAG director Shane Huntley <a href="https://twitter.com/ShaneHuntley/status/1446103822250565638">wrote in a Twitter thread</a> on Thursday. &#8220;The increased numbers this month come from a small number of widely targeted campaigns which were blocked.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215346" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Huntley added that these warnings are normal for individuals such as activists, journalists and government officials because that’s who government-backed entities target. &#8220;If you are an activist/journalist/government official or work in [national security], this warning honestly shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise. At some point some [government] backed entity probably will try to send you something,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Google said <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/delivering-10000-security-keys-high-risk-users/">in a blog post</a> that it will send out the security keys throughout 2021 to encourage users to enroll in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/googles-advanced-protection-program-for-high-risk-users-now-includes-malware-protection/">its Advanced Protection Program (APP)</a>, which safeguards users with high visibility and sensitive information who are at risk of targeted online attacks. Security keys make it harder for phishing attacks to work as security keys can only be used to unlock accounts on legitimate websites.</p>
<p>Additionally, Google also announced new and extended partnerships with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), UN Women and nonprofit Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) in order to shore up security for its most at-risk users.</p>
<p>Through its collaboration with the latter, Google said it has already provided Titan Security Keys to more than 180 eligible federal campaigns during the 2020 U.S. election season, adding that it is now working with the organization to provide further protection for state-level campaigns and political parties, committees and related organizations including workshops and training on how to protect against cyberattacks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we get into our dive into Q3 2021 venture capital numbers, one region in particular has our attention: Europe.</p>
<p>While venture capital gains in markets like India, Latin America and the larger African startup ecosystem have proved impressive, Europe has posted strong results of its own. A string of recent exits from European startup hubs makes its performance all the more intriguing.</p>
<p>New data indicates that France’s startup market is posting record totals in terms of dollars raised. CB Insights <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">counts nearly $8 billion invested into French startups in the last two quarters</a>, with the totals roughly split between the two periods. For comparison, that two-quarter figure is billions more than French startups raised in all of 2020.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>Throw in notable IPOs, including <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/truecaller-opens-with-15-4-pop-on-its-stockholm-trading-debut-7559081.html">Truecaller this morning</a>, and you have to keep at least one eye on Europe.</p>
<p>Our perspective on the matter is hardly unique: Techstars <a href="https://siliconcanals.com/news/startups/techstars-launches-accelerators/">recently announced</a> two new programs on the continent, one in France and one in Sweden, indicating that it too sees lots to like in Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The Exchange wanted to know why the global accelerator group picked those two markets over others, how the group is approaching the amount of cash it offers for shares, if there are enough founders in Europe to fill even more accelerator batches and whether the area has the follow-on capital that it needs to support pre-seed and other early-stage startups.</p>
<p>So, we got on the phone with Techstars CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/MaelleGavet">Maëlle Gavet</a> to dig into her company’s decision. Let’s talk Europe!</p>
<h2>Why Techstars picked Paris, Stockholm</h2>
<p>According to Techstars, its Paris accelerator will operate two classes per year, while Stockholm will run once in 2022 and twice per year from 2023 onward. This comes in addition to the programs it already runs in other European cities: London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Oslo and Turin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest is launching a new &#8220;Pinterest Havens&#8221; mental health support initiative in honor of World Mental Health Day, which is October 10th. In a <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-and-world-mental-health-day-introducing-havens-search-trends-community-giving-and">blog post</a>, the company called the initiative “an online and offline space for community-driven inspiration.” Pinterest notes that it’s essentially creating space on its platform to explore the relationship between mental health and rest.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Haven&#8221; will include a collection of relaxing imagery and Idea Pins about rest from Pinterest creators to help users reboot and recharge. The collection includes things like images of waterfalls, journal prompts, bedtime affirmations and more. Pinterest’s internal mental health community, Pinside Out, curated the collection within Haven.</p>
<p>Pinterest also announced that it’s commissioning its first real-life installation titled &#8220;Havens: Invest in Rest,&#8221; located within Boxville on Chicago’s South Side. The site-specific installation aims to bring the anti-burnout oasis to life through actual physical Pins, immersive art and community programming. Pinterest says the installation works alongside the online Havens community board to encourage viewers to take a breath and focus on their well-being.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215375" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To support the installation, Pinterest is donating $80,000 to three local organizations: Boundless Early Education, Urban Juncture Foundation and Coffee, Hip Hop &amp; Mental Health. The donations will be provided through the Pinterest Charitable Fund.</p>
<p>Pinterest notes that its compassionate search feature, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/pinterest-wellness/">launched in 2019</a>, continues to serve as a way for users to find helpful resources and activities if they’re feeling stressed, anxious or sad when searching for terms related to emotional well-being. The feature surfaces wellness activities when users search for things like “stress quotes” and “work anxiety.”</p>
<p>The guided wellness activities were created with the help of experts at Brainstorm, the Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation, and with advice from Vibrant Emotional Health and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The feature is currently available in the U.S., U.K., Ireland, Canada, Australia, Singapore, India, the Philippines, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Brazil and Germany.</p>
<p>Further, Pinterest notes that users can “visit the ‘daily inspiration’ space of the search tab to find how Pinterest Creators are investing in rest, and how emotional wellbeing can look different to everyone. Journaling, meditating, walking, dancing, drawing and more, are all activities that can support our emotional wellbeing and mental health.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These announcements come as Pinterest says it has seen an increase in users coming to the platform for inspiration around increased emotional well-being and positivity. For instance, searches for ‘Sunday rest routine’ have increased 7x over the past year, while searches for &#8220;destressing tips&#8221; have increased 12.7x. The company says it aims to create a space for reflection on how mental health can impact us all globally.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann </a>and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> were all aboard this week with <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> on the dials, which meant that we had a flat lovely time recording Equity for you. Of course, Equity is TechCrunch&#8217;s venture capital focused podcast where we dig into the most critical funding rounds, and natter about the key news items impacting startups.</p>
<p>Before we hop into this week&#8217;s topics, you can follow the show on Twitter, where we rather often host impromptu Twitter spaces that sometimes become episodes. Come hang!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215171" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s the rundown for this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/chalo-raises-40-million-to-digitize-bus-commutes-in-india/">Chalo raises $40M to improve bus transit in India</a><b>: </b>This startup wins name (and startup) of the week. Chalo wants to tackle inefficiencies in India&#8217;s bus system, so we noodle over why that makes sense and what challenges could be ahead.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/masterworks-raises-110m-to-push-fractional-shares-of-physical-art-not-nfts-into-investor-portfolios/">Masterworks raises $110M for fractional art ownership</a>:</strong> Call it a Series A if you must, but the mega-round that Masterworks just raised helps underscore the global shift toward alternative investing, and fractional ownership. How long until we get Masterworks on the blockchain? That would be the real IRL-NFT crossover we are kinda waiting for.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/y-combinator-backed-costcertified-lands-8-45m-to-build-the-amazon-for-construction/">CostCertified wants to save your next home reno project</a>: </strong>CostCertified, which just participated in Y Combinator&#8217;s summer cohort, raised $8.45 million in seed funding. The Canadian company&#8217;s end goal is to build the “Amazon for construction.” CostCertified allows contractors to send a shoppable interactive estimate to homeowners so that they can choose their selections during a project, and see the effect on price instantly.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/contrary-capitals-20m-fund-ii-is-all-about-community-first-investments/">All about community</a>: </strong>Community has been watered down, there&#8217;s no doubt about it. But, there are still arguments for why it works &#8212; and we make them (often).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/">Google invests in Africa</a>: </strong>American tech giant Google is putting capital to work in Africa, but in the form of infra investment and early-stage investing. Frankly both make good sense, given the advertising giant&#8217;s business model.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/udemy-files-to-go-public-on-back-of-growing-b2b-incomes/">Edtech goes B2B</a>:</strong> Udemy is going public! We have dug through the numbers already, but thankfully with Natasha on the show we got to go a level deeper on where edtech revenues may come from next.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s our show! We are back bright and early on Monday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pets continue to be big business, and <a href="http://www.alphapaw.com/">Alpha Paw</a> is the latest to draw investor attention. The Austin-based company raised $8 million in Series A funding, led by Nordic Eye, after bootstrapping for the past three years.</p>
<p>CEO Ramon van Meer took over the company in 2018 via an acquisition and is working with his 11-year-old son, Victor. At the time, Alpha Paw was a small company developing pet ramps for dogs that had trouble jumping up or down from sofas. It was relaunched in 2019 in the pet wellness area.</p>
<p>“We have a vision of helping pets lead healthier and longer lives,” van Meer told TechCrunch. “We wanted to create wellness products, similar to our human lifestyles, and to keep healthy, it is about nutrition and supplements.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2213798" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2213800" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213800" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2213800" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ramon-Victor.png" alt="Alpha Paw" width="741" height="775" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ramon-Victor.png 741w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ramon-Victor.png?resize=143,150 143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ramon-Victor.png?resize=287,300 287w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ramon-Victor.png?resize=650,680 650w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ramon-Victor.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ramon-Victor.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213800" class="wp-caption-text">Alpha Paw&#8217;s Victor and Ramon van Meer. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alpha Paw</p></div></p>
<p>Driven in part by the global pandemic, people spent more time with their pets in the past few years and a trend emerged of pet parents applying their ideas of health and wellness to their pets. Indeed, the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210514005425/en/Global-Pet-Supplement-Market-2021-to-2027---by-Pet-Application-Source-and-Distribution-Channel---ResearchAndMarkets.com">global pet supplement market</a> was valued at nearly $600 million in 2019 and poised to top $820 million by 2027. This comes as Americans spent nearly <a href="https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2020-04-15/annual-spending-pets-nearing-100b">$100 billion</a> on their pets last year, according to the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/american-pet-products-association">American Pet Products Association</a>.</p>
<p>Alpha Paw offers pet products for dogs and cats like food and supplements that are customized with pet breed in mind. There will soon be a subscription box service that includes food and nutritional supplementary toppings to mix in for ailments like allergies or hip and joint issues. The box will also include an edible item for dental care. And, since Alpha Paw knows the breed, weight of the pet and what the target weight should be, it will also include a personalized regime for daily exercise and play.</p>
<p>The company had $20 million in sales last year and is projected this year to do $35 million in sales, van Meer said. It is also about giving back: His son, Victor, is big on charity, and so for every product purchased, Alpha Paw donates meals to shelter dogs across the country. To date, it has donated more than 500,000 meals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new capital will fund customer acquisition growth, product expansion and general expansion, including internationally. It will also help to build up its community of pet parents on social media. Users have built breed-specific communities where they interact with each other, and ask questions of each other and veterinarians.</p>
<p>Peter Warnøe, general partner of Nordic Eye, said he was watching the pet industry for a while and saw it increase in valuation as more startups got into it.</p>
<p>“We all know the space has gone up since COVID, and most dogs live over a decade, so this is not a trend, but really something sustainable,” he added. “The industry is growing a lot because of the importance of dogs and the amount of dogs being added to families. Ramon’s track record in other businesses and what he has done here in two years, it was not hard to decide to invest.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Users can either book someone for podcasts and other events or advertise their willingness to be a guest.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://guestio.com/">Guestio</a> closed on $1.5 million in seed funding for its platform that simplifies the booking process for podcasts.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Travis Chappell said users can go on the platform and book guests for their shows at the click of a button in all kinds of topics and with shows big or small.</p>
<p>Chappell is himself a podcaster, hosting an entrepreneur show called “Build Your Network.” Having done almost 700 episodes over the past several years, he found that in the process of leveling up the type of guest he wanted to have on the show became increasingly difficult.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2213740" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/the-podcast-industry-report-statistics/">Podcasting is projected to be a $1 billion industry this year</a>, with more than 118 million Americans tuning in each month in 2021. It&#8217;s no surprise that access to super inaccessible people is a challenge, but seeing the success of apps like Cameo, Chappell thought there could be a better way for podcasters.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0zh9AcCQOJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/spotifys-podcast-creation-tool-anchor-gains-access-to-the-companys-larger-audio-ad-network/">Spotify&#8217;s podcast creation tool Anchor gains access to the company&#8217;s larger audio ad network</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spotify&#8217;s podcast creation tool Anchor gains access to the company&#8217;s larger audio ad network&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/spotifys-podcast-creation-tool-anchor-gains-access-to-the-companys-larger-audio-ad-network/embed/#?secret=0zh9AcCQOJ" data-secret="0zh9AcCQOJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He launched Guestio in 2020 as a booking marketplace. Users can go in as a podcaster and book someone for a number of different purposes. On the flip side, talent can use the app to book shows and also advertise what they are doing, like having a book coming out and wanting to do a book tour.</p>
<p>Guestio’s current business model retains 20% of the booking fees with the remainder going to the booker or talent. It also launched a new feature that enables guests to charge for marketing the interviews they do and is poised to unveil a new &#8220;mini endorsement&#8221; feature where businesses can buy audio or video endorsements from celebrities to use for things like ad campaigns, Chappell said.</p>
<p>“We are also putting in more subscription tiers so that people who are needing a constant inflow of guests for a show can pay a monthly fee,” he added. “We also are coming out with ‘Guestio credits’ that people can use to book interviews or pitch an idea.”</p>
<p>Backers of the company include angel investors like John Lee Dumas, David Meltzer, Matt Barnes, Joel Marion, Zvi Band, Ross Paquette and Josh Snow.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dumas, founder and host of the “Entrepreneurs on Fire” podcast, said he has known Chappell since 2017, and when he heard the idea for Guestio, wanted to be a part of it. He, too, struggled with accessing highly qualified people to be on his show, while also finding it difficult to vet podcasters to see if they were a right fit.</p>
<p>“This is really for any platform,” he added. “The booking mechanism fits across all platforms, and going forward, as more people are comfortable with the virtual platform, a company like Guestio is going to be at the forefront. They are already a leader in the space right now and one of the first to do this at a high level and will be one that people continue to go for.”</p>
<p>Guestio’s platform has close to 3,000 users and has done close to $200,000 in revenue over the past five months, according to Chappell. He intends to use the new funding to build out the company’s lean workforce, invest in marketing and continue software development.</p>
<p>His next goals are to focus on the talent side of the marketplace to add more features for guests looking to book themselves on shows. Similar booking platforms charge a high dollar amount per appearance on podcasts, but are not transparent about what that entails, he said. Guestio collects data on podcasts, and as a result, is able to provide details on audience and other insights so that talent can make better decisions.</p>
<p>“I’m proud of my team that we have been able to pull off some of these bigger deals and bring revenue into this stage,” Chappell added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Insurance in Kenya and Africa at large remains a marginal product, with levels of penetration across the continent half the world average as a percentage of GDP, and premiums per capita 11-fold lower than the world average, according to a recent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/middle-east-and-africa/africas-insurance-market-is-set-for-takeoff">report</a> by McKinsey and Co. (and that&#8217;s including the outsized market of South Africa; take that out and Africa is even further behind). But economic growth and the rapid expansion of digital and mobile services are set to change all that: the smallest market then looks like the biggest growth opportunity.</p>
<p>That spells an opening for new players. Safaricom, the Kenyan telco that runs the groundbreaking and market-dominant M-Pesa mobile payment platform, has been working on a new insurance product against property damage, theft, and loss of life provisionally called Bima. Yet to be launched, when (and if) it does roll out, it will enter the market alongside a small but growing number of companies entering the field taking more innovative approaches with products that address the needs as well as the limitations of consumers in the region.</p>
<p>The wider picture for insurance startups has so far been a patchy one in Kenya, with penetration in the country currently at less than <a href="https://www.ira.go.ke/images/annual/Insurance%20Industry%20Annual%20Report%202019%20(30.09.2019)%20(2).pdf">3%</a>. But that also leaves room for innovation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2212443" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Add to that the track record being set in the adjacent field of financial services and you get an interesting precedent for how insurance tech might develop. Fintech has shaped up to be a hot area for investment and growth, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flutterwave</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/sequoia-heritage-stripe-and-others-invest-200m-in-african-fintech-wave-at-1-7b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wave</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/kuda-the-african-challenger-bank-raises-55m-at-a-500m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kuda</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/thunes-a-fintech-startup-serving-emerging-markets-raises-60-million-led-by-africa-focused-helio-investment-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thunes</a> all raising massive rounds in the last year at valuations rivaling those of their counterparts in more developed regions, on the heels of great expectations for growth.</p>
<p>In its recent report, McKinsey said a rise in demand for digital solutions, as smartphone and affordable internets penetration deepens across the continent, has provided opportunities for the insurtechs to step in and offer innovative products.</p>
<p>“Competition among players has already led to significant innovation and disruption in the African insurance market, with insurers leveraging technology to target specific segments or services and cut costs,” it said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Innovative products launching across the continent appear to be more customer-centric, allowing micro-payments, flexible sign-ups and access to a wide range of services through mobile phones. Among those that are making it easier for clients to access and afford insurance services is Kenya’s Griffin Insurance, which allows clients to access all services through its mobile app, pay for car coverage in installments and pause coverage when they travel overseas. The insurance firm is a sister-company to Lami technologies, which raised $1.8 million in May this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/kenyas-lami-raises-1-8m-to-scale-api-insurance-platform-across-africa/">to scale API insurance platform across Africa</a>.</p>
<p>Startups like Bima, also named like Safaricom&#8217;s product, offer other services like telemedicine that complement their core insurance businesses. The mobile-first platform which provides life and health insurance policies, along with telemedicine to support the latter, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/bima-nabs-30m-more-for-micro-health-and-life-insurance-aimed-at-emerging-markets/">raised $30 million</a> last year to build micro-insurance and healthcare services targeting the emerging markets. The startup was founded in Europe but is active primarily across seven countries in Asia and in Ghana, Tanzania and Senegal in Africa. It targets people earning less that $10 a day, and targets to have at least 75% of its clients as first-time policyholders.</p>

<p>South Africa-based Pineapple is another growing insurtech that offers mobile-based services reducing paperwork and the need for office visits to sign up or process claims, aligning itself with the fast-changing customer behavior. The firm, which recently extended its range of services to include car insurance, now provides its customers full-fledged insurance coverage &#8212; all underwritten by Old Mutual.</p>
<p>Insurtech opportunities in sectors such as agriculture are also developing, with startups such as Oko, which operates in Mali and Uganda, providing automated insurance products based on satellite data and mobile payments. The startup, which raised $1.2 million earlier this year, derisks farmers affected by extreme weather events like drought and floods.</p>
<p>Even Safaricom has already started some early moves into the space, in the form of a <a href="https://www.safaricom.co.ke/home/insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home insurance product</a> covering items like electronics and furniture that it offers in partnership with Jubilee Insurance, a Kenyan underwriter. The service &#8212; which users can register and pay for via USSD (the mobile technology that is used for a variety of data services in Africa, which bypasses needing costly mobile data plans by relying on more basic 2G network) &#8212; offers insurance covers that cost up to $13 a month with a maximum payout of $10,000. (It seems that Safaricom&#8217;s yet-to-launch insurance service might take a different and more direct approach to how the product is offered to the market, which may be why it requires more regulatory and other approvals for the telco.)</p>
<p>Yet it is not all smooth sailing for insurance providers, and for those that might want to move deeper into that space.</p>
<p>Safaricom &#8212; leveraging its 39.9 million mobile subscribers in Kenya as of March of this year and a hugely sticky service already in full swing in the form of a payments service &#8212; would jump into that pool with a splash, although it&#8217;s not clear if it will be swimming at all at this point: the company&#8217;s insurance service entered a regulatory approval process back in December 2020 and a spokesperson declined to give a timeline for a commercial launch.</p>
<p>Safaricom launching a new insurance effort underscores how the telco continues to look for ways to diversify away from its traditional voice, data and messaging services.</p>
<p>It outlined the roll-out of new services in the latest Sustainable Business <a href="https://www.safaricom.co.ke/images/Downloads/Safaricom_2021_Sustainable_Business_Report.pdf">Report</a> published a fortnight ago. The company also recently launched a video on-demand service dubbed Baze that enables online content creators to monetize their content, and subscribers to access content for a daily charge of up to $0.18. The service rivals streaming services such as Netflix, Showmax (a South African service) and Amazon Prime Video, that remain out of reach to most smart-phone owners due to cost.</p>
<p>The telecom said in the report that it is also exploring new growth opportunities in agriculture, education, healthcare, next generation financial services, regional expansion as well as in micro and small medium enterprises (MSMEs).</p>
<p>“Going forward we will endeavor to play a key role in driving healthcare and education inclusion as well as enabling smallholder farmers to become wealthier and commercially sustainable,” said Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa in a statement.</p>
<p>Already Safaricom runs DigiFarm, a service where farmers access farm inputs at discounted prices. DigiFarm also links farmers to the market, and provides loans for farming activities and learning materials. Safaricom says that the platform has 14,000 active members.</p>
<p>In line with the telecom’s plans to grow its revenue streams and expand regionally, a Safaricom-led consortium was in May this year formally granted one of the licenses to operate in Ethiopia by the Ethiopian Communications Authority. The consortium comprised of Vodafone Group and its member <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/loon-signs-deal-to-expand-commercial-internet-service-to-mozambique/">Vodacom</a>, Japan’s conglomerate Sumitomo Corporation, and CDC Group will commercially launch its services in Ethiopia next year. It said that Ethiopia will open a new market of 4 million SMEs and a population projected to to hit <a href="https://www.healthpolicyproject.com/pubs/724_ProjectingEthiopian.pdf">130 million by 2030</a>.</p>
<p>Safaricom is well known as the company behind M-Pesa, the mobile-money service that enables its customers to send and receive money, as well as to pay utility bills using just their phone numbers, turning it into a kind of proxy for a bank account for the millions of &#8220;unbanked&#8221; residents of the region. The service recently surpassed voice to become Safaricom’s top earner after the platform’s revenues hit $745 million for the financial year ending in March.</p>
<p>M-Pesa customers also have access to Fuliza, an overdraft service, and can borrow short-term loans through third-party services integrated in the M-Pesa app. M-Pesa could serve as an anchor for the raft of new services that are coming online, from insurance to infinity: to market the new products, Safaricom can tap its 28.3 million active mobile money customers in Kenya, turning the service into a kind of &#8220;super app&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.graneet.fr">Graneet</a>, a French startup that just raised a $2.8 million seed round (€2.4 million) led by <a href="https://www.pointnine.com">Point Nine</a> and <a href="https://foundamental.com">Foundamental</a>. Graneet is a vertical software-as-a-service startup focused on the construction industry and the myriad small and medium companies in this industry specifically.</p>
<p>It wants to build the definitive financial management solution so that construction companies can better control their projects. The vast majority of construction companies still rely on multiple Excel files, which leads to information silos and cumbersome data entry tasks. Other investors include Jack Newton, Renaud Visage, Alexandre Guinefolleau, Arthur Waller, Philippe Gelis and the founders of Colonies.</p>
<p>The mother of Graneet’s co-founder and CEO Jean-Gabriel Niel has been leading a construction company. “She would tell me ‘this is crazy, I can’t figure out whether I’m going to gain or lose money for one out of two construction projects,’ ” he told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215051" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He spent some time looking at this company’s internal processes — order processing, billing management, you name it. And that’s when he realized that Microsoft Excel was still the leading solution.</p>
<p>With Graneet, the company thinks it needs to solve three basic things — quotes, billing and resource planning. The startup first started working on billing. Graneet acts as a single source of truth where you can see how much your client is supposed to pay, how much you’ve received so far and what’s next. You can see if there are any outstanding invoices and mark them as paid.</p>
<p>The company then started working on quotes and lead generation. Graneet lets you create quotes directly from the platform. Once the client has approved your quote, you can go back when your construction project is well on its way and enter a percentage of completion — this is a key metric in this industry.</p>
<p>Finally, with today’s funding round, Graneet wants to develop the third part of its product, which is resource planning. Soon, you’ll be able to manage subcontractors from Graneet and divide an invoice into multiple parts for multiple contractors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Graneet clients will be able to invite subcontractors to the platform. They won’t be able to see everything, but they’ll be able to see what they’re working on. Similarly, if you’re a Graneet client and you work for a bigger company as a subcontractor, you’ll be able to send monthly progress reports. That should definitely help when it comes to finding new clients for the product.</p>
<p>Later down the road, Graneet thinks it can also offer more services to its existing customers. For instance, many construction companies work with factoring companies — these companies buy outstanding invoices and pay them right away for cash flow reasons. Graneet could also provide advance payments on the platform directly.</p>
<p>That’s just one example of how Graneet could be helpful. The idea is that construction companies are currently under-equipped when it comes to software solutions. If Graneet can prove that it can fill that gap, there will be a lot of product opportunities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of high-profile investors are chasing to invest in Slice, a fintech startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/27/slice-raises-20-million-to-go-after-credit-card-industry-in-india/">attempting to expand the market for credit cards in India</a>.</p>
<p>Tiger Global is in advanced stages of talks to lead a round of over $100 million in the Bangalore-based startup, sources familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>A number of other firms, including Insight Partners, Ribbit Capital and Greenoaks, are also engaging with the startup, sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215192" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Deliberations are ongoing and the terms can change, sources added.</p>
<p><a href="http://sliceit.com">Slice</a>, which has raised around $30 million in its previous equity financing rounds and was valued at under $200 million in a round earlier this year, declined to comment. Slice counts Blume Ventures, Gunosy Capital and Better Capital among its investors.</p>
<p>Tiger Global declined to comment.</p>
<p>Even as hundreds of millions of Indians today have a bank account, only about 30 million have a credit card. Most people in the South Asian market are not eligible to get a credit card, and even many of those who are don’t bother to get one because the experience of signing up is too clumsy, time consuming and the rewards don’t make up for it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Slice has made it easier for far more people — even those without a traditional full-time job — to get a card, and the signup process is swift. In the past two years, Slice has emerged as one of India’s largest card-issuing firms.</p>
<p>It has also become aggressive to reach potential customers. Last month, the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/indian-fintech-slice-launches-27-credit-limit-cards-to-tap-200-million-users/">launched a card with 2,000 Indian rupees ($27) as the default limit</a> to tap the nation’s potential addressable market of 200 million individuals.</p>
<p>In a separate announcement earlier this week, Slice said it issued 110,000 cards last month. The startup, founded by Flipkart alum Rajan Bajaj, says it has more than 3 million registered members, whose average age is 27.</p>
<p>It is also <a href="https://twitter.com/anmolm_/status/1445338588611166209">exploring</a> applications atop of blockchain, according to Bajaj&#8217;s LinkedIn and the startup&#8217;s recruitment posts. Last week, the firm announced that it is offering new hires a three-day week with steady pay and benefits to attract talent that wishes to work on other opportunities &#8212; or do whatever else they like &#8212; at the same time.</p>
<p>Tiger Global has emerged as the most aggressive growth-stage investor in India in recent quarters. It has backed over two dozen startups in India this year, propelling many of them to the covet unicorn club.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2215265" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215265" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2215265 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-q3-21.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="556" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-q3-21.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-q3-21.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-q3-21.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-q3-21.jpg?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-q3-21.jpg?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-q3-21.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2215265" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: CB Insights</p></div></p>
<p>India&#8217;s startup ecosystem witnessed a record 519 deals in the quarter that ended in September this year, research firm CB Insights <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">said in a report</a> on Thursday. During the same quarter, the startups raised $9.9 billion, compared to $10.3 billion in all of last year, the report said. Sequoia Capital India was the most prolific investor in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market during the quarter with 33 deals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The founders of <a href="https://www.upmesh.io/">Upmesh</a> were building a game on top of Twitch’s API when they realized something about another group of livestreamers. Even though selling through Facebook Live has been gaining popularity in Southeast Asia for years, many vendors are still going through their comments afterward and using pen-and-paper to collect orders. Upmesh was created to automate the checkout process and ultimately wants to create a platform similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/whatnot-raises-another-150m-for-its-livestream-shopping-platform-evolves-into-a-unicorn/">Whatnot</a> where people can discover new live commerce sellers across different social media platforms.</p>
<p>Upmesh announced today it has closed a seed round of $3 million, led by Leo Capital, with participation from Beenext, iSeed, Goto Financial head of merchant financial services Jonathan Barki, BukuWarung founders Abhinay Peddisetty and Chinmay Chauhan, and Zopim founders Royston Tay and Kwok Yang Bin.</p>
<p>Upmesh was launched nine months ago by Wong Zi Yang, Soh Jan, Nhat Vu and Shawn Teow, and is now used by almost 300 live commerce merchants in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. The startup says it processes annualized gross merchandise value of $40 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215283" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The platform’s tools provide e-commerce functions that automatically capture orders made in livestream comments (for example “white top +1”), matches it to the right item in a seller’s inventory and sends a checkout link to the customer. Upmesh currently works with Facebook Live, but will add other platforms, too, with the goal of becoming platform-agnostic.</p>

<p>Other companies that provide order-capturing tools for live commerce include CommentSold, Dibsly, Soldie and Buy It Live, but Upmesh’s founders say one of its most important differentiators is tailoring its platform to meet the expectations of sellers and customers in different Southeast Asian countries.</p>
<p>“If you look at the live selling climate in Southeast Asia, the way people are collecting orders between each country is very different,” said chief executive officer Wong. “Between Singapore and the Philippines, whether you key-in your inventory before or after your live really different, even whether people maintain stock counts is really different.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>For example, he said in Singapore, inventory turnaround is usually very fast, which means even sellers who offer thousands of items only keep stock on the shelf for short periods of time. In the Philippines, however, many vendors do live commerce to supplement their brick-and-mortar shops. Inventory is often taken from their stores and they sell what they have on hand. “The way the software is structured has to be very customized to the individual markets,” Wong said.</p>
<p>Upmesh will use part of its new funding to double down on the Philippines and Malaysia for at least another six months, but it also wants to enter Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. The company plans to increase its headcount, launch marketing campaigns and create educational content for sellers.</p>
<p>Wong notes that even though COVID-19 drove adoption of e-commerce, it isn’t what created interest in live commerce. Many of its clients have been livestreaming for about three years. “The way that people interact with e-commerce is changing. It’s becoming more relationship-driven. In fact, our sellers actually know their buyers on a first name basis, so they can call them out by name when they join their livestream,” said Wong. “It’s actually replacing advertising for small business.”</p>
<p>Most of Upmesh’s user acquisition so far has been through word-of-mouth, and it serves a lot of fashion live sellers, since they are a closely-knit community, said Wong.</p>
<p>Upmesh’s future plans revolve around turning those communities into new ways of making money, creating a platform that will let sellers and buyers interact with each other and discover live commerce videos on different social media platforms.</p>
<p>“If we look at an interesting comparison to the U.S., the U.S. has live commerce platforms like Whatnot, but Whatnot is focused on collectibles and vintage items, things that have a very strong secondary reseller market,” said Wong. “In the U.S., those verticals have the most amount of community, people who are talking to each other on eBay, on YouTube or offline, and they look those communities and gave them a home to be in.”</p>

<p>Southeast Asia, on the other hand, does not have a similar collectibles market, but communities spring up around different types of goods, like fashion or fresh foods. Those are the kinds of verticals that Upmesh wants to add to its platform.</p>
<p>“That’s the end game for live commerce, that you can discover and interact with different sellers and then once you find a seller you like, you can go deeper,” said Wong. “We direct users’ attention to where the goods are, and since we have the inventory of all our sellers, if you want a red dress, we can tell you which sellers have a red dress.”</p>
