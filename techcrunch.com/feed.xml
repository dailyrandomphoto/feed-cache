										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.vantage.sh/">Vantage</a>, a new service that makes managing AWS resources and their associated spend easier, is coming out of stealth today. The service offers its users an alternative to the complex AWS console with <a href="https://www.vantage.sh/features">support</a> for most of the standard AWS services, including EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPCs, ECS and Fargate and Route 53 hosted zones.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s founder, Ben Schaechter, previously worked at AWS and Digital Ocean (and before that, he worked on Crunchbase, too). Yet while <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/digitalocean" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="digitalocean">DigitalOcean <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> showed him how to build a developer experience for individuals and small businesses, he argues that the underlying services and hardware simply weren&#8217;t as robust as those of the hyperclouds. AWS, on the other hand, offers everything a developer could want (and likely more), but the user experience leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095167" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5fe32cd36c40f8efc4e02eca_View-Compute-p-1080.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095167" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2095167" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5fe32cd36c40f8efc4e02eca_View-Compute-p-1080.png" alt="" width="1024" height="826" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5fe32cd36c40f8efc4e02eca_View-Compute-p-1080.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5fe32cd36c40f8efc4e02eca_View-Compute-p-1080.png?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5fe32cd36c40f8efc4e02eca_View-Compute-p-1080.png?resize=300,242 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5fe32cd36c40f8efc4e02eca_View-Compute-p-1080.png?resize=768,619 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5fe32cd36c40f8efc4e02eca_View-Compute-p-1080.png?resize=680,548 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5fe32cd36c40f8efc4e02eca_View-Compute-p-1080.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095167" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vantage</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The idea was really born out of &#8216;what if we could take the user experience of DigitalOcean and apply it to the three public cloud providers, AWS, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gcp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gcp">GCP <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Azure,&#8221; Schaechter told me. &#8220;We decided to start just with AWS because the experience there is the roughest and it&#8217;s the largest player in the market. And I really think that we can provide a lot of value there before we do GCP and Azure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The focus for Vantage is on the developer experience and cost transparency. Schaechter noted that some of its users describe it as being akin to a &#8220;Mint for AWS.&#8221; To get started, you give Vantage a set of read permissions to your AWS services and the tool will automatically profile everything in your account. The service refreshes this list once per hour, but users can also refresh their lists manually.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLYCGFduuv0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Given that it&#8217;s often hard enough to know which AWS services you are actually using, that alone is a useful feature. &#8220;That&#8217;s the number one use case,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What are we paying for and what do we have?&#8221;</p>
<p>At the core of Vantage is what the team calls &#8220;views,&#8221; which allows you to see which resources you are using. What is interesting here is that this is quite a flexible system and allows you to build custom views to see which resources you are using for a given application across regions, for example. Those may include Lambda, storage buckets, your subnet, code pipeline and more.</p>
<p>On the cost-tracking side, Vantage currently only offers point-in-time costs, but Schaechter tells me that the team plans to add historical trends as well to give users a better view of their cloud spend.</p>
<p>Schaechter and his co-founder bootstrapped the company and he noted that before he wants to raise any money for the service, he wants to see people paying for it. Currently, Vantage offers a free plan, as well as paid &#8220;pro&#8221; and &#8220;business&#8221; plans with additional functionality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/eden/">Eden</a>, the office management platform that has raised nearly $70 million since inception, is today making a tweak to its nomenclature to reflect its push into SaaS tools. Henceforth, the startup will be called Eden Workplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a lot of clients in different categories like retail, some industrial and some classic real estate and we wanted to reaffirm that we&#8217;re really building software and a service marketplace for the modern office,&#8221; said cofounder and CEO Joe du Bey. &#8220;We also felt that the company is fundamentally different because of all the SaaS tools that we&#8217;re building, so it acknowledges that there&#8217;s a change in our business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eden also acquired the rights to <a href="https://www.edenworkplace.com/">edenworkplace.com</a>, which du Bey believes will lend more credibility to the brand who is looking to sell into corporations and organizations and IT departments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2095237" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095237" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="240" class="size-large wp-image-2095237" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png 3153w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=300,106 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=768,271 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=680,240 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=1536,541 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=2048,722 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095237" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Eden</p></div></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first evolution for the office management startup.</p>
<p>Eden started out as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/08/eden-raises-2-million-to-expand-on-demand-tech-help-service/">service to help folks troubleshoot tech issues using on-demand specialists</a>. Over time, the company moved into office management services, such as cleanings, repairs, re-stocking, IT help and more. The vertically integrated startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/eden-raises-10-million-series-a-to-build-out-its-office-management-marketplace/">turned into a marketplace</a>, working with multiple vendors to provide services to clients.</p>
<p>In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Eden has had to shift yet again, introducing SaaS products to help people return to and work in their office spaces. That includes the ability to offer COVID-safety questionnaires, track the people coming in and out of the office, alongside tools for visitor management and room booking.</p>

<p>Eden is also introducing a desk reservation system for workers to ensure they can maintain social distancing. This feature was teased at the time of the SaaS launch but is available now to new and existing customers.</p>
<p>Thus far, Eden&#8217;s SaaS tools have been growing revenue by more than 100 percent month over month, and du Bey believes the SaaS side of the business will grow 5x by the end of 2021.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.capchase.com">Capchase</a> is one of this new crop of startup-focused fintech companies. It allows startups to receive their future recurring revenue today in the form of debt, allowing founders to spend future money earlier and potentially avoid at least some of those expensive, dilutive rounds of venture capital, particularly when they are just getting started. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/capchase-raises-4-6m-to-deliver-fast-cash-to-saas-companies/">I profiled the Boston-based company a few months ago</a>, when they had raised a $4.6 million seed led by Caffeinated Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Capchase raises $4.6M to deliver fast cash to SaaS companies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/capchase-raises-4-6m-to-deliver-fast-cash-to-saas-companies/embed/#?secret=zDLxoI9tI2" data-secret="zDLxoI9tI2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, the company is swimming in new funds, and itâs ready to start lending out to even more startups. This morning, the company announced that it has raised $60 million in an âasset-backed credit facilityâ from i80 Group. That should allow <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/capchase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="capchase">Capchase <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to expand the number of startups it works with, as well as the amount of revenue prepayment it could potentially extend to each startup as well.</p>
<p>i80 itself has built an investment firm based around credit underwriting just these sorts of projects for startups. In addition to this facility for Capchase and similar fintech underwriting, the group also backs real estate underwriting projects like for Properly, <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/canadian-real-estate-innovator-properly-announces-100m-financing-from-silicon-valley-bank-and-i80-group-850318563.html">where it co-led a $100 million facility with Silicon Valley Bank</a>.</p>
<p>Capchase, which was founded in early 2020, claims that its initial customers have delayed fundraises by an average of 8 months and saved about 16% in overall dilution. Of course, those number will vary widely depending on the startup, its growth, its recurring revenues and other variables.</p>
<p>Capchaseâs goal isnât just to extend revenue prepayment to startups, but to do it fast, sometimes in just days or even hours depending on the complexity of the recurring revenues of its clients. With $60 million more, itâs hungry to lend even faster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lenovo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lenovo">Lenovo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> keeps rolling out unique takes on familiar categories this year at CES. Last week it was the screen-swiveling all-in-one and some AR glasses, and today (the first official day of the show), the companyâs got an interesting update to last yearâs dual-display ThinkBook Plus.</p>
<p>Like the original, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 2 i sports an e-ink display on the lid. Lenovoâs been experimenting with the technology for a number of form factors, and this one makes more sense than previous shots &#8212; essentially offering up a quick-glance notification center. I suppose you could also use it as an e-reader if you&#8217;re so inclined.</p>
<p>Ultimately, like a lot of what Lenovo does, itâs perhaps more interesting than honestly useful. Though, as ever, points for trying something new. This time out the screen is significantly larger, at about the same size as the primary screen. It now measures 12 inches and sports a 2560 x 1600 resolution (also matching the main screen). The refresh rate has been enhanced, and now itâs possible to run some of the apps on the lid without opening it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The laptop also sports a built-in stylus for use with the touchscreen. Also interesting is the arrival of the new ThinkBook Charging Mat, which uses Energysquareâs Power by Contact to power the battery. The battery itself gets 15 hours on a charge, or 24 if just using the e-ink screen. I suspect charging it up using just the pad is a fairly time-consuming process.</p>
<p>Dell notably introduced its own take on the category back at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 2017.

<p>ThinkBook Plus Gen 2 i arrives this quarter, starting at $1,549. No word on the pricing for the mat accessory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana Labs</a>, the company behind the increasingly popular <a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana">open-source</a> monitoring and observability platform, today announced both an updated version of its cloud service and the launch of a free tier for it.</p>
<p>The free plan for Grafana Cloud has some limitations, but it includes access to virtually all of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/raintank" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="raintank">Grafana Labs&#8217; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tools for monitoring modern applications. In addition, Grafana&#8217;s paid Pro plan for its hosted service is also getting an update and will now include access to five times more metrics per month.</p>
<p>With the free plan, users get a 14-day retention period for metrics and logs, access for up to three team members, 50 GB of log storage and up to 10,000 series for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/prometheus-6f1d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="prometheus-6f1d">Prometheus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Graphite metrics. For Pro plans, those numbers increase to 15,000 series, 13 months of retention for metrics (up from 3,000 previously) and 100 GB of logs with a one-month retention period.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Offering a hosted service is par for the course for open-source companies. For most of them, after all, this is the most obvious way to monetize their tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;The origin story of Grafana Cloud is one of open source,&#8221; the company writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Just like the development of our features, Grafana Cloud was first born from the pains and needs of our open source community. We were looking to give users a quick way to get Grafana up and running. It was a product created out of necessity, and it made sense at the time because itâs what our customers wanted back then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given its open-source origins, the team decided that it made sense to also offer a free plan. In addition, though, adding a free plan will also make it easier for new users to get startedÂ  &#8212; and maybe become paying users over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We are more than seven years into the notion of modern containerization, and it still requires a complex set of tools and a high level of knowledge on how containers work. The <a href="https://github.com/docker-slim/docker-slim">DockerSlim open source project</a> developed several years ago from a desire to remove some of that complexity for developers.</p>
<p><a href="http://Slim.ai">Slim.ai</a>, a new startup that wants to build a commercial product on top of the open source project, announced a $6.6 million seed round today from Boldstart Ventures, Decibel Partners, FXP Ventures and TechAviv Founder Partners.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO John Amaral says he and fellow co-founder and CTO Kyle Quest have worked together for years, but it was Quest who started and nurtured DockerSlim. &#8220;We started coming together around a project that Kyle built called DockerSlim. He&#8217;s the primary author, inventor and up until we started doing this company, the sole proprietor of that of that community,&#8221; Amaral explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time Quest built DockerSlim in 2015, he was working with Docker containers and he wanted a way to automate some of the lower level tasks involved in dealing with them. &#8220;I wanted to solve my own pain points and problems that I had to deal with, and my team had to deal with dealing with containers. Containers were an exciting new technology, but there was a lot of domain knowledge you needed to build production-grade applications and not everybody had that kind of domain expertise on the team, which is pretty common in almost every team,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He originally built the tool to optimize container images, but he began looking at other aspects of the DevOps lifecycle including the author, build, deploy and run phases. He found as he looked at that, he saw the possibility of building a commercial company on top of the open source project.</p>
<p>Quest says that while the open source project is a starting point, he and Amaral see a lot of areas to expand. &#8220;You need to integrate it into your developer workflow and then you have different systems you deal with, different container registries, different cloud environments and all of that. [&#8230;] You need a solution that can address those needs and doing that through an open source tool is challenging, and that&#8217;s where there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity to provide premium value and have a commercial product offering,&#8221; Quest explained.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ed-sim" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ed-sim">Ed Sim, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> founder and general partner at Boldstart Ventures, one of the seed investors sees a company bringing innovation to an area of technology where it has been lacking, while putting some more control in the hands of developers. &#8220;Slim can shift that all left and give developers the power through the Slim tools to answer all those questions, and then, boom, they can develop containers, push them into production and then DevOps can do their thing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They are just 15 people right now including the founders, but Amaral says building a diverse and inclusive company is important to him, and that&#8217;s why one of his early hires was head of culture. &#8220;One of the first two or three people we brought into the company was our head of culture. We actually have that role in our company now, and she is a rock star and a highly competent and focused person on building a great culture. Culture and diversity to me are two sides of the same coin,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is still in the very early stages of developing that product. In the meantime, they continue to nurture the open source project and to build a community around that. They hope to use that as a springboard to build interest in the commercial product, which should be available some time later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Around a third of Americans regularly get their news from Facebook, according to the latest <a href="https://www.journalism.org/2021/01/12/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-in-2020/">study from Pew Research Center</a>, whose surveys aim to better understand the current media landscape in the U.S. In the updated report, Pew Research found that around half of U.S. adults, or 53%, said they &#8220;often&#8221; or &#8220;sometimes&#8221; use social media to get their news. This is spread out across a number of sites, but Facebook is at the top of the list.</p>
<p>The study found that 36% of U.S. adults said they &#8220;regularly&#8221; access Facebook to get news. This is a significantly larger percentage than almost any other social media platform, with the exception of YouTube, which is used regularly for news by 23% of U.S. adults.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2095185" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-02.png?w=407" alt="" width="407" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-02.png 840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-02.png?resize=90,150 90w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-02.png?resize=179,300 179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-02.png?resize=768,1284 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-02.png?resize=407,680 407w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-02.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Beyond that, the percentages are much smaller. Even Trump&#8217;s preferred platform for communication (well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/why-twitter-banned-president-trump/">until recently</a>), Twitter, is only used regularly for news by 15% of U.S. adults, Pew found.</p>
<p>Only around one-in-ten Americans or fewer said they regularly got their news from other social media platforms, including Instagram (11%), Reddit (6%), Snapchat (4%), LinkedIn (4%), TikTok (3%), WhatsApp (3%), Tumblr (1%) and Twitch (1%).</p>
<p>Pew notes that the lower percentages for using these sites as a source of news also has to do with the fact that fewer Americans report using these sites at all.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2095181" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-03.png?w=273" alt="" width="273" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-03.png 416w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-03.png?resize=60,150 60w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-03.png?resize=120,300 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-03.png?resize=273,680 273w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-03.png?resize=20,50 20w" sizes="(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px" /></p>
<p>But even if their audiences are smaller, the site&#8217;s users may be heavily engaged with the news. Twitter, for instance, is used only by 25% of U.S. adults, but over half the users (59%) say they get news on the platform, compared with 54% of Facebook users. Meanwhile, 42% of Reddit users get news regularly on its site, even though it has a significantly smaller user base than Facebook.</p>
<p>In other words, the list of &#8220;top news platforms&#8221; looks a bit different when you count how many of a social media site&#8217;s <em>own</em> <em>users</em> gets the news regularly from the platform, instead of just how many U.S. adults altogether get their news from the site.</p>
<p>When measured this way, Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit lead, followed by YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, then Twitch.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2095182" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-01.png?w=622" alt="" width="622" height="584" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-01.png 622w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-01.png?resize=150,141 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-01.png?resize=300,282 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PJ_2021.01.12_news-social-media_0-01.png?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" /></p>
<p>Pew additionally examined the demographic makeup of those who use social media for news, and found that White adults make up the majority of the regular news users for sites like Facebook and Reddit. Both Black and Hispanic adults, meanwhile, made up around a quarter of Instagram&#8217;s regular users (22% and 27%, respectively.) Facebook was found to also skew towards women (63% vs 35%) when it came to regularly using it getting the news, while Reddit skews towards men (67% vs. 29%).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s also interesting about the report&#8217;s findings is that, despite Americans&#8217; widespread usage of social media for getting the news, a majority (59%) said they believed it to be &#8220;largely inaccurate.&#8221; This figure has stayed fairly consistent over the past couple of years, as well. It&#8217;s up from 57% in 2018 and the same as on 2019.</p>
<p>Nearly half of social media users also said reading the news on social media has not made much of a difference in helping them to understand current events.</p>
<p>This finding seems to contradict <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/isolation-and-social-media-combine-to-radicalize-violent-offenders-11565041473">reports</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00546-3">studies</a> that say social media sites &#8212; and their algorithms that personalize news to the interests and beliefs of their users &#8212; have helped radicalize people online. Last week, the results of that was on full display as a mob of people who have consumed misinformation and conspiracy theories, often for years, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/capitol-riot/">stormed the U.S. Capitol</a> in a failed attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that Pew&#8217;s study is based on self-reported data. So while respondents may have claimed social media posts didn&#8217;t really help them &#8220;understand&#8221; the news, they may be underestimating those posts&#8217; power and influence over time.</p>
<p>The Pew Research Center regularly runs studies like this. For example, last year it reported how social media news consumers tend to be <a href="https://www.journalism.org/2020/07/30/americans-who-mainly-get-their-news-on-social-media-are-less-engaged-less-knowledgeable/">less engaged and less knowledgeable</a> about the facts on key news topics, like the U.S. election or COVID-19. The same study also found that the social media news consumers were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/study-u-s-adults-who-mostly-rely-on-social-media-for-news-are-less-informed-exposed-to-more-conspiracies/">more frequently exposed to fringe conspiracies.</a></p>
<p>The platforms themselves have done little to help prevent the spread of misinformation, beyond adding basic fact-checks. Facebook waited years<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/"> to ban QAnon groups</a>, but many still remained after the sweep, as did &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; conspiracy groups, after a similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">crackdown</a> on the hashtags and other incitements of violence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM revealed Tuesday a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cadillac" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cadillac">Cadillac <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-branded electric vertical takeoff and landing drone concept that is designed â if it&#8217;s ever built â to let owners cruise the skies in isolated luxury.</p>
<p>The single seat eVTOL, which was showcased alongside an autonomous vehicle during GM&#8217;s keynote presentation at the virtual 2021 <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tech trade show, is the automaker&#8217;s first foray into aerial mobility. This is a mere concept, which means it&#8217;s unlikely to become a real product. However, these concepts can signal where a company is headed on the design or product front. And when it comes to electric and autonomous vehicles, GM has proven its willingness to invest in the technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are preparing for a world where advances in electric and autonomous technology make personal air travel possible,&#8221; Michael Simcoe, GM&#8217;s global design chief, said during the presentation. &#8220;It is a concept designed for the moment when time is of essence and convenience is everything.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2095195" style="width: 1964px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.33.45-AM.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095195" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095195 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.33.45-AM.jpg" alt="GM electric evtol ces" width="1954" height="996" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.33.45-AM.jpg 1954w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.33.45-AM.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.33.45-AM.jpg?resize=300,153 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.33.45-AM.jpg?resize=768,391 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.33.45-AM.jpg?resize=680,347 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.33.45-AM.jpg?resize=1536,783 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.33.45-AM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1954px) 100vw, 1954px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095195" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GM</p></div></p>
<p>The eVTOL concept is equipped with 90-kilowatt hour electric motor to power four rotors that can whisk the passenger off of a rooftop to their destination. It also comes with air-to-air and air-to-ground communications capabilities.</p>
<p>Simcoe said the company has more concepts planned, including a &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">luxurious two-seater designed for you and someone very special to decompress, relax and enjoy a multi sensory experience choreographed for more intimate journeys.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The entire exercise, as Simcoe explained, is to show the world what autonomy and Cadillac luxury might look like in the &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">not too distant future.&#8221;Â </span></p>
<p>Of course, these concepts are also designed to convey just how serious GM is about the future of transportation, which in its view centers around electrification, automated vehicle technology and connected car services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smartphone sales are bad &#8212; and have been for a couple of years now. Certainly this ongoing pandemic hasnât helped. All the talk about how 5G and new form factors were going to cause a kind of bounce-back all fell by the wayside, as people put a pause on unnecessary luxuries.</p>
<p>Samsung is the only company thatâs seen some success with the foldable form factor, and that whole thing got off to aâ¦rough start. There were plenty of technical issues at first, leading to a less than auspicious first impression. These days, price continues to be a major hurdle &#8212; especially during a time when paying $1,000 and up on a phone is a major red flag for many.</p>
<p>In the world of phone form factors, two is, at the very least, the start of a trend. And on day one of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> both LG and TCL have offered their take on yet another form factor designed to offer more screen real estate in pocketable devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2095164" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095164" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095164 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AMOLED-Rollable-Display2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="978" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AMOLED-Rollable-Display2.jpg 2174w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AMOLED-Rollable-Display2.jpg?resize=150,143 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AMOLED-Rollable-Display2.jpg?resize=300,286 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AMOLED-Rollable-Display2.jpg?resize=768,733 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AMOLED-Rollable-Display2.jpg?resize=680,649 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AMOLED-Rollable-Display2.jpg?resize=1536,1467 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AMOLED-Rollable-Display2.jpg?resize=2048,1956 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AMOLED-Rollable-Display2.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AMOLED-Rollable-Display2.jpg?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095164" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: TCL</p></div></p>
<p>LGâs product is &#8212; for the moment &#8212; the more notable of the two, largely because the company plans to actually release the thing. In an interview published this morning, spokesperson Ken Hong<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/CES-2021/LG-to-release-world-s-first-rollable-smartphone-developed-with-BOE"> told Nikkei</a>, &#8220;As it is released at CES 2021, I can tell that it will be launched this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, indeed, LGâs a company not afraid to take chances with a wacky form factor. There are a number of examples of the phenomenon in recent years, most notably the swiveling screen on the LG Wing.</p>
<p>Still, the product didnât amount to much more than a brief tease during a press conference (an excuse to transition between scenes, really), so youâd be forgiven for assuming that the tech still has a long way to go.</p>
<p>TCL, meanwhile, noted up front that the product is still firmly in the concept phase, but managed to give us a better look. I suppose itâs easier to parade concept than an unfinished real-world product. Details are still slim, but the company says the device is capable of expanding from 6.7 to 7.8 inches.</p>
<p>One imagines &#8212; or, at least, hopes &#8212; that the industry has learned from the issues stemming from the first batch of foldables. Sometimes the race to bring technology to market results in delivering something half-baked, an issue that came back to bite companies like Samsung and Motorola. Lab testing is one thing &#8212; the real world is a different thing entirely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today is rolling out an update to its Access Your Information tool with the goal of making the tool easier to both use and navigate, as well as better explain how and why that data is used. The new version of the tool has been visually redesigned, and now further breaks down the viewable information across eight different categories instead of just two.</p>
<p>The tool had first launched in 2018 in the wake of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cambridge-analytica/">Cambridge Analytica</a> scandal, when the personal data of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/">up to 87 million Facebook users</a> had been hijacked. Following that event, Facebook made a number of changes to how its platform apps worked and rolled out new features to make it easier for users to find and utilize Facebook&#8217;s privacy settings.</p>
<p>One of the new additions was this Access Your Information tool, which offers users a secure way to manage their Facebook posts, reactions, comments and other things they&#8217;ve searched for. The idea is that you could use the tool to pull up your information, then &#8220;delete anything from your timeline or profile that you no longer want on Facebook.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before, this tool offered just two broad categories of data: Your Information and Information About You. The updated version, on the other hand, has broken this out to eight categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Activity Across Facebook</li>
<li>Friends and Followers</li>
<li>Preferences</li>
<li>Personal Information</li>
<li>Logged Information</li>
<li>Ads Information</li>
<li>Apps and Websites Off Of Facebook</li>
<li>Security and Login Information</li>
</ul>
<p>Within each of these eight categories, the information is then further broken down into subcategories. This makes it easier to more narrowly drill down to just the sort of data you want to view and, possibly, remove.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095153" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095153" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2095153" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="360" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png 2262w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=680,360 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=1536,812 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=2048,1083 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095153" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, the tool is introducing Search functionality with the update. You can find data categories by searching them &#8212; like by typing in &#8220;location&#8221; to pull up information about your location history.</p>
<p>The tool will also now better explain how this data Facebook has can be used to personalize your experience on its platform. For example, you might see your primary location is one of the signals that was used to target you with an ad for a food delivery app. (Facebook already explains this in its Why Am I Seeing This tool for ads, but now it&#8217;s in this tool, too.)</p>
<p>Facebook says the changes were developed based on how people had been using the tool &#8212; especially in terms of what categories of data they were clicking on.</p>
<p>That said, the timing of the tool&#8217;s revamp is notable. There&#8217;s a large effort at Apple underway to better highlight to App Store users which apps collect personal data which is then used to track them. Apple is now requiring apps to add App Store privacy labels and will soon require apps to get user consent on tracking.</p>
<p>Facebook, in response to this push, launched <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/apple-ios-14-speak-up-for-small-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a website</a> and ran full-page ads in newspapers to gain support for its personalized advertising business, noting the harms it says will come to small businesses as a result of Apple&#8217;s changes.</p>
<p>This revamped tool will help make Facebook&#8217;s case to users, as well, by explaining the why the data and the ads could be useful. (After all, isn&#8217;t it better to see a food delivery ad for a company that actually serves your local area?, Facebook would want you to think.)</p>
<p>Then there is the not-so-small-matter of people who may be trying to rapidly delete their incriminating Facebook history &#8212; like photos and videos of themselves inside the Capitol during last week&#8217;s riot, perhaps. Now that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/us/politics/capitol-arrests.html">the FBI is filing federal charges</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/thirteen-charged-federal-court-following-riot-united-states-capitol">dozens more are being charged in Superior Court</a>, people may be rethinking their decision to share their participation in the event so publicly. The tool could help there, too.</p>
<p>Facebook, when asked, said the enhancements are just a usability update, however.</p>
<p>The new tool is available today on iOS and Android, with an expansion to desktop to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We may finally have an answer to why Byjuâs, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/silver-lake-leads-500-million-round-in-indias-byjus/">worldâs most valuable edtech startup</a>, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/indian-education-startup-byjus-raises-200m-from-general-atlantic/">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> last year.</p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-12/byju-s-said-to-pay-1-billion-for-blackstone-backed-india-tutor?sref=gni836kR">reports</a> that the Bangalore-based startup has agreed to buy Aakash Educational Services, which owns and operates more than 200 physical tutoring centres across the country aimed at students preparing to qualify for top engineering and medical colleges.</p>
<p>According to the publication, Byjuâs will pay $1 billion to buy Aakash Educational Services, which was founded in 1988 and serves more than 250,000 students. Aakash sold 37.5% stake to Blackstone in late 2019 in a deal that valued the Indian firm at about $500 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Byjuâs spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
<p>Byjuâs has raised over $800 million in the past two years, and more than doubled its valuation to over $11 billion. The startup, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/tiger-global-invests-in-india-unacademy-at-2-billion-valuation/">several other edtech firms</a> in India, attracted tens of millions of students to its platform last year after the pandemic prompted New Delhi to shut down schools nationwide.</p>
<p>Byjuâs prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years has also expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on Byjuâs app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake. The startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/byjus-profitable-fy-2019/">turned profitable in late 2019</a>, served over 70 million students as of late last year.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/indian-decacorn-byjus-ceo-talks-about-future-acquisitions-coronavirus-and-international-expansion/">interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last year</a>, Byjuâs co-founder and chief executive Byju Raveendran said the startup, which acquired a coding platform aimed at young students called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">WhiteHat Jr for $300 million last year</a>, was open to more merger and acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p>The startup is backed by several high-profile investors, including Bond, which was co-founded by Mary Meeker. Bond expects Byjuâs to be worth over $30 billion within three years, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch earlier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://roboflow.com/">Roboflow</a>, a startup that aims to simplify the process of building computer vision models, today announced that it has raised a $2.1 million seed round co-led by Lachy Groom and Craft Ventures. Additional investors include Segment co-founder Calvin French-Owen, Lob CEO Leore Avidar, Firebase co-founder James Tamplin and early Dropbox engineer Aston Motes, among others. The company is a graduate of this year&#8217;s Y Combinator summer class.</p>
<p>Co-founded by <span style="font-weight: 400;">Joseph Nelson (CEO) and Brad Dwyer (CTO), Roboflow is the result of the team members&#8217; previous work on AR and AI apps, including <a href="http://magicsudoku.com/">Magic Sudoku</a> from 2017. After respectively exiting their last companies, the two co-founders teamed up again to launch a new AR project, this time with a focus on board games. In 2019, the team actually participated in the TC Disrupt hackathon to add chess support to that app &#8212; but in the process, the team also realized that it was spending a lot of time trying to solve the same problems that everybody else in the computer vision field was facing.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094898" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pills-live-detection.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094898" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2094898" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pills-live-detection.gif?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2094898" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roboflow</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In building both those [AR] products, we realized most of our time wasn&#8217;t spent on the board game part of it, it was spent on the image management, the annotation management, the understanding of &#8216;do we have enough images of white queens, for example? Do we have enough images from this angle or this angle? Are the rooms brighter or darker?&#8217; This data mining of understanding in visual imagery is really underdeveloped. We had built a bunch of &#8212; at the time &#8212; internal tooling to make this easier for us,&#8221; Nelson explained. &#8220;And in the process of building this company, of trying to make software features for real-world objects, realize that developers didn&#8217;t need inspiration. They needed tooling.&#8221;</p>
<p>So shortly after participating in the hackathon, the founders started putting together the first version of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roboflow" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roboflow">Roboflow <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and launched the first version a year ago in January 2020. And while the service started out as a platform for managing large image data sets, it has since grown to become an end-to-end solution for handling image management, analysis, pre-processing and augmentation, up to building the image recognition models and putting them into production. As Nelson noted, while the team didn&#8217;t set out to build an end-to-end solution, its users kept pushing the team to add more features.</p>

<p>So far, about 20,000 developers have used the service, with use cases ranging from accelerating cancer research to <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/reducing-traffic-with-computer-vision/">smart city applications</a>. The thesis here, Nelson said, is that computer vision is going to be useful for every single industry. But not every company has the in-house expertise to set up the infrastructure for building models and putting it into production, so Roboflow aims to provide an easy to use platform for this that individual developers and (over time) large enterprise teams can use to quickly iterate on their ideas.</p>
<p>Roboflow plans to use the new funding to expand its team, which currently consists of five members, both on the engineering and go-to-market side.</p>

<p>&#8220;As small cameras become cheaper and cheaper, we&#8217;re starting to see an explosion of video and image data everywhere,&#8221; Segment co-founder and Roboflow investor French-Owen noted. &#8220;Historically, it&#8217;s been hard for anyone but the biggest tech companies to harness this data, and actually turn it into a valuable product. Roboflow is building the pipelines for the rest of us. Theyâre helping engineers take the data that tells a thousand words, and giving them the power to turn that data into recommendations and insights.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Context is always important. In the grand scheme of things, I have privilege: I was born a male, in the most powerful country in the world, during the most prosperous time in history, to parents who both went to college, all in a middle-class neighborhood.</p>
<p>I could have been born during my dadâs generation when there were still signs that said &#8220;Whites Only&#8221; and he was barred from entry. Even now, the fact that Iâm half-Jewish and look more ambiguous than &#8220;Black&#8221; has been a privilege.</p>
<p>But despite my privilege, Iâm also confident that my Black heritage made it more difficult for me to raise venture capital. Itâs a reality that goes against the classic Silicon Valley ethos: strive for perfection and constantly improve.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			Itâs in our national interests to make becoming an entrepreneur as egalitarian as possible.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Today â and the data proves this â if you are a white male, you have an unfair advantage when looking to raise venture capital. This doesnât take anything away from the brilliant white male entrepreneurs that have built incredible companies, but it has made an equivalent crowd of Black founders almost nonexistent.</p>
<p>As a nation we know the benefits of encouraging entrepreneurship across backgrounds: Entrepreneurs create jobs, spark innovation and allow us to maintain our position as the most competitive nation on the planet. Itâs in our national interests to make becoming an entrepreneur as egalitarian as possible, and yet weâve fallen remarkably short of that goal across both race and gender.</p>
<p>I moved to southern China shortly after graduating from UC Berkeley. A lot of my decision-making process at the time was more subconscious, but I always had this feeling that as a Black male, I wasnât going to get fair treatment working for a large company; I always knew my path to success was through being an entrepreneur and creating my own company. China, not the U.S., seemed the place to do that.</p>
<p>I fell in love with the entrepreneurial spirit of China. And surprisingly, as a foreigner in China, I felt that I wasnât judged in the context of race. They saw me as an American that could bring them business opportunities and that was it, I felt that I was judged more on the merits of the value that I could bring than I would in the U.S. â and it was refreshing. Spurred by opportunities, I started a successful import and export business in China, and after a few years I had over 30 employees. I loved the experience of working with factories and I found it mesmerizing watching products that we use and wear being made.</p>
<p>At that time, my clients were larger U.S.-based retailers and brands. I could see the growth of Shopify and how this deceptively simple e-commerce product, plus marketing tools like Instagram, allowed small businesses to sell online and market their products in ways that had only been accessible to my larger clients years before. But I kept thinking that there was no equivalent inroad for small businesses to vast resources of supply chain and manufacturing.</p>
<p>That was the reason I founded <a href="http://thestudio.com">The/Studio,</a> a custom manufacturing platform that would give small businesses access to factories so that they could easily manufacture products in low quantities, without having to deal with all of the hassle and risks associated with manufacturing â just like the big brands.</p>
<p>At the time, I didnât even know that raising venture capital was a possibility. And really, this was where my race became an obstacle. Those closer to the concentric circles of venture capital know that venture capital exists and they know how to access it.</p>
<p>Those that are further away donât know how it truly can scale your company, let alone how to access it. Now, when you have a commodity like capital that is a closely held resource to a favored few, thatâs called elitism and cronyism. I believe itâs the antithesis of what Silicon Valley is supposed to stand for and itâs detrimental to Americaâs ability to lead on a global, entrepreneurial scale.</p>
<p>By 2016, without capital, I had bootstrapped the company to eight digits in revenue. We had more than 100 employees and the business was profitable. I knew that there was a much larger opportunity for us to take advantage of â the same one Shopify seized on â but I felt that I didnât have the financial resources, nor the knowledge at the time, to really grow the business in the way that I thought was possible or responsible.</p>
<p>It was at this time that I started to understand that at this point in a technology companyâs trajectory, they really need venture capital to put fuel to the fire. Not just for the money, though that helps â we needed the counsel and guidance that often comes with it, too.</p>
<p>So I upped and moved to San Francisco. I was very optimistic that it would be easy for my company to raise millions of dollars in venture capital â after all, I was used to reading in TechCrunch about companies that were raising millions of dollars, and sometimes tens of millions of dollars, with no product, just a good idea (and sometimes a bad one). Iâd proven my ability as an entrepreneur by already building a sizable business with a massive TAM, plus a product that was live, already profitable and ready to be scaled.</p>
<p>I started off with several introductions that one of my friends from college and a former VC made for me to several of his previous colleagues. In the traditional Silicon Valley way, I would take one introduction and turn it into another. I began to realize that venture capital is a bit of a social game â and I was about to play it for two years.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094777" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094777" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2094777" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Joseph-Heller-Headshot3.png" alt="Joseph Heller is CEO and founder of Supplied." width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Joseph-Heller-Headshot3.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Joseph-Heller-Headshot3.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Joseph-Heller-Headshot3.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Joseph-Heller-Headshot3.png?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Joseph-Heller-Headshot3.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Joseph-Heller-Headshot3.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094777" class="wp-caption-text">Joseph Heller is CEO and founder of Supplied. <strong>Image Credits: Supplied</strong></p></div></p>
<p>During this process, I want to be clear that I never faced overt racism; everyone was polite and gracious with their time. But when going to pitch meetings and VC events, I got the same feeling that I would get when you go to a high-end country club or a luxury store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. It was clear that the venture community â and the few entrepreneurs that they anointed to be part of their chosen â were a closely knit elite who wanted nothing to do with outsiders.</p>
<p>An air of arrogance, elitism and exclusivity pervaded literally every interaction. They spoke a certain way, they were looking for cues of who else you knew in their network â and the minute that they discovered that you were not one of them, the meeting was basically over. This feeling was in stark contrast with what in my mind Silicon Valley had stood for. I had envisioned an ideal where any brilliant, hard-working entrepreneur with a good idea and was scrappy as hell could raise money and find success.</p>
<p>In reality, it was a place where your admittance to the club was heavily based on your race, gender and what university you went to (even UC Berkeley wasnât highly regarded). If you werenât white, male and from Harvard, Stanford or the Ivies, you had to relentlessly pursue your vision for years to get in through the back door.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/the-studio" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="the-studio">The/Studio <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> did finally raise an $11 million series A â after 18 months and 150 meetings and 145 &#8220;noâs.&#8221; Read that again. I was mostly pitching white male VCs. Their prejudgements and the fact that you donât know their friends made it a ânoâ before the meeting even started. The wider data suggests strongly that there was a racial component to this, as does my personal napkin math: Roughly 120 of the VCs I pitched were white and we got zero term sheets from them. Thirty that I pitched were ethnic minorities and I received five term sheets, or a success rate of 17%.</p>
<p>Two years later, Iâve become part of that exclusive group of entrepreneurs that have raised a sizable venture capital round. And I now have a behind-the-scenes view of what Silicon Valley is all about. There are some truly brilliant investors and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and the data backs that up; the number of VC-backed companies that go public in Silicon Valley dwarf the rest of the nation for a good reason.</p>
<p>But Iâve also learned that there are a lot of incompetent investors that are investors simply because of who they know, and a lot of entrepreneurs that arenât the best in the world who get funded because of who they know. In addition, Iâve met a lot of people that would be great investors that never will have the opportunity to be investors, because of who they donât know and how they look. Likewise, I know many great entrepreneurs, just as good as the ones that have taken major companies public, that wonât raise VC money because of who they donât know and how they look.</p>
<p>I do believe there is a deep-seated perception in Silicon Valley that people that look a certain way and have a certain pedigree are the best entrepreneurs. The system is set up in a way that reinforces this mentality with a positive feedback loop: The VC structure is set up in a way that they make money off of 10% of their deals and the other 90% can fail, no problem.</p>
<p>If they invest in someone that is unknown within their social circles, they run the risk of being challenged by their partnership on why they made that decision, so the personal risk of going out on a limb is big. If they invest in someone that has a ton of social credibility in Silicon Valley, then even if they fail, nobody will question them. Itâs part of the process.</p>
<p>VCs are only human, and if you have billions of dollars of capital to deploy and thousands of entrepreneurs that want to raise money from you, and you can only select a few a year, itâs easy to take the resistance-free route and invest in people that you know. Those people are generally white males. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, because statistically if you invest in predominantly white males and a few of them succeed, then invest in far fewer people of color or women, even fewer of them will succeed. You end up internalizing that bias in your mathematically âobjectiveâ decision-making.</p>
<p>We saw this same issue begin to be resolved for women in the last decade. There were very few female entrepreneurs who raised VC money 10 years ago â 823 women-owned businesses, according to a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2019/11/12/the-number-of-venture-capital-backed-companies-with-female-founders-is-on-the-rise/?sh=2e6ae44c3bc3">recent Forbes study</a>. There are still very few female-led VC-backed companies today, compared to male-led ones, but there are a lot more now; over 3,450 as of 2019, according to the same study. Women didnât get smarter in 10 years; pressure was applied to VCs and they started being less myopic.</p>
<p>They realized that women made great entrepreneurs â and investors, too. During the last decade, more VC firms began hiring â and were started â by women, <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201810/kimberly-weisul/female-founders-funding-guide.html">although even now itâs still a meager 11%</a>.</p>
<p>But what about the racial divide? I know a brilliant Black guy that has a masterâs degree in electrical engineering and computer science from one of the top five engineering schools in the nation, heads an engineering team for a company that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and has created a high-tech startup serving enterprise customers, doing over $1 million a year in revenue, is profitable and totally bootstrapped. Iâm confident that if he were a white male, he would have already raised significant VC money. He hasnât.</p>
<p>Again, I donât think itâs a matter of overt racism. But he probably isnât accepted and doesnât feel comfortable in VC social circles; he probably doesnât have the confidence that he can raise money; he hasnât seen others that look like him raise money. Because he lacks these things and because he doesnât have the traditional âentrepreneur look,â he would be dismissed by VCs.</p>
<p>Now, all this being said, change begins with entrepreneurs, too. For instance, we recently launched a new product called <a href="https://suppliedshop.com/">Supplied</a> that allows small businesses and boutiques to buy products wholesale directly from factories in China. About 95% of our customers are women â and 60% of our customers are people of color.</p>
<p>We didnât set out to build a product for this market, but once they embraced it, we embraced them. Initially, my board, which is all white and male, didnât understand this market and was a bit cautious. I donât blame them; there was nothing nefarious about their assumptions or initial concerns, they just didnât have the experience in their life that helped them to understand our customer.</p>
<p>But I did, at least the racial challenges faced by our customer base. I had conviction that there was a business here because I know a lot of women of color that had similar experiences and aspirations as the customers that were gravitating toward our platform, only to be shut out by prohibitively high prices on other âwholesaleâ platforms.</p>
<p>And I recognized my own inability to fully understand our customer base, as well as the fact that my team wasnât diverse enough to really understand them, either. So I deliberately tried to recruit more women into our organization. Iâm now proud to say that my executive leadership is 33% female, 33% Black, 77% people of color. The team that runs Supplied is predominantly female, just like the customer base.</p>
<p>Both The/Studio and Suppliedâs head of marketing are Black women, with one working from Nigeria and the other from Ghana. Our diversity numbers are far better than almost any tech company Iâve encountered. Diversity isnât something we just talk about; it comes naturally to us, because diversity comes naturally to me.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley has created incredible outcomes, and I donât want to unfairly malign Silicon Valley as this racist institution that deliberately keeps out minorities and women. But because of many factors â which do include overt racism, historical factors and just human nature â the fact remains that Silicon Valley does not reflect our nationâs diversity across race and gender. Yet.</p>
<p>Our country is becoming more diverse and the rest of the world more wealthy. For Silicon Valley to maintain its crown as a beacon of innovation, itâs important to make it more diverse so it can understand the United States as well as emerging markets. It doesnât need to be a zero-sum game where more people of color will push out the incumbents. In fact, it will make things more competitive, with a more diverse perspective on the world, which is better for returns and opportunities for all.</p>
<p>Blacks founders and other underrepresented groups also have an obligation to pull up their bootstraps and pursue being entrepreneurs and being funded, no matter how hard it is. This generation will serve as the inspiration â and employer â of the next. The more Black people who get funding, the more Black entrepreneurialism becomes normalized, creating a flywheel effect of normalizing investing in Black founders for VCs and encouraging more Black people to pursue being entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that equal access to capital and entrepreneurship is the final civil rights movement. We have an opportunity to create real equality â financial and social â in Silicon Valley and the world, all while building the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart announced today it will soon begin to pilot a new solution that could eventually allow the retailer to deliver groceries to customers&#8217; homes 24 hours per day. The company is partnering with <a href="https://www.homevalet.co/">HomeValet</a>, the maker of a temperature-controlled smart box that&#8217;s placed outside the home. Customers&#8217; groceries can be delivered, contact-free, to the secure box and kept cold at any time &#8212; even if the customer isn&#8217;t at home.</p>
<p>The smart boxes will be tested initially with customers near Walmart&#8217;s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, starting this spring. There won&#8217;t be a way to sign up for the service. Instead, Walmart will conduct outreach to its current delivery customers in Northwest Arkansas to learn of their interest in participating.</p>
<p>The HomeValet boxes themselves are an internet-of-things platform which offer three temperature-controlled zones, making them capable of storing frozen, refrigerated and pantry items. The boxes communicate with the delivery provider&#8217;s device, which gives them secure access to the smart box at the time of the delivery to place the items inside.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to the HomeValet <a href="https://www.homevalet.co/faqs">FAQ</a>, the boxes also disinfect the exposed surfaces of delivered items as well as the inside of the box itself, in between deliveries, using UVC light.</p>
<p>This could appeal to customers who have been trying to reduce their exposure to the novel coronavirus by wiping down all their groceries before putting them away. (The HomeValet website, however, makes no specific claims about COVID-19. Instead, it simply says the UV-C LED disinfection method it uses can create &#8220;inhospitable environments to microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, molds and other pathogens.&#8221;)</p>
<p>HomeValet notes that Walmart customers will be the first to gain access to its boxes, as the product is just now going to market. The general public will be able to pre-order boxes for themselves later this year, with pricing still to be announced. HomeValet intends to eventually sell to both consumers and retailers.</p>
<p>HomeValet, a D.C. Metro area-based startup, was founded by father and son team, John and Jack Simms, years before the COVID-19 pandemic with the goal of offering more secure home deliveries. However, the pandemic <a href="https://www.tysonsreporter.com/2020/09/24/tysons-secure-home-delivery-startup-plans-to-launch-this-fall/">created a new sense of urgency inside the company</a> to get their product to market as consumers&#8217; needs transformed overnight and continued at an accelerated pace, they&#8217;ve said.</p>
<p>As a result, HomeValet <a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/tysons-contactless-delivery-tech-company-buys-ind-based-firm/">acquired an Indiana-based engineering firm</a>, Envolve Engineering LLC, founded by former Whirlpool engineers, back in September. The company <a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/tysons-contactless-delivery-tech-company-buys-ind-based-firm/">touted</a> the deal at the time as a way to bring the capabilities of a Fortune 500 organization to its faster and more nimble startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumers want convenience and peace of mind now more than ever. HomeValetâs safe, temperature-controlled Smart Box and app, can enable 24/7 secure deliveries whether customers are occupied at home or receiving remotely,&#8221; said John Simms, HomeValet co-founder and CEO. &#8220;Weâre excited for Walmart customers to be some of the first to enjoy contactless, unattended home delivery,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Though Walmart envisions how a smart box could allow it to expand its delivery hours, it won&#8217;t be offering 24/7 deliveries during the pilot. Instead, the focus of the pilot will be to learn more about if and how its customers like to interact with this technology and how Walmart might incorporate it into its operations going forward.</p>
<p>HomeValet is one of many solutions to date that Walmart has tested to make grocery delivery more efficient. Not all those tests have rolled out broadly. For example, Walmart in 2019 began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/walmart-to-launch-in-home-grocery-delivery-in-three-cities-starting-this-fall/">to trial an in-home grocery delivery service</a> that allows Walmart delivery drivers to enter the home through a smart lock system and, in some cases, put groceries away in the customer&#8217;s fridge. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/aug/26/walmart-halts-in-home-deliveries/">Walmart pulled back </a>on the in-kitchen program, which is still only operating in Pittsburgh. (InHome delivery is also offered inÂ Kansas City, Vero Beach and West Palm Beach, but groceries are left inside the door.)</p>
<p>Walmart didn&#8217;t disclose further details about the nature of its partnership with HomeValet, but said there&#8217;s no cost to the customers during the pilot period. More information will be available as the program goes to launch in the spring.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Uber has expanded a program that incentivizes drivers to use all-electric and hybrid vehicles to more than 1,400 cities in North America including Austin, Houston, Miami and New York City as part of the ride-hailing company&#8217;s broader plan to become a zero-emission platform by 2040. The program, known as Uber Green, gives customers the option [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has expanded a program that incentivizes drivers to use all-electric and hybrid vehicles to more than 1,400 cities in North America including Austin, Houston, Miami and New York City as part of the ride-hailing company&#8217;s broader plan to become a zero-emission platform by 2040.</p>
<p>The program, known as <a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/ride/ubergreen/#:~:text=Each%20time%20you%20choose%20Uber,vehicles%20(EVs)%20by%202025.">Uber Green</a>, gives customers the option to request an EV or hybrid electric vehicle. Drivers receive an extra $0.50 from a $1 rider surcharge for every Uber Green trip completed.Â Uber said Tuesday it is integrating the program into its Uber Pass membership service and will give members 10% off on &#8220;green&#8221; trips, the same discount provided for a standard ride.</p>
<p>Of course, the success of Uber Green hinges on its ability to get drivers to make the switch. The company has set aside $800 million to get its drivers to use electric vehicles by 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s beginning to roll out programs through partnerships with automakers, charging network <span style="font-weight: 400;">providers, and EV rental and fleet companies to provide further incentives. Uber said Tuesday drivers in Los Angeles can rent electric vehicles through a partnership with Avis. The program will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expand nationwide in 2021.Â Â </span></p>
<p>Uber has also partnered with <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ample. Starting this month, drivers in San Francisco </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can rent a vehicle with Ample battery swapping technology, which lets switch out the electric vehicle batteries in minutes.Â </span></p>
<p>The company has also expanded its partnership with EVgo to give drivers on its ride-hailing platform access to charging discounts at more than 800 U.S. locations.</p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s zero-emission goal will require more than getting drivers and riders to use EVs. The company is expanding other programs as well, including its journey planning feature for public transit users. The feature, which is now available in more than 40 cities globally, is accessed through the Uber app and lets users plan their public transit journey and includes walking directions to stations and real-time schedules. The company said Tuesday it has added the feature for users in <span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlanta, Auckland, Brisbane, Buenos Aires, Guadalajara, Philadelphia, Rome, Bangalore, Chennai, and Mumbai.Â </span></p>
<p>Uber said it is also bringing a multimodal trip planner that combines ride-hailing with walking <span style="font-weight: 400;">directions and city bus, subway, or train connections to Mexico City and London. The feature launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Sydney and Chicago.Â </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps these companies would have merely stayed private sans SPACs. If that's true, two cheers for blank-check companies?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are a number of ways to take a private company public: You can pursue a traditional IPO, sell a chunk of shares at a set price and start trading. You can direct list and merely start to trade. You can host a hybrid auction-offering, like what Unity did.</p>
<p>Hell, Google showed us back in the day that a reverse-Dutch auction is possible, after which no one else deigned to try it.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the blank-check method: Instead of taking <em>your</em> company private, some rich people list a pile of hungry money instead and then go hunting for a private company to merge with. If you consent, the money bucket and your actual company merge, renaming themselves after your operating entity. This is a SPAC-led debut.</p>

<hr />
<p>And it&#8217;s what we&#8217;re discussing today, because there are a few upstarts going public via special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs, or blank-check companies) worth checking out.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>One deals with bitcoin, and one is a huge consumer-facing fintech that has <a href="https://www.sofistadium.com/">a stadium</a> named after itself. In the case of <a href="https://www.bakkt.com/">Bakkt</a>, the cryptocurrency-powering entity, a SPAC made some sense at first blush. <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a>, on the surface, seemed less obvious. (Bakkt is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, an exchange-focused, public company. It has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynpollock/2020/03/19/bakkt-crypto-exchange-boosted-by-300m-from-microsoft-ice-during-crisis/?sh=15d362ab72c7">raised money from Microsoft</a> as well.)</p>
<p>This morning I want to dig through the two offerings&#8217; investor presentations to see what we can learn. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/a-quick-peek-into-opendoors-financial-results/">viewing the Opendoor-SPAC presentation</a>, I had a few questions heading into the new deals. The first was whether SPACs were going to be used again to lift potentially promising companies that lacked obvious, near-term growth stories to the public markets. If so, perhaps SPACs would wind up helping get more total companies public, which would not be a bad thing.</p>
<p>Especially given how many unicorns the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/with-5-new-unicorns-in-first-week-of-2021-are-we-in-for-a-stampede-this-year/">private markets are birthing</a>Â ahead of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/how-unicorns-helped-venture-capital-get-later-and-bigger/">the public market&#8217;s ability to IPO them all</a>; maybe SPACs would help close the liquidity gap?</p>
<p>So, does that very modest hypothesis fit with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bakkt" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bakkt">Bakkt <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and SoFi? And what can Bakkt tell us about Coinbase&#8217;s impending IPO and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/social-finance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="social-finance">SoFi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> about the state of consumer fintech? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>SPAC me baby one more time</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll start with Bakkt. You can read its release, including all the messy details of a SPAC-led combination <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210111005532/en/Bakkt-the-Digital-Asset-Marketplace-Launched-by-Intercontinental-Exchange-in-2018-to-Become-a-Publicly-Traded-Company-via-Merger-with-VPC-Impact-Acquisition-Holdings">here</a>. The piece you need to know is that the resulting, combined company will have an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp">enterprise value</a> of around $2.1 billion and more than $500 million in cash after all elements of the deal are closed.</p>
<p>So the market should soon have a publicly traded, cryptocurrency-focused business that is loaded with cash. Fun!</p>
<p>Next we want to know how healthy Bakkt is as a business, which brings us to its investor presentation, which you can read <a href="https://www.victoryparkcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bakkt-Management-Presentation.pdf">here</a>. The presentation stresses that Bakkt is backed by major companies, a plus for public investors who might still be skittish about bitcoin. It also stresses that Bakkt will handle a host of digital tokens instead of <em>just</em> cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Bakkt&#8217;s point that airline miles and other nonmonetary rewards are <em>related</em> to decentralized cryptocurrencies in that they are digital tokens is worth considering. Bakkt views the breadth of its supported asset classes as both an advantage over its competitors, and something that it is expanding. Equities trading is coming soon, which will allow users to view even more of their digitally held assets in one place.</p>
<p>Then we get to the results section of the presentation, which includes what I think is the most egregious chart of all time:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095088" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095088" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095088 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="319" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png 1248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=300,141 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=768,361 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=680,319 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095088" class="wp-caption-text">Akin to calling One America News Network &#8220;conservative,&#8221; this chart stretches the word&#8217;s definition somewhat. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bakkt</p></div></p>
<p>Observe how competitors are denoted withÂ <em>actual</em> data, while Bakkt bests them all withÂ <em>projections. </em>Oof. So when it comes to what we can learn today from Bakkt about the impending Coinbase IPO I think that the answer is &#8220;not much.&#8221; Oh well.</p>
<p>We raise the above chart not merely to gently mock some of its embedded optimism, but also to note how nascent Bakkt&#8217;s consumer app really is. Per the company itself, it has yet to <em>really</em> launch:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095090" style="width: 486px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095090" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095090 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png?w=476" alt="" width="476" height="192" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png 476w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png?resize=300,121 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095090" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bakkt</p></div></p>
<p>This leads to the &#8220;results&#8221; shared being pretty heavy on speculation. Indeed, they are <em>nearly</em> <em>all speculation</em>. Check it out:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The new business called BrightDrop, which officially launched Tuesday during the virtual 2021 <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will begin with two main products: an electric van called the EV600 with an estimate range of 250 miles and a pod-like electric pallet dubbed EP1. BrightDrop has other products in mind and is tinkering with a few concepts, including <span style="font-weight: 400;">medium-distance vehicle that transports multiple electric pallets known as EP1 as well as a rapid load delivery vehicle concept, which was teased Tuesday.</span></p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t just a vehicle play, however. GM has also developed a suite of software tools to offer an EV ecosystem for the commercial marketplace. It&#8217;s also setting up a dealership network to support sales and service and plans to help commercial customers set up charging infrastructure.</p>
<p>TheÂ <span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud-based software platform, which can be accessed on the web or by mobile app, will give users information to improve operations, including the best delivery routes and other fleet management features, according to GM. The electric van and pallet will have an array of connected features designed to give customers better ways to monitor and manage the vehicles, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">location monitoring, battery status and remote commands to lock and unlock.Â </span></p>

<p>BrightDrop is the latest &#8220;startup&#8221; to spin out of the automaker&#8217;s Global Innovation effort, an in-house organization that has led to the launch of <span style="font-weight: 400;">OnStar Insurance, OnStar Guardian and GM Defense. Travis Katz, who was an entrepreneur-in-residence at Redpoint Ventures, has been named CEO and president of BrightDrop.Â </span></p>
<p>The idea for BrightDrop was sparked by a team within the Global Innovation organization that was evaluating the growth of e-commerce and consumer demand for online delivery, which has been exacerbated by COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more we learned about the demand and the challenges of delivery and logistics from that first mile to literally the last five feet, the more we saw the opportunity to leverage GM&#8217;s expertise in things like electrification, mobility applications, telematics, fleet management to help businesses move goods and services in a smarter and more sustainable way,&#8221; Pam Fletcher, vice president of Global Innovation at General Motors, said in a media briefing ahead of the announcement.</p>
<p>That opportunity is a substantial one, based on GM&#8217;s estimates. The automaker said that byÂ <span style="font-weight: 400;">2025, the combined market opportunity for parcel, food delivery and reverse logistics in the U.S. will be more than $850 billion. Demand for urban last-mile delivery is expected to grow by 78% by 2030, leading to a 36% increase in delivery vehicles in the world&#8217;s top 100 cities, according to the World Economic Forum. At the same time, this increase in demand is expected to cause delivery-related carbon emissions to rise by nearly one-third.</span></p>
<h2>The EP1</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2095086" style="width: 4010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095086" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095086 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg" alt="" width="4000" height="2278" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=1536,875 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=2048,1166 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095086" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GM</p></div></p>
<p>The business unit&#8217;s first product is called the EP1, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a propulsion-assisted, electric pallet developed to move goods over short distances. For instance, it might be used to shuttle goods from a warehouse to a delivery van. The pod will be available in early 2021.</span></p>
<p>The EP1 has a built-in electric hub motor that can travel up to 3 miles per hour. The pod&#8217;s speed will adjust depending on the operator&#8217;s walking pace.</p>
<p>The EP1, which GM says it&#8217;s designed to maneuver in tight spaces, can about 23 cubic feet of cargo space and carry a payload of up to 200 pounds. Inside the pod are adjustable shelves and lockable cabinet doors to allow for remote access to whatever goods are being transported.</p>
<p>FedEx recently completed a pilot program testing the EP1.Â <span style="font-weight: 400;">FedEx Express couriers were able to safely handle 25% more packages per day with the EP1s, according to GM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrightDrop and FedEx Express have another pilot scheduled to take place in a major urban center in the U.S. this quarter.Â </span></p>
<h2>The EV600</h2>

<p>The electric delivery van is a vehicle designed and built off of GM&#8217;s Ultium architecture â the heart of the company&#8217;s EV strategy. The first vans will be delivered to FedEx at the end of this year. <span style="font-weight: 400;">BrightDrop expects to make the EV600s available to more customers to order starting in early 2022.</span></p>
<p>The vehicle will be able to travel an <span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated 250 miles on a single charge. Its peak </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">charge rate will be up to 170 miles of EV range per hour via 120kW DC fast charging, according to GM</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>The inside is roomy with <span style="font-weight: 400;">600 cubic feet of cargo area and comes with a security system to keep goods safe. There is a 13.4-inch-diagonal, full-color infotainment screen, front sliding pocket doors, wide cabin walkways and a large auto-open cargo bulkhead door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â The electric van comes standard with advanced driver assistance tech found in its consumer vehicles, including f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ront and rear park assist, automatic emergency braking and other warnings to keep the driver in the lane. The van also comes standard with a forward collision alert, following distance indicator, front pedestrian braking andÂ  automatic high beams and HD Rear Vision Camera.</span></p>
<p>Customers can pump up the safety features and add options such as r<span style="font-weight: 400;">ear cross traffic braking, blind zone steering assist, reverse automatic braking, HD surround vision, rear pedestrian alert and enhanced automatic emergency braking.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">America is a land of paperwork, and nowhere is that more obvious than at the end of someoneâs life. Advanced care directives have to be carefully disseminated to healthcare providers and strictly followed. Property has to be divided and transferred while meeting relevant estate laws. And of course, there are the logistics of a funeral, cremation or other option that has its own serious complexities, costs and choices.</p>
<p>The worst time to figure out how to die is when you die. The best time to figure it out is precisely when you donât have to.</p>
<p>For New York City-headquartered <a href="https://lantern.co">Lantern</a>, the goal is to initiate those conversations early and give its users significantly better peace-of-mind, particularly in these dolorous times.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company offers essentially a âhow-toâ platform for beginning to prepare for end-of-life, offering checklists and monitoring to ensure that the vast majority of details are figured out in advance. In some cases, the startup will handle the underlying details itself, while in other areas like estate planning, it works with partners such as Trust &amp; Will, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/trust-will-raises-15m-as-digital-estate-planning-hits-mainstream/">which we have profiled a number of times on TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p>Right now, the company has two plans: a simple free one and a $27 / year plan that tracks your progress on end-of-life planning and allows you to collaborate with family, friends or whoever else needs to be part of your decision-making. The company is in the process of adding other Ã  la carte options for additional fees.</p>
<p>Last month, the company raised $1.4 million in a seed round led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/draper-associates-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="draper-associates-2">Draper Associates <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with a few other firms involved. Earlier, the company raised a pre-seed round of $890,000 from the likes of 2048 Ventures, Amplify and others, bringing its total fundraised to date to $2.3 million. The company is organized as a public-benefit corporation and was founded in September 2018 and first launched a year later.</p>
<p>For founders Liz Eddy and Alyssa Ruderman, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lantern-co" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lantern-co">Lantern <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was an opportunity to tackle a looming problem in a compassionate and empathetic way. âI started my first company when I was 15,â Eddy, who is CEO, said. That company focused on dating abuse and domestic violence education for high school and later college students. âI really fell in love with the pace and variety of starting something new, but also in creating conversations around topics that people really don&#8217;t want to talk about and making it more palatable and comfortable,â she said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094851" style="width: 631px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094851" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2094851" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?w=621" alt="" width="621" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg 3652w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=137,150 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=274,300 274w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=768,841 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=621,680 621w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=1402,1536 1402w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=1870,2048 1870w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094851" class="wp-caption-text">Lantern co-founders Alyssa Ruderman and Liz Eddy. Photo via Lantern.</p></div></p>
<p>Later, she joined local suicide prevention non-profit <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org">Crisis Text Line</a>, which has an SMS-based network of crisis counselors who are trained to calm people and begin their process of recovery. She spent more than six years at the organization.</p>
<p>As for Ruderman, who is COO of Lantern, she most recently spent two years at Global Citizen, a non-profit organization focused on ending extreme poverty. The two connected and incubated Lantern at startup accelerator Grand Central Tech.</p>
<p>The idea for better end-of-life planning came from personal experience. âI lost my dad when I was in elementary school,â Eddy said, âand saw firsthand how loss and grief impacts a family financially, emotionally, logistically, legally â every aspect.â</p>
<p>Today, many of these processes are offline, and the online products mostly available today are focused on individual elements of end-of-life planning, such as estate planning or selecting and purchasing a casket. Eddy and Ruderman saw an opportunity to provide a more holistic experience with a better product while also initiating these conversations earlier.</p>
<p>That pre-planning part of the product was launched just as the pandemic was getting underway last year, and Eddy said that âwe had a sort of a really interesting launch where people were starting to come to terms with their own mortality in a way we hadn&#8217;t seen in a very long time.â Typical users so far have been between 25 and 35 years old, and many people start planning when they have a major life event. Eddy says that the death of a family member is an obvious trigger, but so is having a baby or starting a company.</p>
<p>One aspect that Eddy emphasized repeatedly was that having a will and pre-planning for end-of-life are not equivalent. âEven if you don&#8217;t have a dollar to your name after you pass away, there are a ton of other things that your loved ones, family members, whoever&#8217;s responsible has to consider,â she said.</p>
<p>From a product perspective, there are some nuances compared to your more typical SaaS startup. For one, the company needs to engage you regularly, but not too frequently. Unlike, say, a wedding which is a single event that then is over, your documents and directives need to be occasionally edited and updated as a userâs life circumstances change.</p>
<p>Beyond that, one of the largest challenges with a product that talks about death is building a connection with a user that doesnât seem cold, and, well, Silicon Valley-like. âEven as a product that is entirely virtual, making sure that you really feel that human connection throughoutâ is a high priority, Eddy said. âWe use a lot of empathetic language, and our imagery, all of the illustrations are done by illustrators who have lost someone in memory of the person who&#8217;s lost.â</p>
<p>Longevity startups may remain a thesis for some VC investors, but handling the end â no matter when â is an activity every person faces. Lantern might shine just a bit more light on what is otherwise a debilitating and scary prospect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.cockroachlabs.com/">Cockroach Labs</a>, makers of CockroachDB, have been on a fundraising roll for the last couple of years. Today the company announced a $160 million Series E on a fat $2 billion valuation. The round comes just eight months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/cockroach-labs-scores-86-6m-series-d-as-scalable-database-resonates/">the startup raised an $86.6</a> million Series D.</p>
<p>The latest investment was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/altimeter-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="altimeter-capital">Altimeter Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from new investors Greenoaks and Lone Pine along with existing investors Benchmark, Bond, FirstMark, GV, Index Ventures and Tiger Global. The round doubled the company&#8217;s previous valuation and increased the amount raised to $355 million.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Spencer Kimball says that the company&#8217;s revenue more than doubled in 2020 in spite of COVID, and that caught the attention of investors. He attributed this paradoxical rise to the rapid shift to the cloud brought on by the pandemic that many people in the industry have seen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People became more aggressive with what was already underway, a real move to embrace the cloud to build the next generation of applications and services, and that&#8217;s really fundamentally where we are,&#8221; Kimball told me.</p>
<p>As that happened, the company began a shift in thinking. While it has embraced an open source version of CockroachDB along with a 30-day free trial on the company&#8217;s cloud service as ways to attract new customers to the top of the funnel, it wants to try a new approach.</p>
<p>In fact, it plans to replace the 30 day trial with a newer version later this year without any time limits. It believes this will attract more developers to the platform and enable them to see the full set of features without having to enter credit card information. What&#8217;s more, by taking this approach it should end up costing the company less money to support the free tier.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we expect is that you can do all kinds of things on that free tier. You can do a hackathon, any kind of hobby project [&#8230;] or even a startup that has ambitions to be the next DoorDash or Airbnb,&#8221; he said. As he points out, there&#8217;s a point where early stage companies don&#8217;t have many users, and can remain in the free tier until they achieve product-market fit.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s when they put a credit card down, and they can extend beyond the free tier threshold and pay for what they use,&#8221; he said. The newer free tier is still in the beta testing phase, but will be rolled out during this year.</p>
<p>Kimball says that company wasn&#8217;t necessarily looking to raise, although he knew that it would continue to need more cash on the balance sheet to run with giant competitors like Oracle, AWS and the other big cloud vendors, along with a slew of other database startups. As the company&#8217;s revenue grows, he certainly sees an IPO in its future, but he doesn&#8217;t see it happening this year.</p>

<p>The startup ended the year with 200 employees and Kimball expects to double that by the end of this year. He says growing a diverse group of employees takes good internal data and building a welcoming and inclusive culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the starting point for anything you want to optimize in a business is to make sure that you have the metrics in front of you, and that you&#8217;re constantly looking at them [&#8230;] in order to measure how you&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;The thing that we&#8217;re most focused on in terms of action is really building the culture of the company appropriately and that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve been doing for all six years we&#8217;ve been around. To the extent that you have an inclusive environment where people actually really view the value of respect, that helps with diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kimball says he sees a different approach to running the business when the pandemic ends with some small percentage going into the office regularly and others coming for quarterly visits, but he doesn&#8217;t see a full return to the office post-pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and pharmaceutical company Moderna have <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005245/en/Uber-and-Moderna-Collaborate-to-Raise-Awareness-and-Increase-Access-to-COVID-19-Vaccines">announced a partnership</a> around COVID-19 vaccination, which will include a number of different initiatives. To start, it&#8217;s only confirmed component is to provide users with credible, factual information about COVID-19 vaccine safety through Uber&#8217;s consumer app, but the companies have also discussed additional &#8220;options&#8221; including building ride scheduling via Uber directly into the immunization appointment booking process.</p>
<p>Still in its early days, the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program is already beset with challenges, including providing timely access to vaccines to swaths of the population who need it most. The inoculation program also has to contend with significant misinformation proliferating on social media about vaccine safety, and any app with the surface area of something like Uber has a chance to get positive messages and accurate information in front of a lot of people, so that&#8217;s good news on its own.</p>
<p>But one of the very real challenges to an effective vaccination campaign remains logistical, and getting people to make their initial and follow-up appointments for the first round of the Moderna vaccine, and its second shot booster, is a bigger challenge than many might suspect. I spoke to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/healthvana" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="healthvana">Healthvana <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Ramin Bastani about their work with Â LA County on creating an immunization record that integrates with Apple Wallet to provide patients with timely info and reminders about vaccination appointments, but integrating a ride-booking service or appointment reminder directly in the Uber app that most users already have on their phone anyway could be another very effective way to increase success rates for first and follow-up inoculation visits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Uber has already <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/10-million-rides/">offered up free and discounted rides</a> to help lower the friction of actually going out and getting a vaccine, but a product-level integration could do a lot more than that by providing easy, user-friendly access. As noted, this is still just one of the options being discussed, but if Uber and Moderna are willing to commit it to print, that at least means they&#8217;re serious about trying to find a way. We&#8217;re holding them to account, too, so rest assured we&#8217;ll follow up on their progress as this collaboration develops.</p>
