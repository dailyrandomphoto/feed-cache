										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If China once seemed to be committed to the free market economy, over the course of 2021, it has shattered that illusion entirely by abruptly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/technology/china-didi-crackdown.html">disempowering</a> its own tech companies and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/10/11/china-moves-ban-news-outlets-not-funded-communist-party/">turning up the dials</a> on media censorship at the direction of a president who, three years ago, oversaw the erasure of presidential limits from the country&#8217;s constitution. (These were a short-lived experiment, in any case, given that China has been &#8220;dominated for thousands of years by absolute monarchs,&#8221; as NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/14/593155818/why-abolishing-chinas-presidential-term-limits-is-such-a-big-deal">noted</a> at the time, with term limits first introduced in the 1980s.)</p>
<p>The U.S., and Silicon Valley in particular, needs to be paying <em>much</em> closer attention to this consolidation of power, suggests Jacob Helberg, who is co-chair of the Brookings Institution China Strategy Initiative, a former senior advisor to Stanford&#8217;s Cyber Policy Institute, and a former news policy lead at Google. (He was also an advisor to U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg during his presidential campaign.) In a gripping new book titled <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wires-War-Technology-Global-Struggle-ebook/dp/B08VJMR39C">The Wires of War: Technology and the Global Struggle for Power</a></em>, Helberg lays out how China&#8217;s &#8220;techno-totalitarian&#8221; regime may be first impacting the Chinese people (its &#8220;first victims,&#8221; he says), but why its efforts to increasingly control the software and the hardware of the internet are a real and present &#8212; and fast-escalating &#8212; danger to the U.S. and democracies everywhere.</p>
<p>Indeed, he says, one need look no further than India &#8212; which seemed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/28/us/politics/china-india-hacking-electricity.html">receive a warning</a> by the Chinese government last year when the power went out in a city of 20 million people &#8212; of what could be coming to the U.S. absent drastic and unified action on the part of private industry and the federal government. He talked us yesterday in a chat that has been edited for length.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217894" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>TC: You started your job at Google, focusing on its global news policies, just ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Given that so much attention was paid at the time to Russia and its misinformation campaigns, I&#8217;m surprised you didn&#8217;t write a book about U.S.-Russia relations.</strong></p>
<p>JH: Well, there are really two fronts to this &#8220;gray&#8221; war: the front-end software battle to control what people see on their screens, which has a lot of different players, with Russia one of the first movers in the space with respect to foreign interference. Then there is the back-end hardware front of the war that&#8217;s focused on the physical internet and the physical infrastructure of the internet. Ultimately, one of the reasons that the book primarily focuses on China is because the most decisive area of this war is going to be about controlling that physical internet infrastructure. If you control the infrastructure of the internet, you can basically control or compromise anything that runs on top of it. If you control the back end, you can also compromise and control the front end. That&#8217;s why we should be placing far more substantial effort [on the latter].</p>
<p><strong>TC: By back end, you mean things like cellular phones, satellites, fiber optic cables, 5G networks, and artificial intelligence.</strong></p>
<p>JC: Artificial intelligence is interesting because it&#8217;s obviously a combination of software and hardware, but yes, it&#8217;s basically fiber optic cables, 5G satellites, low orbit satellites, and so forth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: In the book, you quickly highlight China&#8217;s alleged attacks on India last year, which shut down trains and the stock market and forced hospitals to rely on emergency generators. Do you think we&#8217;ve seen [attacks] in the U.S. that the public, at least, didn&#8217;t connect to China?</strong></p>
<p>JC: One of the core attributes of the gray war &#8212; one of the reasons why governments are leaning so heavily into new gray zone tactics is because sometimes it&#8217;s really hard to [assign] attribution. We have a system where a lot of our internet is run by private companies. Unlike in China, we actually have private companies that are completely separated from the U.S. government. Because of our privatized system, there are certain market and legal incentives for private companies to underreport cyber security breaches. If you&#8217;re a company that experiences cyber security breach, you are a victim [that] can also be held to [account] because you can be held to be negligent in certain cases. So companies sometimes are very wary of reporting cyber security breaches.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also really genuinely hard to do attribution sometimes. So it&#8217;s not impossible that we&#8217;ve seen similar types of cyber attacks in the U.S. as were carried out in India, but we do know [for a fact] that we have had substantial cyber attacks on the U. S., with many people from the intelligence community concerned about the integrity of our energy grid. The Office of Personnel Management has obviously been hacked, which is important because that basically means that China now has a list of a lot of government employees with access to top-secret information. The list [of cyber attacks] is very long.</p>
<p><strong>TC: But you think the India hack was still a warning to us all.</strong></p>
<p>JH: The reason that hack was so historically significant is it was the first signal that if this gray war were to turn hotter, it could potentially be one of the first wars that we have experienced since the the Revolutionary War where we actually see significant physical destruction on our homeland carried out by a foreign actor. With the exception of 911 and with the exception of the Civil War, which was an internal war, we&#8217;ve never seen a foreign power actually reach our shores and and carry out mass destruction. [Given] the cyber attack that was carried out on India, you could imagine a scenario where, if our relationship with China really went south, that&#8217;d be a potential . . . well, we would have to make sure that our nuclear power plants are awfully safe.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you think we should we respond to this threat? The U.S. government has taken a very strong position against Huawei and its bid to build infrastructure in the United States. You point out that companies like Zoom have a lot of Chinese employees and potential exposure to Chinese intelligence. Where do we draw the line? And how does the government marshal a response that also protects the rights of businesses?</strong></p>
<p>JH: It&#8217;s such an important question for the critical juncture that we find ourselves in currently, especially with the looming risk of a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan. I&#8217;m a very big proponent of the idea of the U.S government establishing an outbound CFIUS framework. We right now have a framework that provides the U.S. government with the ability to review and potentially block any inbound investments from a foreign country on the grounds of national security; the basic idea would be to apply the same framework for outbound investments. So basically, give the U.S. government the tools to review on grounds of national security any investment from the United States to outside of the United States and particularly to China, because over time, as we&#8217;ve seen when American companies pour billions of dollars into China, that can sometimes pose some real problems.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How realistic do you think that is given the financial incentives that companies have to continue expanding into China?</strong></p>
<p>JCH: There are already proposals making their way through the halls of Congress that trend in that direction and that are somewhat analogous to what I&#8217;m suggesting, so I think these ideas are very much on the horizon. As for when these issues are going to become pressing enough to be prioritized by Congress and get the kind of support needed to make it to the President&#8217;s desk might actually be driven by a crisis, because obviously in Washington, a lot of things happens in moments of crisis, unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Yes and no. Look at gun control in the U.S. But it&#8217;s interesting the way you frame this away from the idea that the U.S. versus China is a competition because there really are no mutually observed rules, even if at times in the past, it has seemed so.</strong></p>
<p>JH: When you say that it&#8217;s a competition, you&#8217;re communicating the embedded assumption that you can afford to lose, because when you&#8217;re in a competition, you can afford to win or lose. We compete with the Germans and the Japanese commercially all the time, but if Toyota sells more cars than General Motors, it&#8217;s really not that big of a deal. It&#8217;s the marketplace; we operate on a level playing field along rules that we mutually abide by. The reason &#8220;war&#8221; is much more accurate and apt for the current set of circumstances with China is because because we&#8217;re talking about a political struggle and the outcome is about the political survival of our system and it gives you a certain level of mental clarity about how to prioritize certain things that are necessary ti treat this challenge with the level of determination and urgency that&#8217;s needed to produce a successful outcome.</p>
<p>The other thing is that when you&#8217;re in a war, you&#8217;re much more willing to absorb short-term costs to produce a successful result. During World War Two, General Motors was building tanks and airplanes and we really mobilized as a country. Here, we&#8217;re obviously not asking Apple to build aircraft carriers, but one of the short-term costs that we need to seriously start thinking about is: how much is it going to cost for us to move our supply chains out of China? Because that&#8217;s going to cost money and require effort, and it&#8217;s going to be hard. But the potential cost of us being cut off from access to our supply chains is so high that it&#8217;s worth the relatively lower costs of putting in the effort, energy, and time to do this before it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p><strong>TC: In the book, you note that this decoupling of economic foreign policy from national security objectives dates back to the Cold War. Now you&#8217;re suggesting an outbound CFIUS program and moving all of our supply chains out of China. What other incentives do you think that private industry needs in order to wean itself off China or focus less on it as huge market opportunity?</strong></p>
<p>JH: A lot of the programs that have worked in the past often boil down to carrots and sticks, and I think a combination of certain penalties that are applied to disincentivize [investors and outfits] from engaging in highly sensitive investments in China, [while also] incentivizing other types of behavior, like trading with other countries that do not pose risks to the U.S. or democracy, is probably going to be the mix that succeeds and resonates with the business community.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You also make the distinction that the U.S. is at war with the authoritarian government of China, not the people of China. Very unfortunately, that message doesn&#8217;t seem to be getting through to everyone.</strong></p>
<p>JH: It&#8217;s really worth repeating when when I talk about a gray war and in our national debates about our issues with China that this is not about anything that has to do with the Chinese people or Chinese culture but instead the political regime and the [Chinese Communist Party].</p>
<p>Part of why we&#8217;re on the right side of this equation is that the first victims &#8212; and the people who have suffered the most at the hands of the CCP &#8212; are the Chinese people. It&#8217;s important to remember that Uighurs, Tibetans and political dissidents are Chinese nationals, too, even though they&#8217;re treated as third-class citizens. And those are who we also need to keep in mind because Chinese state news media will often try to promote the narrative that any talk of a hard stance against China is racist.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We sat down with Radenbaugh to talk about the e-bike revolution, diversifying the supply chain and building a product that's made for how people want to use it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rad Power Bikes founder Mike Radenbaugh grew up among the Redwood trees on the Lost Coast of Northern California with &#8220;tree hugger parents and tree hugger neighbors,&#8221; and a life connected to nature. This exposed the founder not only to alternative ways of living that are more responsible to the planet but also to alternative energy. As a young teenager watching the electric vehicle space, Radenbaugh became energized seeing electric motorcycles and cars popping up but was impatient with their slow commercialization.</p>
<p>When Radenbaugh was 15, he built his first e-bike hacking together parts he ordered from Radio Shack and eBay with the money he saved from his job as a bellboy at the one hotel in town. This was back in 2007, and despite his young age, Radenbaugh says this is the year Rad Power Bikes was founded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started advertising in the local newspaper and they gave me the first ad free I think because I went in as this punk kid and they felt sympathy for me,&#8221; Radenbaugh told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, Radenbaugh continued as a sole proprietor building bespoke e-bikes for people who&#8217;d reach out looking for something fast and powerful to replace their car journeys. Along the way, he says he really got to understand what it was customers wanted and what was missing from the marketplace.</p>
<p>With all this knowledge and hands-on experience buffering him, in 2015, Radenbaugh relaunched Rad Power Bikes as a direct-to-consumer business. He and his growing team set to work perfecting the business model, adding in company-owned retail stores and mobile service centers around the country, partnering with a big network of bike shops and building a massive-scale supply chain.</p>
<p>Now, the company has 615 staff members with plans to hire more, over 350,000 customers and is producing bikes in six countries. The company&#8217;s getting big, and it&#8217;s getting big fast, with reported sales in 2019 of $100 million.</p>
<p>That number only increased in 2020, in large part due to the COVID-related boom in e-bike sales generally. Earlier this year, the company raised $150 million to scale globally, the largest funding round of a U.S. electric bike startup. But as the world begins to wrangle coronavirus to a point where cities are opening up, will this boom in e-bike sales last?</p>
<p>We sat down with Radenbaugh to talk about the e-bike revolution, diversifying the supply chain and building a product that&#8217;s made for how people want to use it.</p>
<p><i>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>
<p><b>What would you say is different about your business model compared to the competition? Companies like VanMoof have also been scoring large funding rounds lately.</b></p>
<p>Being user-friendly is consistent across the whole lineup. We popularized fat tires on e-bikes, we popularized throttles on e-bikes, so our customers could have more power. None of those things really existed; they were just super nascent and more part of the DIY community until we commercialized them. So both of those features I think are kind of pivotal to the DNA of our business, and it just so turns out that we just knew something early on that a lot of people didn&#8217;t by listening to the customer — that the bike shouldn&#8217;t only be pedal assisted. They should be more substantial and really move your butt from point A to point B.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The massive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/hacker-leaks-twitch-source-code-and-creator-payout-data/">Twitch hack</a> last week was just the latest example of a high-profile breach that has the security industry in a frenzy. Everyone is asking themselves how this could happen, how such a large store of critical data — the source code! — could be taken out without tripping any alarms, how a company with Amazon-level security resources, literally, seemed to find out about the breach only once it started spreading on 4chan.</p>
<p>While security pros wait anxiously to unpack and understand the “part 2” reveal from the hackers, it’s becoming apparent that passwords and user emails are probably coming next, though evidence of this data is already being uncovered by researchers, <a href="https://threatpost.com/twitch-leak-emails-passwords/175390/">according to Threat Post.</a></p>
<p>The PR nightmare for Twitch is only just beginning, and now millions of users’ personal, plain text information will soon percolate among threat actors looking to capitalize on the trove of data released in this hack.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218042" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>First, it goes without saying that Twitch users need to cycle their passwords immediately and enable multifactor authentication on their accounts if they haven’t done so already; that’s just good security hygiene. Twitch, for its part, <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1446033897234513920?s=20">reset all stream keys</a> “out of an abundance of caution” and has been able to keep its platform online throughout the crisis. In itself, that’s impressive and notable during such a massive incident.</p>
<h2>Ongoing shifts in attack tactics</h2>
<p>Beyond the immediately compelling parts of this story — from the enormity of creator payouts to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716184/twitch-hack-jeff-bezos-pictures-defaced">trolling Jeff Bezos</a> — the nature of this attack and the shift toward extortion rather than demanding ransoms is serious and significant.</p>
<p>Breached organizations who’ve lost control of their data no longer have the binary choice of paying for decryption keys or rebuilding from backups. It’s a signal that the calculus for businesses in times of crisis is becoming exponentially more complex when a threat actor’s objective is extortion instead of a straightforward ransomware payout.</p>
<p>Twitch won’t be the last example of this emerging and vexing tactic; one that seems to be gaining momentum.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Staying ahead of the game</h2>
<p>I’ll give Twitch the benefit of the doubt and assume it had fairly mature security operations and incident response planning — two elements that companies often woefully underinvest in until it’s too late.</p>
<p>But the situation is a sobering reminder that even when an organization does everything right, there’s still no 100% prevention, and threat actors just have to find one vulnerability to take action. The name of the game, now, is a well-tested, well-documented plan and establishing the response your company wants to have when the unthinkable happens.</p>
<p>Who makes the ultimate decisions? What do you need to shut down and when? Who gets called and in what order? It’s infinitely easier to have these discussions when it’s not a <em>hair-on-fire</em> situation. When the inevitable happens, the company and its response need to be battle tested.</p>
<p>While the full scope of Twitch’s hack remains to be seen, it’s an eye-opening situation that everyone should study as a cautionary tale. Even mature, well-resourced systems can be penetrated, and threat actors are keen to wreak havoc and take control of data without locking it up in ransomware.</p>
<p>Companies must plan and be diligent on process and documentation, and also ensure they’re doing everything possible to detect and minimize the impact to keep themselves protected. They must keep playing an unfair game that’s getting progressively more complicated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-10-14-Tinder-Launches-A-New-Way-to-Find-a-Plus-One-Ahead-of-Busiest-Wedding-Season-in-35-years">announced on Thursday</a> that it’s rolling out a new way for its users to find a plus one for the upcoming end-of-year wedding season. Starting today, users will be able to join the &#8220;Plus One&#8221; option within the app to signal that they are either looking for a date to a wedding or are willing to be one. The new feature is accessible within <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/tinder-adds-a-new-home-for-interactive-social-features-with-launch-of-tinder-explore/">Tinder’s Explore</a> section, which launched last month and offers ways to discover matches by interests and more.</p>
<p>“We know many of our members are looking for a Plus One for their next wedding and we’re excited to now give them a way to do exactly that on Tinder,” said Kyle Miller, the vice-president of product innovation at Tinder, in a <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-10-14-Tinder-Launches-A-New-Way-to-Find-a-Plus-One-Ahead-of-Busiest-Wedding-Season-in-35-years">blog post.</a></p>
<p>Tinder is also partnering with WeddingWire, a wedding planning resource company, to help single guests cover the costs of wedding season through a new Wedding Grant giveaway.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218272" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Starting today, the first 100 eligible Tinder users to join Plus One will receive $460 to help cover the costs associated with upcoming weddings, such as travel, gifts and accommodations. WeddingWire found that guests spend an average of $460 to attend a wedding, which is why this amount was chosen for the giveaway.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218278" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218278" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218278" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tinder</p></div></p>
<p>Tinder says users are already gearing up for wedding season, as mentions of a “plus one” in Tinder bios have increased 45% since the beginning of the year. With this latest feature, Tinder users will be able to directly search for a date to a wedding instead of having to weed through uninterested candidates.</p>
<p>This latest launch comes as Tinder has been rolling out new features to engage with users and give them more options to find and interact with dates. For instance, the aforementioned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/tinder-adds-a-new-home-for-interactive-social-features-with-launch-of-tinder-explore/">new Explore section</a> features events, as well as new ways to discover matches by interests. It also allows users to dive into quick conversations with others before a match is made.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tinder also recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/lyft-now-lets-you-pay-for-your-tinder-dates-ride/">partnered with Lyft</a> last week to allow users to pay for their date’s ride. The feature doesn’t require users to exchange addresses or locations and instead lets you send a credit to your date that lets them book a ride.</p>
<p>In addition to these social features, Tinder has also been focused on releasing safety tools for its users. For example, the company announced in August that it plans to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/tinder-will-soon-make-voluntary-id-verification-available-globally/">voluntary ID verification</a> available globally. In June, Tinder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/tinder-finally-adds-a-block-contacts-feature/">released a feature</a> that lets users upload their phone contacts and block certain people that they’d rather not see on the app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The new version of Nintendo&#8217;s hit Switch console is just different enough to justify itself, but hardly a must-buy for any of the millions who bought the launch version. With a bigger, brighter, and better screen, it&#8217;s a good choice for someone buying now who intends to use it mostly as a handheld — but if you&#8217;re planning or already using your Switch primarily as a stationary console, there pretty much no reason to upgrade. All the same, there will probably be a lot of units moving this holiday season.</p>
<p>Even at the best of times it can be hard to tell what Nintendo&#8217;s hardware strategy is, or whether there is indeed a strategy at all. The $350 <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/oled-model/">Switch OLED</a> provides a perfect example of this: at a time when rivals Sony and Microsoft are striving to show that their next-gen console is the most powerful, Nintendo releases an almost identical version of a console that was underpowered when it came out five years ago. Is it faltering? Or is it just that confident?</p>
<p>Signs point to neither — the rumor being that a <em>new</em> new Switch, with upgraded internals and a new screen but identical form factor, was planned for this year but the pandemic and chip shortage rendered this impossible. Making the best of the situation — or so the story goes — Nintendo slapped the OLED screens on the original hardware and is selling it as a minor quality-of-life update, the way it iterated on the 3DS for years. Nintendo has denied pretty much all accounts and speculation, but this story (again, just rumors) has the right smell.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2213919" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know what to say about the result; on one hand, it&#8217;s plainly better than the original. On the other, it&#8217;s only better by a small amount, and for some people, no amount at all.</p>
<p>The screen itself is obviously the biggest improvement. I had the pleasure of playing <em>Metroid: Dread</em> on it, and the game&#8217;s fast-moving, colorful, high contrast environments looked fantastic on it. The darker darks of the OLED screen made the light areas and colors pop more (though measurements have shown peak brightness is actually lower), and the additional screen real estate, while it looks minimal in photos, does in fact matter in person, making details, UI and text that much more comprehensible.</p>
<p>Oh, and the dust it attracts really stands out on that all-black frontage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218220" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218220" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218220" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2218220" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Darrell Etherington</p></div></p>
<p>The clarity seems improved in motion by the OLED&#8217;s faster individual pixel refresh rate, leaving less of a feeling of one frame blurring into the next. The original Switch&#8217;s screen is just fine, to be clear, but it&#8217;s clearly outmatched here.</p>
<p>The color has a different cast to it than the original&#8217;s LCD, but in games most people won&#8217;t notice: a shift towards the green where the old one tends toward magenta to my eye. Interestingly there are &#8220;vivid&#8221; and &#8220;standard&#8221; options on the OLED model deep in the settings; &#8220;vivid&#8221; was pre-selected and I certainly found it pleasant, giving a bit more saturation to the image but not to the point where it&#8217;s bothersome.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218218" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218218" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218218" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg" alt="The Nintendo Switch OLED on a table." width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2218218" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Darrell Etherington</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to this, the build quality feels better in general. The flimsy kickstand has been made far more beefy and adjustable, and the whole thing feels better put together. Although there are no significant changes to the internals, a slightly improved thermal profile should mean it runs a little cooler and uses the fans more sparingly. The speakers have supposedly been improved, but are still pretty much a last resort.</p>
<p>The Switch OLED comes with 64 GB of internal space, which is a nice upgrade from the 32 on the original. Of course everyone is going to put a micro SD card in there anyway, but the system volume is preferred and now there&#8217;s just that much less need to archive old games.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re someone who plays their Switch games primarily on the device itself, or plans to, the Switch OLED is simply a superior device. I would not say it&#8217;s worth paying full price again to upgrade, but it&#8217;s definitely worth the $50 extra should you need to buy a new console after gifting or selling your first. (It&#8217;s $150 more than the handheld-only Lite, but to me the tradeoff of no TV mode has always been too much to justify.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218216" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218216" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218216" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg" alt="The Nintendo Switch OLED on a table." width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2218216" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Darrell Etherington</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, if you — like me — tend to keep the Switch in its dock at all times except when traveling, almost nothing will change. There is technically a new dock, a bit more solid-feeling as well, and featuring an ethernet connection for those who love wires, but pretty much everything else will be the same for you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s beyond question that the Switch OLED is the best way to play Switch games right now, but even so no one should feel the need to upgrade. Who knows when the next generation of Nintendo consoles will arrive? I think even Nintendo isn&#8217;t quite sure on that. So for now hold onto your cash unless your existing Switch is beat up or would do more good in someone else&#8217;s hands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its annual developer conference Thursday, Roblox painted a picture of what’s next for the fast-growing online multiplayer portal that’s like catnip for kids and teens.</p>
<p>In his keynote, Roblox co-founder and CEO David Baszucki outlined plans to spruce up player avatars, introduce new in-game monetization streams and streamline the experience for developers dreaming up the user-generated content that turned the company into a massive success at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/">intersection of gaming and social networking</a>.</p>
<p>Roblox is known for its blocky, relatively unsophisticated character models and game graphics, but the style hasn’t dampened the company’s explosive growth. Still, Roblox is working to make player avatars more life-like and customizable, choices that fit well with the company’s aspirations, both to keep the platform attractive as its young core user base ages up and to enable many forms of self expression across its endless hub of virtual worlds.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217835" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think people are going to realize Roblox is not just one thing,&#8221; Roblox Chief Product Officer Manuel Bronstein told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Roblox announced a few meaningful changes in this direction. The first is layered clothing, a visual update that will make avatar outfits more realistic and dynamic, so your favorite Roblox virtual jean jacket will fit your character model whether you’re a humanoid version of yourself or a dinosaur. Clothing will fall around avatars and drape naturally, like it would in a more photorealistic game.</p>
<p>The newly announced Roblox avatar updates aim to inject both more customization and more realism into the blocky Lego-like looks that are synonymous with the platform now. Bronstein described the changes as a “huge evolution” of the avatars at the core of the Roblox social experience. “Self-identity is a crucial pillar of the metaverse, and the ability to precisely customize your clothing to your unique avatar is paramount in personal expression,” Baszucki said in the keynote.</p>
<p>Given the booming business of selling in-game items, Roblox has plenty of financial incentives to make its virtual fashion scene more sophisticated and life-like. It&#8217;s also got to keep up with competitors like Epic Games, which sets the bar with both its Fortnite character designs and its brand partnerships, which can bring in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/05/11/epic-reveals-it-made-50-million-from-one-set-of-fortnite-skins/?sh=25608c453903">$50 million in a single go</a>. Roblox has its own <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/06/roblox-warner-bros-pictures-bring-heights-launch-party-roblox/">brand and IP deals</a>, but the more good looking virtual <em>stuff</em> you have floating around for sale, the sweeter those deals will be.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2218200" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218200" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2218200" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AvatarGif.gif?w=680" alt="Roblox avatar updates" width="680" height="339" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218200" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roblox</p></div></p>
<p>In the vein of building toward more realism, Roblox is also giving developers beta access to what it calls “dynamic heads” — facial animations for avatars that could even be interwoven with facial tracking to make a character model’s mouth move along with what it’s saying. Roblox is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/roblox-buys-digital-avatar-startup-loom-ai/">tapping its acquisition of Loom.ai</a>, a digital avatar startup the company bought in late 2020. The company says that devs will be start playing around with the new facial animations starting with a handful of head designs that evoke the platform’s blocky roots. The first iteration of facial animation in Roblox won&#8217;t be rolling out to users yet, but the company wants to get it into developers&#8217; hands, the first step in that process.</p>

<p>With Roblox continuing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/roblox-voice-chat-spatial-audio/">big voice chat rollout</a> it announced last month, the company is quickly pushing its previously text chat-centered experience toward more natural, immersive interactions. The company also noted Thursday that all eligible users who are 13 years old and up are now able to opt into age verification, a screening process that will give some players early access to new features as they make their way to the full player base. Verified users will begin getting access to Roblox’s new voice chat abilities “starting later this fall.”</p>

<p>Beyond improving the avatar experience, Roblox also announced plans to introduce limited edition items, an interesting new way for people to make money (in the form of Robux, which can be traded for actual bucks) from its bustling in-game economy. Roblox creators can put items they design up for sale for a set period of time or in a limited run, building an element of collectability into the game’s well established virtual economies.</p>
<p>Creators can also generate money off of subsequent sales by enabling royalties — a perk that Roblox’s in-game items will share with some NFTs. “The idea is that you [will] eventually be able to set the rules of what happens in the resale of an item,” Bronstein told TechCrunch, noting the NFT connection.</p>
<p>Developers will also be able to enjoy more flexibility while creating content for the platform through a new system Roblox calls Open Cloud. Open Cloud will allow developers to create content in third party tools and then plug that into Roblox, rather than being restricted to Roblox Studio, the company&#8217;s own developer environment.</p>
<p>The company is making a push for the cloud, granting content creators on Roblox more data storage and generally making the platform an attractive, versatile developer destination. Roblox also announced some graphics improvements that developers can start to play with, like more realistic collision physics and aerodynamics that could portray a visual like a parachute deploying.</p>
<p>In 2021, the company is on track to pay out $500 million to developers who craft content for its user generated game worlds — up from 70 million three years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the metaverse is going to be fully user generated,” Bronstein said. “And we think that by empowering everybody to be a creator we’re going to get more immersiveness and a larger variety of [experiences] on the platform.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp is beginning to roll out a new feature that will provide its two billion users the option to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/whatsapp-encrypt-cloud-backup/">encrypt their chat history backup in iCloud or Google Drive,</a> patching a major loophole that has been exploited by governments to obtain and review private communication between individuals.</p>
<p>WhatsApp has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/whatsapp-completes-end-to-end-encryption-rollout/">long encrypted chats</a> between users on its app. But users have had no means to protect the backup of those chats stored in the cloud. (For iPhone users, the chat history is stored in iCloud, and Android users rely on Google Drive.)</p>
<p>It has been <a href="https://fixitalready.eff.org/apple/#/">widely reported</a> that law enforcement agencies across the globe have been able to access the private communications between suspect individuals on WhatsApp by exploiting this loophole.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218014" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>WhatsApp, which processes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/whatsapp-is-now-delivering-roughly-100-billion-messages-a-day/">over 100 billion messages a day</a>, is closing that weak link, and tells TechCrunch that it&#8217;s providing this new feature to users in every market where the app is operational. The feature is optional, the company said. (It’s not uncommon for companies to withhold privacy features for legal and regulatory reasons. Apple’s new encrypted browsing feature isn&#8217;t available to users in certain authoritarian regimes, such as China, Belarus, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, Uganda and the Philippines.)</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive of Facebook, noted that WhatsApp is the first global messaging service at this scale to offer end-to-end encrypted messaging and backups. &#8220;Proud of the team for continuing to lead on security for your private conversations,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113985819851701">wrote</a> in a post on his Facebook page.</p>
<p>WhatsApp began testing the feature with a small group of users last month. The company devised a system to enable WhatsApp users on Android and iOS to lock their chat backups with encryption keys. WhatsApp says it will offer users two ways to encrypt their cloud backups.</p>
<p>Users on WhatsApp will see an option to generate a 64-digit encryption key to protect their chat backups in the cloud. Users can store the encryption key offline or in a password manager of their choice, or they can create a password that backs up their encryption key in a cloud-based “backup key vault” that WhatsApp has developed. The cloud-stored encryption key can’t be used without the user’s password, which isn’t known to WhatsApp.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“While end-to-end encrypted messages you send and receive are stored on your device, many people also want a way to back up their chats in case they lose their phone,” the company wrote in a blog post.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218296" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218296" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218296" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/whatsapp-cloud-backup-encryption.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/whatsapp-cloud-backup-encryption.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/whatsapp-cloud-backup-encryption.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/whatsapp-cloud-backup-encryption.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/whatsapp-cloud-backup-encryption.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/whatsapp-cloud-backup-encryption.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/whatsapp-cloud-backup-encryption.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218296" class="wp-caption-text">The feature can be accessible by navigating to Settings &gt; Chats &gt; Chat Backups &gt; End-to-End Encrypted Backup (<strong>Image Credits:</strong> WhatsApp)</p></div></p>
<p>As we wrote last month, the move to introduce this additional layer of privacy is significant and one that can have far-reaching implications.</p>
<h3>Thoughts, governments?</h3>
<p>End-to-end encryption remains a thorny topic of discussion as governments across the globe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/20/encryption-backdoor-bill-dangerous-lofgren/">continue to lobby for backdoors</a>. Apple was pressured to not add encryption to iCloud Backups after the FBI complained, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZK1CT">according to Reuters</a>, and while Google has offered users the ability to encrypt their data stored in Google Drive, the company reportedly didn’t tell governments before it rolled out the feature.</p>
<p>India, WhatsApp&#8217;s biggest market by users, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">introduced a new law</a> that requires the company to devise a way to make &#8220;traceability&#8221; of questionable messages possible. WhatsApp has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatsapp-sues-india-government/">sued the Indian government</a> over this new mandate, and said such a requirement effectively mandates &#8220;a new form of mass surveillance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.K. government &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/yes-the-uk-now-has-a-law-to-log-web-users-browsing-behavior-hack-devices-and-limit-encryption/">isn&#8217;t exactly a fan of encryption</a> &#8212; recently asked messaging apps to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/uk-tells-messaging-apps-not-to-use-e2e-encryption-for-kids-accounts/">not use end-to-end encryption for kids&#8217; accounts</a>. Elsewhere in the world, Australia <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-46463029">passed controversial laws</a> three years ago that are designed to force tech companies to provide police and security agencies access to encrypted chats.</p>
<p>WhatsApp declined to discuss whether it had consulted with lawmakers or government agencies about the new feature.</p>
<p>Privacy-focused organizations including Electronic Frontier Foundation have lauded WhatsApp’s move.</p>
<p>“This privacy win from Facebook-owned WhatsApp is striking in its contrast to Apple, which has been under fire recently for its plans for on-device scanning of photos that minors send on Messages, as well as of every photo that any Apple user uploads to iCloud. While Apple has paused to consider more feedback on its plans, there’s still no sign that they will include fixing one of its longstanding privacy pitfalls: no effective encryption across iCloud backups,” the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/whats-whatsapp-encrypted-backups">organization wrote</a>.</p>
<p>“WhatsApp is raising the bar, and Apple and others should follow suit.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The successful commercial launches of Blue Origin, SpaceX and Virgin Galactic have officially ushered in a new era of space tourism. But unlike these companies, which are planning on taking people to space using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">rockets</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/virgin-galactic-and-richard-branson-celebrate-launch-of-first-passengers-into-space/">spaceplanes</a>, two-year-old startup <a href="https://www.spaceperspective.com/">Space Perspective</a> is taking a different tack.</p>
<p>Instead of going to space on a rocket, which are prohibitively expensive to develop and may not appeal to all customers, the startup plans to offer rides to the stratosphere using a capsule attached to a large balloon. Its plans have attracted investor interest: the company said Thursday it had raised a $40 million Series A to take it through to its first planned commercial flights in late 2024.</p>
<p>Space Perspective has already collected 475 reservations, each of which was secured by a deposit between $10,000-$25,000, depending on how soon the passenger is looking to fly. The total cost of a seat is $125,000.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218213" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Not going the rocket route has its trade-offs. While a balloon ride is significantly cheaper, and may appeal to more risk-averse customers, customers won’t go quite as high into the atmosphere and won&#8217;t experience any weightlessness. Instead of hitting or surpassing the Kármán line, the internationally recognized but ultimately invisible boundary delineating “space” at 50 miles above sea level, the stratospheric balloon will take customers to around 20 miles above Earth. (This is still significantly higher than a commercial airplane ride, which only reaches around 7 miles above sea level.)</p>
<p>But Space Perspective promises that its six-hour ride will still offer spectacular views, especially of the curvature of the Earth and the blackness of space. The plan is for the space balloon to gradually ascend for two hours at 12 miles per hour, glide at apogee for two hours, then spend the final hours of the flight gradually descending. The capsule will splash down in the ocean, where eight customers plus one pilot will be scooped up by a ship, similar to how NASA and SpaceX retrieve their crewed capsules.</p>
<p>There are other perks to not going quite so high: From the description, it sounds like the Space Perspective balloon ride will look and feel more like a first-class commercial flight with any major airline today, rather than an astronaut launch. Customers will apparently have access to Wi-Fi and even a bar. No special training will be required, either; a company spokesperson said the pre-flight safety briefing will be similar to that delivered by flight attendants today.</p>
<p>The company has already hit a major milestone, successfully launching from the Space Coast Spaceport in Florida an uncrewed, unpressurized full-sized capsule simulator to target altitude in June. The next series of test flights will also be uncrewed, followed by the first piloted test flight in 2023.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Space Perspective was founded by husband and wife and co-CEOs Jane Poynter and Taber MacCallum. The pair were crew members of Biosphere 2, an ambitious and eccentric project to recreate Earth’s conditions in an enclosed system. They later founded Paragon Space Development Corporation, which develops life-support systems for astronauts, and World View Enterprises, a company developing stratospheric balloons for remote sensing. Earlier this month, World View also announced it would offer stratospheric balloon rides by 2024, for $50,000.</p>
<p>The Series A was led by Prime Movers Lab, with additional participation by new investors LightShed Ventures, the Explorer 1 Fund and Yamauchi no.10 Family Office. Additional investors include Tony Robbins, VC firms E2MC and SpaceFund, Kirenaga Partners, Base Ventures and 1517 Fund.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At minimum, we can say that public markets are as welcoming to high-growth SaaS as private markets. And perhaps, with GitLab's IPO pricing, slightly warmer.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sitting here waiting for GitLab to actually start trading, I&#8217;m still digesting the company&#8217;s IPO price.</p>
<p>When we first caught up with GitLab&#8217;s IPO filing, TechCrunch did a little math magic and decided that it wasn&#8217;t unlikely that the company would manage to secure a $10 billion valuation in its debut.</p>
<p>At that price point, everyone looked set to make a killing; even the company&#8217;s most recent investors would see a quick return on their final capital into the DevOps unicorn. The company was last valued on the private markets at around $6 billion in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/-gitlab-valued-over-6-billion-in-secondary-share-sale.html">secondary sale of its equity a year ago,</a> and the last primary price put on GitLab was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/gitlab-hauls-in-268m-series-e-on-2-768b-valuation/">less than $3 billion back in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>The company surpassed our calculations.</p>
<p>From an initial IPO price range of $55 to $60, GitLab <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/gitlab-raises-ipo-range-targeting-valuation-of-as-much-as-11b/">raised its targets sharply to $66 to $69 per share</a>. It was not a surprise to see the company aim higher in its IPO pricing given that its first numbers felt a little soft. The scale of the gap between the company&#8217;s first and second IPO price range, however, was a jolt.</p>
<p>Then the company went and <a href="https://ir.gitlab.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gitlab-announces-pricing-initial-public-offering">priced at $77 per share</a>, once again air-gapping its preceding valuation estimate.</p>
<p>GitLab&#8217;s 143,534,821 shares outstanding at its IPO price were worth $11.1 billion. Doing a bit more math, the company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation lands around the $12.6 billion mark.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s IPO is, therefore, a success from a fundraising and valuation perspective; if the company&#8217;s stock pops sharply when it does begin to trade, apportion mispricing blame to both investment bankers and the former startup&#8217;s private backers that valued the company at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/gitlab-com-series-e--da5548fa">less than $3 billion back in late 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking when we consider the company&#8217;s IPO pricing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue growth is good, but revenue growth with top-tier SaaS metrics is god tier:</strong> Working to figure out just why GitLab was so far off in its first IPO price range is not easy. There is not a single answer. But I reckon that GitLab&#8217;s excellent SaaS metrics likely helped because they paint a picture of a company with much growth baked into its results. For example, in 2020, GitLab had net retention of 148%. During the <em>pandemic</em>. That number scaled to 152% in H1 2021. It&#8217;s going to prove hard to slow GitLab, regardless of what happens economically. So, in a sense, net retention is an effective hedge against macroeconomic slowdown. Which did <em>not</em> harm GitLab&#8217;s IPO pricing.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The math is pretty basic. How many satellites are going to go up over the next decade? How many solar panels will they need? And how many are being manufactured that fit the bill? Turns out the answers are: a lot, a <em>hell</em> of a lot and not nearly enough. <a href="https://regher.com/">That&#8217;s where Regher Solar aims to make its mark</a>, by bringing the cost of space-quality solar panels down by 90% while making an order of magnitude more of them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not exactly a modest goal, but fortunately the science and market seem to be in favor, giving the company something of a tailwind. The question is finding the right balance between cost and performance while remaining relatively easy to manufacture. Of course, if there was an easy answer <em>there</em>, someone would already be doing that.</p>
<p>Solar cells for use on the planet&#8217;s surface are very different from the ones being used in space. Because down here there are few size and mass limitations; you can make the cells bigger, heavier and less efficient — and much cheaper. Space solar cells, on the other hand, need to be highly efficient, extremely light and resistant to the various dangers of space, such as radiation and temperature fluctuation: a top-tier product that costs five-10 times as much and uses small-scale processes and expensive materials.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216466" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Regher Solar has created a space-grade solar cell that, while it doesn&#8217;t reach those dedicated space solar levels, isn&#8217;t that far off — yet costs a fraction as much and can be made at scale with existing processes. If you&#8217;re making a single $200 million geostationary satellite, you don&#8217;t mind paying for the best panels out there, since it&#8217;s only a small part of the overall cost. But if you&#8217;re looking to deploy 10,000 small satellites with short lifespans, panels start making up a lot more of your bill of materials, and a 20% performance hit doesn&#8217;t sound so bad.</p>
<p>Stanislau Herasimenka, CEO and co-founder of Regher, explained that there&#8217;s no magic bullet to their product, but rather a lot of incremental improvements and an understanding of what&#8217;s actually important to the new space economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tech has evolved in a high-cost, low-volume space,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Space panels, they start from a very expensive substrate, usually germanium or gallium arsenic, and lots of expensive processing. Then there&#8217;s space-grade interconnect, an expensive glass and carbon fiber or aluminum substrate, manual assembly&#8230; top performance and low degradation, but it&#8217;s totally not scalable. If they wanted 10 times more of these, they just couldn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet we&#8217;re clearly on our way to doubling, tripling and eventually 10X-ing the number of satellites being launched. They can&#8217;t just slap terrestrial cells on there — they&#8217;d quickly fail — and the tried-and-true makers of fancy III-V cells won&#8217;t have nearly enough stock. So Regher took the best of both worlds to make their cells space-ready, but cheap <em>and</em> able to be made in a hurry.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217178" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_1.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217178" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2217178" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_1.jpeg" alt="A Regher flexible silicon solar cell made with a 20-micron silicon substrate." width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_1.jpeg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_1.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_1.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_1.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_1.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_1.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_1.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_1.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2217178" class="wp-caption-text">A Regher flexible silicon solar cell made with a 20-micron silicon substrate. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Regher Solar</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Right now we&#8217;re running an R&amp;D pilot line where we can make small quantities of panels — 50 kilowatts, about 5% of what the space industry does,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But because we designed with silicon, and the package to be compatible with automated production, we should be able to transition from pilot to 10 megawatts, which is 10 times more than what the space industry does, in a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the product is new, it doesn&#8217;t use any exotic or unprecedented techniques, so ramping up like that really may be possible. Herasimenka described a few of the changes they made to achieve space-like performance at terrestrial-like prices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the first place they took the thickness of the silicon substrate way down, meaning it&#8217;s paradoxically much more resistant to radiation, since it will absorb less. They also changed the impurities and doping in it so that it cures at a low temperature, allowing what damage is caused to be fixed by simply being heated to 80 degrees Celsius. The coating, interconnect and bonding are space-stable. There&#8217;s also less space dedicated to what you might call the bezel, letting the sun-sensitive cells make up more of the surface area. The plan is also to make them flexible (as demonstrated in the images here), to better fit unusual shapes and to increase physical hardiness.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217177" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217177" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2217177" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_2.jpg" alt="A lab technician shows the flexibility of a Regher &quot;solar blanket.&quot;" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_2.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_2.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Regher_Photo_2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2217177" class="wp-caption-text">A lab technician shows the flexibility of a Regher &#8220;solar blanket.&#8221; <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Regher Solar</p></div></p>
<p>Knowing how far to go depended on the moving target that is the cost and planned life of a given constellation-bound satellite. It&#8217;s counterintuitive, but it can be a hazard to a constellation company like Starlink if their satellites perform too well. With thousands of satellites, unit economics come into play — and you don&#8217;t want them to be any better or more expensive than they have to be if the stated plan is to replace them five years from launch. If they&#8217;re still going at 100% then, you probably could have saved a lot of money somewhere along the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Constellation designers design for a particular period of time in a particular orbit,&#8221; Herasimenka said. &#8220;Nobody wants to live for two weeks, and nobody wants 15 years; mostly they go to low Earth orbit and only live there for five-seven years. So we designed for this exact requirement. If they degrade after that, we don&#8217;t care because our customer doesn&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regher taking its shot at this emerging market earned it a spot in Techstars&#8217; 2019 batch, after which they started talking to manufacturers and roughing out deals. They also snagged a NASA SBIR Phase I award and an NSF Phase II, totaling $1.1 million. With prototypes and some validating funding in hand, they collected $33 million in LOIs over the summer and have $50 million more being hammered out, Herasimenka said.</p>
<p>As promising as that is, the company needs to move fast or risk others moving in and eating their lunch. &#8220;Everything can change in just a few years, and by the time an industry realizes it, the market opportunity is gone,&#8221; he said. Clearly Regher Solar intends to be the one to snatch up that opportunity, but they are now looking for significant investment to bring first their pilot, then later the full scale manufacturing lines up to speed. They&#8217;re not ready to announce the specifics, but Herasimenka said they have a $5 million institutional equity seed round that should close before the end of the year, plus $750,000 from individuals.</p>
<p>With interest from established aerospace companies and stamps of approval (via SBIR) of both NASA and the NSF, Regher seems well positioned to make its play. Whether the hard part is designing the new panel or actually making it, though? They&#8217;re about to find out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://spiceai.io/">Spice AI</a>, a Seattle-based startup that aims to make it significantly easier for developers to leverage AI in their applications, today announced that it has raised a $1 million seed funding round.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s obviously not a huge round, but the investors will likely make you perk up a bit: Madrona Venture Group, Picus Capital, TA Ventures and angels like GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich. And the team behind the platform also has some serious credentials, with CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukekim/">Luke Kim</a> spending a decade at Microsoft, where he co-created the Incubations team at Azure and led the engineering work to create <a href="https://dapr.io/">Dapr</a>, while CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leblancphillip">Phillip LeBlanc</a> worked on Azure Active Directory, Visual Studio App Center and GitHub actions.</p>
<p>The team argues that even today, building AI into an application is still far too hard. During his time at Microsoft, Kim started working on a personal project that focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofeedback">neurofeedback</a>. To make this kind of therapy more accessible, he wanted to build an AI system that could analyze the time series data from an <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/electroencephalogram-eeg#:~:text=An%20EEG%20is%20a%20test,activity%20of%20your%20brain%20cells.">EEG</a> and, in the process, he realized how difficult building systems like this still is.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218145" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;It was super hard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s funny. Because I was at Microsoft &#8212; I had all the resources. And I was on this side project &#8212; no resources. And in both cases, I saw that people were struggling with integrating true AI/ML in their applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that while there has been tremendous progress in AI in the last decade, there is still a wide gap between taking that progress and building intelligent software.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218147" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Spice-AI-Logo-with-bg-Dark.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218147" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218147" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Spice-AI-Logo-with-bg-Dark.png" alt="Spice AI Logo with bg - Dark" width="750" height="492" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Spice-AI-Logo-with-bg-Dark.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Spice-AI-Logo-with-bg-Dark.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Spice-AI-Logo-with-bg-Dark.png?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Spice-AI-Logo-with-bg-Dark.png?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Spice-AI-Logo-with-bg-Dark.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2218147" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SpiceAI</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;I think about it like the last mile. The fiber infrastructure got built up but actually connecting it to your house took a long time. This is the theme I see for really using ML in applications. We&#8217;re looking to really fill that gap and make it super easy for developers,&#8221; Kim said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He noted that in building Spice AI, the team took a lot of what they learned from Dapr, but also looked at what Vercel is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/vercel-raises-102m-series-c-for-its-next-js-based-front-end-development-platform/">doing with Next.js</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Now, all of this may sound a bit familiar. After all, there&#8217;s a plethora of startups out there that want to democratize AI. But Kim argues that most of them simply focus on making AI available for anyone, which makes data analytics and business intelligence easier and accessible to more people. Spice AI, however, wants to help developers integrate AI into their applications. Unsurprisingly, that means the company&#8217;s target audience is professional developers, not data science teams.</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of how Spice AI is building its system is that it focuses on reward functions. The idea here is that developers can specify what the algorithm should optimize itself for. If the application controls an air-conditioning system, for example, that outcome would be lower electricity usage. In a project the company is trialing with an Australian retailer, the focus is on finding the ideal pickup location for a customer&#8217;s order, which may not always be the closest location, depending on variables like drive times, item availability, etc.</p>
<p>The company is also building a package manager (called the Spicerack) that will allow developers to publish the manifest with their reward functions so that others can re-use them for their own use cases.</p>
<p>Like similar projects, the Spice AI team is launching its idea as an <a href="https://blog.spiceai.org/posts/2021/09/07/introducing-spice.ai-open-source-time-series-ai-for-developers/">open source project</a>. The idea is to then later release a commercial version with enterprise support, but the team is also thinking about a hosted version, as well as private registries to let enterprises host their models (the company calls these Spicepods).</p>
<p>“Madrona has been investing in intelligent applications for nearly a decade and are excited by Luke and Phillip’s vision to seamlessly bring AI development into existing workflows for developers to accelerate and build high-quality applications,&#8221; said Madrona Venture Group partner Aseem Datar, who until recently was the GM/COO for the Microsoft Cloud. &#8220;This is just the beginning, and I am excited to be on this journey together and work with such a talented team from day one to make it real.”</p>

<p>“We are on a mission to find early-stage startups that are destroying the industries that destroy nature,” he added. “Being witness to one of the most beautiful things dies, someone needed to do something about it, and so I quit my job and went around the world looking at some of the most environmentally destructive and social ills, and it led me to launch my own firm.”</p>
<p>He believes that the most severe carbon emission cuts are unlikely to prevent global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures by 2040. Instead, the answer is beyond stopping emissions to repair the damage and fix problems on a deeper level.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At One Ventures’ investment thesis doesn’t stop at founder, product and company, but looks deeper into the company’s unit economics. Chi explained that a majority of the startups are trying to be planet-positive, but their business model involves asking consumers to pay more money for a product that may only benefit the environment 30% better. Instead, the firm is looking for the companies that can scale a product that, for example, will cost three times less, and be 50% better for the environment.</p>
<p>There is big potential here: Chi is aiming to raise $300 million for its second fund, a milestone he said the firm is well on its way to achieving.</p>
<p>The firm has invested in 21 companies of 30 for its first fund. Ultimately, the firm plans to invest in 100 companies over the next decade. Chi said his team sourced more than 2,600 deals to get to the 21. Some of those include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/robotic-farming-firm-iron-ox-raises-53m/">robotic indoor farming company Iron Ox</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/eliminating-styrofoam-protective-packaging/">earth digestible foam packaging company Cruz Foam</a> and zero water textile dyeing company Alchemie Technology.</p>
<p>“We don’t have the time to invest poorly, we only have a decade to get this right,” he added. “Even in a perfect world, our investments will still only represent the 1% of capital going into climate technology, and the other 99% needs to get deployed efficiently as well. We are all limited in the capital and time we have.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/continuous-scrolling-mobile/">announced</a> today it&#8217;s changing the way search works on mobile devices, initially in the U.S. Now, when you reach the bottom of a set of search results on your phone, you won&#8217;t have to tap to go to the next page. Instead, the next set of results will automatically load so you can continuously scroll down to see more information.</p>
<p>The change will roll out on the mobile web and will be supported on the Google mobile app for both iOS and Android in the U.S. for most English-language searches for the time being. Because it&#8217;s a staggered release, you may initially encounter some results which scroll and others that do not.</p>
<p>While most people find what they&#8217;re looking for in the first few results, says Google, those who are looking for additional information tend to browse through four pages of search results. That&#8217;s why the company is making the change, we&#8217;re told. Now, those users will be able to more seamlessly move between pages without having to click the &#8220;see more&#8221; button at the bottom of the page.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218083" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Google notes this could be helpful in particular for searches where people are looking for a variety of ideas or inspiration on a given topic, instead of just quick answers.</p>
<p><div style="width: 410px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2218083-1" width="410" height="820" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Continuous-Scrolling-on-Mobile.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Continuous-Scrolling-on-Mobile.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Continuous-Scrolling-on-Mobile.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<p>However, there are other benefits of this design, as well, which Google did not reference.</p>
<p>For starters, the continuous scroll doesn&#8217;t force you to stop at some arbitrary point in your search then tap a link to move forward &#8212; a holdover from the desktop era of web search. That &#8220;click for more&#8221; type of design feels outdated in a world where in-app feeds &#8212; like Facebook&#8217;s News Feed for instance &#8212; present a never-ending stream of information and updates. And by continuing to scroll, Google&#8217;s users may end up spending more time in the app where they&#8217;ll also see more ads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The continuous scroll could also give Google more flexibility in terms of ad placement. Instead of limiting ads to the top of a results page, they could be inserted amid the search results as you move down &#8212; more like how ads on social networking feeds appear.</p>
<p>While Google didn&#8217;t publicly detail its plans for ads with this change, the company told us upon follow-up it will redistribute the number of text ads that appear between the top and bottom of pages for U.S.-English mobile queries. Now, text ads will show at the top of the second page and beyond, while fewer text ads will show at the bottom of each page. But, there is no change to how Shopping and Local ads show at this time, we understand.</p>
<p>In addition, as Google Search has become cluttered with info boxes, search suggestions, products to buy and buttons that take you to other search verticals, like Videos, it&#8217;s become more difficult to tap the correct button to move forward in the search results. This is particularly true because Google will shade other buttons darker in hopes of catching your eye and encouraging a click to another destination.</p>
<p>The change to search follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/google-refreshes-its-mobile-search-experience/">a modern redesign of the results page</a> on mobile <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/mobile-redesign-2021/">announced</a> earlier this year, which focused on making search results easier to read through the use of added whitespace in some areas and color in others; a larger, bolder font (Google&#8217;s own, in fact); and a move away from rounded, shaded boxes in favor of straight lines; among other things.</p>
<p>However, that change was more about how the search results looked, not how they functioned.</p>
<p>Google says the new continuous scroll will begin to roll out today in the U.S.</p>

		Tom Zick is a researcher in AI ethics at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, where she is also a J.D. candidate. She holds a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley and was previously a fellow at Bloomberg Beta and the City of Boston. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Founders tend to think responsible AI practices are challenging to implement and may slow the progress of their business. They often jump to mature examples like Salesforce’s <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/company/ethical-and-humane-use/">Office of Ethical and Humane Use</a> and think that the only way to avoid creating a harmful product is building a big team. The truth is much simpler.</p>
<p>I set out to learn how founders were thinking about responsible AI practices on the ground by speaking with a handful of successful early-stage founders and found many of them were implementing responsible AI practices.</p>
<p>Only they didn’t call it that. They just call it “good business.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217657" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It turns out, simple practices that make business sense and result in better products will go a long way toward reducing the risk of unforeseen societal harms. These practices rely on the insight that people, not data, are at the heart of deploying an AI solution successfully. If you account for the reality that humans are always in the loop, you can build a better business, more responsibly.</p>
<p>Think of <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2019/streetlevelalgorithms/streetlevelalgorithms-chi2019.pdf">AI as a bureaucracy</a>. Like a bureaucracy, AI relies on having some general policy to follow (“the model”) that makes reasonable decisions in most cases. However, this general policy can never account for all possible scenarios a bureaucracy will need to handle — much like an AI model cannot be trained to anticipate every possible input.</p>
<p>When these general policies (or models) fail, those who are already marginalized are disproportionately impacted (a classic algorithmic <a href="https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20020410&amp;slug=somalis10m">example</a> is of Somali immigrants being tagged for fraud because of their atypical community shopping habits).</p>
<p>Bureaucracies work to solve this problem with “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7758/9781610447713">street-level bureaucrats</a>” like judges, DMV agents and even teachers, who can handle unique cases or decide not to enforce the policy. For example, teachers can waive a course prerequisite given extenuating circumstances, or judges can be more or less lenient in sentencing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If any AI will inevitably fail, then &#8212; like with a bureaucracy &#8212; we must keep humans in the loop and design with them in mind. As one founder told me, “If I were a Martian coming to Earth for the first time, I would think: Humans are processing machines &#8212; I should use them.”</p>
<p>Whether the humans are operators augmenting the AI system by stepping in when it’s uncertain, or users choosing whether to reject, accept or manipulate a model outcome, these people determine how well any AI-based solution will work in the real world.</p>
<p>Here are five practical suggestions that founders of AI companies shared for keeping, and even harnessing, humans in the loop to build a more responsible AI that’s also good for business:</p>
<h2>Introduce only as little AI as you need</h2>
<p>Today, many companies plan to launch some services with an end-to-end AI-driven process. When those processes struggle to function under a wide range of use cases, the people who are most harmed tend to be those already marginalized.</p>
<p>In trying to diagnose failures, founders subtract one component at a time, still hoping to automate as much as possible. They should consider the opposite: introducing one AI component at a time.</p>
<p>Many processes are &#8212; even with all the wonders of AI &#8212; still just less expensive and more reliable to run with humans in the loop. If you build an end-to-end system with many components coming online at once, you may find it hard to identify which are best suited to AI.</p>
<p>Many founders we spoke with view AI as a way to delegate the most time-consuming, low-stakes tasks in their system away from humans, and they started with all human-run systems to identify what these important-to-automate tasks were.</p>
<p>This “AI second” approach also enables founders to enter fields where data is not immediately available. The people who operate parts of a system also create the very data you’ll need to automate those tasks. One founder told us that, without the advice to introduce AI gradually, and only when it was demonstrably more accurate than an operator, they would have never gotten off the ground.</p>
<h2>Create some friction</h2>
<p>Many founders believe that to be successful, a product must run out of the box, with as little user input as possible.</p>
<p>Because AI is typically used to automate part of an existing workflow &#8212; complete with associated preconceptions on how much to trust that workflow output &#8212; a perfectly seamless approach can be catastrophic.</p>
<p>For example, when an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17615634/amazon-rekognition-aclu-mug-shot-congress-facial-recognition">ACLU audit</a> showed that Amazon’s facial recognition tool would misidentify 28 members of Congress (a disproportionately large fraction of whom were Black) as criminals, lax default settings were at the heart of the problem. The accuracy threshold out of the box was set to only 80%, clearly the wrong setting if a user takes a positive result at face value.</p>
<p>Motivating users to engage with a product’s strengths and weaknesses before deploying it can offset the potential for harmful assumption mismatches. It can also make customers happier with eventual product performance.</p>
<p>One founder we spoke with found that customers ultimately used their product more effectively if the customer had to customize it before use. He views this as a dominant component of a “design-first” approach and found it helped users play to the strengths of the product on a context-specific basis. While this approach required more upfront time to get going, it ended up translating into revenue gains for customers.</p>
<h2>Give context, not answers</h2>
<p>Many AI-based solutions focus on providing an output recommendation. Once these recommendations are made, they have to be acted on by humans.</p>
<p>Without context, poor recommendations could be blindly followed, causing downstream harm. Similarly, great recommendations could be rejected if the humans in the loop do not trust the system and lack context.</p>
<p>Rather than delegating decisions away from users, consider giving them the tools to make decisions. This approach harnesses the power of humans in the loop to identify problematic model outputs while securing the user buy-in necessary for a successful product.</p>
<p>One founder shared that when their AI made direct recommendations, users didn’t trust it. Their customers were happy with the accuracy that their model predictions turned out to have, but individual users just ignored the recommendations. Then they nixed the recommendation feature and instead used their model to augment the resources that could inform a user’s decision (e.g., this procedure is like these five past procedures and here is what worked). This led to increased adoption rates and revenue.</p>
<h2>Consider your not-users and not-buyers</h2>
<p>It is a known problem in enterprise tech that products can easily serve the CEO and not the end users. This is even more problematic in the AI space, where a solution is often part of a greater system that interfaces with a few direct users and many more indirect ones.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the controversy that arose when Starbucks began using <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/kronos-makes-changes-to-software-accused-of-producing-bad-sc">automated scheduling software</a> to assign shifts. The scheduler optimized for efficiency, completely disregarding working conditions. After a successful labor petition and a high-profile <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/starbucks-workers-scheduling-hours.html">New York Times article</a>, the baristas’ input was taken under consideration, improving morale and productivity.</p>
<p>Instead of taking a customer literally on what they ask you to solve, consider mapping out all of the stakeholders involved and understanding their needs <em>before</em> you decide what your AI will help optimize. That way, you will avoid inadvertently making a product that is needlessly harmful and possibly find an even better business opportunity.</p>
<p>One founder we spoke with took this approach to heart, camping out next to their users to understand their needs before deciding what to optimize their product for. They followed this up by meeting with both customers and union representatives to figure out how to make a product that worked for both.</p>
<p>While customers originally wanted a product that would allow each user to take on a greater workload, these conversations revealed an opportunity to unlock savings for their customers by optimizing the existing workload.</p>
<p>This insight allowed the founder to develop a product that empowered the humans in the loop <em>and</em> saved management more money than the solution they thought they wanted would have.</p>
<h2>Be clear on what’s AI theater</h2>
<p>If you limit the degree to which you hype up what your AI can do, you can both avoid irresponsible consequences and sell your product more effectively.</p>
<p>Yes, the hype around AI helps sell products. However, knowing how to keep those buzzwords from getting in the way of precision is crucial. While talking up the autonomous capabilities of your product might be good for sales, it can backfire if you apply that rhetoric indiscriminately.</p>
<p>For example, one of the founders we spoke to found that playing up the power of their AI also increased their customers&#8217; privacy concerns. This concern persisted even when the founders explained that the portions of the product in question did not rely on data, but rather on human judgment.</p>
<p>Language choice can help align expectations <em>and</em> build trust in a product. Rather than using the language of autonomy with their users, some of the founders we talked to found that words like “augment” and “assist” were more likely to inspire adoption. This “AI as a tool” framing was also less likely to engender the blind trust that can lead to bad outcomes down the line. Being clear can both dissuade overconfidence in AI and help you sell.</p>
<p>These are some practical lessons learned by real founders for mitigating the risk of unforeseen harms from AI and creating more successful products built for the long term. We also believe there’s an opportunity for new startups to build services that help make it easier to create ethical AI that’s also good for business. So here are a couple of requests for startups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engage humans in the loop<em>: </em></strong>We need startups that solve the “human in the loop” attention problem. Delegating to humans requires making sure those humans notice when an AI is uncertain so that they can meaningfully intervene. If an AI is correct 95% of the time, research shows that people get complacent and are unlikely to catch the 5% of instances the AI gets wrong. The solution requires more than just technology; much like social media was more of a psychological innovation than a technical one, we think startups in this space can (and should) emerge from social insights.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard compliance for responsible AI: </strong>There’s opportunity for startups that consolidate existing standards around responsible AI and measure compliance. Publication of <a href="https://www.standict.eu/sites/default/files/2021-07/jrc125952_ai_watch_task_9_standardization_activity_mapping_v5.1%281%29.pdf">AI standards</a> has been on the rise in the past two years as public pressure on AI regulation has been increasing. A <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/public-opinion-lessons-for-ai-regulation/">recent survey</a> showed 84% of Americans think AI should be carefully managed and rate this as a top priority. Companies want to signal they are taking this seriously and showing they are following standards put forth by IEEE, CSET and others would be useful. Meanwhile, the current draft of the EU’s expansive <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1623335154975&amp;uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0206">AI Act</a> (AIA) strongly emphasizes industry standards. If the AIA passes, compliance will become a necessity. Given the market that formed around GDPR compliance, we think this is a space to watch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you’re trying one of these tips or starting one of these companies, simple, responsible AI practices can let you unlock immense business opportunities. To avoid creating a harmful product, you need to be thoughtful in your deployment of AI.</p>
<p>Luckily, this thoughtfulness will pay dividends when it comes to the long-term success of your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter says it&#8217;s going to test a new ad format and placement on its platform. On Wednesday, Twitter Revenue Product Lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brucefalck/">Bruce Falck</a> said Twitter would begin showing ads on mobile devices inside conversation threads after the first, third and eighth replies. While the company stopped short of confirming the change would be permanent, it did say it would experiment with the formula to best determine the insertion points and layouts that made the most sense. Twitter also said it would consider making the display of the ads something creators would opt into, rather than forcing them to accept ads in their threads. In that case, creators would also see a share of ad revenue, Twitter said.</p>
<p>The company historically <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18213567/twitter-to-stop-sharing-mau-as-users-decline-q4-2018-earnings">has</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18213567/twitter-to-stop-sharing-mau-as-users-decline-q4-2018-earnings">struggled</a> to <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/twitter-posts-strong-revenue-result-in-q3-as-user-growth-slows/588093/">grow</a> its user base by significant numbers, meaning it&#8217;s had to get more creative with maximizing the revenue it&#8217;s able to extract from its existing users. Over the past year or so, that&#8217;s led to a deluge of new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">products</a>, like audio chat rooms, ticketed events, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/">creator</a> tools, subscriptions, virtual tipping and much more. In time, Twitter wants to make good on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitter-plans-to-double-revenue-by-2023-reach-315m-daily-users/">promise to investors</a> that it will be able to double its revenue from $3.7 billion in 2020 to $7.5 billion or more in 2023, and grow its user base to 315 million monetizable daily users.</p>
<p>Though most of its new products are in the early phases of testing, Twitter has not yet had a runaway hit. For example, third-party data indicated recently Twitter&#8217;s new creator platform called Super Follow had only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/">generated</a> around $6,000 in its first two weeks live in the U.S. and Canada, or perhaps a bit more ($12,400 during 17 days in September, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/">according</a> to a second firm&#8217;s analysis). Regardless of which numbers are closer to the truth, it&#8217;s clear that there&#8217;s not pent-up demand for creator subscriptions just yet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218141" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Twitter has yet to bring its new premium product, the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue">Twitter Blue</a> subscription, to its biggest markets, including the U.S. This product includes a feature that&#8217;s as close as Twitter has ever offered to the &#8220;Edit Tweet&#8221; button users want &#8212; an &#8220;undo&#8221; option for catching typos spotted quickly.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starting today, we’re trying something different and testing a new ad format in Tweet conversations. If you’re a part of this test (which is global; on iOS &amp; Android only), you’ll see ads after the first, third or eighth reply under a Tweet. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f5e3.png" alt="🗣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/kvIGeYt2vp">pic.twitter.com/kvIGeYt2vp</a></p>
<p>&mdash; bruce.falck() <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f997.png" alt="🦗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@boo) <a href="https://twitter.com/boo/status/1448319014921404417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But even with all these new features rolling out, Twitter continues to generate the majority of its revenue through ads. In July, Twitter beat Wall Street estimates on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-beats-revenue-targets-with-ad-improvements-sees-decline-us-users-2021-07-22/">earnings</a> by pulling in $1.05 billion in ad revenue in the quarter &#8212; a move the company attributed to the improved effectiveness of its ads, where it had introduced 2,500 new topic categories for better targeting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Similarly, Twitter plans to make the in-conversation ads contextually relevant to what&#8217;s being discussed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a big opportunity to build an ad offering that creates value and aligns incentives for creators and advertisers,&#8221; said Falck, in an <a href="https://twitter.com/boo/status/1448319014921404417">announcement</a> shared on Twitter. &#8220;As we experiment with this format over the coming months, we’ll focus on understanding how it performs and how it impacts the people and conversations around it. We’ll test different frequencies, layouts, contextually relevant ads, different insertion points, etc. And we’ll examine our learnings and figure out if it’s something we want to make permanent. We’re excited about trying this out for our advertisers and we’re eager to explore how it could open the door for additional opportunities to reward Tweet authors and creators,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>That last bit is referencing a proposed revenue share with creators whose content leads to long threads where ad placements make sense. When tweets go viral on the platform, users will often scroll down through several screens to read more of users&#8217; responses. This could allow Twitter to insert more ads not only near the top of the thread, as is now proposed, but further down the thread. But monetizing viral tweets like this could impact Twitter&#8217;s content and culture. Twitter is already a place that tends to reward a sort of performative type of user &#8212; like those posting snark, jokes, angry tweets and other emotive content; tying tweets&#8217; &#8220;virality&#8221; to creator revenue could push Twitter even further away from the genuine, thoughtful conversations the company claims it wants to host.</p>
<p>However, an increased ad load on Twitter could allow Twitter to offer a different product for those who hate ads enough to pay for an ad-free experience. While currently, Twitter Blue doesn&#8217;t offer an ad-blocking function, apps often offer ways for users to opt out of ads by paying instead. This could be bundled into Twitter Blue perhaps, or even made a standalone purchase. (Twitter has not said this is under consideration, to be clear. When asked, Twitter said that is &#8220;not a part&#8221; of its plans at the moment.)</p>
<p>Users<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/twitter-users-complain-of-timelines-being-overrun-with-promoted-tweets/"> tend to complain when Twitter juices its ads</a> near the ends of quarters or years, when they start appearing every few tweets in the timeline. It&#8217;s possible that a fierce enough backlash from users to these new ads &#8212; or other, negative impacts to consumer behavior on the platform &#8212; could encourage Twitter to reconsider this test.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s more likely this change will move forward once Twitter lands on the right formula for layouts, placement and contextual targeting, given the company&#8217;s need to grow revenue. Already, Twitter failed to make its &#8220;stories&#8221; product work, which could have delivered a new section on the site to run ads. But stories didn&#8217;t gain enough user adoption to make the continued investment worthwhile.</p>
<p>That leaves Twitter looking for other ways to monetize through ads. And showing more ads in more places seems to be the current answer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite the Series B and C crunch, there’s plenty of evidence that India’s latest venture capital results are not the high-water mark of this startup era.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Any subscriber to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/daily-crunch/">Daily Crunch newsletter</a> is familiar with just how often Indian startups take point in our coverage of emerging technology companies around the world. The country’s prominence has perhaps also risen as the Chinese venture capital market evolves in the face of a changing regulatory environment.</p>
<p>A number of Indian companies have recently gone public or started the IPO process. Those exits have proved more than merely useful for recycling capital into the Indian market; they’re showing global investors of all stages that startups in the country can go from seed to redwood.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>The result of a long ramp in venture capital activity since COVID-19-induced lows in early 2020 is an Indian startup market that is going flat-out bonkers. Venture capital data from the country is, even for 2021, surprising.</p>
<p>To get our heads around just what’s going on in the country, The Exchange got ahold of <a href="https://twitter.com/gvravishankar">GV Ravishankar</a>, a managing director at Sequoia India, and <a href="https://twitter.com/Kuna1Bajaj">Kunal Bajaj</a>, head of Capital Network at Blume Ventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Just how active is the Indian market today? Ravishankar said that India is “undeniably going through one of the best periods for startups with respect to their ability to raise financing on a continuous basis.”</p>
<p>The VCs helped us understand what’s driving Indian startups to not merely set new records in terms of capital attracted, but accelerate prior gains to totals that we may not see again for some time after the current business supercycle comes to a close.</p>
<h2>New records for India&#8217;s startup market</h2>
<p>When Q3 venture capital data touched down, The Exchange got busy digesting hundreds of data points. Diving into fresh quarterly data is nearly as good as a spanking-new S-1 filing in terms of filling in gaps in our market comprehension.</p>
<p>But rare is the chart that makes us actually shout out loud: <em>Wait, what?!</em> Such was the case <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">with CB Insights’ Indian data set</a> concerning quarterly venture totals over time:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With more satellites than ever going to orbit, the question of how to control them efficiently and precisely is of more concern than ever. Accion Systems is well placed to provide a solution to this growing challenge, and co-founder and CTO Natalya Bailey will join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021">TC Sessions: Space</a> in December to talk about the evolving market of in-space propulsion.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve followed the growth of Accion for years, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/18/space-propulsion-start-up-accion-systems-starts-taking-orders/">back in 2016</a> it seemed like an idea ahead of its time: developing a super-efficient, super-compact ion thruster that could improve the maneuverability and effective lifespan of small satellites. Now, of course, it seems like an extremely valuable position to be in: the middle of a small satellite boom with five years of development behind them.</p>
<p>Investors seem to have taken note, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/accion-systems-raises-42-million-in-series-c-to-accelerate-development-of-4th-gen-propulsion-system/">Accion raised a $42 million series C</a> earlier in the year, intended to fund the next generation of its tiled ionic liquid electrospray (TILE) propulsion system. It&#8217;s a less complex and more compact version of ion engines the space industry has used for decades, allowing this efficient method of propulsion to be used on smaller craft.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With the latest iteration of the TILE system, the company hopes to set the stage for using it on larger spacecraft. The smallsat/CubeSat category is growing, sure, but there are big ones going up too that would happily swap propulsion systems if it gained them a few extra kilograms of payload space.</p>
<p>But how will mega-constellations play into this? How long until TILE is interplanetary-ready? How&#8217;s the competition shaping up? Bailey will speak to these and other topics on a panel December 14. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?display=true">Grab your ticket</a> to be a part of this conversation before Friday to save $100. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?display=true">Register Now</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, HTC has revealed their latest consumer-focused headset, the $499 Vive Flow. It&#8217;s designed for portability with a compact design and 189 gram weight, though there are some big caveats, which I&#8217;ll get to later.</p>
<p>I had the chance to demo the headset in-person in San Francisco and my first impression of the device was around just how compact and well-designed the hardware appeared. HTC is embracing several hardware features designed around miniaturization that we haven&#8217;t seen in other headsets. The &#8220;pancake&#8221; optics are thinner than what you&#8217;d see in any other commercially available headset, and adjustable diopter lenses allow users to correct their vision in-headset and potentially avoid needing to use glasses with the Flow. The headset overall hosts a lightweight design more akin to the Magic Leap One than existing standalone headsets.</p>
<p>Other key details include the headset&#8217;s 1.6K per eye resolution (they didn&#8217;t disclose exact resolution) that run at 75 frames-per-second, and what HTC claims is a 100-degree field-of-view, though your mileage may vary. The smaller lenses do not have IPD adjustment, meaning anyone using the outer or inner bounds of an IPD adjustable headset will probably be getting a smaller field-of-view and a less comfortable experience. The bug-eye lenses on the front of the device hide pass-through cameras, though I wasn&#8217;t able to demo any content that showcased them. Another interesting feature is a fan inside the headset which draws hot air from your face and eyes, something HTC claims makes longer sessions more comfortable. Speaking of comfort, I was pleasantly surprised by the Flow&#8217;s dual-hinge arms (which have near-ear speakers built-in to them) and how well they managed to secure the headset compared to the straps most headsets sport.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217637" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>During my demo, I was generally pleased by just how well-designed so many elements of the device itself were. All of which is to say, it&#8217;s clear that HTC actually innovated in the hardware design here, which can&#8217;t be said for their last consumer release, the 2019 Vive Cosmos, which was generally panned by reviewers as an inferior Oculus Quest competitor. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But achieving the Flow&#8217;s form factor clearly required some fairly controversial choices, ones that frankly are likely going to leave a pretty slim niche of potential buyers for this headset, which costs $200 more than the larger, but more full-featured Oculus Quest 2. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For one, the $499 device doesn&#8217;t have an onboard battery &#8212; in order to use the headset it has to be connected to a power source, be that an external battery charger or your phone itself. The headset is also sporting a last generation Qualcomm XR1 processor onboard, meaning most content designed to take full advantage of competing headsets like the Quest 2 won&#8217;t support the Vive Flow. Most </span>perplexingly<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, the Vive Flow does not include dedicated controllers or onboard input, instead relying on an accompanying phone app which gives users basic abilities to control content inside the headset.</span></p>
<p>Those tradeoffs aren&#8217;t easy ones to justify, and HTC prioritizing the form factor so heavily over usability leaves them in a tough spot. This wasn&#8217;t a full review period, but after an hour chatting with the team and playing around with the device, I got a pretty good feel for what the Vive Flow is; what I didn&#8217;t grasp as much was who this device was built for.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Without robust gaming support, HTC is pitching the Flow as a wellness and mindfulness device, detailing the headset&#8217;s support for VR meditation apps including MyndVR and Tripp. Spokespeople for HTC detailed how the headset&#8217;s size makes it ideal for whipping out for a quick meditation session, but given that most of these meditation apps are still quite early in their development, and figuring out how to onboard paying customers themselves, I&#8217;m doubtful that the market for VR meditation is big enough for a dedicated $499 device. I find it much easier to believe that this headset will have pretty significant overlap with Facebook&#8217;s discontinued Oculus Go, which many people used primarily to stream videos, something that users can also do on the Flow by connecting and mirroring their Android phone display inside the app and using normal mobile apps like Netflix. It&#8217;s not the most futuristic use and doesn&#8217;t leverage the headset&#8217;s positional tracking at all, but it&#8217;s probably the stickiest use case for a lightweight device that is likely more comfortable to wear for several hours than heavier competing headsets.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that the headset has such a tight focus, because many VR enthusiasts are looking for a full-featured standalone headset option that isn&#8217;t made by Facebook. Generally, HTC has been in a pretty rough VR market position since Facebook began aggressively slashing the prices of their headsets in a bid to bring more consumers into the fold. While Facebook can afford to sell hardware at a loss for the glory of eventual market domination, HTC doesn&#8217;t have that luxury as a much smaller company. It&#8217;s also apparent that Facebook&#8217;s billions of dollars in investment have led to more well-rounded products with software that feels years ahead of what HTC is shipping on the Flow.</p>
<p>HTC has been in the VR game for a long time, and it&#8217;s clear from their hardware design on the Vive Flow that they&#8217;re ready to be seen as a leading force of VR innovation. There are some big tradeoffs to this $499 headset, but with its bold design and shrunken size, it&#8217;s far from forgettable, which is more than can be said about most VR devices. The headset goes up for preorder tomorrow, and will be shipping early next month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let’s talk about strapping guns to the backs of robots. I’m not a fan (how’s that for taking a stand?). When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/mschf-mounted-a-remote-control-paintball-gun-to-spot/">MSCHF did it with Spot</a> back in February, it was a thought experiment, art exhibit and a statement about where society might be headed with autonomous robotics. And most importantly, of course, it was a paintball gun. Boston Dynamics clearly wasn’t thrilled with the message it was sending, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we learned that an art group is planning a spectacle to draw attention to a provocative use of our industrial robot, Spot. To be clear, we condemn the portrayal of our technology in any way that promotes violence, harm, or intimidation.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s precisely the sort of thing the company tries to get out in front of. After decades of killer-robot science-fiction, it doesn’t take much to make people jump any time an advanced robot enters the picture. It’s the automaton version of Rule 34 (in staunch defiance of Asimov’s First Law of Robotics): If a robot exists, someone has tried to weaponize it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217821" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As I’ve said in this very column, I’m glad we’re having these conversations now, and I’m happy people are skeptical when the NYPD trots out a branded version of Spot. I also think it’s important to note, for example, that police departments have been using robots for years to perform dangerous tasks like bomb detection. A majority of us would probably agree that saving people from exploding is a good use for a robot.</p>

<p>I’m glad Boston Dynamics continues to vocalize its opposition toward using the robot for harm (what constitutes intimidation, when it comes to headless quadrupedal robots, is another conversation altogether). Spot’s makers &#8212; along with a wide swath of the robotics industry &#8212; cut their teeth on DARPA-funded projects. I’d say there’s a pretty big gulf between building a robotic pack mule and a mobile weapon, but these are precisely the sorts of things you need to bake into a mission statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>For this Ghost Robotics dog on display at the Association of the U.S. Army convention in D.C. this week, I’d say intimidation is probably the best-case scenario. I’ll let the rifle’s maker, SWORD Defense Systems, speak for themselves here:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SWORD Defense Systems Special Purpose Unmanned Rifle (SPUR) was specifically designed to offer precision fire from unmanned platforms such as the Ghost Robotics Vision-60 quadruped. Featuring safe, chamber, clear, and fire capabilities that allows for safe and reliable deployment of the weapon system – providing the operator an ability to load and safe the weapon at a distance.</p></blockquote>
<p>If that doesn’t send a cold shiver down your spine, I don’t know what to tell you. Is it ethically that far removed from the attack drones the military has been using for bombing campaigns for decades now? Potentially not. But I’m not a fan of drone strikes, either.</p>

<p>Ghost Robotics certainly can’t be accused to obfuscating its military connection. A solider walking around with the Ghost Vision system is the first thing you see when you visit the company’s site. However you feel about the DoD’s budget, defense funding has historically been a huge part of keeping robotics companies afloat, long before VCs were pumping money into the category. Ghost’s site breaks things down accordingly into defense, homeland and enterprise. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/verizon-shows-off-5g-connected-robots-barcelona-conference-2021-06-28/">A recent highly publicized 5G deal</a> with Verizon falls into the latter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/07/robit-dogs-patrol-tyndall/">Recent coverage</a> has highlighted the robotic dogs’ use for patrolling warzones &#8212; not dissimilar from Spot’s functionality in that case. But mounting a gun on the robot changes the math considerably here. There are a lot of questions &#8212; I’ve reached out to Ghost Robotics with some preliminary ones. But this surely isn’t the last we’ll be hearing about this setup.</p>

<p>In non-unmanned-rifle news, Dexterity continues to make waves with another large raise. Just over a year after coming out of stealth with $56.2 million, the Bay Area-based firm is clearly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/warehouse-robotics-firm-dexterity-raises-140m/">striking while the iron is hot</a>, as interest in automated fulfillment has spiked during the pandemic. Four years after launch, it just raised another $140 million at a $1.4 billion valuation.</p>
<p>The company has been running its systems in the real world for two years now, moving a wide range of different objects, including, “loosely packed deformable polybags, to delicate hot-dog buns, to floppy tortillas, to poorly sealed cardboard boxes, to bags of earthworms, to trays and crates of consumer food, to even a molten birthday cake.” Dexterity plans to use the money to continue the deployment of its first thousand robots.</p>

<p>Closing us out this week is the Yanmar YV01, an autonomous spraying robot designed specifically for vineyards.</p>
<p>“YV01 offers cutting-edge autonomous technology and is flexible, lightweight and environmentally-friendly as it ensures highly accurate spraying on vines,” Yanmar Europe President Peter Aarsen said in a release. &#8220;It can be safely and simply operated by a nearby supervisor and it is ideally suited for vineyards which have narrow pathways and where the vines are not tall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently being tested in (where else) Champagne-producing Épernay, France, the system will go on sale next year.</p>
