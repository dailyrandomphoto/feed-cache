										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In Twitter&#8217;s latest appeal to one-up competitors from Clubhouse to Patreon, the company announced today that it will begin rolling out applications for Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces.</p>
<p>Twitter first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">teased the Super Follow feature</a> during an Analyst Day event in February. Super Follows allow creators on Twitter to generate monthly revenue by offering paywalled content to followers who subscribe to them for $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 per month.</p>
<p>Twitter will only take 3% of creators&#8217; revenue after in-app purchase fees – but, on the App Store and Google Play, in-app purchase fees are 30%, which means that creators will take home about two-thirds of what their followers are paying. Once they exceed $50,000 of lifetime earnings on Twitter, the app will take &#8220;20% of future earnings after fees.&#8221; When combined with the 30% in-app purchase fee, that leaves creators with about half of their followers&#8217; payments. Meanwhile, Patreon only takes between 5% and 12% of a creator&#8217;s earnings (it bypasses in-app purchase fees since it&#8217;s a web-based platform). While creators who primarily engage with their audience on Twitter might benefit from having a way to monetize without directing followers to another app, the difference in payout here is stark. Creators might not abandon their existing Patreon systems for Super Follows, but at the very least, this could offer a supplemental income stream.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to elevate people driving the conversations on Twitter and help them earn money,&#8221; said senior product manager Esther Crawford. &#8220;We updated our revenue share cuts after spending more time thinking about how we could support emerging voices on Twitter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ticketed Spaces seem more promising though, since Clubhouse, Spotify Greenroom, and other competitors don&#8217;t offer similar options yet (Discord is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/discord-stage-discovery/">testing ticketed audio events</a> on its Stage Discovery portal, but they aren&#8217;t out yet). Through Ticketed Spaces, users can set their ticket price anywhere between $1 and $999. Creators can also limit how many tickets are sold, which might incentivize someone to actually use the $999 ticket price for a one-on-one conversation with a celebrity (still&#8230; yikes?). Twitter will remind attendees that the Ticketed Space is happening through push and in-app notifications.</p>
<p>Clubhouse and Instagram have features that let listeners <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clubhouse-payments/">tip speakers</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/instagram-rolls-out-fan-badges-for-live-videos-expands-igtv-ads-test/">award badges</a> in a live audio space, but the apps don&#8217;t yet allow for advance ticket sales. Another way for top creators to make money on these apps is through Creator Funds. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Spotify Greenroom</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/clubhouse-announces-plans-for-creator-payments-and-raises-new-funding-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">Clubhouse</a> have both announced plans for Creator Funds, but it&#8217;s not yet clear how the earning potential will compare with selling access to Ticketed Spaces on Twitter.</p>
<p>This slew of updates to Twitter comes after activist shareholders attempted to oust CEO Jack Dorsey last year. Now, Twitter is rapidly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/twitters-acquisition-strategy-eat-the-public-conversation/">adding new features and acquiring companies</a> like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a> (a newsletter platform), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-acquihires-creative-agency-ueno-to-help-design-new-products/">Ueno</a> (a creative agency), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/">Breaker</a> (a social podcasting platform).</p>

<p>Applications to use Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces are only available on mobile (so, no avoiding the in-app purchase fees) and for people in the U.S. Currently, only iOS users can apply for Super Follows, but Ticketed Spaces applications are available on both iOS and Android. Twitter is adding a brand new Monetization button to the sidebar in the app, where users navigate to see if they&#8217;re eligible to apply to be part of the test groups for these features. These features will launch more broadly in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the country&#8217;s most powerful unions, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, confirmed today that it plans to make a nationwide push to unionize Amazon warehouse workers and drivers. And it won&#8217;t be a gentle one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg7pp/the-teamsters-announce-coordinated-nationwide-project-to-unionize-amazon">The news was first reported by Motherboard</a>, which obtained a video and resolution announcing the effort. As the organization explained, the plan to unionize Amazon&#8217;s growing logistics business has been underway for some time, and the failure in Bessemer to do so — after the grassroots effort faced intense opposition from Amazon itself — illustrates why such an endeavor is necessary.</p>
<p>As Teamsters National Director for Amazon Randy Korgan explained <a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/06/14/amazons-labor-exploitation-is-a-return-to-the-1920s--and-unions-are-our-best-hope-out/">in a recent op-ed on Salon</a> that hinted at the effort:</p>
<blockquote><p>I see that Teamster locals across the country are already stepping up to meet the challenge by engaging members, building large volunteer organizing committees, building strong community-labor alliances and integrating transformative social justice organizing into their work.</p>
<p>As we saw in the closely-watched National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election at Amazon&#8217;s Bessemer, Alabama warehouse, the company is willing to violate the law and spare no expense to keep its workers from forming a union.</p>
<p>Building genuine worker power at Amazon will take shop-floor militancy by Amazon workers and solidarity from warehousing and delivery Teamsters.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Teamsters&#8217; plan, assuming a passing vote at this week&#8217;s 30th quinquennial International Convention, is to create a special Amazon Division that will fund and aid unionizing efforts in the company&#8217;s workforces around the country.</p>
<p>While Amazon repeats loudly and at every possible occasion its commitment to safe and well paid jobs, reports continue to come out of workers in horrendous conditions, callous management, and stagnant wages. As to the last, while Amazon has established a $15 minimum wage at the company, others have pointed out that this is far less than many warehouse workers and drivers were making at other jobs — which have now lowered their compensation to follow Amazon&#8217;s lead.</p>
<p>The conflict at Bessemer, in which Amazon was accused of union-busting tactics and dirty tricks to sink a traditional union voting process, has prompted the Teamsters to adopt a different approach.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Teamsters stand with Amazon workers.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AmazonHurts?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AmazonHurts</a> <a href="https://t.co/uhaqFAF9lE">pic.twitter.com/uhaqFAF9lE</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Teamsters (@Teamsters) <a href="https://twitter.com/Teamsters/status/1407144222336196608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>According to Motherboard, the organization is planning &#8220;a series of pressure campaigns involving work stoppages, petitions, and other collective action,&#8221; in the hopes that Amazon will find unionization and negotiation preferable. I&#8217;ve asked the company for comment on the matter and will update if I hear back.</p>
<p>This is one of the union&#8217;s highest priority efforts for the next few years, though it did not specify any particular timeline or budget — no doubt because much of that depends on the situation they find on the ground. But Amazon&#8217;s hundreds of thousands of workers represent an enormous untapped working group, the unionization of which could realize similarly enormous sums in benefits for them.</p>
<p>The full text of the resolution will be published when it is provided to the local unions for a vote, at which point it will be embedded below in this article.</p>

Yes, you. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a>, our mini masterclass in entrepreneurship, is right around the proverbial corner.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mercedes-Benz has used the &#8220;best or nothing&#8221; tagline to market its vehicles for the last 21 years. To ensure its 2021 Mercedes-Benz S580 sedan ticks that &#8220;best&#8221; box, the German automaker has loaded its flagship vehicle with technology, including an infotainment system that learns to anticipate its owner&#8217;s needs, some new rear-steering tricks and upgrades to its advanced driver assistance features.</p>
<p>With a price tag that starts at a steep $110,850, it&#8217;s the luxury car for the exceedingly well-heeled executive who wants the top-of-the-line Mercedes sedan with all the bells and whistles modern driving and living requires — and then some.</p>
<p>In S-Class tradition, the sedan is still a big baller. The new version gets longer (by 1.3-inches) and taller (by 0.4-inches), making more space for passengers and cargo. The base 2021 Mercedes-Benz S500 comes with all-wheel drive and a new inline six-cylinder engine that makes 429 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. That&#8217;s a 60-plus horsepower bump over the last generation model. The S580 that I drove also came with all-wheel drive and a smooth, powerful and quiet 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 that makes 496 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. Both versions also get a 48-volt onboard mild hybrid system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Mercedes has always touted its &#8220;human-centered innovation&#8221; in its S-Class. Initially, the automaker used technology to improve safety (things like ensuring that the doors wouldn&#8217;t suddenly spring open in a crash in the 1950s and crumple zones in the1960s). Since the 1990s, the brand has focused on making driving, parking and navigation less clunky and difficult to use. For example, it had an optional voice recognition package in 1996 that allowed you to activate your carphone (remember those‽) with a voice command.</p>
<p>Mercedes has continued to push the technology envelope, most recently launching an all-electric counterpart to the S Class <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs-stakes-its-claim-on-a-luxury-electric-future/">called the EQS</a>. The 2021 S-Class might mark a new generation of the executive hauler, and it has plenty of technology to offer, but it doesn&#8217;t quite outshine the all-electric EQS.</p>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Mercedes has long been a player in the advanced driver assistance system space, debuting an adaptive cruise control feature called Distronic in 1998.</span></h2>
<p>In the 2021 S-Class, ADAS gets an upgrade (called Drive Pilot) that includes a total of 22 sensors and cameras all around the vehicle, which send information to five multicore processors that can analyze the driving situation 1,000 times per second and adapt the suspension accordingly.</p>
<p>All that&#8217;s to say, the car &#8220;sees&#8221; and responds to road conditions, other vehicles, road signs, pedestrians and cyclists, and then should respond like a human driver would.</p>
<p>On the drive from Los Angeles to Montecito (about 130 miles if you take the freeway the whole way), on both winding mountain and ocean roads and stop-and-go traffic on LA&#8217;s heinous, concrete block 405 freeway, I kept the S580 in adaptive cruise for most of the trip. The system worked as intended, with the S-Class accelerating and stopping at the appropriate times as I crept along in bumper-to-bumper traffic, from the 105 to the 101. What&#8217;s more: I wasn&#8217;t exhausted (and pissed off) when I arrived at my destination after a meandering six hours on the road.</p>
<p>Even when a texting Angeleno decided to change lanes, nearly side-swiped my car and narrowly avoided driving into the backseat of the vehicle ahead, the adaptive cruise system maintained control. I was paying attention as this incident unfolded, but Mercedes has designed its system to ensure drivers are attentive even as the ADAS features handle some of the driving tasks.</p>
<p>Touch sensors inside the car and on the steering wheel as well as eye-tracking and facial recognition cameras monitor the attentiveness of the driver. Take your hands off the sensors, and the driver&#8217;s display will alert you to your wandering ways, disengaging the ADAS system after a few seconds.</p>
<p>The eye detection and facial monitoring is used to recognize typical signs of drowsiness and driver inattention, and displays a warning message prompting the driver to take a break. There&#8217;s also a new microsleep warning that tracks the driver&#8217;s eyelid movements by a camera in the driver display.</p>

<p>Mercedes claims that the 2021 S-Class is prepped for Level 4 autonomous driving and, in their September announcement of the new vehicle, executives said that &#8220;Level 3 conditional driving is near.&#8221; The hardware in the vehicle is meant to support that ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Those 22 sensors and cameras are now capable of recognizing speed limit signs, construction zones and other road hazards, which, at times, I found a little annoying. There were some stretches where the posted speed limit dropped to 55, and when ADAS was engaged, the S-Class would suddenly slow to match the posted speed. That&#8217;s great when traffic around you isn&#8217;t still moving at 70-plus miles per hour, but in quick-moving traffic, it&#8217;s unnerving.</p>
<p>The new S-Class is also outfitted with a lane-changing assistant that helps the driver safely make a lane change without disengaging the ADAS system. Flip on the blinker while operating cruise control (and keeping your eyes up and hands on the wheel), and the S-Class will safely maneuver the sedan from one lane to the other, provided all is clear, centering it in the lane, with very little input from the driver.</p>
<p>In addition to the ADAS advancements, Mercedes has upgraded its parking assistant, as well. When optioned with its branded Intelligent Park Pilot, the S-Class &#8220;could&#8221; conceivably park itself in multilevel automated valet parking (AVP) structures without a human in the vehicle. As Mercedes notes, though, that would only be available in properly equipped parking structures and &#8220;provided that national legislation permits such operation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new S-Class has gotten so large (overall it&#8217;s as long as most midsized SUVs on the market today), Mercedes integrated new rear-axle steering, which can turn the rear wheels in both directions up to an angle of 10 degrees, which reduces the turning radius by nearly seven feet.</p>
<p>Mercedes has also paired this with an advanced air suspension system that acts both to soften the ride and adapt to float you over rough roads, while providing an additional layer of safety using those sensors and cameras around the car. If a side impact is impending, the system can lift the body of the car by about three inches in a few tenths of a second to protect passengers.</p>

<p>Unlike the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs-stakes-its-claim-on-a-luxury-electric-future/">EQS that my counterpart, Tamara Warren</a>, drove, there was no <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mercedes-unveils-hyperscreen-a-curved-56-inch-screen-for-its-flagship-eqs-electric-vehicle/">56-inch Hyperscreen</a> in the $148,000-plus S580 I drove. Instead, a single 12.8-inch OLED screen that stretches from dash to armrest graces the center stack and is the control hub of the vehicle. Here you can do everything from control the fragrance that emanates from a diffuser in the glovebox to access Mercedes wellness features. The screen is bright and clear in high-noon sun with no glare and surprisingly not distracting at night.</p>

<p>However, one of the most impressive features in the new S-Class is the crystal clear and tremendously impressive 3D, augmented reality, head-up display projected onto the windshield. You can move your head around and still see the display from any angle in the driver&#8217;s seat. It&#8217;s even somewhat visible from the passenger seat. Use the infotainment system (known as MBUX, short for Mercedes Benz User Experience) to navigate to a destination of choice and as you approach offramps, turns and your final location, blue augmented-reality arrows pop up in the HUD and over a video feed of the road ahead in the center stack indicating which lane you should be in, where your turn is and showing exactly where the address you&#8217;re looking for is. You can also turn the feature off and change the driver&#8217;s instrument display if it gets too distracting, using the touch-capacitive buttons on the steering wheel.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The 2022 Mercedes-Benz EQS stakes its claim on a luxury, electric future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs-stakes-its-claim-on-a-luxury-electric-future/embed/#?secret=RTLhr7GLhf" data-secret="RTLhr7GLhf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mercedes says that the computing power of MBUX has increased by 50% compared to the system in the previous model, and the memory bandwidth is 41,790 MB/s powered by NVIDIA Xavier (versus the Tegra 3 in the last generation). That translates to almost no stuttering, load lag or confusion on the system&#8217;s part.</p>
<p>Plus, it also helps the very good, natural language voice recognition system work almost perfectly. You can use touch-capacitive buttons on the steering wheel to activate the voice assistant or simply say the key phrase, &#8220;Hey, Mercedes,&#8221; to activate voice commands. Do everything from ask the system to look something up for you (provided you have connectivity), change the temperature, run one of Mercedes preprogrammed wellness programs (changes lighting, temperature and massage settings), call your parents, or navigate to a new location and the system almost never misses a beat. The only trouble I had with it was when trying to use voice control to navigate to an address with more than four numbers in it. (e.g., 12345 West Elm Street). After a few tries, I resorted to plugging it in on the very intuitive, easy-to-use touchscreen on the center stack.</p>
<p>While I didn&#8217;t spend enough time with the new S-Class to try some of the more advanced AI features it offers, Mercedes says that MBUX can do everything from integrate your connected home into the system to navigate to your favorite spots, just like the one in the EQS. In theory, you can then ask the system to turn on your home lights, and it will learn when you like to start the espresso machine on your drive home., As you drive regular routes and ask the system to perform tasks like make calls, or navigate to a specific place each day, the AI will learn your habits. Eventually, it will simply ask you if you&#8217;d like to call your office at a specific time or set a route to your favorite restaurant.</p>
<p>Packed to the gills with tons of features, technology and amenities that make driving a lot more comfortable and a lot less stressful, it&#8217;s no wonder that the S-Class has already garnered several accolades, including World Luxury Car of the Year (Disclosure: I am a World Car Juror). If luxury is all about seamless and invisible technology that makes long drives feel more like a spa day, then the 2021 Mercedes-Benz S Class has it in spades.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Entrepreneurs’ mental health and stress management started to be more widely discussed amid the pandemic, but for many seasoned entrepreneurs, the topic is still taboo. Now that the world seems to be inching toward a new normal, some founders, investors and mental health experts find themselves asking whether we need to consider mental health moving forward if it wasn&#8217;t an issue before the pandemic.</p>
<p>We do. For one, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/30/investors-and-entrepreneurs-need-to-address-the-mental-health-crisis-in-startup-culture/">absolutely was an issue</a> before the pandemic. Furthermore, what drives the mental health epidemic among entrepreneurs is their propensity to accept risk.</p>

			What drives the mental health epidemic among entrepreneurs is their propensity to accept risk.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Entrepreneurs bring in a lot of vulnerability into their jobs, and when combined with the risks they are required to take, the vulnerability can be exacerbated when those risks don&#8217;t work out,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelfreemanmd/">Michael Freeman</a>, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and founder of <a href="https://econa.net/">Econa</a>. “And in most cases, it doesn&#8217;t work out, and so they are more vulnerable to feeling mental health symptoms and entering a downward spiral. The reverse is also true. When entrepreneurs are knocking it out of the park, they are vulnerable to a different set of mental health challenges.”</p>
<p>So how do we address these issues and train entrepreneurs to sharpen and maintain their mental acuity, particularly when things get tough while fundraising?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple: prevention and awareness. In terms of prevention, Freeman said it comes down to destigmatizing entrepreneur mental health differences, celebrating entrepreneur mental health superpowers and adopting a downside-prevention lifestyle.</p>
<p>&#8220;With mental health, as is true with many things medical, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” Freeman said. “For entrepreneurs who want to prevent mental health issues, they need to start by taking a lifestyle risk factor assessment.”</p>
<p>According to Freeman, there are five ways entrepreneurs can support their mental health. (If you or someone you know is feeling hopeless and depressed, please call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 800-273-8255.)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sleep</strong>. The most significant role of sleep is to help your brain power up and stay awake during the day. Allowing your mind and your body to recover can have a profound preventative effect. You can’t pitch if you can’t keep your eyes open.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise, and make sure you sweat</strong>. Entrepreneurs should get at least 45 minutes of exercise a day, including an intensity that makes you sweat twice a week. It not only has health benefits: It enhances <a href="https://www.understood.org/en/learning-thinking-differences/child-learning-disabilities/executive-functioning-issues/what-is-executive-function">executive functioning</a>, meaning it improves your ability to focus and get things done. It also helps you regulate your emotions when you&#8217;re listening to a VC completely shred your idea so you don&#8217;t become despondent after a call. When you&#8217;re fundraising, your ability to think clearly can be the difference between getting a yes and a no.</li>
<li><strong>Get and keep friends that have nothing to do with business</strong>. Entrepreneurship is a lonely profession at times. Aside from work, you want to have a small but engaged circle of friends and loved ones, and be careful not to let your relationships devolve into the blur of work. Keep those relationships and allow them to support you when work gets rough.</li>
<li><strong>Eat well, and eat strategically</strong>. Many entrepreneurs live at or below the poverty line at some point in their journey, and when you&#8217;re under pressure with limited resources, eating junk and fast food is the wrong tradeoff to make because they aren&#8217;t good for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/cognitive-functioning">cognitive functioning</a>, among many other health consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Address mental health concerns in weeks, not months</strong>. When entrepreneurs don&#8217;t manage concerns quickly, they can turn into adverse outcomes. &#8220;If mental health symptoms are prolonged … it can lead to more severe mental health consequences,” Freeman said. “The adverse personal outcomes include anything from experiencing more serious mental health issues to disrupting social relationships and performance falloffs at work. The adverse business outcomes that may result include bankruptcy, losing employees, alienating strategic alliance partners and scaring away potential investors.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Awareness begins by gaining an understanding of the factors that could exacerbate your stress levels and impact your ability to complete a successful raise, and then planning accordingly. Things that could raise your stress levels include everything from your pre-raise financial status and health history to gender, race, industry attitudes, institutional barriers and even citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Entrepreneurs of color, immigrants and women are far more conscious of the glass ceiling,” Freeman said. “It can be a factor in your mental health while you&#8217;re raising. … People from groups that have been otherized in one way or another have different obstacles that are difficult to overcome overall, as well as from a mental health perspective.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerryschrader/">Kerry Schrader</a>, the co-founder of SaaS platform <a href="https://www.mixtroz.com/">Mixtroz</a>, knows all too well how these things can impact you while fundraising. Although she and her daughter <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleeanneammons/">Ashlee Ammons</a> did eventually raise more than a million dollars, the pressure of potentially being the next Black women to do so was overwhelming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stopped holding onto the pressure of being the <a href="https://www.carolroth.com/blog/how-the-mother-daughter-founders-of-mixtroz-raised-more-than-1-million/">37th and 38th</a> Black women to raise over $1 million,” she said. “We got caught up thinking, if we&#8217;re not successful, then we will be the reason other Black women are not funded. Honestly, we decided to remove that additional layer of stress from our thinking and just focused on running a profitable business that people could get behind and hoping for the same grace the majority of our white male counterparts get upon failure: Another chance and more funding, which we knew was and still is not the norm.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Schrader, there was little information available about how to manage their mental health while fundraising, leading her and her daughter to try a variety of methods before finding something that made sense.</p>
<p>Based on her experience, here are five more ways entrepreneurs can manage their mental health while fundraising.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Find a counselor or therapist to help navigate your increased stress level</strong>. There&#8217;s a slow shift that has helped entrepreneurs reframe therapy from something that you do as a reaction to being overwhelmed to a preventative method that helps you thrive. &#8220;I leveraged <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/">BetterHelp</a> to talk with someone while I raised,” Schrader said. “By communicating to a third party, I could say anything. Venting privately allowed me to reframe my conversations with investors more effectively. By having a qualified professional to speak to, I was able to shift my mindset from, ‘You&#8217;re doing me a big favor’ to ‘I have an exciting opportunity and I&#8217;m allowing you to invest early.’ Counseling helped a lot.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Give yourself an out</strong>. Goal-setting is a great way to keep things on track, but it can create an illusion that you&#8217;re not going to be successful if you&#8217;re not constantly moving toward a finite endpoint. &#8220;Initially, we started putting criteria for what actions we would take if we did not hit certain milestones,” Schrader said. “Instead of feeling like we could put ourselves in a position of failure, we had rules for when it would be time to end the business and go back to our careers. Having an agreed-upon ‘out’ with my co-founder … was great for my mental health. And here we are, years later, still in the game and mostly sane.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Leverage your team</strong>. You can’t go it alone. Be willing to rely on your team to move your startup forward and preserve your health. &#8220;Shortly after we closed our friends and family round, I was diagnosed with breast cancer,” Schrader said. “I was going to radiation, surgery and treatments while I was raising. I was pitching from the hospital bed. But when you&#8217;re fundraising, it never stops. That&#8217;s when my daughter decided it was time to commit full time. As a family, we realized we needed to lean on each other if we were going to be successful long term.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Remain flexible with your plans</strong>. When you&#8217;re just starting, you focus too much on set plans. But when you dig into the backstories of prominent entrepreneurs, you&#8217;ll find that they pivoted as needed and learned on the go. &#8220;There were times during our raise when we had to be able to cope with weekly, daily and even hourly changes to our plan,” Schrader said. “I describe it as buying a plane, learning to fly the plane and then looking for a hangar to refuel all at the same time. You can try to organize all you want, but I don&#8217;t know how much planning you can do.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Be intentional about the type of stress you&#8217;re willing to deal with for money</strong>. When you&#8217;re fundraising, the obvious goal is to secure a check. But some entrepreneurs agree to untenable terms in order to receive capital. It&#8217;s important to know your limits before you walk into the room. &#8220;When someone thinks they have the upper hand they will try to see how much stuff they can push you for. Don&#8217;t forget your why. … When you know what you can take without losing yourself, stand your ground,” Schrader said. “And remember, even as an entrepreneur, declining is always an option, specifically if the decision to decline protects your sanity.&#8221;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.airbankos.com">Airbank</a>, a startup that is taking advantage of open banking regulation and related APIs to aggregate all your bank accounts. Focused on startups and small and medium companies, the company wants to build an all-in-one banking interface to access financial data, initiate payments, manage cash flow and more.</p>
<p>Airbank just raised a $3 million (€2.5 million) seed round led by Pia d&#39;Iribarne and Jean de la Rochebrochard at <a href="https://www.newwave.vc">New Wave</a>, with Speedinvest and Tiny VC also participating. A handful of business angels are also joining the round, such as Cris Conde (Executive in Residence at Accel), Luca Ascani (Accel scout) and Marc McCabe (Sequoia scout).</p>
<p>The startup’s value proposition is quite simple and can be easily explained in one screenshot. With Airbank, you can enter your login information for all the bank accounts and related accounts that you use. After that, you can view everything from your Airbank account:</p>

<p>Many companies have to deal with multiple bank accounts for several reasons — you may have opened one bank account when you incorporated your company, another bank account to request a loan, a Wise Business account for low foreign transaction fees, a Revolut Business account to get debit cards for everyone, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to bank accounts, chances are you’re also generating revenue with Stripe, PayPal or Shopify. Many executives lose a ton of time connecting to web portals, exporting data as CSV files, importing those files in Microsoft Excel and consolidating all that information.</p>
<p>Airbank automatically refreshes your balances across several accounts. You can see your total balance in multiple currencies. It can also help you reconcile transactions with outstanding invoices as you can search across multiple accounts at once.</p>
<p>This is just a starting point as Airbank wants to become the only interface for all your banking needs. You can categorize transactions, see how much you’re spending with each supplier, track recurring payments and export everything to Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. Soon, you’ll be able to use Airbank for cash flow forecasting and automatic reconciliation with your Xero or Quickbooks data.</p>
<p>Open banking isn’t limited to account aggregation. With proper APIs, you should be able to initiate payments from a third-party product. And Airbank plans to take advantage of that as the company is working on payments. As you can manage access rights, Airbank could act as the payment portal for the finance team.</p>
<p>“Open banking has enabled smooth integrations with banks, which we can utilize to offer richer banking and payments experiences for our users. Our vision is to build an all-in-one finance hub that connects all your financial accounts in one place. Our integrations will bring bill payments, expense management, and FX all in a single product that is easy to use,” co-founder and CEO Christopher Zemina said in a statement.</p>
<p>Other startups have been working on cash flow management, such as <a href="https://agicap.com">Agicap</a>, and B2B payments, such as <a href="https://libeo.io">Libeo</a> and <a href="https://upflow.io">Upflow</a>. Airbank is starting with account aggregation and wants to tackle B2B finance in a holistic manner.</p>
<p>Vertical SaaS products have been booming lately. And there’s a reason why the space is quite competitive. There’s still a ton of stuff to do around B2B fintech and specialized software-as-a-service products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Quanergy Systems, the Sunnyvale, California-based lidar company, said Tuesday it has agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition fund CITIC Capital Acquisition Corp., a Chinese blank-check firm affiliated with the country’s largest state-owned investment conglomerate.</p>
<p>The deal, which puts an implied valuation on Quanergy at $1.4 billion, is expected to close in the second half of 2021. After closing, the transaction will inject the lidar company with around $278 million in pro forma net cash, including $40 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) funding.</p>
<p>Lidar is an essential component of most autonomous driving systems – the notable exception being Tesla’s stack, which is attempting to develop a pure vision-based system to support its pursuit of automated driving (Tesla vehicles are not autonomous today and have what is considered a Level 2 advanced driver assistance system). Quanergy is a developer of solid state silicon lidar units, which pulses a low-power laser through an optical phased array to measure the distance and shape of objects. Historically, lidar sensors involved moving parts – generally some mechanism to rotate the laser so it can scan the surrounding area. The company also develops perception software that interprets the sensor data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Quanergy has had a bumpy road to the NYSE. The company generated a lot of hype after it announced in 2016 that it had developed a lidar that cost <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/08/quanergy-s3/">$250 or less</a> (for reference, around the same time Velodyne was selling a lidar sensor for $75,000). The news shot the company to unicorn status and incited talks of a potential initial public offering, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-08-13/how-a-billion-dollar-autonomous-vehicle-startup-lost-its-way">Bloomberg reported</a>. But excitement was tempered after Quanergy hit technical roadblocks.</p>
<p>Then the company announced in January 2020 that CEO and co-founder Louay Eldada would be leaving the company. Kevin Kennedy took over as interim CEO, then became the permanent leader in April. Quanergy says it has more than 350 customers and 40 partnerships globally, across both the automotive and internet of things sectors. Its investors include automakers Daimler and Geely, as well as Samsung and Enterprise.</p>
<p>Quanergy says the proceeds from the SPAC transaction will be used to accelerate research and development, pay down debt and fund working capital. Upon closing, Quanergy will be listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “QNGY.”</p>
<p>The SPAC, CITIC Capital Acquisition Corp., is sponsored by CITIC Capital Holdings Limited, an investment firm backed by Chinese conglomerate CITIC Group. Quanergy must file for clearance with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The company anticipates CFIUS greenlighting the deal because CITIC would keep its stake in the company below 10%, and Quanergy does not record any personal driver data, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-quanergy-nears-china-backed-spac-deal-go-public-sources-2021-06-21/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p>Quanergy is not the first lidar company to go public via a SPAC merger. Others include AEye, which will merge with CF Finance Acquisition Corp. III <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/aeye-becomes-latest-lidar-company-to-go-public-via-spac/">at a $2 billion deal</a>, and Volvo-partnered Luminar at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/lidar-startup-luminar-to-go-public-via-3-4-billion-spac-merger/">$3.4 billion valuation</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s antitrust watchdog has ordered an investigation into allegations that Google has abused the dominant position of Android in the country’s smart TV market. The news comes hours after the European Union <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">opened a formal antitrust investigation</a> into allegations that Google abuses its leading role in the advertising-technology sector.</p>
<p>In its initial review, the Competition Commission of India, which began looking into these allegations last year, said Google had breached certain anti-competitive laws. An investigation of this scale can take quarters, if not over a year, to resolve.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commission is of the prima facie opinion that by making pre-installation of Google’s proprietary apps (particularly Play Store) conditional upon signing of ACC (Android Compatibility Commitments) for all Android devices manufactured/distributed/marketed by device manufacturers, Google has reduced the ability and incentive of device manufacturers to develop and sell devices operating on alternative versions of Android i.e. Android forks, and thereby limited technical or scientific development relating to goods or services to the prejudice of consumers in contravention of Section 4(2)(b) of the Act,&#8221; the watchdog said in its 24-page order.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Further, ACC prevents OEMs from manufacturing/ distributing/ selling any other device which operate on a competing forked Android operating system. Therefore, given the dominance of Google in the relevant markets and pronounced network effects, by virtue of this restriction, developers of such forked Android operating system are denied market access resulting in violation of Section 4(2)(c) of the Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google, which counts India as its largest market by users and last year committed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">investing $10 billion in the country</a>, denied any wrongdoing. &#8220;We are confident that our smart TV licensing practices are in compliance with all applicable competition laws,&#8221; a company spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Competition Commission of India added that it found Google requiring television manufacturers pre-installing all its &#8220;must-have&#8221; apps and not having the ability to pick and choose from alternatives &#8220;amounts to imposition of unfair condition on the smart TV device manufacturers and thereby in contravention of Section 4(2)(a)(i) of the Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It also amounts to prima facie leveraging of Google’s dominance in Play Store to protect the relevant markets such as online video hosting services offered by YouTube, etc. in contravention of Section 4(2)(e) of the Act. All these aspects warrant a detailed investigation,&#8221; the competition regulator added.</p>
<p>About 8 million smart TV sets were sold in India in 2019, over 60% of which were powered by Google’s Android operating system.</p>
<p>It’s a tough week for American giants in India. On Monday evening, the world’s second largest internet market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/india-proposes-tougher-e-commerce-rules-following-widespread-cheating-and-unfair-trade-by-amazon-and-flipkart/">proposed tough e-commerce rules</a> that could hurt Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s order is the third ongoing antitrust case investigation that India has opened against Google. Late last year, India’s antitrust watchdog opened an investigation into Google for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/india-opens-antitrust-case-against-google-over-its-payments-app/">allegedly abusing the dominant position of its app store</a> to promote its payments service in the South Asian nation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The future of work is long on long-distance, and today a startup that&#8217;s built a platform to help organizations hire global talent and build out those remote workforces is announcing a round of funding on the heels of strong growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oysterhr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oyster</a> &#8212; which provides tools to help with hiring, onboarding, payroll, benefits and salary management services for both contractors and full-time employees working outside of an organization&#8217;s home country &#8212; has closed a Series B of $50 million.</p>
<p>We understand that the funding is coming in at a $475 million valuation, six times the company&#8217;s valuation when it last raised money &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/oyster-snaps-up-20m-for-its-hr-platform-aimed-at-distributed-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 million round just four months ago</a>. The company itself has seen business grow &#8220;exponentially&#8221; since then, said Tony Jamous, London-based Oyster&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Jack Mardack. The company now works with 80 large businesses, he said, helping them fill knowledge worker roles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Stripes is leading the Series B, with previous backers Emergence Capital and The Slack Fund, as well as new investor Avid Ventures, also participating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jamous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/oyster-snaps-up-20m-for-its-hr-platform-aimed-at-distributed-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told me back in February</a> that the idea for building Oyster was first planted when he was working at his first startup, Nexmo (which eventually he sold to Vonage), after being faced with the challenges of hiring talent internationally, and specifically the millions the company invested to build out the infrastructure to do so itself, since every country has very specific procedures for employing people and handling all of the contractural, tax, and regulatory details related to that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oyster&#8217;s mission has been to  make it possible for any company to hire wherever they want, without going through that pain themselves, making the &#8220;world their oyster,&#8221; so to speak.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While that in itself is a great idea that definitely fills a need for businesses, it has also been compounded by recent changing tides. Not only are more people wanting to work further afield, but at &#8220;home&#8221;, many companies &#8212; especially those who need to fill knowledge worker roles &#8212; are facing talent shortages. All of this is driving even more demand for sourcing and hiring candidates from further afield, and a culture in the workplace that it&#8217;s possible to work well even if you are not in the same physical space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;What&#8217;s happening in the world is that there&#8217;s a talent shortage, and also there&#8217;s no need to be in the office anymore,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When it comes to tapping into the global talent pool, if you think about it, if you&#8217;re a London-based company, then the chances that your best talent is in London is less than 1%. So by tapping into the global talent pool, suddenly you&#8217;re dramatically increasing your chances, especially if you depend on talent as as a key source of your success.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of startups in the market today targeting the remote working opportunity &#8212; helping companies source and hire people wherever they happen to be located &#8212; and Oyster is not the only one of them raising big money to scale. Others include Deel, which is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/payroll-startup-deel-raises-funds-at-1-25-billion-valuation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now valued at $1.25 billion</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/turing-nabs-32m-more-for-an-ai-based-platform-to-source-and-manage-engineers-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing</a>; Papaya Global (now also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/papaya-global-raises-100m-more-at-a-1b-valuation-for-tools-to-hire-pay-and-manage-distributed-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at over $1 billion</a>); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/remote-raises-35m-to-help-orgs-with-global-workforce-payroll-benefits-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remote</a>, and many more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oyster is not &#8212; yet? &#8212; in the business of helping to source or vet potential hires, but once someone is identified and an organization wants to make an offer, Oyster provides a seamless way to handle the rest, including giving advice on whether it&#8217;s best to hire the person as a contractor or full time employee (the trend here, he said, is full-time), how to handle benefits based on the country in which the talent is based; and other aspects of remuneration, again particular to each local market. Pricing ranges from $29 per person, per month for contractors, to $399 for working with full employees, to other packages for larger deployments.</p>
<p>The company also has a public service mission in all this. Jamous himself originally hails from Lebanon and has a particular mission to help people from less high-profile parts of the world, and emerging countries, also get on the career ladder. In this day and age, since relocation and migration are no longer a must-do, it opens up a lot of opportunities for people that didn&#8217;t exist before. Oyster applied for, and now has B-Corp certification, which it&#8217;s using to fill out that global employment and talent mandate.</p>
<p>This is not just for greater good, though. There are actual talent shortages, and a recent study from Korn Ferry, cited by Oyster, found that 1.5 billion knowledge workers will be entering the workforce in the next decade from emerging economies. Building tools to help hire and manage that talent makes business sense.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with Stripes for the next chapter of growth and positive impact for Oyster,” said Jack Mardack, co-Founder of Oyster, in a statement. “Investors like Stripes, Emergence, Slack Fund, Avid, and PeopleTech Partners among others, who share in our passion for the Oyster mission and vision for the future of work, give us the rocket fuel we need to change the world by unblocking access to job opportunities for everyone.”</p>
<p>&#8220;The transition to remote work is one of the most fundamental macro trends in business today and COVID-19 accelerated that transition by 10 years,” said Saagar Kulkarni, partner at Stripes, in a statement. “Oyster makes it seamless for any company to hire the best person for each job, removing location as a barrier. Tony and the team have built the best software product in the market and are poised to build a market-defining company. We are thrilled to join the entire Oyster team on their mission to level the playing field for the global workforce.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.vantage.sh/">Vantage</a>, a service that helps businesses analyze and reduce their AWS costs, today announced that it has raised a $4 million seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz. A number of angel investors, including Brianne Kimmel, Julia Lipton, Stephanie Friedman, Calvin French Owen, Ben and Moisey Uretsky, Mitch Wainer and Justin Gage, also participated in this round</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vantage.sh/">Vantage</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/vantage-makes-managing-aws-easier/">started out</a> with a focus on making the AWS console a bit easier to use &#8212; and help businesses figure out what they are spending their cloud infrastructure budgets on in the process. But as Vantage co-founder and CEO Ben Schaechter told me, it was the cost transparency features that really caught on with users.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were advertising ourselves as being an alternative AWS console with a focus on developer experience and cost transparency,&#8221; he said.&#8221;What was interesting is &#8212; even in the early days of early access before the formal GA launch in January &#8212; I would say more than 95% of the feedback that we were getting from customers was entirely around the cost features that we had in Vantage.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2168621" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168621" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2168621" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png" alt="" width="1024" height="761" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png 2484w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=300,223 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=768,571 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=680,505 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=1536,1141 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=2048,1522 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168621" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vantage</p></div></p>
<p>Like any good startup, the Vantage team looked at this and decided to double down on these features and highlight them in its marketing, though it kept the existing AWS Console-related tools as well. The reason the other tools didn&#8217;t quite take off, Schaechter believes, is because more and more, AWS users have become accustomed to infrastructure-as-code to do their own automatic provisioning. And with that, they spend a lot less time in the AWS Console anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;But one consistent thing &#8212; across the board &#8212; was that people were having a really, really hard time twelve times a year, where they would get a shock AWS bill and had to figure out what happened. What Vantage is doing today is providing a lot of value on the transparency front there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last few months, the team added a number of new features to its cost transparency tools, including machine learning-driven predictions (both on the overall account level and service level) and the ability to share reports across teams.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168622" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168622" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2168622" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png" alt="" width="1024" height="702" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png 2484w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=680,466 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=1536,1054 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=2048,1405 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168622" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vantage</p></div></p>
<p>While Vantage expects to add support for other clouds in the future, likely starting with Azure and then GCP, that&#8217;s actually not what the team is focused on right now. Instead, Schaechter noted, the team plans to add support for bringing in data from third-party cloud services instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number one line item for companies tends to be AWS, GCP, Azure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But then, after that, it&#8217;s Datadog Cloudflare Sumo Logic, things along those lines. Right now, there&#8217;s no way to see, P&amp;L or an ROI from a cloud usage-based perspective. Vantage can be the tool where that&#8217;s showing you essentially, all of your cloud costs in one space.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is likely the vision the investors bought in as well and even though Vantage is now going up against enterprise tools like Apptio&#8217;s Cloudability and VMware&#8217;s CloudHealth, Schaechter doesn&#8217;t seem to be all that worried about the competition. He argues that these are tools that were born in a time when AWS had only a handful of services and only a few ways of interacting with those. He believes that Vantage, as a modern self-service platform, will have quite a few advantages over these older services.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can get up and running in a few clicks. You don&#8217;t have to talk to a sales team. We&#8217;re helping a large number of startups at this stage all the way up to the enterprise, whereas Cloudability and Cloud Health are, in my mind, kind of antiquated enterprise offerings. No startup is choosing to use those at this point, as far as I know,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The team, which until now mostly consisted of Schaechter and his co-founder and CTO Brooke McKim, bootstrapped to company up to this point. Now they plan to use the new capital to build out its team (and the company is actively hiring right now), both on the development and go-to-market side.</p>
<p>The company offers a <a href="https://www.vantage.sh/pricing">free starter plan</a> for businesses that track up to $2,500 in monthly AWS cost, with paid plans starting at $30 per month for those who need to track larger accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pro-privacy browser <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a>, which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/brave-is-launching-its-own-search-engine-with-the-help-of-ex-cliqz-devs-and-tech/">testing its own brand search engine</a> for several months &#8212; operating a waitlist where brave (ha!) early adopters could kick the tyres of an upstart alternative in Internet search &#8212; has now launched the tool, Brave Search, in global beta.</p>
<p>Users interested in checking out Brave&#8217;s non-tracking search engine, which is built on top of an independent index and touted as a privacy-safe alternative to surveillance tech products like Google search, will find it via Brave&#8217;s desktop and mobile browsers. It can also be reached from other browsers via <a href="https://search.brave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://search.brave.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB4NzAgBdIdSTvM0yk0hGH1LyDtA">search.brave.com</a> &#8212; so doesn&#8217;t require switching to Brave&#8217;s browser to use.</p>
<p>Brave Search is being offered as one of multiple search options that users of the company&#8217;s eponymous browser can pick from (including Google&#8217;s search engine). But Brave says it will make it the default search in its browser later this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As we reported back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/brave-is-launching-its-own-search-engine-with-the-help-of-ex-cliqz-devs-and-tech/">March</a>, the company acquired technology and developers who had previously worked on Cliqz, a European anti-tracking search-browser combo which closed down in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/cliqz-pulls-the-plug-on-a-european-anti-tracking-alternative-to-google-search/">May 2020</a> &#8212; building on a technology they&#8217;d started to develop, called Tailcat, to form the basis of the Brave-branded search engine.</p>
<p>The (now beta) search engine has been tested by more than 100,000 &#8220;early access users&#8221; at this point, per Brave. It&#8217;s made this <a href="https://vimeo.com/565464396/5eedcfd477">video ad</a> to tout its &#8220;all in one&#8221; alternative to Google search + Chrome.</p>
<p>The company recently passed 32M monthly active users (up from 25M back in March) for its wider suite of products &#8212; which, as well as its flagship pro-privacy browser, includes a news reader (<a href="https://brave.com/announcing-brave-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/announcing-brave-today/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwxRHCu5kDlzKx2cczjrNR6Vdoqw">Brave News</a>), and a <a href="https://brave.com/brave-and-guardian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/brave-and-guardian/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEO0JCZEU0qwKpXWORyRcXvgQ3qGQ">Firewall+VPN service</a>.</p>
<p>Brave also offers privacy-preserving <a href="https://brave.com/brave-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/brave-ads/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbCTrFQx9JJNVYffsRBznC9cihtQ">Brave Ads</a> for businesses wanting to reach its community of privacy-preferring users.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brave is launching its own search engine with the help of ex-Cliqz devs and tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/brave-is-launching-its-own-search-engine-with-the-help-of-ex-cliqz-devs-and-tech/embed/#?secret=nLZ0TLd7wp" data-secret="nLZ0TLd7wp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Growing public awareness of surveillance based business models has been building momentum for pro-privacy consumer tech for a number of years. And several players which started out with a strong focus on one particular pro-privacy product (such as a browser, search engine or email) have been expanding into a full suite of products &#8212; all under the same non-tracking umbrella.</p>
<p>As well as Brave, there&#8217;s the likes of DuckDuckGo &#8212; which offers non-tracking search but also a tracker blocker and an email inbox protector tool, among other products, and reckons it now has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/__trashed-13/">between 70M-100M users</a> overall; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/protonmail-gets-a-slick-new-look-as-privacy-tech-eyes-the-mainstream/">Proton, the maker of e2e-encrypted email service ProtonMail</a> but also a cloud calendar and file storage as well as a VPN. The latter recently confirmed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/__trashed-13/">passing 50M users globally</a>.</p>
<p>There is also Apple itself too, of course &#8212; a Big Tech giant that competes with Google and the adtech complex by promising users a privacy premium to drive sales of its hardware and services. (At the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021">start of this year</a> Apple said there are now over 1BN iOS users globally &#8212; and over 1.65BN Apple devices.)</p>
<p>Tl;dr: The market for privacy consumer tech is growing.</p>
<p>Still, even Apple doesn&#8217;t try to compete against Google search which perhaps underlines the scale of the challenge involved in trying to poach users from the search behemoth. (Albeit, Apple extracts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/14/google-paying-apple-3-billion-to-remain-default-search--bernstein.html">massive payments from Google</a> to preload the latter&#8217;s search engine onto iOS devices &#8212; which does conflict with (and complicate) its wider, pro-privacy, pro-user promises while also adding a nice revenue boost for Apple&#8230; ).</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo has, by contrast, been at the non-tracking search coalface for years &#8212; and turning a profit since 2014. Though clearly not in the same profit league as Apple. But, more recently, it&#8217;s also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/duckduckgo-gets-10m-from-omers-for-global-privacy-push/">taken in rare tranches of external funding</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/on-a-growth-tear-duckduckgo-reveals-it-picked-up-100m-in-secondary-investment-last-year/">as its investors spy growing opportunity</a> for private search.</p>
<p>Other signs of expanding public appetite to protect people&#8217;s information from commercial snoopers include the surge of usage for e2e encrypted alternatives to Facebook-owned WhatsApp &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/">such as Signal</a> &#8212; which saw a download spike earlier this year, after the advertising giant announced unilateral changes to WhatsApp&#8217;s terms of service.</p>
<p>Credible players that have amassed a community of engaged users around a core user privacy promise are well positioned to ride each new wave of privacy interest &#8212; and cross sell a suite of consumer products where they&#8217;ve been able to expand their utility. Hence Brave believing the time is right for it to dabble in search.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave, said: “Brave Search is the industry’s most private search engine, as well as the only independent search engine, giving users the control and confidence they seek in alternatives to big tech. Unlike older search engines that track and profile users, and newer search engines that are mostly a skin on older engines and don’t have their own indexes, Brave Search offers a new way to get relevant results with a community-powered index, while guaranteeing privacy. Brave Search fills a clear void in the market today as millions of people have lost trust in the surveillance economy and actively seek solutions to be in control of their data.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On a growth tear, DuckDuckGo reveals it picked up $100M in secondary investment last year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/on-a-growth-tear-duckduckgo-reveals-it-picked-up-100m-in-secondary-investment-last-year/embed/#?secret=5dkET35lvR" data-secret="5dkET35lvR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Brave touts its eponymous search offering as having a number of differentiating features vs rivals (including smaller rivals) &#8212; such as its own index which it also says gives it independence from other search providers.</p>
<p>Why is having an independent index important? We put that question to Josep M. Pujol, chief of search at Brave, who told us: &#8220;There are plenty of incentives for censorship and biases, either by design, or what is even more difficult to combat, unintentional. The problem of search, and how people access the web, is that it is a mono-culture, and everybody knows that while it’s very efficient, it’s also very dangerous. A single disease can kill all the crops. The current landscape is not fail-tolerant, and this is something that even users are becoming aware of. We need more choices, not to replace Google or Bing, but to offer alternatives. More choices will entail more freedom and also get back to real competition, with checks and balances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Choice can only be achieved by being independent, as if we do not have our own index, then we are just a layer of paint on top of Google and Bing, unable to change much or anything in the results for users’ queries. Not having your own index, as with certain search engines, gives the impression of choice, but in reality such engine &#8216;skins&#8217; are the same players as the big-two. Only by building our own index, which is a costly proposition, will we be in a position to offer true choice to the users for the benefit of all, whether they are Brave Search users or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although, for now, it&#8217;s worth noting that Brave is relying on some provision from other search providers &#8212; for specific queries and in areas like image search (where, for example, it says it&#8217;s currently fetching results from Microsoft-owned Bing) &#8212; to ensure its results achieve adequate relevancy.</p>
<p>Elsewhere it also says it&#8217;s relying upon anonymized contributions from the community to improve and refine results &#8212; and is seeking to live up to wider transparency claims vis-a-vis the search index (which it also claims has &#8220;no secret methods or algorithms to bias results&#8221;; and for which it will &#8220;soon&#8221; be offering &#8220;<a href="https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/goggles.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/goggles.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLB7RFV0dgjxk9pRQ0-1MQ27mH0Q">community-curated open ranking models</a> to ensure diversity and prevent algorithmic biases and outright censorship&#8221;).</p>
<p>In another transparency step Brave is reporting the percentage of users&#8217; queries that are independent by showing what it bills as &#8220;the industry’s first search independence metric&#8221; &#8212; meaning it displays the ratio of results coming exclusively from its own index.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is derived privately using the user&#8217;s browser as we do not build user profiles,&#8221; Brave notes in a press release. &#8220;Users can check this aggregate metric to verify the independence of their results and see how results are powered by our own index, or if third-parties are being used for long tail results while we are still in the process of building our index.&#8221;</p>
<p>It adds that Brave Search will &#8220;typically be answering most queries, reflected by a high independence metric&#8221;. Although if you&#8217;re performing an image search, for example, you&#8217;ll see the the independence metric take a hit (but Brave confirms this will not result in any tracking of users).</p>
<p>&#8220;[<a href="https://brave.com/transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/transparency/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnUdHuInbNHjYiS__sy4b5fyhfVg">Transparency</a>] is a key principle at Brave, and there will also be a global independence metric for Brave Search across all searches, which we will make publicly available to show how we are progressing towards complete independence,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168093" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168093" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2168093" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="409" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?resize=768,462 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?resize=1536,924 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168093" class="wp-caption-text">Example of Brave&#8217;s &#8216;independence metric&#8217; for search results (Image credits: Brave)</p></div></p>
<p>On the monetization side, Brave says it will &#8220;soon&#8221; be offering both a paid ad-free version of search in the future and an ad-supported free version &#8212; while still pledging &#8220;fully anonymous&#8221; search. Though it specifies that it won&#8217;t be flipping the ad switch during the early beta phase.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will offer options for both ad-free paid search and ad-supported free search later,&#8221; it notes. &#8220;When we are ready, we will explore bringing private ads with BAT revenue share to search, as we&#8217;ve done for Brave user ads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Users of the search engine who do not also use Brave&#8217;s own browser will be served contextual ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Brave Search via the browser, strong privacy guarantees for opt-in ads are a norm and a brand value that we uphold,&#8221; adds Pujol, confirming that users of its search and browser are likely to get the same type of ad targeting.</p>
<p>Asked about pricing of the forthcoming ad-free version of the search engine he says: &#8220;Although we have not finalized the launch date or the price yet, our ad-free paid search will be affordable because we believe search, and access to information, should be available on fair terms for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interesting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/">recent development in Europe</a>, Google &#8212; under pressure from antitrust regulators &#8212; has agreed to ditch a pay-to-play auction model for the choice screen it offers regional users of its Android platform, letting them pick a default search engine from list with a number of rivals and its own brand Google search. The move should expand the number of alternative search engines Android users in Europe are exposed to &#8212; and could help chip away at some of Google&#8217;s search marketshare.</p>
<p>Brave previously told us it would not participate in Google&#8217;s paid auction &#8212; but Pujol says that if the new model is &#8220;truly free to participate&#8221; it will likely take part in future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google and free-to-participate seem difficult to believe, given plenty of precedents but if this model is indeed truly free to participate, without contracts or non-disclosure agreements, then we would likely participate,&#8221; he says. &#8220;After all, Brave Search is open to everyone who would like to use it, and we are open and happy to put Brave Search on any platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have localized browsers throughout the European market, so in addition to growth via the Brave browser growing, we intend to grow Brave Search’s usage by marketing our best-in-class privacy on all media that reach prospective users,&#8221; he adds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With as much seed capital as there is in the market today, we talked to investors about startups raising later Series As than before, while Series B rounds can happen incredibly rapidly.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When SoftBank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/20/softbank-vision-fund-first-close/">announced its first Vision Fund back in 2017</a>, TechCrunch gawked at the size of the fundraising vehicle and its $100 million minimum check size. Noting a few of its early deals, we wrote that &#8220;the party is just getting started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little did we know how accurate that quip would become. The Vision Fund poured capital into a host of companies with big plans, or what could at least be construed as grandiose hypotheses about the future. And after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/the-first-vision-fund-is-officially-done-investing-and-spent-100m-every-day-of-its-existence/">deploying $98.6 billion in a blizzard of deals</a>, SoftBank left the venture capital market changed.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;Strange&#8221; may be the best way to describe today&#8217;s venture capital market, at least in the United States.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a stretch to say that the Vision Fund helped make the venture capital game faster in terms of deal pacing and larger in terms of deal scale. The Vision Fund was also content to write checks at amped valuations, leading some investors to privately carp about lost deals.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s venture capital market is currently enduring another wave of venture capital angst, this time driven by Tiger Global. Tiger often writes smaller checks than what SoftBank&#8217;s capital cannon wielded, but its pace and willingness to invest a lot, very early, at prices that other investors balk at, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-tiger-globals-deal-machine">is making waves</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>And while Tiger races to build what increasingly appears to be a private index fund of software startups that have reached some sort of scale or growth, the venture capital market is seeing its traditional benchmarks tied to different tiers of investment molt, meld or disappear altogether.</p>
<p>Old metrics that would ready a startup for a successful Series A are antiquated clichés. As are <a href="https://twitter.com/danprimack/status/1407289437495640065">round sizes</a> for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/transmit-security-raises-543m-series-a-to-kill-off-the-password/">Series A startups</a>; it&#8217;s increasingly common for seed-stage startups to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/">reload their accounts several times</a> before approaching an A, and Series B rounds often resemble the growth-stage deals of yesteryear.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s confusing, and not Tiger&#8217;s fault, per se; the Tiger rush is a variation on the Vision Fund&#8217;s own venture disruption. The Vision Fund followed in the footsteps of a16z, which raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz/investor_financials/funds">large, rapid funds early in its life</a> and garnered a reputation at the time for having a willingness to pay more than other venture capital firms for the same deal.</p>
<p>Where does all the change leave us? In a fascinating, if turbulent, market for startup fundraising.</p>

During our conversation concerning venture capital dynamics, Seseri said something incredibly interesting: With as much seed capital as there is in the market today, she&#8217;s seeing startups raise later Series As than before. But, she added, with the creep of late-stage capital into the earlier stages of venture investing, Series B rounds can happen rapidly after a company raises an A.</p>
<p>So, slow As and fast Bs. We wanted to dig more into the concept, so we asked a number of other investors about her view. We&#8217;re tackling the question in two parts, focusing on the U.S. market today and the rest of the world later this week.</p>
<p>What we found out is that while Seseri&#8217;s view regarding late As and early Bs is correct for many startups, it really depends on whether they are on the radar of later-stage firms. And yes, some of the investors mentioned Tiger in their responses. Let&#8217;s dive in to understand what founders are really dealing with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve chronicled, in great detail, the many layers of technology, services and solutions that have been wrapped around the world of education in recent years &#8212; and especially in the last year, which became a high watermark for digital learning tools because of COVID-19. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.merlyn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merlyn Mind</a> is coming out of stealth with a proposition that it believes helps tie a lot of this together in the K-12 classroom &#8212; a &#8220;digital assistant&#8221; that comes in the form of a piece of custom hardware and software to &#8220;read&#8221; natural voice and remote control commands from a teacher to control multimedia apps on a screen of choice. Along with this, Merlyn Mind is announcing $29 million in initial funding to build out its vision.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by specialist edtech investor Learn Capital, with other unnamed investors participating. It comes after Merlyn Mind spent about three years quietly building its first release and more recently piloting the service in 50+ classrooms in more than 20 schools.</p>
<p>Co-founded by longtime IBM scientists Satya Nitta (the CEO), Ravi Kokku and Sharad Sundararajan &#8212; all of whom spent several years leading education efforts in IBM&#8217;s Watson AI research division &#8212; Merlyn Mind is coming to the market with a patented, vertically integrated solution to solve what Nitta told me in an interview he believes and has seen firsthand to be a fundamental pain point in the world of edtech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In effect, education and technology may have now been merged into a single term as far as the tech world is concerned, but in terms of practical, on-the-ground application, many teachers are not making the most of the tools they have in the classroom. The majority are, he believes, facing &#8220;cognitive overload&#8221; (which is not to mention the kids, who themselves probably are facing the same: a problem for it to tackle down the road, I hope), and they need help.</p>
<p class="p1">To be fair, this problem existed before the pandemic, with research from <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/how-artificial-intelligence-will-impact-k-12-teachers"><span class="s1">McKinsey &amp; Co.</span></a> published in 2020 (and gathered earlier) finding that teachers were already spending more than half of their time on administrative tasks, not teaching or thinking about how and what to teach or what help specific students might need. Other research from <span class="s2"><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56339016e4b095e84e825b9c/t/5f32b92fa125645492b75bf9/1597159728178/EdTech+Insights-+2020+EdTech+Top+40+School+Year+Report.pdf"><span class="s1">Learn Platform</span></a></span> found that teachers potentially have as many as 900 different applications that they can use in a classroom (in practice, Nitta told me a teacher will typically use between 20 and 30 applications, sites and tech services in a day, although even that is a huge amount).</p>
<p class="p1">Post-COVID-19, there are other kinds of new complications to grapple with on top of all that. Not only are many educators now playing catch-up because of the months spent learning at home (it&#8217;s been widely documented that in many cases, students have fallen behind), but overall, education is coming away from our year+ of remote learning with a much stronger mandate to use <em>more</em> tech from now on, not less.</p>
<p class="p1">The help that Merlyn Mind is proposing comes in the form of what the startup describes as an &#8220;AI hub.&#8221; This includes a personal assistant called Merlyn; a classroom AI hub called Symphony Classroom, a kind of Alexa-style voice interface tailored to the educational environment and built on a fork of Android; a smart speaker that looks a bit like a soundbar; and a consumer-style remote that can be used also for navigation and commands.</p>
<p class="p1">These then work with whatever screen the teacher opts to use, whether it is a TV, or an interactive whiteboard, or something else; along with any other connected devices that are used in the classroom, to open and navigate through different apps, including various Google apps, Nearpod, Newsela and so on. (That could potentially also include kids&#8217; individual screens if they are being used.)</p>
<p class="p1">The idea is that if a teacher is in the middle of a lesson on a specific topic and a question comes up that can best be answered by illustrating a concept through another app, a teacher can trigger the system to navigate to a new screen to find that information and instantly show it to the students. The system can also be used to find a teacher&#8217;s own materials on file. The demo I saw worked well enough, although I would love to see how an ordinary teacher &#8212; the kind they&#8217;re hoping will use this &#8212; would fare.</p>
<p class="p1">Everyone knows the expression &#8220;hardware is hard,&#8221; so it&#8217;s interesting to see Merlyn addressing its problem with a hardware-forward approach.</p>
<p>Nitta was very ready with his defense for this one:</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you why we built our own hardware,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;There&#8217;s a bunch of AI processing that&#8217;s happening on the device, for various reasons, including latency and security. So it&#8217;s kind of an edge AI appliance. And the second thing is the microphones. They are designed for the classroom environment, and we wanted to have complete control over the tooling of these microphones for the processing, for the environment, and that is very hard to do. If you are taking a third-party microphone array off the shelf, it&#8217;s impossible, actually, you simply cannot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s early team is rounded out with alums from the likes of HP Education, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Broadcom and Roku to help build all of this, knowing the challenges they were tackling, but also the payoff once it would be finished if it all works.</p>
<p>&#8220;W<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">e have a very, very talented team, and we basically said, right, this is going to be a lot of hard work that will take us three and a half years. We have to build our own piece of hardware&#8230; and </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">we ended up building the entire voice stack from from scratch ourselves, too,&#8221; Nitta continued. &#8220;It means we have end to end control of everything from the hardware all the way to the language models.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He did point out though that over time, there will be some elements that will be usable without all the hardware, in particular when a teacher may suddenly have to teach outside the classroom again in a remote learning environment. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very ambitious concept, but where would education and learning be if not for taking leaps once in a while? That&#8217;s where investors stand on the startup, too.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>&#8220;Just as we saw with the breakthrough edtech company Coursera which reached IPO this year and was started a decade ago by two machine learning professors, in today&#8217;s hypercompetitive market the best edtech companies need to start with an advanced technological core,&#8221; said Rob Hutter, founder and managing partner of Learn Capital. &#8220;<span class="il">Merlyn</span> is one of the first companies to focus on the enhancement of live teaching in classrooms, and it is developing a solution that is so intuitive it allows teachers to leverage technology with mastery while using minimal effort. This is a very promising platform.&#8221;</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The proof will be in how it gets adopted when it finally launches commercially later this year, with pricing to be announced later.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The conversation on founder pay is changing for the better. We've gathered insights from founders and VCs and narrowed down the most important factors and benchmarks to guide your decision.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;If you&#8217;re the founder of a seed-stage [company and] you&#8217;re worried about your electricity staying on this month, then your salary is too low. If you&#8217;re saving $10,000/mo, then your salary is probably higher than necessary,&#8221; investor Leo Polovets <a href="https://twitter.com/lpolovets/status/1365124742110355456">wrote</a> in a Twitter thread.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Ultimately, a good test is to ask how you&#8217;ll feel if your startup fails: Will you wonder if your salary contributed to its fall? Or will you regret sacrificing more than you can recover?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This tweet is just one of many in a now burgeoning conversation about how founder pay needs to change. The startup and investor communities are beginning to realize that many founders can&#8217;t go without pay for months.</p>
<p>Founders of SaaS startups are at an advantage in this scenario as the sector now has many companies generating revenue almost from day one, sometimes without needing to raise any funding at all.</p>
<p>However, the success still doesn&#8217;t tell founders how much to pay themselves, or what others are doing. To help with this, we&#8217;ve gathered insights from founders and VCs and narrowed down the most important factors and benchmarks to guide your decision.</p>
<h2>A framework for compensation</h2>
<p>Founder compensation is often referred to as a &#8220;founder salary,&#8221; but anchoring the conversation around the salary framework can create the wrong expectation. For example, you could try to establish a correlation between what you plan to pay yourself and your past or current value on the job market. Instead, the data we gathered indicates that founders typically take a pay cut from their previous salaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrissosnowski/">Chris Sosnowski</a> is an interesting example: Before he “took the plunge” at the beginning of 2020 to work full time on his water data management startup <a href="https://www.waterlyapp.com/">Waterly</a>, he used to earn &#8220;well over&#8221; $100,000. But he says his previous salary wasn&#8217;t a key factor when he set his compensation. &#8220;I decided to pay myself based on what I thought it would take to keep the company running,&#8221; he wrote to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>That brings to mind deferred compensation, which will be familiar to anyone who owns equity. Having put his own money into the company and owning the majority of it, Sosnowski is set to be compensated for his efforts if all goes well. &#8220;For the record, I do hope to pay myself back [a] salary for the year or so [it is] reduced like this,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2017, Paul Hawken published a book (<a href="https://drawdown.org/drawdown-framework">Drawdown</a>) compiling a set of concrete actions people could take to combat climate change. Inspired by this, <a href="https://fiftyyears.com/team/seth-bannon">Seth Bannon</a>, founding partner at <a href="https://fiftyyears.com/">Fifty Years</a>, a firm that provides seed funding for companies aiming to make the world a better place, decided to do something similar to address systemic racism, and the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Racial-Inequity-Drawdown-RID-9d1136788f9c4647a7667b33b0e82b0a">Racial Inequity Drawdown</a> was born.</p>
<p>Today, the company is revealing this document to the world and &#8220;open sourcing&#8221; it with the goal of making the framework part of the conversation to address racial inequity in startup investing and in the broader world.</p>
<p>Bannon, like many people, was looking for ways to better understand the impact of racism in the wake of George Floyd&#8217;s murder last year. He began to think about it, much like climate change, as a huge, multidimensional set of problems. He wanted to understand the scope of these problems to use his investment capital to help address some of these issues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;So we incubated the Racial Inequity Drawdown at Fifty Years and the reason we did is because we got excited about finding and funding companies that addressed racial inequity in the same way we do the climate crisis or disease or all these other things &#8212; and it&#8217;s really hard because it&#8217;s such a multidimensional issue,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As a starting point, he decided to create a document similar to &#8220;Drawdown&#8221; that looked at these issues in a single place to help him and his firm understand the scope of the problem, and to help them look at their investments through a racial equity lens.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started to pull together resources just for ourselves, so that we could have racial equity be a lens that we use for our own investing and we were like, &#8216;Oh my God, there&#8217;s a lot here.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>That led to one of the company&#8217;s fellows taking ownership of the project, with the goal of fleshing out a comprehensive document. The resulting framework is built on three pillars or broad sets of categories, including Health &amp; Wellbeing, Equality of Opportunity and Sustainable Systems, with each pillar including different elements of the racial inequity problem that need to be addressed. And each sub-category includes a detailed definition of the problem, key terms, a set of companies and organizations currently working on the issue and what still needs to be done (perhaps openings for startup ideas).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168523" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168523" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2168523" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-22-at-8.36.18-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="Three broad pillars of Racial Inequity Drawdown Document" width="680" height="220" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-22-at-8.36.18-AM.jpg 2334w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-22-at-8.36.18-AM.jpg?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-22-at-8.36.18-AM.jpg?resize=300,97 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-22-at-8.36.18-AM.jpg?resize=768,249 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-22-at-8.36.18-AM.jpg?resize=680,220 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-22-at-8.36.18-AM.jpg?resize=1536,498 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-22-at-8.36.18-AM.jpg?resize=2048,663 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-22-at-8.36.18-AM.jpg?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168523" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fifty Years</p></div></p>
<p>To make it more than a document created in-house, Bannon and his team wanted to take it a step further, so he brought in a group of college students to begin reaching out to communities of color to participate in this initiative and bring it to life.</p>
<p>One of those students is Elizabeth Poku, a rising sophomore at Princeton, who said she was drawn to the project as a way to flip the script on racism. &#8220;What I hope to do in the future is really hijack existing systems and structures that used to put down and oppress people and make sure we&#8217;re changing those narratives, changing those systems to really work for those that they were putting down,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>She saw Racial Inequity Drawdown as a way to help to do this and joined the team, helping to write some sections of the document, including the one on the impact of lack of access to healthcare on people of color. She says that the team then reached out to communities working on the problem and began to compile resources into a database, including startups that have been working to solve the different elements documented in the framework.</p>

<p>Bannon says that investors who want to build racial equity as a lens into their investment process can use this document as a guide, and it also acts as a signal that a firm cares about this as it allocates resources to different startups, certainly that&#8217;s the case for Fifty Years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of this for us was just defining what that means, and now we have a really great start here. And then second is letting entrepreneurs know that we care about racial equity as a lens, and that if you are addressing racial equity, that&#8217;s going to be a big plus in our book.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Obviously, that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re definitely going to be able to fund you, but that&#8217;s going to be a big plus, and we&#8217;re excited about that and attacking racial inequity through technology and entrepreneurship.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firm sees today&#8217;s launch as a starting point, one that others can build on and add to the conversation, and build on this initial framework. At the same time, it gives members of the startup ecosystem, whether that&#8217;s entrepreneurs or investors, a way to start looking at their investments or projects through this racial equity lens.</p>

<p>&#8220;We really want to make this drawdown start the conversation and make sure this is at the forefront of people&#8217;s minds. That&#8217;s our main goal. So yes, if that includes helping community members really find out how they can [help] these startups get into the tech world, that&#8217;s definitely part of our mission,&#8221; Poku explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.myzeller.com/">Zeller</a>, a Melbourne-based fintech founded by former Square executives to serve small- to mid-sized businesses, has raised $50 million AUD (about $37.5 million USD) led by Spark Capital, the investment firm whose portfolio also includes Twitter, Slack and Coinbase. Zeller&#8217;s valuation is now $400 million AUD (about $301 million USD).</p>
<p>The funding included participation from returning investors Square Peg, Apex Capital Partners and Addition, and brings Zeller’s total raised in less than a year to $81 million AUD. This amount includes a pre-launch Series A led by Addition, the investment firm started by Lee Fixel, and seed funding.</p>

<p>Zeller was founded last year by Ben Pfisterer, Square’s former Asia Pacific and Australia head, and Dominic Yap, the fintech’s former strategy and growth lead. The company <a href="https://www.myzeller.com/about/press/zeller-launches-new-business-banking-alternative-for-underserved-australian-businesses">launched its first products for small businesses on May 4</a>, including EFTPOS (electronic funds transfer at point of sale) terminals, business accounts and cards.</p>
<p>The company says more than 1,500 Australian businesses signed up in the month after its launch, and weekly payment volume has been growing 200%. About 80% of businesses that started using Zeller switched from Australia’s four biggest banks, citing their desire for lower fees and better customer support.</p>
<p>Zeller’s new funding will be used to grow its research and engineering hub, including filling 18 new engineering roles that will support Zeller’s plan to become a fully regulated business bank.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Spark Capital investor James Kuklinski said, “From our first meeting with Ben, we knew we wanted to be a part of Zeller. Australia’s business banking landscape is dominated by a small group of incumbents, and is ripe for disruption through simpler, more transparent pricing, best-in-class technology and better customer service.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than a million people migrate to the U.S. each year. Upon their arrival, they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/zolve-raises-15-million-for-its-cross-border-neobank-aimed-at-global-citizens/">face challenges in opening a local bank account</a> and accessing financial services at regular rates.</p>
<p>These challenges for migrants, a significant portion of whom also need to send money home, have persisted globally for decades, despite <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/migrants-sent-billions-of-dollars-home-amid-covid-19-economic-hardships-11620834545">large government support programs</a>.</p>
<p>Now an entrepreneur, who in his previous venture fought exorbitant phone tariff charges to help people make phone calls at low-cost, believes he has found the solution &#8212; and definitely a vote of confidence from investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.majority.com/en/">MAJORITY</a> said on Tuesday it has raised $19 million in its seed funding. The financial round was led by Valar Ventures while Avid Ventures, Heartcore Capital and several prominent Nordic fintech unicorn founders participated in it.</p>

<p>The two-year-old startup operates an eponymous mobile banking service. MAJORITY, whose name is a play on bringing financial inclusion to more people, runs a subscription service where it charges $5 a month to individuals and provides them with a range of financial services, including an FDIC-insured bank account with early direct deposit at no overdraft fee, a debit card, mobile credit and at-cost international phone calls.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168598" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168598" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2168598 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="558" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg?resize=768,418 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168598" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credit:</strong> MAJORITY</p></div></p>
<p>Another reason why so many migrant communities are apprehensive of opening accounts with traditional banks, said Magnus Larsson (pictured above), founder and chief executive of MAJORITY, is that they don’t feel welcome there.</p>
<p>“You might not speak the language, or understand the cultural differences,” he said. To tackle this, MAJORITY has hired customer and sales relation representatives from various communities to work with customers to understand their needs.</p>
<p>Houston and Stockholm-headquartered MAJORITY also runs a community on its app to help individuals who have moved to the U.S. find familiar people and a “home” environment, he said. “Customers there find how to get a visa as well as things like information about places to do local shopping,” he said.</p>
<p>“As veterans within the migrant tech sector, the team behind MAJORITY has already established themselves as builders of disruptive solutions for the world’s immigrants,” said James Fitzgerald, founding partner at Valar Ventures. “By supporting them for continued growth, we are confident that they will bring better and well-needed banking services to immigrants in the U.S.”</p>
<p>Starting today, the service is available in all 50 U.S. states and complies with local regulations, said Larsson, who previously served as the chief executive of Swedish technology firm Rebtel. Sutton Bank is MAJORITY&#8217;s banking partner.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the new funding to expand its product offerings and broaden its team of about 80 people. “Since we are a company of immigrants for immigrants, we also look forward to hiring diverse talent that exists within the different immigrant communities we serve. This is more important now than ever given that many have been hit hard by the pandemic,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As venues reopen across the U.S., Mixhalo has announced a pair of additions to its in-person audio live event audio streaming platform: Mixhalo Over Cellular and Mixhalo Rodeo.</p>
<p>The first is, more or less, what it sounds like. Rather than relying on Wi-Fi, the leverages 5G. The company says it will be able to offer a similar “ultra-low latency” that made the initial Wi-Fi product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/mixhalo-series-a/">so compelling</a>.</p>
<p>Mixhalo is working with a carrier to roll out the feature, but won’t say which. It notes, however, that while it would work with LTE, for obvious reasons, 5G provides a greater opportunity to decrease latency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rodeo, meanwhile, is designed to work with existing venue wireless to circumvent the need to install an additional overlay system.</p>
<p>“The Rodeo system actually reduces network strain since the existing access points are now aware of the Mixhalo traffic and can plan for and buffer network data accordingly,” CEO John Vars tells TechCrunch. “If a venue has installed a wireless system post-2015, they are likely to have the necessary hardware to support Rodeo in their venue. We do need to install a server in the venue’s server room, but that is the only hardware component of Rodeo.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168564" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168564" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2168564" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1017" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg 1696w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=300,298 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=768,763 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=680,675 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=1536,1525 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168564" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mixhalo</p></div></p>
<p>Co-founded by Incubus guitarist Mike Einziger, Mixhalo launched its product onstage at Disrupt 2017 (with some help from Pharrell), promising to deliver live event sounds through its ultra-low latency streaming tech.</p>
<p>Naturally, 2020 and the first half of this year have been a pretty major trial for a startup so tied to live events. Vars tells TechCrunch that the company was forced to reduce headcount at the beginning of the pandemic as contracts were ended, but adds that the company has managed to grow since, in part on the strength of a number of partnerships.</p>

<p>“The silver lining in all of this is that we got a chance to step back and laser-focus on improving our core product,” says Vars. “These improvements include this announcement of Mixhalo Rodeo and Mixhalo over Cellular, as well as the capability to dynamically adjust latency based on physical position in the venue &#8212; we may not have had the time and opportunity to work on these improvements in the full swing of pre-pandemic business. With these new features, we’ve seen piqued interest from partners in the sports world and are excited to see this use case of Mixhalo really take off.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kairos, the startup studio led by Ankur Jain, is launching a new brand today called <a href="https://www.biltrewards.com/">Bilt Rewards</a>. Bilt is a rewards program that lets renters earn each time they make a rent payment.</p>
<p>The company is funded by Kairos, which is the studio that is also responsible for brands like Rhino, Alloy, and Little Spoon.</p>
<p>Bilt has two main pieces, a rewards platform and a credit card, powered by Mastercard.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the rewards side, Bilt has partnered with estate owners and property managers including the Blackstone Group, The Related Companies and Equity Residential. Folks who rent with these entities can now earn rewards each time they pay their rent, with the opportunity to earn even more rewards for things like lease renewals or lease signing bonuses.</p>
<p>The co-branded <a href="https://www.biltrewards.com/card">Bilt Mastercard</a> credit card allows renters at those properties, or any other renter, to pay their rent with the credit card. As a renter myself, and as one that is still forced to pay by check via snail mail, this is a welcome offering.</p>
<p>Folks who use the Bilt Mastercard will earn 2x points on rent payments and one point per dollar spent on the card elsewhere.</p>
<p>These points, whether earned through spending on the card or by paying rent at Bilt-partnered properties, can be used toward travel with airlines and hotels, as well as other perks like group fitness classes. But perhaps the most significant option for spending points is to use them toward a mortgage payment.</p>
<p>Bilt worked with regulators, as well as Fannie Mae and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to gain approval for using rewards points toward a mortgage. So not only can people use their rewards points toward their down payment on a home, but folks using the Bilt Mastercard can also build their credit score and earn rewards at the same time, bringing down the rates on their mortgage.</p>
<p>On the revenue side, Bilt takes a cut of the transaction fee alongside Mastercard for purchases made through the Bilt credit card. The startup also generates revenue by charging property managers for the points they distribute to their tenants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three years ago, if you asked us if we could bring together an alliance of property owners to work together under one unified rewards program, it would have been hard to imagine,&#8221; said Jain. &#8220;If you think about getting payment networks to collaborate on a credit card or fees on rent, most people would have said that&#8217;s not possible. Getting regulatory approval from the U.S. government was a huge hurdle we had to overcome. Building out every airline and hotel partnership was huge. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s taken three years. This has been the hardest project we&#8217;ve worked on.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Squad used to be an app that connected people with similar interests for in-person meetups. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit. While most social apps thrived under these conditions &#8212; people craved digital connection more than ever &#8212; Squad couldn’t operate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder <a href="https://www.isawatson.com/">Isa Watson</a> didn’t know how long the world would be in shutdown. Instead of waiting for a return to normalcy, she shifted the scope of the app entirely.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://www.withyoursquad.com/">Squad</a> relaunches as an audio-based social app that aims to help users deepen their relationship with their existing circle of close friends. Squad is an audio-only app, but don’t worry &#8212; it’s not another Clubhouse wannabe. Instead, it functions as a news feed of voice message updates from your closest friends, which expire after 24 hours.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can add up to 12 friends to your “squad,” and once you post an update, your squad members can emoji react or send a private voice message in response &#8212; these also expire after a day, encouraging users to be more open about what they share. Soon, Squad will support phone calls, but there currently isn’t functionality for group calls or group audio messaging. But, users might be incentivized to talk on the phone via Squad rather than a typical call, since you can add a title to your call. That way, your squad member knows why you’re calling before they pick up. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168416" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168416" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2168416" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168416" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Squad</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a big gap in the social landscape, because most of the tools are discovery platforms, broadcast platforms and personal branding platforms,” Watson said. “There’s a huge opportunity for us to come in and help people maintain stronger connections with the people that they enjoy the most.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posting a voice update feels more genuine than a curated Instagram shot or a crafted Facebook status update (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/is-facebook-dead-to-gen-z/">Facebook is decidedly uncool</a> among Gen Z and millennials). As the popularity of apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/amid-controversy-dispo-confirms-series-a-funding-high-profile-advisors-and-investors/">Dispo</a> show, young people are responding well to ephemeral, authentic social media experiences. But the audio-only medium could be a hard sell for people who aren’t already sending voice messages on WhatsApp or iMessage. However, while Squad’s initial rollout will be domestic, there’s great potential for an app like this outside of the U.S., where <a href="https://in.mashable.com/culture/11736/if-youre-not-voice-messaging-youre-missing-out-heres-how-to-do-it-right">voice messaging is more popular</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of the conversations that would happen on text message are now happening in an asynchronous audio type of way,” Watson added. “So we expect that to continue to penetrate further into our habits.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watson raised a $3.5 million seed round in 2019, and she was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/06/raising-vc-in-silicon-valley-as-a-female-poc/">featured on TechCrunch</a> with advice on raising venture capital as a woman of color in Silicon Valley. Despite changing the direction of her app, her investors &#8212; which include Michael Dearing (Harrison Metal), Aaron Levie (Box), Katrina Lake (Stich Fix), Jen Rubio (Away) and Stewart Butterfield (Slack) &#8212; remain supportive. Watson secured another million dollars of funding after the seed round, bringing Squad’s funding to a total of $4.5 million to date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One thing [the investors] said to me was, ‘Isa, you’ve been talking about this shift in social for years now, and people told you you were crazy, that social was all figured out and there was nothing that was going to happen,’ ” Watson said. “Now, people are buying into that change.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168418" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168418" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2168418" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168418" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Squad</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Squad isn’t a Clubhouse competitor, the rise of audio-only media is a good sign for the app’s ability to crack a saturated social market (so many social apps are trying to compete with Clubhouse, it’s a miracle we don’t yet have audio-only Tinder speed dating). In Squad’s beta test, 87.5% of users completed the onboarding process. Still, Squad falls victim to the same accessibility issues that plague Clubhouse and many of its clones. As of yet, Squad doesn’t support captioning, though Watson says this is something the company has discussed and hopes to implement down the road. Not only could captioning broaden Squad’s audience, but it could also further differentiate the app from messaging giants like iMessage and WhatsApp. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, if you’re someone who loves to send voice messages in your group chats, you might want to get your friends on Squad. Currently, the app is invite-only with a waitlist. Once you’re off the waitlist, you get three invites. If you post for five days straight, you get three more invites, and if someone you invited signs up, you get two more invites as well. This continues until you round out your 12-member squad.</span></p>
