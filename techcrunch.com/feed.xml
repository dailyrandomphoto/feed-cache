										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://neeva.com/search?q=Joby+Aviation&amp;src=nvobar">Joby Aviation</a> is now public, twelve years after JoeBen Benvirt founded the company at his ranch in the Santa Cruz mountains. The air taxi developer began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol “JOBY,” after completing a merger with special purpose acquisition company Reinvent Technology Partners.</p>
<p>As of 10:00 AM ET, the price per share was at $11.01, up 9.8% from its prior-day closing amount.</p>
<p>Joby’s post-transaction valuation now stands at $4.5 billion, the largest in the industry. It also now has the highest cash balance. All told, Joby has around $1.6 billion in total capital to take its air taxi operations to commercialization in 2024. That includes $835 million of private-investment-in-public-equity as well as more than $500 million of capital on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>RTP <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-238165/">reported</a> to the Securities and Exchange Commission that around 63% of the 69 million ordinary shares were redeemed prior to the public trading debut, giving Joby access to $255 million out of the $690 million of cash held in trust from the blank-check firm.</p>

<p>It’s a sizable amount, but creating an entirely new form of transportation is a capital-intensive business. Joby’s executive chairman Paul Sciarra told TechCrunch he thinks $1.6 billion will be enough to prepare the company for launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We think that&#8217;s enough to execute on the things that matter over the next few years, and those are […] one, ensuring that we execute on the certification program; two, showing we can demonstrate our ability to repeatedly manufacturing these aircraft in a certifiable way; and then third and finally, the opportunity to lay the groundwork for commercial launch,” Sciarra said.</p>
<p>Joby is developing a five-seat electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, which it unveiled to much anticipation in February. The company, which has backing from Toyota and JetBlue, has released a slew of announcements in recent months as it geared up for the public listing.</p>
<p>“A lot of people talk about us as a secretive company,” Benvirt said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We&#8217;re not actually a secretive company, we just choose to do the work and then show our work, rather than talking about it and then doing it.”</p>

<h2>From $RTP to $JOBY</h2>
<p>Joby’s merger with blank-check firm Reinvent, headed by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/joby-aviation-takes-flight-into-the-public-markets-via-a-spac-merger/">announced in February</a>. The transaction includes a few provisions to ensure longer-term collaboration, including a lock-up on founder shares for up to five years, as well as vesting provision with earnout not realized until the price per share reaches $50 – a $30 billion market cap.</p>
<p>SPACs are not a new instrument for going public, but they have gained a widespread presence in the transportation space, particularly amongst eVTOL startups looking to secure amounts of capital. Archer Aviation was the first developer to announce it would merge with a blank-check firm, followed by Joby, Lilium and Vertical Aerospace. But there are signs that the investment bubble may be starting to deflate: late last month, Archer cut its valuation by $1 billion in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824502/000110465921097282/tm218061d22_ex99-1.htm">“strategic reset”</a> of the transaction terms with Atlas Crest Investment Corp.</p>
<p>Such turbulence is not uncommon in markets populated by pre-revenue companies. But despite now being a public company – and having shareholders to answer to – Sciarra said Joby’s task remains unchanged. “We can’t control the markets,” he said. “[Joby] is a company that&#8217;s been executing quietly for a very long time on things that matter. I think it&#8217;s going to be incumbent upon us to do the same as we make this transition to a public company: tell folks what we&#8217;re going to do, and then go out and do them. That, quarter by quarter, is what builds credibility, what combats skepticism, and what gives investors and frankly, the broader public, confidence that this is a company that means what it says.”</p>
<p>One way to frame the fate of air taxis is whether they will be more like autonomous vehicles or electric vehicles. The AV space circa five years ago was filled with companies setting ambitious expectations about when true self-driving cars would be on the roads, only to have multiple companies collapse or sell under the weight of overshot expectations.</p>
<p>But Sciarra suggested that a better analogy to the eVTOL industry as it currently stands is the early days of electric vehicles. He pointed out that Joby’s aircraft is designed to conform to existing safety and certification standards, with a trained pilot onboard, similar to how helicopters and planes operate today. “We didn&#8217;t want to compound the technical risk of developing a new aircraft with the technical and regulatory risk of developing full autonomy from day one.”</p>
<p>“We think about our approach as a little bit more Tesla versus, say, Waymo,” he added.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This week we were back to full strength, with Danny <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> to chat through the latest venture capital brouhaha. Namely whether or not venture capital is about to get shaken to its core, or if we&#8217;re really parsing some long-term economic trends that will eventually revert.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sam Lessin kicked off the Twitter conversation <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-end-of-venture-capital-as-we-know-it">by positing</a> that venture capital as we know it is kaput, with software and later-stage investing possibly seeing the most disruption.</li>
<li>Both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/venture-capital-probably-isnt-dead/">Alex</a> and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/vcs-are-not-going-away-anytime-soon/">Crunchbase News</a> posted responses to the concept, which could best be summarized as <em>yeah, but</em>.</li>
<li>However, the point that there <em>is </em>a lot of non-venture money flooding into startups is both real and material, and worth chewing on. So, masticate we did, parsing which areas of startup investing might be the most winsome for the VCs we spend so very much time talking to,</li>
</ul>
<p>The direction and future of the venture capital world has largely been lost amidst a sea of large numbers. New megarounds. New unicorns. That sort of thing. But inside the rising tide of capital available to private companies has been a mix-shift of sorts. The question is where that goes long-term. We tried to posit a few things that could happen next.</p>
<p>Equity is back on Friday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Galaxy Z Flip is probably destined to forever play second fiddle to the Fold. And with its older and larger sibling now ascending to the ranks of “flagship” with a slew of new features like S-Pen functionality, the designation is probably all but inevitable.</p>
<p>But for those seriously considering the world of foldables, there’s something to be said for the clamshell devices. It has always been the more compact and &#8212; dare I say &#8212; accessible member of the Galaxy Z family. Of course, at $1,380 &#8212; well, let’s just say “accessibility” is relative.” At today’s Unpacked event, however, Samsung announced that the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is getting an even larger price drop than the Fold.</p>
<p>At $999.99, again, we’re speaking relatively here. But at the very least, a nearly $400 price drop brings the Flip into the realm of mainstream flagship pricing (the Fold 3, while cheaper than its predecessor, is still $1,799). Add onto that the learnings that come with a third-generation device, and there’s a case to be made that this is Samsung’s (and, probably the industry’s) most mainstream foldable to date. I mean, anything beats the original Razr foldable, right?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188121" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188121" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188121" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9791.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188121" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Obviously we’re going to hold out for a review unit until we’re able to say something more definitive on the matter. But while Samsung continues to lead with the Fold, don’t sleep on the alternative. Both devices have (understandably) prioritized durability among their new features. That includes a stronger protective film made of PET plastic, coupled with a reconfiguration of the display panels aimed at reinforcing what has traditionally been the weak link on these products.</p>
<p>Also on board is Samsung’s new proprietary Armor Aluminum for the body, Gorilla Glass Victus for the exterior of the device and IPX8 water resistance. That means the new foldables can withstand significantly more water than their predecessors. The “X” in the rating means it’s not rated against debris, due to the nature of the hinges, but Samsung believes the sweeping mechanism it introduced on previous models can make quick work of particulate matter that could potentially fall behind the screen and damage it in the process of pressing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188122" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188122" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188122" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9794.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188122" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The phone has also gotten a striking redesign. When closed, I’d say it’s a considerably better-looking device than the Fold &#8212; not to mention significantly easier to port around in your pocket. The device now comes in Cream, Green, Lavender and Black, coupled with a variety of different grips and straps. If you get it online, you can also choose a Gray, Pink or White version. The internal display is effectively the same as its predecessor at 6.7 inches (2640 x 1080), but the front screen has been further increasing from 1.1 to 1.9 inches &#8212; a not insignificant bump when we’re dealing with those sizes.</p>
<p>The cameras remain roughly the same as the Flip 2:</p>
<ol>
<li>Front: 10MP Selfie. F2.4, Pixel size: 1.22μm, FOV: 80-degree</li>
<li>Rear: 12MP Ultra Wide. F2.2, Pixel size: 1.12μm, FOV: 123-degree</li>
<li>Rear 2: 12MP Wide-angle. Dual Pixel AF, OIS, F1.8 Pixel size: 1.4μm, FOV: 78-degree</li>
</ol>

<p>The battery is (understandably) a fair bit smaller than the Fold’s at 3,300mAh, split over two modules (because, folding). It supports fast-wired and wireless charging, as well as Samsung’s Wireless PowerShare for giving some juice back to your other devices. Like the Fold, the new flip is powered by the Snapdragon 888. Here that’s coupled with 8GB of RAM and either 128 or 256GB of storage.</p>
<p>Like the other devices announced today, the Flip is now up for preorder and starts shipping August 26. Preordering will get you a $150 Samsung Credit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Behold, Samsung’s latest flagship. With the Galaxy Note out of the way &#8212; for this year, at least &#8212; the company used today’s Unpacked event to breathe added legitimacy into its foldable line. The original Galaxy Fold, introduced in 2019, represent a sort of experiment for the company (along with all the hiccups that entailed), as the first foldable from a major hardware manufacture, whereas last year’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 found the company correcting some of the glaring issues with its predecessor.</p>
<p>Today’s event finds the company making the case for Galaxy Z Fold 3 as something beyond an experiment or a curiosity. The task will almost certainly be an uphill battle for the next few generations. Unlike the latest version of the Flip, which starts at a price reduced considerably from its predecessor, the new Fold drops the entry price $200, down to $1,800. Any price reduction is a step in the right direction &#8212; and something that should be increasingly feasible as the technology continues to scale. But even in the world of premium flagships, that will continue to be a tough pill to swallow.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188115" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188115" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2188115" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9765.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188115" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>What the upgraded Fold truly brings to the table, however, is a continued refinement to build materials that make the foldable screen a feasible option for day to day usage. This, of course, is precisely what hamstrung the original. Sure, the company did a lot of testing in controlled rooms, but once the product got out into the world (and into the hands of non-Samsung employees), problems of durability began cropping up, resulting in displays that were unintentionally damaged in a variety of imaginative ways.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Samsung’s new Galaxy Fold arrives September 18 for $2,000&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/samsungs-new-galaxy-fold-arrives-september-18-for-2000/embed/#?secret=pXQBZtqlbS" data-secret="pXQBZtqlbS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold features a stronger frame made of “Armor Aluminum,” new protective film for the foldable display, Gorilla Glass Victus on the front-facing screen and an IPX8 rating &#8212; representing the first waterproof rating for the company’s foldable. Waterproofing has, of course, become something of an industry standard, but obviously things complicate quickly when you add folding mechanisms into the equation.</p>
<p>In fact, that’s why the rating has an “X” stuck in the middle of it. It’s effectively protected from accidental dunks in water, but not dust and debris. This is due to the hinge mechanism created for earlier models that allows some particulate matter through, but sweeps it away with a built in brush that moves as the device opens. That effectively protects it from getting behind the screen, where it could damage the phone with a finger press on the other side.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2188123" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188123" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2188123" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9807.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188123" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, the stronger protective film is the thing. It’s what’s (hopefully) standing between you and damaging your phone’s biggest selling point with an overzealous finger press &#8212; or, for that matter, a stylus. The Fold, after all, is following in the footsteps of Samsung’s S series by blurring the line with the Note (which handily opted to sit this round out).</p>
<p>In fact, Samsung actually went out of its way to create a special Fold Edition of the S-Pen specially designed to not damage the Fold display. It’s optional, of course, and as with the S21, there’s slot for the stylus in the handset &#8212; that’s to be expected, given the relatively fragility of the product. There will, of course, be a case with a built-in S-Pen holster.</p>
<p>The Fold Edition S-Pen is smaller and features a spring-loaded tip designed to retract so you don’t damage the screen by writing/drawing too hard. Certainly the Fold is a clear candidate for stylus functionality, given its 7.6-inch canvas that puts even the Note Ultra’s 6.9-inch screen to shame. Of course, the feasibility of this combination has been severely hampered by structural integrity issues with the screen. It will be interesting to see how the company has managed to navigate that.</p>
<p>At 7.6 inches (<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">2208 x 1768, 374 ppi), the primary screen is largely unchanged. The cover screen, too, is about the same, at </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">6.2 inches &#8212; though it now joins the main screen with a 120 Hz refresh rate. </span></p>

<p>Notably, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the first Samsung device to add an under-display camera. That, along with foldable displays, has been one of the biggest holy grails in the smartphone category for the past several years. Samsung’s not the first to introduce the technology. A handful of Chinese manufacturers, including Xiaomi and Oppo, have either released or plan to release devices sporting the technology.</p>
<p>It’s telling that the company opted to test the water with the Fold. Aside from the obvious aspect of creating a contiguous display, it gives the company the opportunity to test out another mainstream technology. The dirty little secret about the first generation of under-screen cameras is that the picture quality tends to suck. Samsung surely knows this and has opted to stick it on a device that already has a selfie camera above its front display.</p>
<p>The company describes new tech as follows, “the minimum pixels applied on top of the camera hole, Z Fold 3 features an increased viewable area so users get an unbroken canvas for their favorite apps.” The thinking here is that the internal camera simply doesn’t get as much use, save for things like teleconferencing (which is, granted, something we’ve been doing a lot more of in the past year). As currently configured, it’s a bit of a compromise on both ends. Picture quality takes a hit and the camera hole is still semi-visible. So, either the best or worst of both worlds, depending on what you’re looking for.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188125" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188125" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2188125" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188125" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The under-display camera is four megapixels (when was the last time you saw one of those?), verses the 10-megapixel front/cover camera. The rear camera setup is virtually identical to its predecessor:</p>
<ul>
<li>12MP Ultra Wide. F2.2, Pixel size: 1.12μm, FOV: 123-degree</li>
<li>12MP Wide-angle. Dual Pixel AF, OIS, F1.8, Pixel size: 1.8μm, FOV: 83-degree</li>
<li>12MP Telephoto. PDAF, F2.4, OIS, Pixel size: 1.0μm, FOV: 45-degree</li>
</ul>
<p>The battery has taken a bit of a hit, down from 4,500 to 4,400mAh (spread out over two modules, as is the foldable way). The Fold also supports fast charge/fast wireless and Wireless Powershare to use that 4,400mAh battery to power other gadgets. Samsung generally doesn’t offer battery estimates for phones prior to release, so wait on the review for that. The whole thing is powered by a Snapdragon 888 chip (market depending), coupled with 12GB of RAM and either 256 or 512GB of storage.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the devices announced today, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is up for preorder now and starts shipping on the 26th. The $1,800 price tag continues to be a roadblock toward more mainstream adoption, though the company has moved a number of these devices to early adopters already. Preorders get a $200 Samsung Credit.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Today, the release of OpenAI Codex, a new Al system that translates natural language to code, marks the beginning of a shift in how computer software is written.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, there&#8217;s been growing talk about “no code&#8221; platforms, but this is no new phenomenon. The reality is, ever since the first programmable devices, computer scientists have regularly developed breakthroughs in how we &#8220;code&#8221; computer software.</p>
<p>The first computers were programmed with switches or punch cards, until the keyboard was invented. Coding became a matter of typing numbers or machine language, until Grace Hopper invented the modern compiler and the COBOL language, ushering in decades of innovation in programming languages and platforms. Languages like Fortran, Pascal, C, Java and Python evolved in a progression, where the newest language (built using an older language) enabled programmers to &#8220;code&#8221; using increasingly more human language.</p>
<p>Alongside languages, we&#8217;ve seen the evolution of “no-code” platforms — including Microsoft Excel, the 1980s granddaddy of no-code — that empower people to program computers in a visual interface, whether in school or in the workplace. Anytime you write a formula in a spreadsheet, or when you drag a block of code on<a href="http://Code.org"> Code.org</a> or Scratch, you&#8217;re programming, or &#8220;coding,” a computer. “No code” <em>is</em> code. Every decade, a breakthrough innovation makes it easier to write code so that the old way of coding is replaced by the new.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Does this mean coding is dead? No! It doesn&#8217;t replace the need for a programmer to understand code. It means coding just got much easier, higher impact and thus more important.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This brings us to today&#8217;s announcement. Today, OpenAl announced OpenAI Codex, an entirely new way to “write code” in the natural English language. A computer programmer can now use English to describe what they want their software to do, and OpenAl&#8217;s generative Al model will automatically generate the corresponding computer code, in your choice of programming language. This is what we&#8217;ve always wanted — for computers to understand what we want them to do, and then do it, without having to go through a complex intermediary like a programming language.</p>
<p>But this is not an end, it is a beginning. With Al-generated code, one can imagine an evolution in every programming tool, in every programming class, and a Cambrian explosion of new software. Does this mean coding is dead? No! It doesn&#8217;t replace the need for a programmer to understand code. It means coding just got much easier, higher impact and thus more important, just as when punch cards were replaced by keyboards, or when Grace Hopper invented the compiler.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, the demand for software today is greater than ever and will only continue to grow. As this technology evolves, Al will play a greater role in generating code, which will multiply the productivity and impact of computer scientists, and will make this field accessible to more and more computer programmers.</p>
<p>There are already tools that let you <a href="https://bubble.io/">program using only drag-and-drop</a>, or to <a href="https://serenade.ai/">write code using your voice</a>. Improvements in these technologies and new tools, like OpenAI Codex, will increasingly democratize the ability to create software. As a result, the amount of code — and the number of coders — in the world will increase.</p>
<p>This also means that learning how to program — in a new way — is more important than ever. Learning to code can unlock doors to opportunity and also help solve global problems. As it becomes easier and more accessible to create software, we should give every student in every school the fundamental knowledge to not only be a user of technology but also a creator.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In what has quickly become the busiest Unpacked of the virtual era, Samsung just dropped a new version of its wireless earbuds. The Galaxy Buds 2 add active noise canceling to the entry-level model, while retaining the $149 price point.</p>
<p>For those keeping track, the current Galaxy Buds offerings are Buds 2 ($149), Buds Live ($170) and Buds Pro ($200). The addition pretty clearly blurs the line between the first two. Asked for clarification on how the offerings now shake out, Samsung tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>As our premium offering, the Galaxy Buds Pro leverage cutting-edge technology to deliver immersive audio, intelligent Active noise cancelling, and effortless connectivity. For those looking to show off their unique style, the Galaxy Buds Live combine high quality sound with an eye-catching design.</p></blockquote>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>So, design and sound are the differentiators. The Buds Live were, of course, introduced during a time when ANC was more of an exception than a rule for nonpremium-priced earbuds, so I wouldn’t be too surprised to see them start to be phased out.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2188137" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9901.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>As I’ve said in the past, Samsung’s earbuds have always been quietly solid. They don’t get the love of Apple or Sony in that department, but the company has consistently produced solid buds, and I don’t see any reason to expect these will be any different. Of course, the Pros still sit at the high end, in terms of sound quality, 360 audio, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Samsung says the new Buds are their smallest and lightest to date. Indeed, the Buds, the case and everything are quite compact (and surprisingly glossy!). They retain the familiar ovular shape that sits up against the wearer’s ear. They’re built specifically to pair with the company’s mobile devices, but you should be able to connect them to any Bluetooth device.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Along with a surge in connected fitness funding, it seems that rowing machines are really having their moment. In April, Ergatta announced a $30 million raise, last month, CityRow announced a $12 million round for its studios and home machines, and today, Aviron is announcing a $4.5 million round. A rising tide and all that good stuff.</p>
<p>The round, which includes Samsung Next, Formic Ventures, GFC and Y Combinator, follows $750,000 in early-stage funding. As we noted in January, the Toronto-based startup spent much of the pandemic (understandably) pivoting from gym equipment to connected home fitness. As more people look to rowing as a full-body alternative to cycling that’s much kinder on your knees than running, the company’s looking to differentiate itself through gamification.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188401" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188401" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188401" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bug-Blaster.gif" alt="" width="800" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188401" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aviron</p></div></p>
<p>“We’re going a lot harder on the gamification side of things,” founder and CEO Andy Hoang tells TechCrunch. “And that’s the biggest differentiator between, say, us and a Peloton or a Hydro. They focus almost exclusively on instructor-led classes, while we focus on these high-intensity races and fully animated games, where you’re shooting bugs or running away from zombies.”</p>
<p>Last month, however, Peloton announced plans to compete more directly on the game side of things, with plans to roll out in late-2021/early 2022. The first product is a Tron-esque racing game. “Peloton created Lanebreak to complement instructor-led classes with a fresh new experience for members, giving them more ways to stay engaged and motivated with their workouts,” the company wrote in a release last month. Aviron says it’s trying to add something deeper.</p>

<p>“What makes Aviron really different is we’re not gamifying the fitness experience by added new graphics or achievements to the end of your workout,” says Hoang. “What we’re doing is gaming the fitness experience. What makes games really fun and exciting isn’t the bells and whistles. It’s the characters, it’s the story, discovering new things and unlocking them.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2188402" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188402" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188402" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Power-Play.gif" alt="" width="800" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188402" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aviron</p></div></p>
<p>The company has already begun to increase headcount. Last time we checked in, Aviron was at 10 full-time employees. The company has increased to 25, roughly half of whom are involved in its game development team.</p>
<p>“We’re constantly looking for people. Content is our focus, and we’re hiring the right people for marketing and branding,” adds Hoang. “We’re doing a whole new rebrand.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung’s watches have long been something of an anomaly. While the company embraced Wear OS (then Android Wear) in its earliest days with the massive Gear Live, the company quickly shifted to Tizen, an open-source operating system largely used by Samsung for wearables and smart TVs.</p>
<p>That’s no doubt been a kind of bugbear for Google, which has long struggled to crack a significant portion of the smartwatch market. Samsung, meanwhile, has had its share of success with its products while doing its own thing. But there’s always more market share to be grabbed.</p>
<p>Third-party apps have long been an issue for basically every smartwatch maker but Apple (it’s the main reason Fitbit bought Pebble, if you’ll recall), and clearly Samsung saw the opportunity in reigniting its partnership with Google. The deal &#8212; first mentioned at I/O and discussed more recently at MWC &#8212; is now seeing the light of day on the brand new Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.</p>

<p>The companies refer to it as “the new Wear OS Powered by Samsung.” What that means, practically, is that Wear OS serves as the code base. Design and other elements of Tizen exist in here, but for all practical intents and purposes, it’s a custom built version of Google’s wearable operating system, which Samsung helped build out.</p>

<p>The company will stress that latter bit as an important bit of clarification &#8212; that it didn’t just slap a new coat of paint on the OS here. The company’s One UI Watch sits atop all of that, in a bid to create a unified user experience across Samsung’s mobile devices and wearable line.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Per a release:</p>
<blockquote><p>Galaxy Watch 4 Series is also the first generation of smartwatches to feature Wear OS Powered by Samsung — a new platform that elevates every aspect of the smartwatch experience. Built by Samsung and Google, this cutting-edge platform lets you tap into an expansive ecosystem right from your wrist — with popular Google apps like Google Maps, and beloved Galaxy services, like Samsung Pay, SmartThings and Bixby. The new platform also includes support for leading third-party apps, like Adidas Running, Calm, Strava and Spotify.</p></blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/wear-os/galaxy-watch4">a blog post this morning</a>, Google breaks down its end of the partnership thusly,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">We’re taking what we’ve learned from Wear OS and Tizen to jointly build what smartwatch users need. Compared to previous Wear OS smartwatches, the Galaxy Watch4 features a 2.5x shorter set up experience, up to 40 hours of battery life, optimized performance with app launch times 30 percent faster than before and access to a huge ecosystem of apps and services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And there are more ways to get more done from your wrist with Wear OS. We’re introducing more capabilities and a fresh new look based on <a href="https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628699504085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGfMa5pdw3MAogiXBLNfOF9d6qmIw">Material You</a> design language for <span class="il">Google</span> Maps, Messages by <span class="il">Google</span> and <span class="il">Google</span> Pay apps as well as launching a YouTube Music app. There are also new apps and Tiles coming to Wear OS for quicker access to your favorites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The software giant singles out turn-by-turn directions on Google Maps, the ability to download and listen to songs on YouTube Music and improved app discovery via Google Play. The news also finds Google Pay on Wear OS coming to 16 additional countries, including Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Slovakia, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>The other key focus on the line continues to be health &#8212; it’s the field on which all smartwatches are currently competing. The monitoring is built around a smaller version of the company&#8217;s BioActive Sensor, which measures optical heart rate, electrical heart (ECG) and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis. The trio of sensors measure a bunch of different metrics, including blood pressure, AFib monitoring, blood oxygen and now body composition/BMI. So now, for better or worse, your watch will tell you your body fat percentage [post-pandemic grimace face emoji]. Says Samsung, “In about 15 seconds, your watch’s sensor will capture 2,400 data points.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188136" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188136" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188136" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9889.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9889.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9889.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9889.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9889.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9889.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9889.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9889.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9889.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188136" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Design is the primary distinction between the two models. The Galaxy Watch 4 is the thinner and lighter of the two &#8212; more in line with the Galaxy Watch Active. It sports a touch bezel, versus the Classic’s physical spinning bezel &#8212; arguably Samsung’s best innovation in the category.</p>
<p>Also, of note: Both models come in two sizes. That’s always been a bit of a sticking point for me on Samsung Watches. If your devices are large and only come in the one size, you’re essentially knocking out a sizable portion of your customer base right off the bat. The Watch 4 comes in 40mm and 44mm and the Classic is available in 42mm and 46mm. The models start at $250 and $350, respectively. Another $50 will get you LTE connectivity.</p>
<p>The watches go up for preorder today and start shipping on August 26. Preordering will get you a $50 Samsung Credit. The company is also launching a limited-edition Thom Browne version of the Classic in September, which will almost certainly cost an arm and/or leg.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Apple has settled its 2019 lawsuit with Corellium, a company that builds virtual iOS devices used by security researchers to find bugs in iPhones and other iOS devices, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/10/apple-drops-corellium-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>Washington Post</em></a> has reported. The terms of the settlement weren&#8217;t disclosed, but the agreement comes after Apple suffered a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-loss-lawsuit-corellium-120347028.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">major court loss</a> in the dispute in late 2020.</p>
<p>Corellium’s software allows users to run virtual iPhones on a computer browser, giving them deep access to iOS without the need for a physical device. In addition to accusing Corellium of infringing on its copyright, Apple said the company was selling its product indiscriminately, thereby compromising the platform’s security.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Specifically, Apple accused the company of selling its products to governments that could have probed its products for flaws. When he was employed by another company, Corellium co-founder David Wang </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.engadget.com/azimuth-apple-fbi-san-bernardino-iphone-unlock-141617737.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">helped the FBI</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> unlock an iPhone used by a terrorist responsible for the San Bernardino attacks. </span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, a judge dismissed the copyright claims, calling them &#8220;puzzling, if not disingenuous.&#8221; He <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16064642/784/apple-inc-v-corellium-llc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">wrote</a> in his ruling that “the Court finds that Corellium has met its burden of establishing fair use,&#8221; adding that its use of iOS in that context was permissible.</p>
<p>Corellium started offering its platform to individual subscribers earlier this year, after previously only making it available to enterprise users. Each request for access is vetted individually so that it won&#8217;t fall into the wrong hands for malicious purposes, according to the company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Slightly falling quarterly venture capital totals and a notable decline in unicorn formation does not a startup winter make. So let’s look at what's happened more recently.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China’s technology scene has been in the news for all the wrong reasons in recent months. In the wake of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">scuttling of Ant Group’s IPO</a>, the Chinese government has gone on a regulatory offensive against a host of technology companies. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">Edtech got hit</a>. On-demand companies <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meituan-dives-14-china-tech-100133466.html">took incoming fire</a>. Ride-hailing? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/chinese-cybersecurity-probe-validates-didis-pre-ipo-warning-to-investors/">Check</a>. Gaming? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/">You bet</a>.</p>
<p>The result of the government fusillade against some of the best-known companies in China was falling share prices. The damage <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/22/investing/china-us-ipos-intl-hnk/index.html#:~:text=China%27s%20unprecedented%20tech%20crackdown%20has%20wiped%20%241%20trillion,analysts%20said%20in%20a%20research%20report%20last%20week.">topped $1 trillion</a> among just public Chinese companies listed abroad.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>What about startups in sectors that were reformed overnight? If their public comps are any indication, even more wealth was deleted in the recent wave of crackdowns.</p>
<p>The Exchange was curious about the impact of the Chinese government’s actions on the venture capital market. The Chinese startup economy has produced a number of world-leading companies. Tencent and Alibaba, yes, and even Baidu have become well-known for a reason. Could regulatory changes shake up the venture model that helped grow the country’s largest tech concerns?</p>
<p>After we checked in on the same <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/">question this Monday</a>, SoftBank provided a partial answer, noting yesterday that it is pausing investments in China. The Japanese teleco, conglomerate and investing powerhouse has been deploying capital at a rapid pace in recent weeks. That will slow, at least in China. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-posts-lower-profit-as-tech-rally-cools-11628579001?mod=hp_lead_pos3">Here’s the WSJ</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The regulatory initiative in China has become so unpredictable and widespread that SoftBank and its funds are planning to hold off on investing much more there until the risks become clearer, [SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son] said at an earnings press conference in Tokyo.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is SoftBank early to its decision to shake up its investing strategy, missing Chinese deals for some time? Or is it late? We secured data from <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> and <a href="https://tracxn.com/">Traxcn</a> that paints a somewhat surprising picture of venture capital activity at least thus far in Q3 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But first, a reminder of how well China’s venture capital market was performing as 2020 eased its way into 2021.</p>
<h2>Before the shakeup</h2>
<p>China had a reasonably good Q2 2021 despite the turmoil.</p>
<p>Sure, funding flowing into Chinese startups was down 18% compared to Q4 2020, per <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">CB Insights,</a> but that quarter had recorded an all-time high of $27.7 billion. With $22.8 billion raised, Q2 2021 still did better than every other quarter since Q2 2016 with the exception of Q2 2018, Q4 2020 and Q1 2021. Indeed, the ecosystem had started to <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/after-frenetic-start-chinas-vc-ecosystem-cools-in-late-2018/">cool down in late 2018</a> before picking up pace again at the end of 2020.</p>
<p>However, that&#8217;s only one way to look at the numbers. If you compare recent Chinese venture results with other regions, it underperformed. During Q2 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">U.S. funding reached a new high of $70.4 billion</a>, with places like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/">Latin America</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/canadas-startup-market-booms-alongside-hot-global-vc-investment/">Canada</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">India</a> also establishing new records.</p>
<p>This also means that China lost ground as to its share of global startup dealmaking, and the same goes for unicorn creation. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamMCarrigan/status/1405996644135485440">Tech Buzz China&#8217;s summary of CB Insights data</a>, the U.S. accounted for 132 unicorn births between January 1 and June 16, 2021, compared with just three in China.</p>
<p>Slightly falling quarterly venture capital totals and a notable decline in unicorn formation does not a startup winter make. So let’s look at what&#8217;s happened more recently.</p>
<h2>So, what about Q3?</h2>
<p>The thesis that there would be an instantly obvious slowdown in Chinese venture capital activity is not supported by the data we secured.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung is set to introduce a whole bunch of new products, starting today at <strong>7 AM PT/10 AM ET.</strong> I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/what-to-expect-from-samsungs-next-unpacked/">wrote a whole bunch of words about what to expect</a> from the company’s latest Unpacked event. It’s a long list and a kind of return to the pre-pandemic days, back before companies started taking liberties by holding separate events for all their new products.</p>
<p>You can stream the proceedings here:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7ixp-XwqGI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Here’s the short bulleted version, based on a deluge of leaks over the past several weeks and months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Galaxy Z Fold 3</li>
<li>Galaxy Z Flip 3</li>
<li>Galaxy Watch 4</li>
<li>Galaxy Buds 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Samsung has more or less confirmed the first three already. The company gave some substantial details on its forthcoming foldables. We’ve also heard a good deal about the new smartwatch &#8212; from a software standpoint, at least. Both Samsung and Google have been discussing their upcoming joint software platform.</p>
<p>More info on all of the above, soon. And perhaps even a surprise or two? Perhaps. We’ll be following along with the latest.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Trust wants to give smaller businesses the same advantages that large enterprises have when marketing on digital and social media platforms.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.trust.co/">Trust</a> wants to give smaller businesses the same advantages that large enterprises have when marketing on digital and social media platforms. It came out of beta with $9 million in seed funding from Lerer Hippeau, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Upfront Ventures and Upper90.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based company was started in 2019 by a group of five Snap alums working in various roles within Snap’s revenue product strategy business. They were building tools for businesses to fund success with digital marketing, but kept hearing from customers about the advantage big advertisers had over smaller ones — the ability to receive good payment terms, credit lines, as well as data and advice.</p>
<p>Aiming to flip the script on that, the group created Trust, which is a card and business community to help digital businesses navigate the ever-changing pricing models to market online, receive the same incentives larger advertisers get and make the best decision of where their marketing dollars will reach the furthest.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188301" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188301" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188301" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png" alt="" width="1024" height="538" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=1536,806 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=2048,1075 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188301" class="wp-caption-text">Trust dashboard</p></div></p>
<p>Trust does this in a few ways: Its card, built in partnership with Stripe, enables businesses to increase their buying power by up to 20 times and have 45 days to make payments on their marketing investments, CEO James Borow told TechCrunch. Then as part of its community, companies share knowledge of marketing buys and data insights typically reserved for larger advertisers. Users even receive news via their dashboard around their specific marketing strategy, he added.</p>
<p>“The ad platforms are a wall of gardens, and most people don’t know what is going on inside, so our customers work together to see what is going on,” Borow said.</p>
<p>The growth of e-commerce is pushing more digital marketing investments, providing opportunity for Trust to be a huge business, Borow said. <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/quarterly-online-sales/">E-commerce sales in the U.S.</a> grew by 39% in the first quarter, while <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-ad-opportunities-and-capital-spur-investor-interest-in-ad-tech-11625220000">digital advertising spend</a> is forecasted to increase 25% this year to $191 billion. Meanwhile, Google, Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter all recently reported rapid growth in their year-over-year advertising revenues, Borow said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will go toward increasing the company’s headcount.</p>
<p>“We have active customers on the platform, so we wanted to ramp up hiring as soon as we went into general release,” he added. “We are leaving beta with 25 businesses and a few hundred on our waitlist.”</p>
<p>That list will soon grow. In addition to the funding round, Trust announced a strategic partnership with social shopping e-commerce platform Verishop. The company’s 3,500 merchants will receive priority access to the Trust card and community, Borow said.</p>
<p>Andrea Hippeau, partner at Lerer Hippeau, said she knew Borow from being an investor in his previous advertising company Shift, which was acquired by Brand Networks in 2015.</p>
<p>When Borow contacted Lerer about Trust, Hippeau said this was the kind of offering that would be applicable to the firm’s portfolio, which has many direct-to-consumer brands, and knew marketing was a huge pain point for them.</p>
<p>“Digital marketing is important to all brands, but it is also a black box that you put marketing dollars into, but don’t know what you get,” she said. “We hear this across our portfolio — they spend a lot of money on ad platforms, yet are treated like mom-and-pop companies in terms of credit. When in reality Casper is outspending other companies by five times. Trust understands how important marketing dollars are and gives them terms that are financially better.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Impossible sent me a tube of its plant-based sausage to try ahead of today’s news. As an aside, the big box with several frozen packs inside was maybe not the most efficient way to send it, but I don’t know, maybe there’s no great way to send frozen foodstuffs. Someone feel free to disrupt that industry at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p>That said, I’ve got no complaints about the contents. I’ve tossed the sausage (Notsage? Fauxsage?) into a couple of pasta dishes and am currently defrosting what’s left for dinner tonight. As someone who hasn’t eaten pork or beef for probably a decade and a half, I’m probably not the best judge of how close they’ve come to the actual thing, but I dunno, it tasted pretty much what I remember sausage tasting like.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188358" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188358" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188358" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188358" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Impossible</p></div></p>
<p>The product is Impossible’s follow-up to its popular Burger, introduced earlier at a number of diners across the U.S. It’s also gone on sale at around 200 coffee shops around Hong Kong. Today, the company is announcing retail availability for the product, as it arrives in a number of major supermarket chains. The list includes, Kroger, Ralphs, King Soopers, Fred Meyer, Safeway, Albertsons, Wegmans, Stop &amp; Shop, Hannaford, Giant Martin’s, Giant Food, Sprouts Farmers Market and Heinen’s.</p>
<p>The product is entirely plant-based and contains no cholesterol or trans fats, with nine grams of fat, including four grams of saturated fat per a 56 gram serving. That also includes seven grams of protein and zero grams of pigs. Impossible lists the number of pigs killed for food each year in the U.S., but I’ll save you that and just say…it’s a lot of pigs. Americans eat a lot of pigs.</p>

<p>The product also uses 79% less water, 41% less land and emits significantly less greenhouse gas than pork production. I can also attest to the fact that it cooks quite well in a skillet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[The company provides software, services and infrastructure to small businesses so they can scale online.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cart.com/">Cart.com</a>, a Houston-based company providing end-to-end e-commerce services, brought in its third funding round this year, this time a $98 million Series B round to bring its total funding to $143 million.</p>
<p>Oak HC/FT led the new round of funding and was joined by PayPal Ventures, Clearco, G9 Ventures, Mercury Fund, Valedor Partners and Arsenal Growth. Strategic investors in the Series B include HeyDay CEO Sebastian Rymarz and Casper CEO Philip Krim. This new round follows a <a href="https://houston.innovationmap.com/2021-q2-houston-startup-funding-2653704803.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1">$25 million Series A round</a>, led by Mercury and Arsenal in July, and a $20 million seed round from Bearing Ventures.</p>
<p>Cart.com CEO Omair Tariq, who was previously an executive at Home Depot and COO of Blinds.com, co-founded the company in September 2020 with Jim Jacobson, former CEO of RTIC Outdoors.</p>
<p>Tariq told TechCrunch that the company provides software, services and infrastructure to businesses so they can scale online. Cart.com is taking the best parts of selling direct-to-consumer on marketplaces like Amazon and Shopify to create value for brands. Tariq said he is pioneering the term “e-commerce-as-a-service” to bring together under one platform a suite of business tools like storefront software, marketing, fulfillment, payments and customer service.</p>
<p>“We see the power of having an interconnected platform,” Tariq said. “There also needs to be a hybrid between selling direct-to-consumer and on Amazon and Shopify for companies that don’t have the money to pay for a percentage of their sales and receive no access to customers or data, and needing 20 different plug-ins that are not connected.”</p>
<p>Cart.com went after the new funding after seeing validation of its idea: brands coming to them wanting more products and services, which led to acquisitions. The company has acquired seven companies so far, including — AmeriCommerce, Spacecraft Brands and, more recently, DuMont Project and Sauceda Industries. Tariq is planning for another three or four by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In addition, it received inbound interest from strategic investors, like Oak and PayPal, which Tariq said was going to enable the company “to be more successful faster.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Allen Miller, principal at Oak HC/FT, said after spending time with Tariq to understand his vision about Cart.com’s software, payments and services, he felt that the company was doing something that didn’t exist in today’s commerce infrastructure.</p>
<p>He said that Cart.com is well positioned to help companies, like those with $1 million in sales, stay focused on growing the business while Cart.com stitches together all of the tools for them to operate in the background.</p>
<p>“It’s a unique offering to merchants that has a high value proposition,” Miller said. “The vision and drive that Omair and Jim have, along with an inspiring mission they want to achieve — to be brand-centric and help the next generation of merchants. These guys also have a good playbook on finding companies and teams to acquire, as well as handling the post M&amp;A to have everyone on one platform.”</p>
<p>The new financing will enable Cart.com to further invest in technology development and to increase headcount by at least 15 times, with plans to go from fewer than two dozen employees to more than 300 team members by the end of the year. The company has nearly 70 jobs posted on its website for positions in engineering, technology, digital marketing and e-commerce. Tariq also expects half of the funds to go toward more acquisitions.</p>
<p>Cart.com currently serves over 2,000 e-commerce brands, including GNC, Haymaker Coffee and KeHE, and processes more than $700 million in gross merchandise value per year. The company saw revenue increase 400% since the platform’s launch in November.</p>
<p>In addition, the company has nine fulfillment centers across the country, and is increasing its access to reach 80% of the U.S. population with two-day shipping, Tariq added.</p>
<p>“We are giving the power back to brands by giving them what they need to operate e-commerce,” he said. “There are still a few pieces to fill in so brands have a unified experience, but with us, they can add fulfilment, marketing or customer conversion tools with the click of a couple of buttons.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's remote hiring technology enable restaurants to fill last-minute drive-thru or cashier shifts.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Will Clem knows all too well about restaurant workers not showing up for a shift. At least one person would have car trouble or need to stay home with sick children, and it became a common occurrence on the weekends for the co-founder of Memphis Meats and owner of Baby Jacks BBQ in Memphis.</p>
<p>Needing to fill a shift one Friday night, Clem decided to prop his laptop in the drive-thru lane of one of his restaurants and took orders from home by remoting into the system. No one noticed that he wasn’t actually taking orders from the kitchen itself. Thus came the idea for <a href="https://www.biteninja.com/">Bite Ninja</a>, a remote hiring technology platform for restaurants.</p>
<p>Clem connected with Orin Wilson to start the company in 2020 and worked for a year on the technology before launching it in March. Today, the company announced $675,000 in pre-seed funding led by Y Combinator, AgFunder and Manta Ray.</p>
<p>With many restaurants unable to find workers as a result of the global pandemic, Clem and Wilson wanted to build a technology that would enable restaurants to go back to normal operating hours, or even reopen their stores. At the same time, the workers, or “Ninjas” as they are referred to, can work the drive-thru or counter for a lunch or dinner rush shift from home, but appear on-screen to customers via menu boards, Wilson said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188449" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188449" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188449" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png" alt="" width="1000" height="749" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188449" class="wp-caption-text">Bite Ninja drive-thru. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bite Ninja</p></div></p>
<p>“When a restaurant is slammed, you need an army of people to work the rush, but it is not reasonable to ask them to get in their uniform and get in their cars, last-minute, to clock in for just an hour or two,” he added. “They have control of their schedule and can pick the right shift for them. It is so popular that we typically have five to 10 people bidding on each shift.”</p>
<p>Bite Ninja is providing a better experience and reaches potential workers that would not necessarily have an interest in performing fast food work. Many of the 3,000 Ninjas already working with the company are stay-at-home moms and retirees with customer service experience, but who can’t physically come into a store, Clem said. In addition, the company is working with the Nurse-Family Partnership to help women get back into the workforce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company initially ran three pilot programs and has expanded services to curbside and front cashier stations. The funding will enable Bite Ninja to scale initiatives, hire additional software engineers and prepare for a rollout at national food chains.</p>
<p>Since launching earlier this year, Bite Ninja is already being used in a few thousand stores.</p>
<p>Manuel Gonzalez, partner at AgFunder, said restaurants are a big part of entrepreneurship, but the pandemic forced more than <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/26/restaurants-bars-closed-2020-jobs-lost-how-many-have-closed-us-covid-pandemic-stimulus-unemployment/">110,000 of them out of business</a>.</p>
<p>“Bite Ninja’s solution is one that decreases costs to restaurant owners, but increases the income of the worker,” he said. “It also helps entrepreneurs and the community because restaurants are important for economic, cultural, community and social points of view.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most people probably don&#8217;t realize just how much our devices are time driven, whether it&#8217;s your phone, your laptop or a network server. For the most part, time keeping has been an esoteric chore, taken care of by a limited number of hardware manufacturers. While these devices served their purpose, a couple of Facebook engineers decided there had to be a better way. So they built a new more accurate time keeping device that fits on a PCI Express (PCIe) card, and contributed it to the Open Compute Project <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/projects/time-appliances-project-tap-incubation">as an open source project</a>.</p>
<p>At a basic level, says Olag Obleukhov, a production engineer at Facebook, it&#8217;s simply pinging this time-keeping server to make sure each device is reporting the same time. &#8220;Almost every single electronic device today uses NTP &#8212; Network Time Synchronization Protocol &#8212; which you have on your phone, on your watch, on your laptop, everywhere, and they all connect to these NTP servers where they just go and say, &#8216;what time is it&#8217; and the NTP server provides the time,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Before Facebook developed a new way of doing this, there were basically two ways to check the time. If you were a developer, you probably used something like Facebook.com as a time checking mechanism, but a company like Facebook, working at massive scale, needed something that worked even when there wasn&#8217;t an internet connection. Companies running data centers have a hardware device called Stratum One, which is a big box that sits in the data center, and has no other job than acting as the time keeper.</p>
<p>Because these time-keeping boxes were built by a handful of companies over years, they were solid and worked, but it was hard to get new features. What&#8217;s more, companies like Facebook couldn&#8217;t control the boxes because of their proprietary nature. Obleukhov and his colleague research scientist, Ahmad Byagowi began to attack the problem by looking for a way to create these devices by building a PCIe card with off-the-shelf parts that you could stick into any PC with an open slot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188442" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188442" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188442" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?w=680" alt="Facebook time keeping PCI card" width="680" height="506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg 1921w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?resize=300,223 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?resize=768,572 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?resize=680,506 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?resize=1536,1143 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188442" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>They literally drew the first design on an iPad and began to build that vision into a prototype. A time appliance relies on a couple of key components: a GNSS receiver and what&#8217;s called a high stability oscillator. <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/08/11/open-source/time-appliance/">In a blog post describing the project</a>, Obleukhov and Byagowi explained the role of these two parts:</p>
<p>&#8220;It all starts from a GNSS receiver that provides the time of day (ToD) as well as the 1 pulse per second (PPS). When the receiver is backed by a high-stability oscillator (e.g., an atomic clock or an oven-controlled crystal oscillator), it can provide time that is nanosecond-accurate. The time is delivered across the network via an off-the-shelf network card,&#8221; the two engineers wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It all sounds pretty basic when described like this, but it&#8217;s actually quite complex and perhaps that&#8217;s why nobody had ever thought to attack the problem in this way, simply accepting that the current methods of determining time worked fine. But these two Facebook engineers were annoyed by the limitations of these approaches and decided to build something better themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of it came from frustration. We were frustrated with whatever exists in the market, and we needed certain features like security features to maintain different things and monitor what&#8217;s going on. And we had to always ask the vendors [for these new features] and every time a request would take like six months to one year, and [it wouldn&#8217;t be exactly what we wanted] and we had to change things all the time, so that&#8217;s why we had to basically make this from scratch in this way,&#8221; Obleukhov said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;When It Comes To Facebook Scale, You Can Throw Out The Rulebook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/24/when-it-comes-to-facebook-scale-you-can-throw-out-the-rulebook/embed/#?secret=8YVZ0ZhXi7" data-secret="8YVZ0ZhXi7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One thing that made it possible to put a time keeping device on a PCIe card was the advances in miniaturization of the atomic clock/oscillator. So when you combine the timing of their frustration with the current capabilities of the technologies, they realized they could do this themselves if they dedicated themselves to the task.</p>
<p>As the design began coming together, the engineers decided to make it flexible to enable engineers to play off the basic design and drop in whatever components met their needs. Some might need highly sophisticated expensive parts, but others could get away with much cheaper parts, depending on their requirements.</p>
<p>They also decided early on to open source the design process, and to involve the Open Compute Project so that other companies and engineers could contribute to the design. &#8220;It was actually going to be open source from the get-go, and the reason for that is we needed to have community support. I didn&#8217;t want it to be just one in-house project and let&#8217;s say if I lost interest or the businesses lost interest [it could go away]. I wanted this to [keep going] regardless [of what happened],&#8221; Obleukhov said.</p>
<p>Today there are a dozen vendors involved in the project and a number of cards out there including the one designed by these engineers, as well as a commercial offering from <a href="https://www.orolia.com/about-the-atomic-reference-time-card-art-card/">Orilia</a>, but the goal is to continue improving the design, and by making it open source, the community of companies and engineers involved will continue to improve it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">US cybersecurity firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/nortonlifelock/">NortonLifeLock</a> has confirmed it is acquiring British rival <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/avast/">Avast</a> in order to create a global consumer security powerhouse.</p>
<p>The agreement, which comes just weeks after both companies confirmed they were in advanced discussions regarding a possible combination of the two brands, will see Avast stockholders receive cash and shares that value the deal at $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion. That makes this merger the third-largest cybersecurity acquisition of all time, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/">Thoma Bravo‘s $12.3 billion takeover of Proofpoint</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/14/why-broadcom-is-looking-to-aging-enterprise-software-in-a-softening-chip-market/">Broadcom’s $10.7 billion acquisition of Symantec’s enterprise business</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>NortonLifeLock, formed in 2019 as a spin-off from Symantec following the latter, says the deal will create an industry-leading consumer cyber safety business, unlock approximately $280 million of annual gross cost synergies, and dramatically expand its user numbers thanks to Avast&#8217;s 435 million-strong customer base.</p>
<p>“With this combination, we can strengthen our cyber safety platform and make it available to more than 500 million users,” NortonLifeLock CEO Vincent Pilette said in a statement. “This transaction is a huge step forward for consumer cyber safety and will ultimately enable us to achieve our vision to protect and empower people to live their digital lives safely.”</p>
<p>Avast, founded in 1988, focuses on cybersecurity software for consumers and small and medium-sized businesses and describes itself as one of the largest security companies. However, the company has not been without controversy during its near-25-year history; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/avast-shuts-down-marketing-analytics-subsidiary-jumpshot-amid-controversy-over-selling-user-data/">Avast was forced to shut down its marketing technology subsidiary Jumpshot</a> last year after it was found to be peddling web browsing data that could be linked to individual users.</p>
<p>Once NortonLifeLock&#8217;s acquisition of the company is complete, Pilette will remain CEO of the new business, while Avast CEO Ondrej Vlcek will become president and join the board, the companies said.</p>
<p>“Our talented teams will have better opportunities to innovate and develop enhanced solutions and services, with improved capabilities from access to superior data insights,&#8221; Vlcek said. &#8220;Through our well-established brands, greater geographic diversification and access to a larger global user base, the combined businesses will be poised to access the significant growth opportunity that exists worldwide.”</p>
<p>The final name of the merged company has yet to be determined, but NortonLifeLock has confirmed it will be dual headquartered in the Czech Republic and Tempe, Arizona, and will seek to cut its number of employees from 5,000 workers to around 4,000 over the next two years. The combined company will be listed on the Nasdaq, rather than Avast&#8217;s current London Stock Exchange home.</p>
<p>The deal, which has been confirmed just weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/nortonlifelock-acquires-avira-in-360m-all-cash-deal-8-months-after-avira-was-acquired-for-180m/">NortonLifeLock bought free antivirus provider Avira for £360 million</a>, is expected to close in mid-2022.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Students around the country are about to return to school after the summer holiday, and they’re doing so at a time when both coronavirus transmission and the effects of climate change are mounting. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/hopskipdrive-raises-22-million-to-focus-on-school-transportation-70-percent-of-revenue-is-enterprise/">HopSkipDrive</a>, a rideshare platform for kids, had to let go much of its staff amid school lockdowns. Now, the company is betting that demand for its rideshare service will increase as parents send their kids back to school. To help fund that growth and expand into 30 new markets over the next year and a half, HopSkipRide raised $25 million in a Series C.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are also continuing to invest in our route optimization software, which just helps districts get more efficient and greener,” Joanna McFarland, CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch. “By reducing overall fleet size, we play a significant role in the overall acceleration of the electrification of the entire yellow bus network.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McFarland also said HopSkipDrive plans to use the new cash injection, which came from Energy Impact Partners, Keyframe Capital, FirstMark Capital and 1776 Ventures, to invest in electrification initiatives that will spur the company’s goal of helping its CareDrivers transition to electric vehicles affordably via partnerships with OEMs. Currently, hybrid or electric vehicles make up 19% of the startup&#8217;s CareDriver network vehicles, which are owned by gig economy workers similar to Uber or Lyft. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike those rideshare giants, however, HopSkipDrive&#8217;s drivers have over five years of caregiving experience, and as a result, are predominantly women who enjoy flexible work schedules and the ability to contribute to the ridesharing economy without driving sketchy drunk people around at night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HopSkipDrive is among a small handful of emerging startups dedicated to modernizing the public school bus system. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/zum-wins-150m-from-san-francisco-schools-to-modernize-and-electrify-student-transport/">Zūm</a>, another student transportation service, has a similar mission statement with a different path to market. Whereas Zūm takes over the entire transportation system and even has lofty goals of acquiring 10,000 electric buses by 2025, HopSkipDrive focuses more on meeting the transportation needs that don’t neatly fit on a school bus or on a school route. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think prior to Covid, we were really seen as an alternative transportation solution for districts, so helping with individualized transport solutions for students with special needs, for students experiencing homelessness or in foster care, and that’s the core service we offer today,” said McFarland. “But as we’ve seen during Covid, all of these trends have only been accelerated and districts have had to deal with a lot more of that than they ever have in the past, but they’re also suffering from a severe bus driver shortage that is reaching a critical point. So anytime you have less than 12 kids on a school bus, we are a cost effective solution, and we are also a much cleaner solution.”</span></p>
<p>HopSkipDrive&#8217;s more complementary approach has helped the company acquire contracts with over 300 districts in nine states plus Washington, D.C. During the pandemic, the startup signed on about 150 new contracts, and this year has renewed 100% of its existing contracts, many of them with price increases, according to McFarland.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as Delta variant cases continue to rise to record levels, schools are planning to reopen, which means services like HopSkipDrive’s will be essential. McFarland says the company has Covid SafeRide standards, which include policies around sanitization and mask-wearing, as well as anonymous exposure tracing via the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see school closures again like we did in 2020,” said McFarland. “I think the tide has turned where everybody realizes that the cost of keeping kids out of school was far greater than the risk of them attending school in person.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ChargePoint has made its second acquisition since going public in March, purchasing European electric fleet management company ViriCiti for €75 million ($88 million) in cash. The news comes just a few weeks after the EV charging network operator announced the purchase of European charging software company has·to·be.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/chargepoint-to-buy-european-charging-software-startup-for-295m/">the has·to·be buy</a>, this newer deal will beef up ChargePoint’s portfolio of hardware and vehicle management software for electric fleet customers, as well as add another 2,500 networked ports and 3,500 connected vehicles to its growing portfolio. ViriCiti customers include Chicago Transit Authority, San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority, British public transportation company Arriva and Berlin’s main public transport service Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe.</p>

<p>Beyond this customer base, ChargePoint CEO Pasquale Romano told TechCrunch the acquisition of ViriCiti will give the company access to a much larger software feature set for customers beyond ChargePoint’s core offerings of charger management and vehicle charger scheduling, like battery health monitoring, vehicle operations data and greater vehicle telematics capabilities.</p>
<p>“It’s really important for us here to make it easy for fleets to electrify and this [acquisition] is all about making us continually having the most complete offering for fleets,” Romano said.</p>
<p>ChargePoint operates the largest vehicle charging network in North America, with more than 115,000 charging points globally. The company also offers customers access to another 113,000 public charging spots through network roaming agreements. While the company might be best known for this extensive branded network, it also has a cloud subscription platform, as well as a considerable commercial and fleet division. The company went public in March after merging with blank-check company Switchback Energy Acquisition Corporation.</p>

<p>Some of ViriCiti’s services, like battery health monitoring, could be applicable for residential customers, or even simply for fleet customers that let employees take home or use a company vehicle full-time. “If you have vehicles that go home with the driver […] it would stand to reason that what you need to do in the take-home scenario is, your infrastructure needs to look like a logical extension of the infrastructure that you would have in your depots. So we&#8217;re pleasantly surprised at how much commercial and residential relevance there is.”</p>
<p>Crucially, ChargePoint will also be absorbing ViriCiti’s more than 50-person workforce, a whole team of mostly software engineers that will transfer their expertise to the new company. “If you just want to see evidence of where our mindset is, look at how many software engineers [are] in the sum total of those two acquisitions,” Romano said. “It&#8217;s the majority of both of those companies’ staffs are engineers, and they&#8217;re all software in general […] You can see where our focus is in terms of in terms of investment.”</p>
