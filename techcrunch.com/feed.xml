										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> is now valued at $40 billion following a fresh capital injection of $200 million (USD) in a round led by T. Rowe Price. New and existing investors participated in the round, including Franklin Templeton, Sequoia Capital Global Equities, Bessemer Venture Partners, Greenoaks Capital, Dragoneer Investments, Blackbird, Felicis and AirTree Ventures.</p>
<p>This round solidifies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/canva/">Canva</a> as one of the most valuable private software companies out there, and it also propels the Australian tech scene forward.</p>
<p>Cofounder and CEO Melanie Perkins and her team started working on Canva in 2012, and launched the product in 2013. The premise behind it was relatively simple, but the technology itself&#8230; not so much.</p>
<p>Canva allows anyone to design. Presentations, t-shirts, brochures, flyers&#8230; you name it. The first step in this is creating a truly simple user interface, where folks can simply drag and drop components into their designs, complete with hundreds of thousands of templates, without doing a lot of fine tuning. The second step is creating a massive library of content, from fonts to templates to imagery, gifs and videos. The third step is to make that product accessible to everyone, whether it&#8217;s a platform or device or language or price.</p>
<p>Going after everyone, instead of just designers, has proved incredibly fruitful for the company. To be clear, designers still use Canva to layout components they&#8217;ve designed in other products, such as Figma and Sketch, and Canva actually plays nicely with a variety of design software products. But Canva has no intention of going head to head with Figma, Adobe or Sketch.</p>
<p>Perkins described it with the example of a business card. Designers will create the components of a business card in their design platform of choice, and then layout the template for business cards in Canva, sharing that template with the entire organization. That way, when someone gets a title change or a new employee comes on, they can actually edit the card themselves without the help of a designer and send it to print.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Perkins why Canva hasn&#8217;t extended the platform more aggressively into the workflow of professional designers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We would like to replace PDF,&#8221; said Perkins. &#8220;Rather than people sending PDFs backwards and forwards between the designer and the client, designers can just create a template for organization use. It&#8217;s less important for us to absolutely excel at things like vector design because there are amazing programs on the market that may be there. We really want to focus on that collaboration piece.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though a bottoms-up enterprise strategy is relatively popular these days, Canva was an early master of the model. Canva launched as a free product, and over time the company introduced enterprise layers into the mix.</p>
<p>As of now, Canva has more than 60 million monthly active users across 190 countries, with big name companies on the enterprise plan. This includes Salesforce, Marriott International, PayPal and American Airlines. Canva expects to exceed $1 billion in annualized revenue by the end of 2021. More than 500,000 teams are paying for the product in some capacity.</p>
<p>With a 2,000-person team, Canva will use the fresh funding to double its workforce in the next year.</p>
<p>Canva also shared its DEI numbers, with females representing 42 percent of the workforce. The company did not share any stats around people of color on the team.</p>
<p>Perkins explained to TechCrunch that a huge part of the company&#8217;s growth has to do with an obsession over creating a highly valuable free product.</p>
<p>&#8220;We intentionally make our free product extremely generous for a number of reasons,&#8221; said Perkins. &#8220;It&#8217;s critical both for our marketing and towards our mission of empowering people to design. But, as part of our marketing, it means that people are able to love the product, share it with their friends and family, and promote it on social media. And then that virality really rapidly fuels our growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside growing the team, Canva also has plans to further build out the product in the next year, launching website design soon. This will allow users to turn existing and new presentations and designs into a website, and even search for and buy a domain for that site.</p>
<p>Canva is also working on a new video editor and an offline mode.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Canva CEO Melanie Perkins will tell us about the journey to a $15B valuation at Disrupt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/canva-ceo-melanie-perkins-will-tell-us-about-the-journey-to-a-15b-valuation-at-disrupt/embed/#?secret=ulDy54yxGQ" data-secret="ulDy54yxGQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Perkins says that Canva has two goals, and that each fuels the other. The first is to become one of the world&#8217;s most valuable companies, and the other is to do the most good that it can do.</p>
<p>The company has already joined the 1 percent pledge and has several efforts around being a force for good, including giving the premium product to more than 130,000 non-profits, allocating more than 45,000 volunteering hours each year, and launching Print One, Plant One, which is a project that plants a tree for every single print order placed through Canva.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s funding announcement, cofounders Perkins and Cliff Obrecht are committing the vast majority of their own equity in the company (around 30 percent) to doing good in the world, with plans to do this through the Canva Foundation.</p>
<p>Perkins will be joining us at Disrupt to talk about the new funding, valuation, what&#8217;s in store for Canva, and share her broader thoughts on design as a category.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The TechCrunch crew is hard at work writing up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-fall-event-2021/">the latest</a> from Apple&#8217;s iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch event. They have good notes on the megacorp&#8217;s hardware updates. But what are the markets saying about the same array of products?</p>
<p>For those of us more concerned with effective S&amp;P dividend yields than screen nit levels, events like Apple&#8217;s confab are more interesting for what they might mean for the value of the hosting company than how many GPUs a particular smartphone model has. And, for once, Apple&#8217;s stock may have done something a little interesting during the event!</p>
<p>Observe the following chart:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2202582" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="439" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png?resize=1536,991 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>This is a one-day chart, mind, so we&#8217;re looking at intraday changes. We&#8217;re zoomed in. And Apple kinda took a bit of a dive during its event that kicked off at 1 p.m. in the above chart.</p>
<p>Normally <em>nothing</em> of import happens to Apple&#8217;s shares during its presentations. Which feels weird, frankly, as Apple events detail the product mix that will generate hundreds of billions in revenue. You&#8217;d think that they would have more impact than their usual zero.</p>
<p>But today, we had real share price movement when the event wrapped around 2 p.m. ET. Perhaps investors were hoping for more pricey devices? Or were hoping Apple had more up its sleeve? How you rate that holiday Apple product lineup is a matter of personal preference, but investors appear to have weighed in slightly to the negative.</p>
<p>Worth around $2.5 trillion, each 1% that Apple&#8217;s stock moves is worth $10 billion. Apple&#8217;s loss of 1.5% today &#8212; more or less; trading continues as I write this &#8212; is worth more than Mailchimp. It&#8217;s a lot of money.</p>
<p>You can read the rest of our coverage from the Apple event <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-fall-event-2021/">here. </a>Enjoy!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Biden made his latest nomination to the Federal Trade Commission this week, tapping digital privacy expert Alvaro Bedoya to join the agency as it takes a hard look at the tech industry.</p>
<p>Bedoya is the founding director of the <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/privacy-technology-center/">Center on Privacy &amp; Technology</a> at Georgetown&#8217;s law school and previously served as chief counsel for former Senator Al Franken and the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law. Bedoya has worked on legislation addressing some of the most pressing privacy issues in tech, including stalkerware and facial recognition systems.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It is the honor of my life to be nominated to serve on the FTC. When my family landed at JFK in 1987 with 4 suitcases and a grad student stipend, this was not what we expected. Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JoeBiden</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/linakhanFTC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@linakhanFTC</a>, thank you Sima, my love, mom, dad, Pablo, our families. Vamos.</p>
<p>&mdash; Alvaro Bedoya (@alvarombedoya) <a href="https://twitter.com/alvarombedoya/status/1437509709251190797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In 2016, Bedoya co-authored a report titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.perpetuallineup.org/">The Perpetual Line-Up: Unregulated Police Face Recognition in America</a>,&#8221; a year-long investigation that dove deeply into the police use of facial recognition systems in the U.S. The 2016 report examined law enforcement&#8217;s reliance on facial recognition systems and biometric databases on a state level. It argued that regulations are desperately needed to curtail potential abuses and algorithmic failures before the technology inevitably becomes even more commonplace.</p>
<p>Bedoya also isn&#8217;t shy about calling out Big Tech. In a<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/opinion/silicon-valley-lobbyists-privacy.html"> New York Times op-ed a few years ago</a>, he took aim at Silicon Valley companies giving user privacy lip service in public while quietly funneling millions toward lobbyists to undermine consumer privacy. The new FTC nominee singled out Facebook specifically, pointing to the company&#8217;s efforts to undermine the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, a state law that serves as one of the only meaningful checks on invasive privacy practices in the U.S.</p>
<p>Bedoya argued that the tech industry would have an easier time shaping a single, sweeping piece of privacy regulations with its lobbying efforts rather than a flurry of targeted, smaller bills. Antitrust advocates in Congress taking aim at tech today seem<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/09/house-democrats-announce-tech-bills-492703"> to have learned that same lesson as well</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We cannot underestimate the tech sector’s power in Congress and in state legislatures,&#8221; Bedoya wrote. &#8220;If the United States tries to pass broad rules for personal data, that effort may well be co-opted by Silicon Valley, and we’ll miss our best shot at meaningful privacy protections.&#8221;</p>
<p>If confirmed, Bedoya would join <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">big tech critic Lina Khan</a>, a recent Biden FTC nominee who now chairs the agency. Khan&#8217;s focus on antitrust and Amazon in particular would dovetail with Bedoya&#8217;s focus on adjacent privacy concerns, making the pair a formidable regulatory presence as the Biden administration seeks to rein in some of the tech industry&#8217;s most damaging excesses.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s September, which generally means two things: We&#8217;re blasting Earth, Wind, and Fire on repeat, and Apple will announce a new iPhone (or four).</p>
<p>Right on schedule, Apple held a remote event this morning, streaming kinda-sorta-live from its Cupertino campus. Whether you didn&#8217;t have time to watch the entire hour-long stream or just want the highlights, we&#8217;ve got you — as usual, we&#8217;ve boiled the whole thing down to the bullet points.</p>
<h2>New iPads</h2>
<p>Both the standard iPad and the iPad mini have gotten the update treatment — here&#8217;s whats new for each:</p>

<p>Apple kicked off the Watch segment with a few new features coming to iOS 8 (like fall detection for cyclists and better algorithms for detecting calories burned when you&#8217;re on an e-bike) before announcing a new Watch — Series 7, they&#8217;re calling it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-watch-series-7-arrives-with-a-larger-more-rugged-display/">Apple Watch Series 7</a>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By reducing the screen&#8217;s borders, they were able to squeeze in a display that is 20% bigger.</li>
<li>To take advantage of that bigger screen, buttons are bigger across the UI.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s got a swipe-style prediction keyboard, for easier text input on the go.</li>
<li>Apple says it&#8217;s got the strongest (most crack-resistant) display to dat, and is the first Apple Watch to be IP6X certified against dust.</li>
<li>An &#8220;updated charging architecture&#8221; and a new USB-C charger allow it to charge 33% faster.</li>
<li>Series 7 will start at $399 and start shipping &#8220;later this fall.&#8221;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shortly after today’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-fall-event-2021">virtual conference</a>, Apple announced that the next major version of iOS will be ready for prime time very soon. iPhone users will be able to update to iOS 15 on September 20. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-ios-15-with-new-features-for-facetime-and-better-notifications/">first unveiled</a> iOS 15 earlier this year at its Worldwide Developer Conference.</p>
<p>The biggest change of iOS 15 is a new Focus mode. In addition to “Do not disturb,” you can configure various modes — you can choose apps and people you want notifications from and change your focus depending on what you’re doing. For instance, you can create a Work mode, a Sleep mode, a Workout mode, etc.</p>
<p>There are many new features across the board, such as a new Weather app, updated maps in Apple Maps, an improved version of FaceTime, and more. Safari also has a brand-new look. At first, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/apple-tweaks-controversial-ios-15-safari-changes-in-latest-beta/">a bit controversial</a>. Since then, Apple has listened to feedback and improved its new take on Safari.</p>
<p>The new version of iOS also scans your photos for text. Called Live Text, this feature lets you highlight, copy and paste text in photos. It could be a nice accessibility feature as well. iOS is going to leverage that info for Spotlight. You can search for text in your photos directly in Spotlight and it&#8217;ll pull out relevant photos. These features are handled on-device directly.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to update to iOS 15 if you have an iPhone 6s and later, any model of iPhone SE or the most recent iPod touch model. It’ll be available as a free download.</p>
<p>For users running the iOS 15 beta, the release candidate is rolling out now, ahead of Monday&#8217;s public launch.</p>
<p>If you like your iPhone the way it is, Apple has also said that you don’t have to update to iOS 15. For the foreseeable future, the company will still update iOS 14 with security patches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has announced its new lineup of phones at its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-fall-event-2021">virtual conference</a>. In addition to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/this-is-the-iphone-13/" title="This is the iPhone 13">regular iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini</a>, the company has two Pro models with some premium features that you won’t find in the regular iPhone 13.</p>
<p>Of course, the Pro models are also more expensive. For reference, the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $699 and the iPhone 13 starts at $799. As for the Pro models, the iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at $1,099. The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1-inch display while the iPhone 13 Pro Max has a 6.7-inch display.</p>
<p>“Our Pro lineup pushes the limits with our most advanced technologies for users who want the very best iPhone,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said.</p>
<p>Here’s what you’ll get if you decide to buy the iPhone 13 Pro instead of the iPhone 13. The design is slightly different as the Pro models get shiny stainless steel bands around the case of the phone. There are also three stainless steel rings around the three camera sensors. The back of the device is made of matte glass.</p>
<p>There are three different camera sensors at the back of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max instead of two. In addition to the ultra wide and wide camera, you get a 3x camera. It seems like the wide and ultra wide cameras aren’t identical in the Pro models vs. the regular models either.</p>
<p>Last year, only the iPhone 12 Pro Max featured sensor shift optical image stabilization. This time, the entire iPhone 13 lineup gets sensor shift optical image stabilization. Basically, the regular iPhone 13 is getting many of the advanced camera features that was restricted to Pro models.</p>
<p>In particular, there’s a new cinematic mode with rack focus. You can track a subject and lock focus on that subject in real time. Cinematic mode shoots in Dolby Vision HDR. Later this year, you&#8217;ll be able to shoot ProRes videos with the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So here’s what you get in the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro Max:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 77mm telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom.</li>
<li>An ultra wide camera with ƒ/1.8 aperture and &#8220;up to 92% improvement in low-light performance,&#8221; according to Apple.</li>
<li>A wide camera with ƒ/1.5 aperture and &#8220;up to 2.2x improvement in low-light performance,&#8221; according to Apple.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first time, you can use Night mode with all three cameras. This way, you don’t have to remember which camera will give you the best result.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2202548" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max comes with a Pro Motion display with P3 color range. Like on high-end iPad models, these iPhone models have an adaptative framerate. If you need it, your iPhone display can run at 120Hz. If you’re watching a movie, the iPhone can use a lower framerate to save battery life.</p>
<p>As the iPhone 13 Max is the largest smartphone in the lineup, you get more battery life. Apple promises a battery that lasts 2.5 hours longer for the iPhone 13 Pro Max compared to the iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p>
<p>Like the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini, the Pro models come with Apple’s A15 Bionic chip. It’s a 5-mm design with 15 billion transistors. There are two high-performance cores and four energy-efficient cores. You should get nearly the same performances across the lineup, but there&#8217;s a new 5-core GPU in the Pro lineup.</p>
<p>Pre-orders start on Friday and they will be available on September 24. There are four different models with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alongside the introduction of the new iPhone 13, Apple introduced a few new accessories to complement its upgraded flagship devices. One of the more interesting additions in the accessories in the lineup is a new MagSafe wallet that works with Apple &#8220;Find My&#8221; service. That means if you accidentally lose your wallet when it becomes unattached from your iPhone, you can launch the Find My app to locate it as you can with other Apple devices or items attached to your Apple AirTags.</p>
<p>In this case, the MagSafe leather wallet will notify users of the last known location where the wallet was separated from the phone. It will not, however, provide real-time tracking.</p>
<p>This is a small, but clever addition for those who use Apple&#8217;s MagSafe products. The technology<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/apple-launches-new-ecosystem-of-accessories-and-wireless-chargers-with-magsafe/"> was first introduced last fall</a> to allow iPhone users to attach all sorts of products to the back of their iPhone, like cases, wallets, tripods and car mounts, as well as Apple&#8217;s own accessories for charging, like the MagSafe battery pack &#8212; which is coming to iPhone 13. MagSafe works by layering on a magnetometer, a copper-graphite shield, two shields, multiple layers of magnets, an NFC antenna, and more on the back of the iPhone, to make the accessories attach.</p>
<p>But it had not yet combined the power of MagSafe with the capabilities of &#8220;Find My&#8221; until now.</p>

<p>Along with the launch of the &#8220;Find My&#8221;-connected wallet, aka the iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe, the company is also introducing a range of new cases and colors for iPhone, designed to work with MagSafe. This includes MagSafe cases in leather and silicone, as well as a clear case with MagSafe. All are available to order today.</p>

<p>Currently, the $9.99/month service is available in six countries, like the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. But at its press event today, Apple announced that the service will become available in many more countries this fall, including Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, France, Italy, Russia and more. Content will be subtitled in six languages.</p>

<p>Apple also announced that it will add new pilates and guided meditation content for Fitness+ subscribers starting in the fall. Every day, Fitness+ will add guided meditations that focus on gratitude, mindfulness, and calming. These experiences will be available in both video and audio form, and could pose competition to apps like Headspace and Calm.</p>
<p>Also in the fall, Fitness+ will roll out Group Workouts, powered by Share Play. This enables subscribers to exercise alongside their friends via FaceTime or a group message thread, no matter where they are in the world. Up to 32 people can exercise together at once.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Are founders in fundraising mode short-sighted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/is-it-so-bad-to-take-money-from-chinese-venture-funds/">when it comes to working with Chinese venture funds</a>?</p>
<p>Runa Capital&#8217;s Asia business development manager Denis Kalinin studied data from iTjuzi, a database of Chinese venture capitalists, and found:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;Chinese funds invested around $250 billion in 2020 (three times higher than the figure reported in Crunchbase). This figure puts Chinese VC investments only 30% lower than investments by U.S. funds, but three times that of U.K. funds and 12.5 times more than German funds.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The pandemic, geopolitical tensions and other factors led many Chinese venture funds to pare back their international investments, but that&#8217;s largely &#8220;because during COVID, China’s economy recovered much faster than other countries’,&#8221; writes Kalinin.</p>
<p>His analysis covers multiple angles: Chinese investments in Europe are catching up with those in Asia and the United States, half of China&#8217;s top cross-border investors are CVCs, and investors are particularly interested in fintech, deep tech and digital health at the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese investors can bring value to foreign startups, but you need to study their expertise and how it can be useful for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toast released an early IPO price range of $30 to $33 per share on Monday, and Alex Wilhelm digs into the S-1/A filing to “better understand how to value vertical SaaS startups that are pursuing a payments-and-SaaS business approach.”</p>
<p>Is the restaurant software startup worth the $18 billion valuation it’s aiming for?</p>

<p>Every founder who launches an enterprise software startup has to figure out the &#8220;right&#8221; pricing model for their products.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a consequential decision: Per-seat licenses are easy to manage, but what if customers prefer a concurrent licensing model?</p>
<p>&#8220;Early pricing discussions should center around the buyer’s perspective and the value the product creates for them,&#8221; says Ridge Ventures partner Yousuf Khan, who previously worked as a CIO.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he notes, &#8220;self-evaluation is hard, especially when you’re asking someone else to pay you for something you’ve created.&#8221;</p>

<p>India&#8217;s mom-and-pop businesses are experiencing a digital transformation that&#8217;s creating new e-commerce opportunities; smartphones have replaced paper records, and a new government-backed instant payments system is disrupting how value is exchanged.</p>
<p>But instead of importing legacy credit systems, buy now, pay later systems are the &#8220;next step for solving the digital B2B puzzle,&#8221; writes Anubhav Jain, co-founder and CEO of Rupifi.</p>

<p>Freshworks, which develops and offers a variety of business software tools, set an IPO price range of $28 to $32 per share on Monday, meaning its valuation could reach nearly $10 billion, Alex Wilhelm writes.</p>
<p>“It appears that the Freshworks IPO is pretty reasonably priced as is, though a boost to its price range is not out of the question if public market investors decide that they are bullish on its future growth prospects. We just don’t see dramatic upside.”</p>

<p>The multibillion-dollar exits of Japanese startup Paidy (to PayPal) and Australian buy now, pay later company Afterpay (to Square) “provided hard market proof that what BNPL startups are building has value beyond simple operating results,” Alex Wilhelm writes in The Exchange.</p>
<p>He breaks down the value of Afterpay, Paidy and Klarna using a simple metric: What would you pay for $1 of BNPL GMV?</p>

<p>Video game livestreaming is booming.</p>
<p>Twitch has an average of almost 3 million concurrent viewers; by comparison, on the night of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, CNN&#8217;s livestream averaged 1.1 million.</p>
<p>The most successful streamers use their ad revenue and sponsorship money to hire video editors and social media teams to make them look good, but new automated tools are giving part-time streamers the ability to spotlight their best moments as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rumors were right. The centerpiece of today&#8217;s big Apple event is the latest iPhone. The latest device lands less than a year after its predecessor, now that things have settled down somewhat on the supply chain side for Apple. Last year&#8217;s iPhone 12 was a massive seller, bucking the trend of stagnating smartphones sales, in part due to a bottleneck in sales from the unplanned delay, but also because it finally brought 5G connectivity to Apple&#8217;s mobile line.</p>

<p>Lucky number iPhone 13 (no skipping for superstition&#8217;s sake, mind) features a familiar design. The front notch has finally been shrunken down &#8212; now 20% smaller than its predecessor, while the rear-facing camera system has also gotten a redesign. The screen is now 28% brighter Super Retina XDR display on both the iPhone 13 and 13 mini at 1200 nits.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2202470" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The 13 sports a 6.1-inch screen, while the mini&#8217;s is 5.4 inches &#8212; same as last year. The display is protected by a ceramic shield coating, and the handset rates IP68 dust/waterproofing.</p>
<p>The phone is powered by Apple’s new A15 Bionic chip, built with a 5nm processor. The CPU is 6-core that the company is calling “the fastest CPU on any smartphone.” The new 4-core GPU, meanwhile, brings advanced graphics to the handset.</p>

<p>The rear dual-camera system features a 12MP wide angle camera that’s capable of pulling in up to 47% more light. The new Cinematic Mode, meanwhile, brings rack focus-style shooting capable of adjusting the focus on subjects, using machine learning (you can also tap to adjust manual or switch between subjects). All models in the iPhone 13 also support Night Mode shooting, as well as the ProRes codec for a more pro-level of video.</p>

<p>Following last year&#8217;s introduction of 5G, the company has added more advanced antennae. Through the combination of a larger battery and energy saving software, the company says it&#8217;s been able to eke out an additional 2.5 hours of life on the 13 and 1.5 hours on the mini.</p>

<p>iPhone 13 mini starts at $699 and, while the 13 starts at $799. It comes in b<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">lack, gold, silver and a new, lighter blue. Storage options start at</span>128GB.</p>

<p>Not a massive update all told &#8212; Apple seemingly save a lot of that for the iPhone 13 Pro, which brings a 120Hz display (a feature that was rumored across the line) and a number of key updates to the imaging system. The Pro and Pro Max feature similar battery upgrades as the 13. The devices go up for pre-order on September 17 and will be available at retail on September 24.</p>
<p>The company is also launching a number of accessories, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apples-new-magsafe-wallet-can-be-located-with-the-find-my-app-if-it-goes-missing/">a new MagSafe Wallet</a> that works with the Find My feature.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A U.S. federal judge last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">struck down</a> Apple rules restricting app developers from selling directly to customers outside the App Store.</p>
<p>Apple’s stock <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/apple-erases-nearly-85-billion-in-value-after-app-store-ruling">fell 3%</a> on the news, which is being regarded as a win for small and midsize app developers because they’ll be able to build direct billing relationships with their customers. But Apple is just one of many Big Tech companies that dominate their sector.</p>
<p>The larger issue is how this development will impact Amazon, Facebook, Grubhub and other tech giants with online marketplaces that use draconian terms of service to keep their resellers subservient. The skirmish between Apple and small and midsize app developers is just a smaller battle in a much larger war.</p>
<p>App makers pay up to 30% on every sale they make on the Apple App Store. Resellers on Amazon pay a monthly subscription fee, a sales commission of 8% to 15%, fulfillment fees and other miscellaneous charges. Grubhub charges restaurants 15% of every order, a credit card processing fee, an order processing fee and a 10% delivery commission.</p>
<p>Like app developers, online resellers and social media influencers are all falling for the same big lie: that they can build a sustainable business with healthy margins on someone else’s platform. The reality is the App Store, online marketplaces and even social networks that dominate their sectors have the unilateral power to selectively deplatform and squeeze their users, and there’s not much anyone can do about it.</p>
<p>Healthy competition exists inside the App Store and among marketplace resellers and aspiring social media influencers. But no one seems to be talking about the real elephants in the room, which are the social networks and online marketplace providers themselves. In some respects, they’ve become almost like digital dictators with complete control over their territories.</p>
<p>It’s something every small and midsize business that gets excited about some new online service catering to their industry should be aware of because it directly impacts their ability to grow a stable business. The federal judge’s decision suggests the real goal in digital business is a direct billing relationship with the end user.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the internet, those who are able to lead a horse to water and make them drink — outside the walled gardens of digital marketplace operators like Uber, Airbnb and Udemy — are the true contenders. In content and e-commerce, this is what most small and midsize companies don’t realize. Your own website or <em>owned medi</em>a, at a top-level domain that you control, is the only unfettered way to sell direct to end users.</p>
<p>Mobile app makers on Apple’s App Store, resellers on Amazon and aspiring content creators on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok are all subject to the absolute control of digital titans who are free to govern by their own rules with unchecked power.</p>
<p>For access to online marketplaces and social networks, we got a raw deal. We’re basically plowing their fields like digital sharecroppers. Resellers on Amazon are forced to split their harvest with a landlord who takes a gross percentage with no caps. Amassing followers on TikTok is building an audience that’s locked inside their venue.</p>
<p>These tech giants — all former startups that built their audiences from scratch — are free to impose and selectively enforce oppressive rules. If you’re a small fry, they can prohibit you from asking for your customer’s email address and deplatform you for skimming, but look the other way when Spotify and The New York Times do the same thing. Both were already selling direct and through the App Store prior to Friday’s ruling.</p>
<p>How is that competitive? Even after the ruling, Big Tech still gets to decide who they let violate their terms of service and who they deplatform. It’s not just their audience. It’s their universe, their governance, their rules and their enforcement.</p>
<p>In the 1948 court case United States v. Paramount Pictures, the Supreme Court ruled that film studios couldn’t own their own theaters because that meant they could exclusively control what movies were screened. They stifled competition by controlling what films made it to the marquee, so SCOTUS broke them up.</p>
<p>Today, social networks control what gets seen on their platforms, and with the push of a button, they can give the hook to whoever they want, whenever they want. The big challenge that the internet poses to capitalism is that the network effect is fundamentally anti-competitive. Winner-take-all markets dominated by tech giants look more like government-controlled than free-market economies.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the web gives us access to a global marketplace of buyers and sellers. On the other, a few major providers control the services that most people use to do business, because they don’t have the knowledge or resources to stand up a competitive website. But unless you have your own domain and good search visibility, you’re always in danger of being deplatformed and losing access to your customers or audience members with no practical recourse.</p>
<p>The network effect is such that once an online marketplace becomes dominant, it neutralizes the competitive market, because everyone gravitates to the dominant service to get the best deal. There’s an inherent conflict between the goals of a winner-takes-all tech company and the goals of a free market.</p>
<p>Dominant online marketplaces are only competitive for users. Meanwhile, marketplace providers operate with impunity. If they decide they want to use half-baked AI or offshore contractors to police their terms of service and shore up false positives, there’s no practical way for users to contest. How can Facebook possibly govern nearly 3 billion users judiciously with around 60,000 employees? As we’ve seen, it can’t.</p>
<p>For app makers, online resellers and creators, the only smart option is open source on the open web. Instead of relying on someone else’s audience (or software for that matter), you own your online destination powered by software like WordPress or Discord, and you never have to worry about getting squeezed when the founders go public or their platform gets bought by profit-hungry investment bankers. Only then can you protect your profit margins. And only then are the terms of service the laws of the land.</p>
<p>Politics aside, as former President Donald Trump’s deplatforming demonstrated, if you get kicked off Facebook and Twitter, there’s really nowhere else to go. If they want you out, it’s game over. It’s no coincidence Trump lost his Facebook and Twitter accounts on the same day the Republicans lost the Senate. If the GOP takes back the Senate, watch Trump get his social media accounts back. Social networks ward off regulators by appeasing the legislative majority.</p>
<p>So don’t get too excited about the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/info">Amazon Influencer Program</a>. If you want to build a sustainable digital business, you need an owned media presence powered by software that doesn’t rake commissions, have access to your customer contact information and has an audience that can’t be commandeered with an algorithm tweak.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Watch users who ride bikes will get a handful of new features designed just for them. Announced during today&#8217;s Apple iPhone press event, the company says that Apple Watch will now begin to detect when users begin a bike ride to remind you to start a workout. And similar to other workouts, Apple Watch will also automatically pause and resume as you take breaks during your ride. And, perhaps most importantly, it will gain a new fall detection feature, as well.</p>
<p>While Apple Watch can <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208944">already detect a fall on Series 4  or later devices</a>, allowing users to contact emergency services if needed, Apple says that it will now add fall detection to cycling. In this case, it&#8217;s able to sense the unique motion and impact that occurs when someone falls when riding a bike &#8212; which is a different type of movement than someone who falls when standing.</p>

<p>For indoor cyclists such as Peleton enthusiasts, Apple Watch will also now better support e-bikes with an improved workout algorithm that more accurately calculates calories burned.</p>
<p>These features will join others Apple has added, like the reimagined Breathe app, new watch faces, and updates to Messages and Photos that roll out with watchOS 8. Apple additionally announced a new Watch product, as well, with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-watch-series-7-arrives-with-a-larger-more-rugged-display/">Apple Watch Series 7,</a> offering a larger Retina display, interface redesigns, new watch faces and colors, better charging, and more.</p>
<p>Related to workouts, Apple also announced an update to its subscription service, Fitness+, which will be available in 15 new countries in addition to the original six, and which is adding Pilates workouts, guided meditations, and workouts designed for skiers and snowboarders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK competition regulators are spooking tech investors in the country with an implied threat to clamp down on startup M&amp;A, according to a new survey of the industry.</p>
<p>As the UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer engaged with the tech industry at a ‘Chatham House’ style event today, the Coalition for a Digital Economy (<a href="http://Coadec.com">Coadec</a>) think-tank released a survey of over 50 key investors which found startup investors are prepared to pull capital over the prospect of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/competition-and-markets-authority">Competition and Markets Authority’s</a> (CMA) new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-markets-unit">Digital Markets Unit</a> (DMU) becoming a “whole-economy regulator by accident”. Investors are concerned after the CMA recommended the DMU be given &#8216;expanded powers&#8217; regarding its investigations of M&amp;A deals.</p>
<p>Controversy has been stirring up around the DMU, as the prospect of it blocking tech startup acquisitions &#8211; especially by US firms, sometimes on the grounds of national security &#8211; has gradually risen.</p>
<p>In the Coadec survey, half of investors said they would significantly reduce the amount they invested in UK startups if the ability to exit was restricted, and a further 22.5% said they would stop investing in UK startups completely under a stricter regulatory environment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 60% of investors surveyed said they felt UK regulators only had a “basic understanding” of the startup market, and 22.2% felt regulators didn’t understand the tech startup market at all.</p>
<p>Coadec said its conservative estimates showed that the UK Government’s DMU proposals could create a £2.2bn drop in venture capital going into the UK, potentially reducing UK economic growth by £770m.</p>
<p>Commenting on the report, Dom Hallas, Executive Director of Coadec, said: “Startups thrive in competitive markets. But nurturing an ecosystem means knowing where to intervene and when not to. The data shows that not only is there a risk that the current proposals could miss some bad behavior in some areas like B2B markets whilst creating unnecessary barriers in others like M&amp;A. Just as crucially, there’s frankly not a lot of faith in the regulators proposing them either.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The survey results emerged just as Chancellor Rishi Sunak convened the “Treasury Connect” conference in London today which brought together some of the CEOs of the UK’s biggest tech firms and VCs in a ‘listening process’ designed to reach out to the industry.</p>
<p>However, at a press conference after the event, Sunak pushed back on the survey results, citing research by Professor Jason Furman, Chair, of the Digital Competition Expert Panel, which has found that “not a single acquisition” had been blocked by the DMU, and there are “no false positives” in decision making to date. Sunak said the “system looks at this in order to get the balance right.”</p>
<p>In addition, a statement from the Treasury, out today, said more than one-fifth of people in the UK’s biggest cities are now employed in the tech sector, which also saw £11.2 billion invested last year, setting a new investment record, it claimed.</p>
<p>Sunak also said the <a href="https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/future-fund/">Future Fund</a>, which backed UK-based tech firms with convertible loans during the pandemic, handed UK taxpayers with stakes in more than 150 high-growth firms.</p>
<p>These include <a href="https://www.vaccitech.co.uk/">Vaccitech PLC</a>, which co-invented the COVID-19 vaccine with the University of Oxford and is better known as the AstraZeneca vaccine which went to 170 countries worldwide. The Future fund also invested in <a href="https://www.century.tech/">Century Tech</a>, an EdTEch startup that uses AI to personalize learning for children.</p>
<p>The UK government’s £375 million ‘<a href="https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/future-fund-breakthrough/">Future Fund: Breakthrough</a>’ initiative continued from July this year, aiming at high-growth, R&amp;D-intensive companies.</p>
<p>Coadec’s survey also found 70% of investors felt UK regulators “only thought about large incumbent firms” when designing competition rules, rather than startups or future innovation.</p>
<p>However, the survey found London was still rated as highly as California as an attractive destination for startups and investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Big day for hardware over at Apple HQ. In addition to all of a pair of new iPads, the company just launched the latest version of the wearable-dominated Apple Watch. As anticipated, the Apple Watch Series 7 marks one of the biggest design changes in the smartwatch&#8217;s six year history. The new Watch sports a re-engineered display that&#8217;s 20% larger than the Series 6, while &#8220;barely effecting&#8221; the watch&#8217;s size, courtesy of smaller bezels.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2202438" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The corners are rounded and the display is significantly brighter than the last version. The new screen is able to fit 50% more text than the previous models, and the system features a new text input feature with AI predictions. The glass on the front has been fortified, and the Watch now rates IP6X.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2202411" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-2021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-2021.jpg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-2021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-2021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Contrary to rumors, the battery hasn&#8217;t been improved this time out. It can, however, charge at around  33% faster, so you can get some quick juice in before sleep tracking.</p>

<p>Apple Watch Series 7 is arriving later this fall, starting at $399. The cases come in five different colors. The Series 3 is sticking around, priced at $279, while the SE runs $279. The new watch will ship with WatchOS 8, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-watch-will-now-detect-biking-workouts-falls-from-bike-when-riding/">which now includes bike tracking</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As expected, we&#8217;re going to be seeing a LOT of hardware at today&#8217;s Apple event. The company has already unveiled a refresh to the iPad and here&#8217;s a new version of the Mini that looks to be the small tablet&#8217;s biggest refresh to date. The new iPad Mini sports a design overhaul that closely resembles that of the iPad Pro. That&#8217;s all built around an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, accomplished by significantly shrinking its bezels.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to like about this refresh on top of the aforementioned aesthetic updates. It&#8217;s a long list that really rounds out the product&#8217;s functionality, including 5G, Apple Pencil support and a power button that supports TouchID for unlocking. The product is getting some nice upgrades inside, as well, with a CPU Apple says in 40% faster than its predecessor and a GPU that bumps performance up 80%.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2202406" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png" alt="" width="1024" height="572" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png 3754w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=1536,858 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=2048,1145 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The Mini sports a USB-C port and front and rear-facing 12-megapixel cameras, the former of which supports Apple&#8217;s Center Stage program. The Mini starts at $499 and goes on sale next week. Pricing, naturally, goes up when you add 5G into the mix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is launching a new iPad model. This is the most affordable iPad model in the lineup, it’s cheaper than the iPad Air and iPad Pro. Today&#8217;s new iPad replaces the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/the-eighth-generation-ipad-is-a-fine-choice-for-casual-users/">existing $329 iPad</a> in the lineup.</p>
<p>It features Apple’s A13 chip. Apple originally unveiled the A13 for the iPhone 11. As a reminder, the existing iPad uses the A12 Bionic. Apple is keeping the same familiar design with a 10.2-inch display.</p>
<p>When it comes to the camera, you can expect improved auto focus and low-light performance. The front-facing is receiving a huge upgrade as it now has a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera with a 122° view angle.</p>
<p>Apple is also bringing center stage to the iPad. That feature automatically detects what’s happening during a video call and crops the image to that part of the video feed in real time. It’s going to improve your family video-conferencing sessions.</p>
<p>The entry-level iPad is also getting True Tone for the first time. It’s a sort of white-balance adjustment feature for the display. Like the previous version, the new iPad supports the first-generation Apple Pencil with its built-in Lightning connector.</p>
<p>The new iPad will be available next week for $329 with 64GB (instead of 32GB for the previous generation). You can also get a model with cellular connectivity and schools can buy this iPad for $299. This model of iPad comes in silver and Space Gray.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s that time of year again. Summer is winding down, the leaves are starting to change color and Apple’s getting ready to drop a brand new iPhone on the world. Today’s big event arrives less than a year after the last big iPhone event, as Apple seems to be back on schedule, after some early pandemic supply chain issues.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/what-we-expect-from-next-weeks-apple-event/">a handy roundup</a> of all the things we expect to see live on video from Cupertino, based on a slew of rumors and leaks. The big news today is almost certainly the arrival of the iPhone 13. We’re also expecting the new Apple Watch Series 7 to drop, as well as some other key hardware additions, potentially including new AirPods and additional Apple Silicon Mac models.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is set to announce new iPhone models today. The company is holding a (virtual) keynote at <strong>10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris)</strong>. And you’ll be able to watch the event right here as the company is streaming it live.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EvGOlAkLSLw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/what-we-expect-from-next-weeks-apple-event/">Rumor has it</a> that there will be a new generation of iPhone models. Reports suggest that the company is going to call it the iPhone 13 and that there will be four different models just like last year. Today, you can expect to learn more about the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p>
<p>When it comes to new features, it’s safe to say that there will be big camera upgrades. This year, the company seems to be focused on video improvements in particular. The iPhone 13 should also come with a better display and a faster chip.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. Apple is likely to use this opportunity to announce a new Apple Watch model. There will be bigger design changes with the Apple Watch Series 7 with sharp edges.</p>
<p>There could be more product announcements as Apple has been working on the AirPods 3. They will replace or complement the entry-level AirPods 2 in the audio lineup. The AirPods Pro and AirPods Max will remain unchanged for now.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s a small chance that we get to hear more about new Macs with custom designed Apple chips as well as new iPad models…</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can watch the live stream directly on this page, as Apple is streaming its conference on YouTube.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok announced this morning that it is implementing new tactics to educate its users about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/tech-leaders-discuss-how-social-media-is-broken-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/">negative mental health impacts</a> of social media. As part of these changes, TikTok is rolling out a &#8220;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/well-being-guide/">well-being guide</a>&#8221; in its Safety Center, a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/eating-disorders/">brief primer</a> on eating disorders, expanded search interventions, and opt-in viewing screens on potentially triggering searches.</p>

TikTok wants users to think about why they&#8217;re sharing their experience, if they&#8217;re ready for a wider audience to hear their story if sharing could be harmful to them, and if they&#8217;re prepared to hear others&#8217; stories in response. </span></p>
<p>The platform also added a brief, albeit generic memo about the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/eating-disorders/">impact of eating disorders</a> under the &#8220;topics&#8221; section of the Safety Center, which was developed with the <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631712835680000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_6fZatFLr2KphvOIMd5SIVjFDvQ">National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA)</a>.

<p>Already, TikTok directs users to local resources when they search for words or phrases like #suicide,* but now, the platform will also share content from creators with the intent of helping someone in need. The platform told TechCrunch that it chose this content following consultation with independent experts. Additionally, if someone enters a search phrase that might be alarming (TikTok offered &#8220;scary makeup&#8221; as an example), the content will be blurred out, asking users to opt-in to see the search results.</p>
<p>As TikTok unveils these changes, its competitor Instagram is facing scrutiny after The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">leaked documents</a> that reveal its parent company Facebook&#8217;s own research on the harm Instagram poses for teen girls. Similar to the Gen Z-dominated TikTok, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">more than 40%</a> of Instagram users are 22 or younger, and 22 million teens log into Instagram in the U.S. each day. In one anecdote, a 19-year-old interviewed by The Wall Street Journal said that after searching Instagram for workout ideas, her explore page has been flooded with photos about how to lose weight (Instagram has previously fessed up to <a href="http://bbc.com/news/technology-56750088">errors with its search function</a>, which recommended that users search topics like &#8220;fasting&#8221; and &#8220;appetite suppressants&#8221;). Angela Guarda, director for the eating-disorders program at Johns Hopkins Hospital, told The Wall Street Journal that her patients often say they learned about dangerous weight loss tactics via social media.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question on many people’s minds is if social media is good or bad for people. The research on this is mixed; it can be both,&#8221; Instagram wrote in a <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/using-research-to-improve-your-experience/">blog post today</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As TikTok nods to with its advice on sharing mental health stories, social media can often be a positive resource, allowing people who are dealing with certain challenges to learn from others who have gone through similar experiences. So, despite these platforms&#8217; outsized influence, it&#8217;s also on real people to think twice about what they post and how it might influence others. Even when Facebook experimented with hiding the number of &#8220;likes&#8221; on Instagram, employees said that </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">it didn&#8217;t improve</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> overall user well-being. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">These revelations about the negative impact of social media on mental health and body image aren&#8217;t ground-breaking, but they generate a renewed pressure for these powerful platforms to think about how to support their users (or, at the very least, add some new memos to their security center). </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mailchimp is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/">selling itself to Intuit in a transaction valued at $12 billion</a>. The deal is a coup not only for companies that eschew venture capital backing &#8212; Mailchimp is famous for its bootstrapping history &#8212; but also for the city of its founding, Atlanta.</p>
<p>Mailchimp’s mega-exit comes in the same year that fellow Atlanta-based startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">Calendly raised</a> a massive $350 million round that valued the technology company north of $3 billion, per Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>The two companies underscore how possible it is to build large startups in markets outside of the traditional collection of cities most associated with technology entrepreneurship in the United States, like Boston, New York City and San Francisco, to name a few.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Investors are taking note. CB Insights <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">data through Q2 2021</a> indicates that startups in Atlanta are on a fundraising tear, already surpassing total capital raised in 2020 in just the first half of this year. The city’s venture acceleration is similar to fundraising gains we’ve seen in markets like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/when-vcs-turned-to-zoom-chicago-startups-were-ready-for-their-close-up/">Chicago</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>The Exchange wanted to better understand the Atlanta market, especially regarding how bullish its local inventors are that its current pace of fundraising can continue, and what sort of external interest its startups are enjoying. So, we ran questions by <a href="https://twitter.com/smccormiq">Sean McCormick</a>, the CEO of Atlanta-based <a href="https://singleops.com/">SingleOps</a>, a software startup that raised capital earlier this year; <a href="https://www.atlantaventures.com/studio">Atlanta Ventures’</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/atgimbel">A.T. Gimbel;</a> and <a href="https://www.blhventures.com/">BLH Venture Partners’</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishmistry/">Ashish Mistry</a>. We also heard from <a href="https://twitter.com/pauljnoble">Paul Noble</a>, CEO of <a href="https://verusen.com">Verusen</a>, a supply chain intelligence startup that <a href="https://verusen.com/verusen-secures-8-million-series-a-to-fuel-intelligent-connected-supply-chains/">raised an $8 million Series A round</a> in January.</p>
<p>The picture that forms is one of a city enjoying a rising tide of venture activity, boosted by some local dynamics that may have helped some of its earlier-stage companies scale more cheaply than they might have in other markets. And there’s plenty of optimism to be found concerning the near future. Let’s explore.</p>
<h2>A funding boom</h2>
<p>It’s cliche at this point to note that a particular geography is experiencing record venture capital results; many cities, regions and countries are seeing startup capital inflows accelerate. But there are markets where the gains still stand out despite the generally warm climate for private capital investments into private companies.</p>
<p>Atlanta is one such market. Per CB Insights data, the U.S. city saw $2.17 billion in total investment during 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, Atlanta nearly matched its 2020 tally, with its startups collecting some $2.07 billion in total capital. Another $953 million was invested in the second quarter of the year; keep in mind that venture capital data is laggy, and thus what may appear to be a sharp decline may be ameliorated by later disclosures.</p>
<p>But with around $3 billion invested in the first half of 2021, already around a 50% gain on 2020’s full-year figures, it’s clear the city is seeing an unprecedented wave of venture investment.</p>
<p>Dollar volume is half the venture capital activity matrix, of course. The other key data line for the investment type is deal volume. There Atlanta’s activity is less superlative; Q1 2021 saw Atlanta startups attract 57 total deals, the second-best results that we have data for, narrowly losing to Q3 2017’s 59 deals.</p>
<p>But Q2 2021 saw Atlanta’s known venture deal volume fall to 42, a figure that is a slight miss from 2020’s average deal volume, measured on a quarterly basis. The same caveat regarding delayed data applies here, but perhaps not enough to completely close the gap between what we might have expected from Atlanta startups in terms of Q2 deal volume in the wake of the city’s super-active Q1.</p>
<p>Despite the somewhat slack Q2 2021 deal count in Atlanta, per current data, it’s clear that the city is enjoying record venture capital attention. What’s driving the uptick? Let’s find out.</p>
