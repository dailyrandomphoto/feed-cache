										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers are considering whether current rules aimed at limiting the practice of geoblocking across the bloc should be extended to cover access to streaming audio-visual content.</p>
<p>Access to services like Netflix tends to be gated to individual EU Member States, meaning Europeans can be barred from accessing libraries of content offered elsewhere in the region. So if you&#8217;re trying to use your Netflix subscription to access the service after moving to another Member State, or want to access inventory offered by Netflix elsewhere in Europe, the answer is typically a big fat no, as we&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/at-last-an-end-to-geoblocking-in-europe-nope-not-by-a-long-chalk/">reported before</a>.</p>
<p>This undermines the core concept of the EU&#8217;s Single Market (and the Digital Single Market &#8212; aka the frictionless ecommerce end-goal which rules such as those limiting geoblocking aim to deliver).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Commission is alive to ongoing issues around online access to audio-visual content. In a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-publishes-its-short-term-review-geo-blocking-regulation">review</a> of the two-year-old Geo-blocking Regulation published today, it says it will kick off discussions with the audiovisual sector on ways to improve consumer access to this type of copyrighted content across the bloc.</p>
<p>It says the planned talks will feed its upcoming Media and Audiovisual Action Plan &#8212; which aims to help European market players scale up and reach new audiences. However it&#8217;s not committing to any specific actions as yet. So whether the push yields anything more nuanced than another &#8216;no&#8217; remains to be seen. (The movie industry being a blocker to freer digital flows of content is, after all, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">not a new story</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Increased access and circulation of audiovisual content will benefit an increasing demand across-borders, including in border regions and with linguistic minorities,&#8221; the Commission suggests in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-publishes-its-short-term-review-geo-blocking-regulation">press release</a> on its review of the current rules.</p>
<p>It notes that on average a European consumer only has access to 14% of the films available online in all the Member States as a whole (the EU27), with &#8220;significant variations&#8221; by country (such as viewers in Greece having access only to 1.3% of the films available online in the EU, vs those in Germany having access to 43.1%).</p>
<p>Its review also highlights growing demand (especially for younger age ranges) to access audio-visual content offered in other Member States &#8212; noting it almost doubled between 2015 and 2019 (from 5% to 9%).</p>
<p>&#8220;A <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/survey/getsurveydetail/instruments/flash/surveyky/2221">2019 Eurobarometer</a> confirmed that there is interest in gaining access to audio-visual content offered in different Member States,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>For other types of copyrighted content &#8212; including music, e-books and videogames &#8212; the Commission sounds less convinced of the need for regulatory reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Report concludes that a further extension of the scope would not necessarily bring substantial benefits to consumers in terms of choice of content, as the catalogues offered are rather homogeneous (in many instances beyond 90%) among Member States,&#8221; it writes, also flagging &#8220;potential impacts&#8221; on the price of such services in Member States (which can vary).</p>
<p>After 18 months of application of the current Geo-blocking Regulation (in force since December 2018), the Commission review lauds progress in reducing some obstacles &#8212; claiming there&#8217;s been &#8220;a stark reduction in barriers caused by location requirements, from 26.9% down to 14% of approximately 9,000 websites surveyed&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such restrictions prevent users from attempting to register to foreign websites due to a postal address in another Member State, and is important because registration is a key stage of the online shopping process,&#8221; it notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;A further decrease in restrictions that users faced when trying to access websites cross-border was reported (e.g. users were denied access or automatically rerouted), the remainder of which was residual (only 0.2% of websites blocking access).&#8221;</p>
<p>It also credits the regulation with boosting the amount of cross-border delivery purchases, saying the increased access to cross-border websites provided by regulation led to an increase of 1.6% in the EU27 compared to 2015, adding that a third of the surveyed websites offered cross-border delivery.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, the internal market commissioner, ThierryBreton, said: “This first review of the Geo-blocking Regulation already shows first positive results. We will further monitor its effects and discuss with stakeholders, notably in the context of the Media and Audio-visual Action Plan to ensure the industry can scale up and reach new audiences, and consumers can fully enjoy the diversity of goods and services in the different EU Member States.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://servicenow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceNow</a>, the cloud-based IT services company, is making a significant acquisition today to fill out its longer-term strategy to be a big player in the worlds of automation and artificial intelligence for enterprises. It is acquiring <a href="https://www.elementai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Element AI</a>, a startup out of Canada.</p>
<p>Founded by AI pioneers and backed by some of the world&#8217;s biggest AI companies &#8212; it raised hundreds of millions of dollars from the likes of Microsoft, Intel, Nvidia and Tencent, among others &#8212; Element AI&#8217;s aim was to build and provision AI-based IT services for enterprises, in many cases organizations that are not technology companies by nature.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed, a spokesperson told TechCrunch, but we are attempting to find out elsewhere. Element AI was valued at between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/13/element-ai-raises-151m-on-a-600-700m-valuation-to-help-companies-build-and-run-ai-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$600 million and $700 million</a> when it last raised money, $151 million (or C$200 million at the time) in September 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If it&#8217;s anywhere near or around that figure, this deal would be ServiceNow&#8217;s biggest acquisition.</p>
<p>A spokesperson confirmed that ServiceNow is making a full acquisition and will retain most of Element AI’s technical talent, including AI scientists and practitioners, but that it will be winding down its existing business after integrating what it wants and needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our focus with this acquisition is to gain technical talent and AI capabilities,&#8221; she said. That will also include Element AI co-founder and CEO, JF Gagné, joining ServiceNow, and co-founder Dr. Yoshua Bengio taking on a role as technical advisor.</p>
<p>The startup is headquartered in Montreal, and ServiceNow&#8217;s plan is to create an AI Innovation Hub based around that &#8220;to accelerate customer-focused AI innovation in the Now Platform.&#8221; (That is the brand name of its automation services.)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, ServiceNow will start re-platforming some of Element AI’s capabilities, she said. &#8220;We expect to wind down most of Element AI’s customers after the deal is closed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The deal is the latest move for a company aiming to build a modern platform fit for our times.</p>
<p>ServiceNow, under CEO Bill McDermott (who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/former-sap-ceo-bill-mcdermott-taking-over-as-servicenow-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joined in October 2019</a> from SAP), has been on a big investment spree in the name of bringing more AI and automation chops to the SaaS company. That has included a number of acquisitions this year, including<a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; border-bottom-color: #00a562;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/servicenow-to-acquire-belgian-configuration-management-startup-sweagle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweagle</a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/servicenow-acquires-conversational-ai-startup-passage-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Passage AI</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">,</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/servicenow-acquires-loom-systems-to-expand-aiops-coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loom</a> (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1373715/000137371520000257/now-20200930.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">respectively</a> for $25 million, $33 million and $58 million), plus regular updates to its larger workflow automation platform.</p>
<p>ServiceNow has been around since 2004, so it&#8217;s not strictly a legacy business, but all the same the publicly-traded company, with a current market cap of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOW?p=NOW&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly $103 billion</a>, is vying to position itself as the go-to company for &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; &#8212; <em>the</em> buzz term for enterprise IT services this year, as everyone scrambles to do more online, in the cloud, and remotely to continue operating through a global health pandemic and whatever comes in its wake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology is no longer supporting the business, technology is the business,&#8221; McDermott said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/servicenow-updates-its-workflow-automation-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier this year</a>. In a tight market where it is completely plausible that Salesforce might scoop up Slack, ServiceNow is making a play for more tools to cover its own patch of the field.</p>
<p>“AI technology is evolving rapidly as companies race to digitally transform 20th century processes and business models,” said ServiceNow Chief AI Officer Vijay Narayanan, in a statement today. “ServiceNow is leading this once-in-a-generation opportunity to make work, work better for people. With Element AI’s powerful capabilities and world class talent, ServiceNow will empower employees and customers to focus on areas where only humans excel – creative thinking, customer interactions, and unpredictable work. That’s a smarter way to workflow.”</p>
<p>Element AI was always a very ambitious concept for a startup. Dr Yoshua Bengio, winner of the 2018 Turing Award who co-founded the company with AI expert Nicolas Chapados and Jean-François Gagné (Element AI&#8217;s CEO) alongside Anne Martel, Jean-Sebastien Cournoyer and Philippe Beaudoin, saw a gap in the market.</p>
<p>Their idea was to build AI services for businesses that were not tech companies in their DNA, but would still very much need to tap into the innovations of the tech world in order to continue growing and remaining competitive with said tech companies as the latter moved deeper into a wider range of industries and the companies themselves required increasing sophistication to operate and grow. They needed, in essence, to disrupt themselves before getting unceremoniously disrupted by someone else.</p>
<p>And on top of that, Element AI could work for and with the tech companies taking strategic investments in Element AI, as those investors wanted to tap some of that expertise themselves, as well as work with the startup to bring more services and win more deals in the enterprise. In addition to its four (sometimes fiercely competitive) investors, other backers included the likes of McKinsey.</p>
<p>Yet what form all of that would take was never completely clear.</p>
<p>When I covered the startup&#8217;s most recent tranche of funding last year, I noted that it wasn&#8217;t very forthcoming on who its customers actually where. Looking at its website, it still isn&#8217;t, although it does lay out several verticals where it aims to work. They include insurance, pharma, logistics, retail, supply chain, manufacturing, government and capital markets.</p>
<p>There were some other positive points. Element AI also played a strong ethics card with its AI For Good efforts, starting with work with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/element-ai-opens-london-outpost-with-focus-on-ai-for-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amnesty in 2018</a> and most recently <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-partners-with-element-ai-to-spearhead-ethical-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla</a>. Indeed, 2018 &#8212; a year after Element AI was founded &#8212; was also the year AI seemed to hit the mainstream consciousness &#8212; and also start to appear somewhat more creepy, with algorithmic misfires, pervasive facial recognition, and more &#8220;automated&#8221; applications that didn&#8217;t work that well and so on &#8212; so launching an ethical aim definitely made sense.</p>
<p>But for all of that, it seems that there perhaps were not enough threads there to need a bigger cloth as a standalone business. <a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Overview/Working-at-Element-AI-EI_IE1624154.11,21.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glassdoor reviews</a> also speak of an endemic disorganization at the startup, which might not have helped, or was perhaps a sign of bigger issues.</p>
<p>“Element AI’s vision has always been to redefine how companies use AI to help people work smarter,” said Element AI Founder and CEO, Jean-Francois Gagné in a statement. “ServiceNow is leading the workflow revolution and we are inspired by its purpose to make the world of work, work better for people. ServiceNow is the clear partner for us to apply our talent and technology to the most significant challenges facing the enterprise today.”</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to be completed by early 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drugmaker Moderna has completed its initial efficacy analysis of its COVID-19 vaccine from the drug&#8217;s Phase 3 clinical study, and determined that it was 94.1% effective in preventing people from contracting COVID-19 across 196 confirmed cases from among 30,000 participants in the study. Moderna also found that it was 100% effective in preventing severe cases (such as those that would require hospitalization) and says it hasn&#8217;t found any significant safety concerns during the trial. On the basis of these results, the company will file an application for emergency use authorization (EUA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Monday.</p>
<p>Seeking an EUA is the next step towards actually beginning to distribute and administer Moderna&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine, and if granted the authorization, it will be able to provide it to high-risk individuals in settings where it could help prevent more deaths, such as with front-line healthcare workers, ahead of receiving a full and final regulatory approval from the U.S. healthcare monitoring agency. Moderna will also seek conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency, which will enable similar use ing the EU.</p>
<p>Moderna&#8217;s vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, which provides genetic instructions to a person&#8217;s body that prompts them to create their own powerful antibodies to block the receptor sites that allows COVID-19 to infect a patient. It&#8217;s a relatively new therapeutic approach for human use, but has the potential to provide potentially even more resistance to COVID-19 than do natural antibodies, and without the risk associated with introducing any actual virus, active or otherwise, to an inoculated individual in order to prompt their immune response.</p>
<p>In mid-November, Moderna announced that its COVID-19 vaccine showed 94.5% efficacy in its preliminary results. This final analysis of that same data hews very close to the original, which is promising news for anyone hoping for an effective solution to be available soon. This data has yet to be peer reviewed, though Moderna says that it will now be submitting data from the Phase 3 study to a scientific publication specifically for that purpose.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> marketing of iPhones as &#8216;water resistant&#8217; without clarifying the limits of the feature and also having a warranty that excludes cover for damage by liquids has got the company into hot water in Italy.</p>
<p>The Italian competition authority (AGCM) has informed the tech giant of an intent to fine it €10 million for commercial practices related to the marketing and warranty of a number of iPhone models since October 2017, starting with the iPhone 8 through to the iPhone 11, following an investigation into consumer complaints related to its promotion of water resistance and subsequent refusal to cover the cost of repairs caused by water damage.</p>
<p>In a document setting out the AGCM&#8217;s decision dated towards the end of October &#8212; which was made public today (via <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-italy-apple-antitrust/italys-antitrust-fines-apple-10-million-euros-for-misleading-commercial-practices-idUKKBN28A0OH">Reuters</a>) &#8212; the regulator concludes Apple violated the country&#8217;s consumer code twice because of what it characterizes as &#8220;misleading&#8221; and &#8220;aggressive&#8221; commercial practices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Its investigation found Apple&#8217;s iPhone marketing tricked <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">consumers into believing the devices were impermeable to water, rather than merely water resistant &#8212; with the limitations of the feature not given enough prominence in ads. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While a disclaimer stating that Apple&#8217;s warranty excludes damage by liquids was deemed an aggressive attempt to circumvent consumer rights obligations &#8212; given its heavy promotion of the devices as water resistant.</span></p>
<p>Apple places a liquid contact indicator inside iPhones, which changes from white or silver to red on contact with liquid, and checking the indicator is a standard step undertaken by its repair staff.</p>
<p>The AGCM report cites examples of consumers who&#8217;s iPhone had taken a &#8220;short dive&#8221; in the sea being refused cover. Another complainant had been washing their device under the tap &#8212; which Apple deemed improper use.</p>
<p>A third reported that their one-month old iPhone XR stopped working after coming into contact with water. Apple told them they must buy a new device &#8212; albeit at a subsidized price.</p>
<p>While an iPhone XS user, with a one-year old handset who reported it had never come into contact with water was refused coverage by Apple support who said it had, complained to the regulator there&#8217;s no way for a consumer to prove their device was not immersed in water for more than the length of time and depth to which Apple&#8217;s small print specifies it has water resistance.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Apple for comment on the AGCM&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p>The tech giant has 60 days from the date it was notified of the regulator&#8217;s intent to fine to appeal the decision.</p>
<p>The size of the penalty is well under half of the operating profit the regulator says Apple&#8217;s Italian operation made in the year September 2018 to September 2019, when it note it recorded revenues on its sales and services of €58,652,628; and an operating profit of €26,918,658.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/italian-consumer-watchdog-hands-down-e15m-in-fines-to-apple-and-samsung-for-slowing-devices/">Two years ago</a> Italy&#8217;s competition watchdog also fined Apple and Samsung around $15M for forcing updates on consumers that may slow or break their devices. While, this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/apple-fined-27-million-for-throttling-old-iphones-without-telling-users/">February</a>, France fined Apple $27 million for capping the OS performance of iPhones with older batteries.</p>
<p>Apple has also faced much larger penalties from competition authorities elsewhere in Europe &#8212; including being notified of a $1.2BN fine by France&#8217;s competition authority in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/apple-fined-record-1-2b-in-france-over-anti-competitive-sales-practices/">March</a> this year, which accused the tech giant of operating a reseller cartel along with two wholesale distribution partners, Ingram Micro and Tech Data.</p>
<p>Apple also had to stump up as much as €500M in back taxes demanded by French authorities <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/apple-fined-27-million-for-throttling-old-iphones-without-telling-users/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>While some $15BN from Apple&#8217;s European HQ is sitting in an escrow account to cover a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/30/apple-ordered-to-pay-up-to-145-billion-for-illegal-tax-benefits-in-ireland/">2016 European Commission &#8216;State Aid&#8217; charge</a> that it illegally benefited from corporate tax arrangements in Ireland between 2003 and 2014.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/apple-and-ireland-win-appeal-against-the-european-commissions-15-billion-tax-ruling/">July</a> Apple and Ireland won the first round of an appeal against the charge.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government has squeezed the timetable for domestic telcos to stop installing 5G kit from Chinese suppliers, per the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55124236">BBC</a>, which reports that the deadline for installation of kit from so-called &#8216;high risk&#8217; vendors is now September.</p>
<p>It had already announced a ban on telcos buying kit from Huawei et al by the end of this year &#8212; acting on national security concerns attached to companies that fall under the jurisdiction of Chinese state surveillance laws. But, according to the BBC, ministers are concerned carriers could stockpile kit for near-term installation to create an optional buffer for themselves since it has allowed until 2027 for them to remove such kit from existing 5G networks. Maintaining already installed equipment will also still be allowed up til then.</p>

<p>A Telecommunications Security Bill which will allow the government to identify kit as a national security risk and ban its use in domestic networks is slated to be introduced to parliament tomorrow.</p>
<p>Digital secretary Oliver Dowden told the BBC he&#8217;s pushing for the &#8220;complete removal of high-risk vendors&#8221;.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/uk-u-turns-on-huawei-and-5g-giving-operators-until-2027-to-rip-out-existing-kit/">July</a> the government said changes to the US sanction regime meant it could no longer manage the security risk attached to Chinese kit makers.</p>
<p>The move represented a major U-turn from the policy position announced in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/uk-will-allow-huawei-to-supply-5g-with-tight-restrictions/">January</a> &#8212; when the UK said it would allowed Chinese vendors to play a limited role in supplying domestic networks. However the plan faced vocal opposition from the government&#8217;s own back benches, as well as high profile pressure from the US &#8212; which has pushed allies to expel Huawei entirely.</p>
<p>Alongside policies to restrict the use of high risk 5G vendors the UK has said it will take steps to encourage newcomers to enter the market to tackle concerns that the resulting lack of suppliers introduces another security risk.</p>
<p>Publishing a supply <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/5g-supply-chain-diversification-strategy/5g-supply-chain-diversification-strategy">chain diversification strategy for 5G</a> today, Dowden warns that barring &#8220;high risk&#8221; vendors leaves the country &#8220;overly reliant on too few suppliers&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This 5G Diversification Strategy is a clear and ambitious plan to grow our telecoms supply chain while ensuring it is resilient to future trends and threats,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;It has three core strands: supporting incumbent suppliers; attracting new suppliers into the UK market; and accelerating the development and deployment of open-interface solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government is putting an initial £250 million behind the 5G diversification plan to try to build momentum for increasing competition and interoperability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Achieving this long term vision depends on removing the barriers that prevent new market entrants from joining the supply chain, investing in R&amp;D to support the accelerated development and deployment of interoperable deployment models, and international collaboration and policy coordination between national governments and industry,&#8221; it writes.</p>
<p>In the short to medium term the government says it will proritize support for existing suppliers &#8212; so the likely near term beneficiary of the strategy is Finland&#8217;s Nokia.</p>
<p>Though the government also says it will &#8220;seek to attract new suppliers to the UK market in order to start the process of diversification as soon as possible&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of our approach we will prioritise opportunities to build UK capability in key areas of the supply chain,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;As we progress this activity we look forward to working with network operators in the UK, telecoms suppliers and international governments to achieve our shared goals of a more competitive and vibrant telecoms supply market.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Huawei for comment on the new deadline for UK carriers to stop installing its 5G kit.</p>
<p>The company has continued to reject security concerns attached to its business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food delivery apps have been a big deal this year both for consumers stuck at home and unable (or unwilling) to go to restaurants or grocery stores, and for investors who are eyeing the opportunity to back rising stars to help them grow.</p>
<p>Today came the latest development in that story: <a href="https://www.hungrypanda.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HungryPanda</a>, which makes a Mandarin-language app specifically targeting Chinese consumers outside of China, has raised $70 million to continue its global expansion in delivering food from Chinese restaurants and Asian grocery stores targeting the Chinese diaspora.</p>
<p>Estimates put the number of Chinese people living abroad (counting students and first-generation immigrants, and counting those living outside of the Mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau) at <a href="http://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/academy/index.php?chinese-diaspora" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around 50 million</a>, with most of them concentrated in other Asian countries, so that is a specific target for the startup. Longer term, there are tens of millions more people if you consider second-, third- and further generations of people, although that will likely see big changes to the app, including introducing other languages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding comes on the back of a surge of usage of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hungrypanda" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hungrypanda">HungryPanda <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. It is now live in 47 cities (versus 31 in February of this year) across Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, and the UK &#8212; the country where it is was founded. Growing some 30-fold in the last three years, HungryPanda&#8217;s CEO and founder Eric Liu said in an interview that it is already profitable in its earliest markets in the UK, as well as in New York City, and is safely en route to getting into the black in other locations, too.</p>
<p>The Series C is being led by Kinnevik (a prolific backer of e-commerce startups), with participation also from 83North and Felix Capital (which backed HungryPanda in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/hungrypanda-a-food-delivery-app-for-chinese-communities-raises-20-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last round of $20 million earlier this year</a>), as well as Piton Capital and Burda Principal Investment.</p>
<p>HungryPanda is not disclosing its valuation right now, but it&#8217;s notable that most of its four-year life has been spent bootstrapped &#8212; it has raised only $90 million to date, all of it this year.</p>
<p>Food apps have come into their own in 2020. Already popular with consumers who like the convenience of using a phone or website to browse and order food to be brought to their door, during the Covid-19 pandemic, many services were stretched to capacity in cities where people were being ordered to shelter in place and restaurants were closed.</p>
<p>E-marketer estimates that in the US alone, usage went up by <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/more-consumers-turning-food-delivery-apps-amid-indoor-dining-restrictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 25%</a>. It all still came at a cost, though. For example, the increased measures that needed to be taken to ensure social distancing meant higher costs for the companies, which are often already stretched in their unit economics.</p>
<p>In that sea of apps, however, you might be hard-pressed to distinguish one from another. At one point in the UK, for example, even the delivery bags and logos of two big rivals, Deliveroo and Uber Eats, looked the same.</p>
<p>HungryPanda is a very different bird compared to these. For starters, the whole app is in Mandarin. And it focuses primarily (in most cases, only) on Chinese food. If you want pizza or a burger, or if you want to read the menu in English, go somewhere else.</p>
<p>The app was founded four years ago by Liu, who was an international student in computer science student at the University of Nottingham. Coming over from China, even though there are indeed a number of Chinese restaurants in the city, he and other Chinese students found it nearly impossible to order from them.</p>
<p>The reasons? All of the menus were in English, and the names of dishes, as they were translated, had no meaning for them; and in any case they were all essentially filtered and altered for local (read: British) palates. This was a bigger deal than it might be for some: Chinese people prefer to eat &#8220;traditional&#8221; food, said Liu, and they take the business of eating very seriously.</p>
<p>His solution was to build an app that provided all the information to students like him in a format that they could actually use, including items that typically might only be offered on side menus to Chinese customers in Mandarin, if at all.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that while food delivery unit economics can be very challenging in a sprawling city, the same does not apply typically to HungryPanda. Typically, at a company like Deliveroo, the rule of thumb has been to be slightly above two deliveries per hour per driver to make that hour profitable. That is not always possible, however, in the real world. (And that&#8217;s before counting all of the other costs around marketing, and so on.)</p>
<p>HungryPanda, however, was delivering to students who were in dormitories, and often ordering in groups to eat &#8220;family style&#8221;. It meant that HungryPanda was mitigating a lot of the typical unit economics, said Antoine Nussenbaum, the co-founder of Felix Capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;This made the efficiency of delivering much higher,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The same has gone for grocery delivery. Panwen Chen, the global VP of strategy and an early employee of the company, was also a student at Nottingham and said, considering that even students don&#8217;t want to eat out all that time, getting groceries was next to impossible for him and others like him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn’t have a car, and so getting to the Chinese grocery in Nottingham meant taking two buses or 50-60 minute walk,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Before you know it, you&#8217;re struggling with very heavy bags of groceries. It&#8217;s not a nice experience. We then started working with groceries, and what we found was that with food delivery we already had the infrastructure, so it was a natural extension of what we do, especially since the community was the same. That helped us to understand also what they wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that takeaway ready-made food is still majority of the startup&#8217;s business, both growing very fast.</p>
<p>Loading in one function, and then two, into the app sets up HungryPanda for how it might grow further in the future. Asia has been a pioneer on that front, with apps like WeChat, and more specifically those focused around delivery services like Grab, really carving out a place for themselves as &#8220;super apps,&#8221; providing users with a vast array of services beyond the core, original purpose of those apps.</p>
<p>Consumers and businesses in the wider network are accustomed to the existence of &#8220;super apps&#8221;, and they are well-used. So in a world where some of the homegrown Chinese apps have found it harder to break into international markets (and in some cases like the US, they may be <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/30/1011450/wechat-censored-china-under-attack-in-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">downright challenged to do so</a>) this gives HungryPanda, which is a UK app, an interesting position, potentially as a partner or as a strong competitor in those markets.</p>
<p>Indeed it already pushes a wide range of offers to users from partner organizations, which stretch well beyond basic food ordering.</p>
<p>HungryPanda started for Liu as a side project to university. His plan was to go on to the London School of Economics for post-graduate work after getting his Nottingham undergrad degree. The business took off, though, and so he deferred for two years. Last year, he got the reminder from the LSE to nudge him on what happens next, and he said he ended up deferring indefinitely for now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel it&#8217;s been not just a good experience for me, but for the Chinese community that uses us,&#8221; he said. He now lives in New York City, building the business in the US.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We are now into the all-important holiday sales period, and new numbers from <a href="http://gartner.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> point to some recovery underway for the smartphone market as vendors roll out a raft of new 5G handsets.</p>
<p>Q3 smartphone figures from the analysts published today showed that smartphone unit sales were 366 million units, a decline of 5.7% globally compared to the same period last year. Yes, it&#8217;s a drop; but it is still a clear improvement on the first half of this year, when sales <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/covid-19-blamed-as-smartphone-sales-plummet-20-in-q2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slumped by 20%</a> in each <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-06-01-gartner-says-global-smartphone-sales-declined-20--in-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quarter</a>, due largely to the effects of Covid-19 on spending and consumer confidence overall.</p>
<p>That confidence is being further bolstered by some other signals. We are coming out of a relatively strong string of sales days over the Thanksgiving weekend, traditionally the &#8220;opening&#8221; of the holiday sales cycle. While sales on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/thanksgiving-on-track-for-a-record-6b-in-us-online-sales-says-adobe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thursday</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/black-friday-online-sales-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Friday</a> were at the lower end of predicted estimates, they still set records over previous years. With a lot of tech like smartphones often bought online, this could point to stronger numbers for smartphone sales as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On top of that, last week <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/idc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="idc">IDC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; which also tracks and analyses smartphones sales &#8212; published a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201125005413/en/Smartphone-Shipments-Will-Return-to-Growth-in-the-Holiday-Quarter-and-Beyond-Driven-by-Strong-Push-Behind-5G-According-to-IDC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> predicting that sales would grow 2.4% in Q4 compared to 2019&#8217;s Q4. Its take is that while 5G smartphones will drive buying, prices still need to come down on these newer generation handsets to really see them hit with wider audiences. The average selling price for a 5G-enabled smartphone in 2020 is $611, said IDC, but it thinkgs that by 2024 that will come down to $453, likely driven by Android-powered handsets, which have collectively dominated smartphone sales for years.</p>
<p>Indeed, in terms of brands, Samsung, with its Android devices, continued to lead the pack in terms of overall units, with 80.8 million units, and a 22% market share. In fact, the Korean handset maker and China&#8217;s Xiaomi were the only two in the top five to see growth in their sales in the quarter, respectively at 2.2% and 34.9%. Xiaomi&#8217;s numbers were strong enough to see it overtake Apple for the quarter to become the number-three slot in terms of overall sales rankings. Huawei just about held on to number two. See the full chart further down in this story with more detail.</p>
<p>Also worth noting: overall mobile sales &#8212; a figure that includes both smartphones and feature phones &#8212; were down 8.7% 401 million units. That underscores not just how few feature phones are selling at the moment (smartphones can often even be cheaper to buy, depending on the brands involved or the carrier bundles), but also that those less sophisticated devices are seeing even more sales pressure than more advanced models.</p>
<h2>Smartphone slump: it&#8217;s not just Covid-19</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s worth remembering that even before the global health pandemic, smartphone sales were facing slowing growth. The reasons: after a period of huge enthusiasm from consumers to pick up devices, many countries reached market penetration. And then, the latest features were too incremental to spur people to sell up and pay a premium on newer models.</p>
<p>In that context, the big hope from the industry has been 5G, which has been marketed by both carriers and handset makers as having more data efficiency and speed than older technologies. Yet when you look at the wider roadmap for 5G, rollout has remained <a href="https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/ip_services/understanding-5g/5g-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patchy</a>, and consumers by and large are still <a href="https://www.govtech.com/network/For-Many-Consumers-5G-Remains-an-Unknown-Quantity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not fully convinced</a> they need it.</p>
<p>Notably, in this past quarter, there is still some evidence that emerging/developing markets continue to have an impact on growth &#8212; in contrast to new features being drivers in penetrated markets.</p>
<p>“Early signs of recovery can be seen in a few markets, including parts of mature Asia/Pacific and Latin America. Near normal conditions in China improved smartphone production to fill in the supply gap in the third quarter which benefited sales to some extent,” said Anshul Gupta, senior research director at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gartner" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gartner">Gartner, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in a statement. “For the first time this year, smartphone sales to end users in three of the top five markets i.e., India, Indonesia and Brazil increased, growing 9.3%, 8.5% and 3.3%, respectively.”</p>
<p>The more positive Q3 figures coincide with a period this summer that saw new Covid-19 cases slowing down in many places and the relaxation of many restrictions, so now all eyes are on this coming holiday period, at a time when Covid-19 cases have picked up with a vengeance, and with no rollout (yet) of large-scale vaccination or therapeutic programs. That is having an inevitable drag on the economy.</p>
<p>“Consumers are limiting their discretionary spend even as some lockdown conditions have started to improve,” said Gupta of the Q3 numbers. “Global smartphone sales experienced moderate growth from the second quarter of 2020 to the third quarter. This was due to pent-up demand from previous quarters.”</p>
<p>Digging into the numbers, Samsung has held on to its top spot, although its growth was significantly less strong in the quarter. Even with that slump, Samsung is still a long way ahead.</p>
<p>That is in part because number-two Huawei, with 51.8 million units sold, was down by more than 21% since last year. It has been having a hard time in the wake of a public relations crisis after sanctions in the US and UK, due to accusations that its equipment is used by China for spying. (Those UK sanctions, indeed, have been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55124236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brought up in timing, just as of last night</a>.)</p>
<p>That also led Huawei earlier this month to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/huawei-sells-budget-phone-unit-honor-to-government-distribution-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirm</a> the long-rumored plan to sell off its Honor smartphone division. That deal will involve selling the division, reportedly valued at around $15 billion, to a consortium of companies.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Apple&#8217;s small decline of 0.6% to 40.6 million units to Xiaomi&#8217;s 44.4 million, will shift in the next quarter, on the back of the company launching a new raft of iPhone 12 devices.</p>
<p>“Apple sold 40.5 million units in the third quarter of 2020, a decline of 0.6% as compared to 2019,” said Annette Zimmermann, research vice president at Gartner, in a statement. “The slight decrease was mainly due to Apple’s delayed shipment start of its new 2020 iPhone generation, which in previous years would always start mid/end September. This year, the launch event and shipment start began 4 weeks later than usual.”</p>
<p>Oppo, which is still not available through carriers or retail partners in the US, rounded out the top five sellers with just under 30 million phones sold. The fact that it and Xiaomi do so well despite not really having a phone presence in the US is an interesting testament to what kind of role the US plays in the global smartphone market: huge in terms of perception, but perhaps less so when the chips are down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Others&#8221; &#8212; that category that can take in the long tail of players who make phones, continues to be a huge force, accounting for more sales than any one of the top five. That underscores the fragmentation in the Android-based smartphone industry, but all the same, its collective numbers were in decline, a sign that consumers are indeed slowly continuing to consolidate around a smaller group of trusted brands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.smics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SMIC</a>, one of largest chip makers in the world, is among several companies that the Department of Defense plans to designate as being owned or controlled by the Chinese military, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-30/u-s-to-add-china-s-smic-cnooc-to-blacklist-reuters-says?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports Reuters</a>. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-securities-investments-finance-communist-chinese-military-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed an executive order</a>, set to go into effect on January 11, that would bar U.S. investors from buying securities from companies on the defense blacklist.</p>
<p>In a statement to Reuters, SMIC said it continues &#8220;to engage constructively and openly with the U.S. government&#8221; and that it &#8220;has no relationship with the Chinese military and does not manufacture for military end-users or end-uses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The largest semiconductor maker in China, SMIC holds about 4% of the worldwide foundry market, <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20201005-10499.html#:~:text=Occupying%20about%204%25%20of%20the,and%20more%20advanced%20process%20technologies." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimates market research firm TrendForce.</a> Its U.S. customers have included Qualcomm, Broadcom and Texas Instruments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2328894/dod-releases-list-of-additional-companies-in-accordance-with-section-1237-of-fy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently 31 companies on the defense blacklist</a>. SMIC is one of four new companies that the Department of Defense plans to add, according to Reuters. The others are China Construction Technology, China International Engineering Consulting Corp and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC).</p>
<p>The company delisted from NYSE in May 2019, but it said that the decision was prompted by the limited trading volume and high administrative costs, not the U.S.-China trade war or the U.S. government’s blacklisting of Huawei and other Chinese tech companies.</p>

<p>SMIC has already been impacted by export restrictions that prevent them from purchasing key equipment from American suppliers. At the beginning of October, it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-04/smic-says-u-s-is-placing-export-restrictions-on-its-suppliers?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told shareholders</a> that export restrictions set by the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security could have &#8220;material adverse effects&#8221; on its production.</p>
<p>The executive order, and the possible addition of new companies to the defense blacklist, is in-line with the Trump administration’s hard stance against Chinese tech companies, including Huawei, ZTE and ByteDance, that it claims are a potential national security threat through their alleged ties to the Chinese government and military. But the future of a lot of the current administration’s policies after the Joe Biden assumes the presidency on January 20 is uncertain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://primer.io/">Primer</a>, the U.K. fintech that wants to help merchants consolidate their payments stack and easily support new payment methods in the future, has raised £14 million in Series A funding. The round was led by Accel, who I understand were quite proactive in persuading Primer to take the VC firm&#8217;s money.</p>
<p>The young company wasn&#8217;t actively fund-raising, having quietly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/primer/">raised £3.8 million in funding announced in May</a>. Instead, the team was heads down building out the product and wooing potential customers by holding technical workshops and in-depth interviews over Zoom with 100 merchants &#8212; activity that didn’t go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Also participating in the Series A are existing investors: Balderton, SpeedInvest and Seedcamp, who were joined in the round by new backer RTP Global. Sonali De Rycker, partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/accel" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="accel">Accel, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will join Primer’s board.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by ex-PayPal employees – via PayPal’s acquisition of Braintree — Primer wants to offer one payments API to (hopefully) rule them all, with the explicit aim of bringing greater transparency to a merchant’s payment stack.</p>
<p>The thinking is that larger merchants, especially those that operate in more than one geography, have to support an array of payment methods, which brings with it significant technical overhead, a poor user experience, and lack of transparency.</p>
<p>Primer, now described as a “low code” platform, carries out a lot of that heavy-lifting on behalf of merchants and while remaining steadfastly payment method agnostic. By doing so, the idea is to reduce friction when adopting new payment methods as they come to market, and be able to provide better insights into things like how well each checkout option is performing.</p>
<p>As well as payment-service-providers (PSPs), the platform has connectors for fraud providers, chargeback services, subscription billing engines, BI tools, loyalty and rewards platforms. Both payments and non-payments services can be &#8220;seamlessly connected to the checkout experience and payments flow via workflows, enabling merchants to unify their fraud migration efforts, build sophisticated transaction routing, and solve complex flows – all with no code,&#8221; explains Primer.</p>
<p>Primer says the additional funding will be used for international business development and scaling its team. Billed as a remote-first company, Primer has 23 employees across six countries, and says it has already picked up traction across mid-market and large enterprise e-commerce merchants across Europe.</p>
<p>Comments Paul Anthony, Primer’s co-founder and head of product and engineering: “During our time at PayPal, we saw first-hand the technical burden online merchants face trying to offer the best payments experiences to their customers globally. Our low-code approach enables merchants’ payments teams to manage and expand their payments ecosystems, and maintain sophisticated payments logic with a familiar workflow UI&#8221;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new investment brings Primer’s total funding to £17.8 million, and comes only a few weeks after the initial launch of the company’s platform.</p>

<p>Thanks I’m giving for the start of the first big online season. Yes, the pandemic has put in place a gigantic move to the digital for our immediate and accelerated future. We all know how this plays out in the required state of things pre-vaccine. But there’s an undercurrent not so hidden there of a dynamic answer to my wife’s stubborn question: Where’s my Jetpack?</p>
<p>She’s a child of the 60s, a post-Beatles time of imploding dreams and dashed expectations. James Bond got to fly a Jetpack, but the telltale burned gasoline exhaust made the effect an artifact of what wasn’t going to happen. In an electric decade and noise-canceling AirPods, maybe it’s more likely to surface than not, but if so, what’s the next Jetpack?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>My vote is for the electric newsletter, a notification engine that knows what I’m tracking, projects the trends circulating my core peers, and invests proactively in the products we want to accelerate. It’s a self healing economy, a research coordinator, a humor and media rewarder. On the Gang, we use a blend of live streaming, backchannel notifications, and everything up to but not including a newsletter.</p>
<p>From its earliest days, Twitter promised a future where RSS authority would be mined in a social context. What I mean by that is RSS delivered the ability, the chair in the sky opportunity Louis C.K. described, the chance to explore the world alongside the artists formerly known as accredited journalists. It was always a tough sell for the displaced gatekeepers, but flash forward to today and you can see they’re all bloggers and podcasters now.</p>
<p>The moment the meritocracy window opened, the definition of success moved to the readers, the viewers, the social enterprise as Marc Benioff insisted. Software as a service mined those social signals as fuel for what the iPhone delivered in the mobile wave. Now the mobile economy is expanding to the silicon on the desktop. M1 seems like an evolution, but its entry point on consumer laptops is designed to produce network effects in the same way Office 97 boosted Windows 95 into orbit.</p>
<p>So where is this electric newsletter if it’s so important? As a vehicle for finding stuff I didn’t know I cared about, newsletters suffer from too many of them with too few business models driving them. Subscriptions derive revenue but reduce the network effects of advertising supported subsidy of firewalls. You get reach but quantity explodes. Context glut is not a pretty thing, either.</p>
<p>Our early attempts at constructing a Gang newsletter spawned the realtimeTelegram feed; its group-shared notification stream valuable as much for what we skipped as when we dipped in to it. As a framing device for the Gillmor Gang recording sessions, we could anticipate both what we wanted to talk about and what we wanted to avoid. Trump fatigue gets burned off in Telegram, while science and innovation get drilled down on and fleshed out in advance.</p>
<p>Adding a Twitter feed (follow @gillmorgang) pushes Likes and retweets into the mix. The live recording stream generates Facebook Watch Parties and additional comments. An edited version here on TechCrunch adds this related commentary. But where’s the newsletter for all these live pieces?</p>
<p>Perhaps the answer goes back to the Jetpack? It may not be the Jetpack we are looking for, but rather the components that make up this stream as a service. A Jetpack offers the dream of instant teleportation without the traffic jams or being polite about your Uber driver’s musical taste. Zoom already offers some of that promise, where saving the commute opens up hours in your day. Zoom-enabled shopping and delivery management will go a long way.</p>
<p>As Donovan presciently proclaimed, Electrical Banana gonna to be the very next phase. My electric newsletter is the perfect definition of a pipe dream. It’s not so much as when it’s going to get here as what.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London HQ&#8217;d <a href="http://firstminute.capital/">Firstminute Capital</a> has announced its second early-stage venture fund of $111m (£87m). Founded and cornerstoned in 2016 by Brent Hoberman CBE (best known as co-founder of lastminute.com and MADE.com), together with Spencer Crawley (formerly of Goldman Sachs), this new fund comes after the first fund of $100M, giving Firstminute $211M assets under management, investing across Europe and the US at the seed stage.</p>
<p>Firstminute’s team of 18 is based in London, Stockholm and Berlin and now has plans to open an office in LA next year.</p>
<p>Of note is the fact that its LPs now number 70 founders of billion-dollar businesses as investors, and that Firstminute is being so open. VCs typically do not reveal much information about LPs. Hoberman has clearly also leveraged his position as founder of the Founders Forum group which runs events and activities for European tech founders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The fact that so many founders &#8211; largely drawn from the ranks of European startups &#8211; have invested is unusual, certainly for European VC funds. It includes 16 founders of $10bn+ “decacorn” technology businesses, including Palantir, Wayfair, Ocado, MongoDB, Zalando, Supercell and Check Point, as well as founders from Huda Beauty, Graphcore and Rappi. Included are board members and CEOs from large technology companies.</p>
<p>RIT Capital Partners is the fund’s anchor investor. This is their first such position in a European venture capital firm. They previously backed leading US funds including Sequoia, Benchmark, Thrive and Iconiq. Additional institutional investors include the Chinese technology giant Tencent, FMCG conglomerate Henkel, London-based venture fund Atomico and four Californian multi-stage firms.</p>
<p>The existing Fund I portfolio consists of 56 companies that have collectively raised approximately $0.5bn in funding.</p>
<p>Firstminute says half of its current portfolio companies have UK headquarters, with the remaining half split between continental Europe and North America. Two-thirds of the businesses are B2B and one third are B2C.</p>
<p>Hoberman said in a statement: “European technology is reaching escape velocity, and it’s fantastic to enable so many global serial entrepreneurs to give their experience to the next generation: we have over 70 unicorn founders joining us on this journey so far, and more to come as we approach final close. Seed venture investing is attracting ever higher quality backers which will help more founders succeed.”</p>
<p>Crawley, firstminute Co-founder &amp; General Partner, said: “Our healthcare systems, workplaces and educational establishments face fresh complexities. The service economy is having to re-imagine itself. The gap between financial markets and the real economy is growing wider (with the young most at risk). Start-ups are not a panacea, but emerging technology companies have a key role to play in today’s recovery strategy, both in their mindset and the products they will create.”</p>
<p>I asked Hoberman to what extent was the internationalization of the fund‘s geographical footprint related to Brexit?</p>
<p>&#8220;Some investors have asked us about the risks of Brexit to a UK-based fund and it&#8217;s been great to highlight the international nature of our approach,” he said. “The potential threats of a bad Brexit deal ensured we moved faster to cover more geographies.”</p>
<p>I also asked him what advantages or disadvantages does having so many founders as LPs confer on the fund?</p>
<p>&#8220;Operators understand the rollercoaster of the founder journey well. They know the path to success is rarely linear. They have lived the scaling journey with all its challenges. They can impart this wisdom to the next generation.</p>
<p>&#8220;These founders know about blitzscaling, board management, prioritization, fundraising, internationalization and above all the role of talent and teams. This knowledge can make the difference between failure and extraordinary success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Furthermore successful founders often have world-class network, useful for hiring, internationalization and business development deals,” he said.</p>
<p>Firstminute also announced some team changes. Arek Wylegalski, formerly of Index Ventures, has joined as a partner for Fund II. Arek was a Venture Partner with the firm during Fund I. Lina Wenner, formerly of BCG, has been promoted to Associate Partner, and Camilla Mazzolini, Clara Lindh Bergendorff and Sam Endacott have been promoted to Principals. Min Nolan, Head of Platform &amp; Operations, and Anais Benazet, Head of Community, lead the portfolio support function, whilst Henry Lane-Fox, Steve Crossan and Tommy Stadlen continue to invest as venture partners.</p>
<p>The backers of firstminute capital funds include the founders and/or executives from the companies listed below:</p>
<p><strong>firstminute LPs &#8211; Founders of $10bn+ companies, include: </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications, and the overall app economy.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 204 billion downloads and $120 billion in consumer spending in 2019. People now <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/average-us-time-spent-with-mobile-in-2019-has-increased" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spend</a> three hours and 40 minutes per day using apps, rivaling TV. Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">This week, we&#8217;re digging into more data about how the App Store commission changes will impact developers, as well as other top stories, like Snapchat&#8217;s new Spotlight feed and India&#8217;s move to ban more Chinese apps from the country, among other things.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We also have our weekly round-up of news about platforms, services, privacy, trends, and other headlines.</p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3><strong>More on App Store Commissions</strong></h3>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/21/this-week-in-apps-apple-slashes-commissions-twitter-launches-fleets-warnings-about-parler/">App Annie confirmed to TechCrunch</a> around 98% of all iOS developers in 2019 (meaning, unique publisher accounts) fell under the $1 million annual consumer spend threshold that will now move App Store commissions from a reduced 15% to the standard 30%. The firm also found that only 0.5% of developers were making between $800K and $1M; only 1% were in $500K-$800K range; and 87.7% made less than $100K.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://appfigures.com/resources/insights/apples-gift-to-developers-is-a-win-win">Appfigures has compiled its own data</a> on how Apple&#8217;s changes to App Store commissions will impact the app developer community.</p>
<p>According to its findings, of the 2M published apps on the App Store, 376K apps are a paid download, have in-app purchases, or monetize with subscriptions. Those 376K apps are operated by a smaller group of 124.5K developers. Of those developers, only a little under 2% earned more than $1M in 2019. This confirms App Annie&#8217;s estimate that 98% of all developers earned under the $1M threshold.</p>

<p>The firm also took a look at companies above the $1M mark, and found that around 53% were games, led by King (of the Candy Crush titles). After a large gap, the next largest categories in 2019 were Health &amp; Fitness, Social Networking, Entertainment, then Photo &amp; Video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the developers making over $1M, the largest percentage &#8212; 39% &#8212; made between $1M and $2.5M in 2019.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2079141" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2079141" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2079141" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-count.png" alt="" width="1024" height="617" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-count.png 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-count.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-count.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-count.png?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-count.png?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-count.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2079141" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Appfigures</p></div></p>
<p>The smallest group (1.5%) of developers making more than $1M is the group making more than $150M. These accounted for 29% of the &#8220;over $1M&#8221; crowd&#8217;s total revenue. And those making between $50M and $150M accounted for 24% of the revenue.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2079142" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2079142" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2079142" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-revenue.png" alt="" width="1024" height="617" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-revenue.png 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-revenue.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-revenue.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-revenue.png?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-revenue.png?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1m-club-revenue.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2079142" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Appfigures</p></div></p>
<p>AppFigures also found that of those making less than $1M, most (&gt;97%) fell into the sub $250K category. Some developes were worried about the way Apple&#8217;s commission change system was implemented &#8212; that is, it immediately upon hitting $1M and only annual reassessments. But there are so few developers operating in the &#8220;danger zone&#8221; (being near the threshold), this doesn&#8217;t seem like a significant problem. <strong><a href="https://appfigures.com/resources/insights/apples-gift-to-developers-is-a-win-win">Read More</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>Snapchat takes on TikTok</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary">After taking on TikTok  with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/snapchat-launches-its-tiktok-rival-sounds-on-snapchat/">music-powered features</a> last month, Snapchat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">this week launched</a> a dedicated place within its app where users can watch short, entertaining videos in a vertically scrollable, TikTok-like feed. This new feature, called Spotlight, will showcase the community’s creative efforts, including the videos now backed by music, as well as other Snaps users may find interesting. Snapchat says its algorithms will work to surface the most engaging Snaps to display to each user on a personalized basis. <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Read More</a>. </strong></p>
<h3>India bans more Chinese apps</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary">India, which has already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/india-bans-pubg-and-over-100-additional-chinese-apps/">banned </a>at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/26/china-responds-to-india-banning-43-additional-chinese-apps.html">least 220 apps</a> with links to China in recent months, said on Tuesday it was banning an additional 43 Chinese apps, again citing cybersecurity concerns. Newly banned apps include short video service Snack Video, e-commerce app AliExpress, delivery app Lalamove, shopping app Taobao Live, business card reader CamCard, and <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1675335">others</a>. There are now no Chinese apps in the top 500 most-used apps in India, as a result. <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/india-bans-another-43-chinese-apps/">Read More.</a></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Supreme Court will hear <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/19-783.html&amp;=date=11-28-2020">arguments</a> on Monday in a case that could lead to sweeping changes to America&#8217;s controversial computer hacking laws — and affecting how millions use their computers and access online services.</p>
<p>The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was signed into federal law in 1986 and predates the modern internet as we know it, but governs to this day what constitutes hacking — or &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; access to a computer or network. The controversial law was designed to prosecute hackers, but has been dubbed as <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/12/worst-law-technology-strikes-again-2017-review">the &#8220;worst law&#8221;</a> in the technology law books by critics who say it&#8217;s outdated and vague language fails to protect good-faith hackers from finding and disclosing security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>At the center of the case is Nathan Van Buren, a former police sergeant in Georgia. Van Buren used his access to a police license plate database to search for an acquaintance in exchange for cash. Van Buren was caught, and prosecuted on two counts: accepting a kickback for accessing the police database, and violating the CFAA. The first conviction was overturned, but the CFAA conviction was upheld.</p>
<p>Van Buren may have been allowed to access the database by way of his police work, but whether he exceeded his access remains the key legal question.</p>
<p>Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/19-783.html&amp;=date=11-28-2020">Van Buren vs. United States</a> was an &#8220;ideal case&#8221; for the Supreme Court to take up. &#8220;The question couldn&#8217;t be presented more cleanly,&#8221; he argued <a href="https://reason.com/volokh/2020/04/15/is-the-supreme-court-about-to-take-its-first-big-cfaa-case/">in a blog post</a> in April.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court will try to clarify the decades-old law by deciding what the law means by &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; access. But that&#8217;s not a simple answer in itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Supreme Court&#8217;s opinion in this case could decide whether millions of ordinary Americans are committing a federal crime whenever they engage in computer activities that, while common, don&#8217;t comport with an online service or employer&#8217;s terms of use,&#8221; said Riana Pfefferkorn, associate director of surveillance and cybersecurity at Stanford University&#8217;s law school. (Pfefferkorn&#8217;s colleague Jeff Fisher is representing Van Buren at the Supreme Court.)</p>
<p>How the Supreme Court will determine what &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; means is anybody&#8217;s guess. The court could define unauthorized access anywhere from <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/07/court-violating-terms-service-not-crime-bypassing">violating a site&#8217;s terms of service</a> to logging into a system that a person has no user account for.</p>
<p>Pfefferkorn said a broad reading of the CFAA could criminalize anything from lying on a dating profile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/11/a-court-ruled-that-it-could-be-a-federal-crime-to-share-your-netflix-password/">sharing the password</a> to a streaming service, or using a work computer for personal use in violation of an employer&#8217;s policies.</p>
<p>But the Supreme Court&#8217;s eventual ruling could also have broad ramifications on good-faith hackers and security researchers, who purposefully break systems in order to make them more secure. Hackers and security researchers have for decades operated in a legal grey area because the law as written exposes their work to prosecution, even if the goal is to improve cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Tech companies have for years encouraged hackers to privately reach out with security bugs. In return, the companies fix their systems and pay the hackers for their work. <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/08/01/safe-harbor-for-security-bug-bounty-participants/">Mozilla</a>, <a href="https://dropbox.tech/security/protecting-security-researchers">Dropbox</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/teslas-new-bug-bounty-protects-hackers-and-your-warranty/">Tesla</a> are among the few companies that have gone a step further by promising not to sue good-faith hackers under the CFAA. Not all companies welcome the scrutiny and bucked the trend by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/talkspace-cease-desist/">threatening to sue researchers</a> over their findings, and in some cases <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chilling-effect-lawsuits-threaten-security-research-need-it-most/">actively launching legal action</a> to prevent unflattering headlines.</p>
<p>Security researchers are no stranger to legal threats, but a decision by the Supreme Court that rules against Van Buren could have a chilling effect on their work, and drive vulnerability disclosure underground.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there are potential criminal (and civil) consequences for violating a computerized system&#8217;s usage policy, that would empower the owners of such systems to prohibit bona fide security research and to silence researchers from disclosing any vulnerabilities they find in those systems,&#8221; said Pfefferkorn. &#8220;Even inadvertently coloring outside the lines of a set of bug bounty rules could expose a researcher to liability.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Court now has the chance to resolve the ambiguity over the law&#8217;s scope and make it safer for security researchers to do their badly-needed work by narrowly construing the CFAA,&#8221; said Pfefferkorn. &#8220;We can ill afford to scare off people who want to improve cybersecurity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Supreme Court will likely rule on the case later this year, or early next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>This is The TechCrunch Exchange, a newsletter that goes out on Saturdays, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">based on the column of the same name</a>. You can sign up for the email <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>.</em></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome to a special Thanksgiving edition of The Exchange. Today we will be brief. But not silent, as there is much to talk about.</p>
<p>Up top, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/is-slack-overpriced-now-that-the-market-knows-salesforce-might-buy-it/">noodled on the Slack-Salesforce deal here</a>, so please catch up if you missed that while eating pie for breakfast yesterday. And, sadly, I have no idea why Palantir is seeing its value skyrocket. Normally we’d discuss it, asking ourselves what its gains could mean for the lower tiers of private SaaS companies. But as its public market movement appears to be an artificial bump in value, we’ll just wait.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s what I want to talk about this fine Saturday: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-24/payments-startup-stripe-is-said-in-talks-to-raise-new-funding?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reporting</a> that Stripe is in the market for more money, at a price that could value the company at &#8220;more than $70 billion or significantly higher, at as much as $100 billion.”</p>
<p>Hot damn. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stripe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stripe">Stripe <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> would become the first or second most valuable startup in the world at those prices, depending on how you count. Startup is a weird word to use for a company worth that much, but as Stripe is still clinging to the private markets like some sort of liferaft, keeps raising external funds, and is presumably more focused on growth than profitability, it retains the hallmark qualities of a tech startup, so, sure, we can call it one.</p>
<p>Which is odd, because Stripe is a huge concern that could be worth twelve-figures, provided that gets that $100 billion price tag. It’s hard to come up with a good reason for why it’s still private, other than the fact that it can get away with it.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, are those reported, possible prices bonkers? Maybe. But there is some logic to them. Recall that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/square" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="square">Square <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paypal">PayPal <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> earnings <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/square-and-paypal-earnings-bring-good-and-bad-news-for-fintech-startups/">pointed to strong payments volume in recent quarters</a>, which bodes well for Stripe’s own recent growth. Also note that 14 months ago or so, Stripe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/business/stripe-valuation.html">was already processing</a> “hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions a year.”</p>
<p>You can do fun math at this juncture. Let’s say Stripe&#8217;s processing volume was $200 billion last September, and $400 billion today, thinking of the number as an annualized metric. Stripe charges 2.9% plus $0.30 for a transaction, so let’s call it 3% for the sake of simplicity and being conservative. That math shakes out to a run rate of $12 billion.</p>
<p>Now, the company’s actual numbers could be closer to $100 billion, $150 billion and $4.5 billion, right? And Stripe won’t have the same gross margins as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>But you can start to see why Stripe’s new rumored prices aren&#8217;t 100% wild. You can make the multiples work if you are a believer in the company’s growth story. And helping the argument are its public comps. Square’s stock has more than tripled this year. PayPal’s value has more than doubled. Adyen’s shares have almost doubled. That’s the sort of public market pull that can really help a super-late-stage startup looking to raise new capital and secure an aggressive price.</p>
<p>To wrap, Stripe’s possible new valuation could make some sense. The fact that it is still a private company does not.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mental health-focused startup <a href="https://seshtherapy.com/">Sesh</a> raised money this week from Polaris Partners. The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/">spent a bit of time on the topic recently</a>, so the funding event caught our eye.</li>
<li>Here are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">three more $100 million ARR companies</a>, and a call for startups reaching $50 million ARR.</li>
<li>Man, <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1331850788256182272">what is up at Coinbase</a>?</li>
<li>Tiger’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/tiger-global-invests-in-india-unacademy-at-2-billion-valuation/">investment into Unacadamey also stood out</a>. Why? Mostly because edtech is hotter than the surface of the sun in 2020. Which is wild for a startup genre that previously was a bit more akin to the far apsis of Pluto as recently as last year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>
<p>And speaking of edtech, Equity’s <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a> and our intrepid producer <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris Gates</a> put together a special ep on the education technology market. You can listen to it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/equity-dive-edtechs-2020-wakeup-call/">here</a>. It’s good.</p>
<p>Hugs and let’s both go do some cardio,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the past decade, celebrity interest and investment in tech companies has significantly increased. But not all celebrity investments are created equally. Some investors, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/ashton-kutchers-sound-ventures-targets-150m-for-third-fund/">Ashton Kutcher</a>, have prioritized the VC pursuits. Some have invested casually without getting overly involved. Others have used their considerable platforms to market their portfolio to varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a little over a year since <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ryan-reynolds" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ryan-reynolds">Ryan Reynolds <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> bought a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/in-wake-of-sprint-t-mobile-deal-ryan-reynolds-has-an-announcement/">majority stake</a> in Mint Mobile, a deal that has already had a dramatic impact on the the MVNO (mobile virtual network operator).</p>
<p>The four-year-old company has seen a tremendous amount of growth, boosting revenue nearly 50,000% in the past three years. However, the D2C wireless carrier has seen its highest traffic days on the backs of Reynolds&#8217; marketing initiatives and announcements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There is a long history of celebrities getting involved with brands, either as brand ambassadors or &#8216;Creative Directors&#8217; without much value other than the initial press wave.</p>
<p>Lenovo famously hired <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/9/6953207/lenovo-ashton-kutcher-yoga-tablet-2-pro-price-release-date">Ashton Kutcher as a product engineer</a> to help develop the Yoga 2 tablet, on which I assume you are all reading this post. Alicia Keys was brought on as BlackBerry&#8217;s Global Creative Director, which felt even more convoluted a partnership than <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1714843/how-lady-gaga-designed-polaroids-grey-label-camera-glasses-pics-video">Lady Gaga&#8217;s stint as Polaroid&#8217;s Creative Director</a>. That&#8217;s not to say that these publicity stunts necessarily hurt the brands or the products <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/11/3977958/blackberry-creative-director-alicia-keys-tweeting-iphone-hacked">(most of the time)</a>, but they probably didn&#8217;t help much, and likely cost a fortune.</p>
<p>And then there are the actual financial investments, in areas where celebrities fundamentally understand the industry, that still didn&#8217;t get to &#8216;alpha.&#8217;</p>
<p>Even Jay-Z has struggled to make a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/26/amazon-is-prepping-a-high-fidelity-tidal-competitor/">music streaming service</a> successful. Justin Bieber never really got a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/30/13459412/shots-app-justin-bieber-rudy-mancuso-lele-pons">selfie app</a> off the ground. Heck, not even Justin Timberlake could <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/434685-myspace-lost-12-years-of-music-and-pictures-in-server-migration">breathe life back into MySpace</a>. Reynolds seemingly has an even heavier lift here. It&#8217;s hard to imagine a string of words in the English language less sexy than, &#8220;mobile virtual network operator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reynolds tells TechCrunch that he viewed celebrity investments as a kind of &#8220;handicapping,&#8221; prior to the Mint acquisition.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just sort of seen how most celebrities are doing very, very well,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;We&#8217;re generally hocking or getting behind or investing in luxury and aspirational items and projects. Then George and I had a conversation about a year-and-a-half ago, maybe longer, about what if we swerved the other way? What if he kind of got into something that was hyper practical and just forget about the sexy aspirational stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mint isn&#8217;t Reynolds&#8217; first entrepreneurial venture. He bought a majority stake in Portland-based Aviation Gin in 2018, which recently sold for $610 million. He also cofounded marketing agency Maximum Effort alongside George Dewey, which has made its own impact over the past several years.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sIJfsWPH7j"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/in-wake-of-sprint-t-mobile-deal-ryan-reynolds-has-an-announcement/">In wake of Sprint/T-Mobile deal, Ryan Reynolds has an announcement</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In wake of Sprint/T-Mobile deal, Ryan Reynolds has an announcement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/in-wake-of-sprint-t-mobile-deal-ryan-reynolds-has-an-announcement/embed/#?secret=sIJfsWPH7j" data-secret="sIJfsWPH7j" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Maximum Effort was founded to help promote the actor&#8217;s first <em>Deadpool</em> film. Reynolds and Dewey had come up with several low-budget spots to get people excited about an R-rated comic book movie. The bid appears to have worked. The film raked in $783.1 million at the box office &#8212; a record for an R-rated film that held until the 2019 release of <em>Joker</em>.</p>
<p>Maximum Effort (and Reynolds) was also behind the viral Aviation Gin spot, which poked fun at the manipulative Peloton ad that aired last year around the holidays. The same actress who portrayed a woman seemingly tortured by her holiday gift of a Peloton sits at a bar with her friends, shell-shocked, sipping a Martini.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2t7lknrK28?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2t7lknrK28">original ad on YouTube</a>, not counting recirculation by the media, has more than 7 million hits. Reynolds calls it &#8216;fast-vertising&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We get to react,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;We get to acknowledge and play with the cultural landscape in real time and react to it in real time. There isn&#8217;t any red tape to come through, because it&#8217;s just a matter of signing off on the approval. So in a way, it&#8217;s unfair, in that sense, because most big corporations, they take weeks and weeks or months to get something approved. Our budgets are down and dirty, fast and cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>He explained that this type of real-time marketing is only possible because he&#8217;s the owner of Maximum Effort (and in some cases of the client businesses, as well), but because there is no red tape to cut through when a great idea presents itself.</p>
<p>Reynolds has brought this marketing acumen to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mint-mobile" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mint-mobile">Mint Mobile <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in a big way. Last year during the Super Bowl, Reynolds took out a full page ad in <em>The New York Times</em>, explaining that the decision to spend $125,000 on a print ad instead of $5 million+ on a Super Bowl commercial would enable the prepaid carrier to pass the savings on to consumers.</p>
<p>In October, Reynolds spun Mint&#8217;s 5G launch into another light-hearted spot. He brought on the head of mobile technology to explain what 5G actually is, and after hearing the technical explanation, happily said &#8220;We may never know, so we&#8217;ll just give it away for free.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFW9_mboFQo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Mint also released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRV-5EBErEc">a holiday ad</a> just a couple of weeks ago warning of wireless promo season, wherein large wireless carriers may try to lure customers into expensive contracts using new devices. Standing over a bear trap, Reynolds dryly states: &#8220;At Mint Mobile, we don&#8217;t hate you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reynolds enjoys nearly <a href="https://twitter.com/VancityReynolds">17 million Twitter followers</a> and more than <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vancityreynolds/">36 million Instagram followers</a>. He uses both platforms to promote his various brands without alienating his followers. Moreover, he doesn&#8217;t <em>exclusively</em> promote his brands on social media, but weaves in his own funny personal commentary or gives followers a peek into his marriage with Blake Lively, which we can all agree is #relationshipgoals.</p>
<p>Mint Mobile partners exclusively with T-Mobile to provide service, and unlike some other MVNOs, it uses a direct-to-consumer model, foregoing any physical footprint. Plans start at $15/month and top out at $30/month. CMO Aron North says that Reynolds&#8217; ownership and involvement with Mint Mobile is &#8220;absolutely critical.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ryan is an A plus plus celebrity, and he&#8217;s very funny and entertaining and engaging,&#8221; said North. &#8220;His reach has given us a much bigger platform to speak on. I would say he is absolutely critical in our success and our growth.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SfpUM5Wrh2A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>We asked Reynolds if he has any specific plans for further tech investment, or if there are any trends he&#8217;s keeping an eye on. He explained that his motivations are not purely capitalistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really focused on community and bringing people together,&#8221; said Reynolds. &#8220;We think it&#8217;s super cool to bring people together, particularly in a world that is very divisive. Even in our marketing, we try to find ways to have huge cultural moments without polarizing people without dividing people without saying one thing is wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>In one of the company&#8217;s more notable recent spots, Reynolds enlisted the help of iconic comedian, Rick Moranis. It was an impressive coup, given the actor&#8217;s seeming retreat from the public eye, turning down two separate Ghostbusters film reboots.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s funny what happens when you just ask,&#8221; says Reynolds. &#8220;I explained that people genuinely miss him and his performances and his energy. And he, for whatever reason, said yes, and the next thing I know, six days later, we were out of there in 15, 20 minutes and we shot our spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, it didn&#8217;t escape the internet&#8217;s notice that two well-known Canadian actors were standing in a field, selling a U.S.-only wireless service.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would love to see [Mint] in Canada,&#8221; Reynolds says. &#8220;There’s a Big Three here that’s challenging to crack. I don’t pretend to know the telecom business well enough to say why, how or what the path forward would be there. I see basically a tsunami of feedback from Canada, asking ‘why can’t we have this here?’ I think it’s sexy. It’s pragmatic and sexy. That’s why I got involved with it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might think that a new <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="netflix">Netflix <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> film called &#8220;Holidate&#8221; offers holiday-themed romance that&#8217;s perfect for a family watch party. You&#8217;d be wrong.</p>
<p>The film stars Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey as a pair of strangers who agree (in classic romantic comedy style) to keep each other company on holidays.</p>
<p>And while the movie can&#8217;t be completely pigeonholed as a raunchy comedy — it also includes a dash of metatextual commentary, with a healthy dose of undiluted romantic schmaltz — &#8220;Holidate&#8221; is certainly filled with sexually frank dialogue, and a couple of its biggest set pieces go all-in on gross-out humor. So, and as one of the hosts of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a> discovered, watching it with your family can be extremely uncomfortable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But, assuming you avoid that awkwardness, is it actually funny? Sometimes! A word that comes up repeatedly in our review is &#8220;adequate&#8221; — Darrell embraced the film&#8217;s surprisingly dirty humor, while Anthony and Jordan were at least mildly entertained.</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing &#8220;Holidate,&#8221; we also discussed the implications of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/netflix-removes-chappelles-show/">Netflix&#8217;s decision to remove &#8220;Chappelle&#8217;s Show&#8221; at Dave Chappelle&#8217;s request</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/black-friday" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="black-friday">Black Friday <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; the day that launched 1,000 other shopping holidays &#8212; may have lost its place as the &#8220;start&#8221; of the Christmas shopping season by now (it gets <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/despite-pandemic-forecasts-predict-u-s-online-holiday-sales-increase-of-20-30-or-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bigger and earlier</a> with each passing year). But the day after Thanksgiving still pulls in a crowd of buyers looking for a bargain and remains a major bellwether for tracking how sales will progress in what is the most important period for the retail and commerce sector.</p>
<p>This year saw growth, but at the low end of the predicted range.</p>
<p>Adobe, which is <a href="https://www.adobe.com/special/retail-shopping-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following online sales in real-time</a> at 80 of the top 100 retailers in the U.S., covering some 100 million SKUs, said US consumers spent $9 billion online on Black Friday, up 21.6% on a year ago. Adobe had originally forecast sales of between $8.9 billion and $9.6 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The figure makes Black Friday (for now at least) the second-largest online spending day in US history (after 2019&#8217;s Cyber Monday).</p>
<p>Although growth was not as wild as some thought it might be, it still had a fillip from current circumstances. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, this year was <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/money/2020/11/27/black-friday-2020-shorter-lines-retailers-amid-covid-19/6436789002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">definitely slimmer</a> when it came to actual, in-person crowds &#8212; kind of a refreshing break from those times when you feel like it&#8217;s the worst of humanity when people are breaking out into fights over TVs at a local Walmart.</p>
<p>Smartphones continued to account for an increasing proportion of online sales, with this year&#8217;s $3.6 billion up 25.3%, while alternative deliveries &#8212; a sign of the e-commerce space maturing &#8212; also continued to grow, with in-store and curbside pickup up 52% on 2019.</p>
<p>Adobe predicts Cyber Monday 2020 will see spending of between $10.8 billion and $12.7 billion.</p>
<p>For some context, in 2019, Adobe tracked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/30/black-friday-sees-record-7-4b-in-online-sales-2-9b-spent-using-smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$7.4 billion in online sales</a>, and yesterday it said that shoppers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/thanksgiving-on-track-for-a-record-6b-in-us-online-sales-says-adobe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spent $5.1 billion on Thanksgiving</a>, with more than $3 billion spent online each day in the week leading up to Thursday.</p>
<p>Its analysts said evening would be big for online shopping &#8212; which makes sense since people might have been either going out in person during the day, or just doing something else on a day off.</p>
<p>Not all are in agreement that night time is the right time, however. Figures from Shopify &#8212; which analyses activity from the 1 million-plus merchants that use its e-commerce platform &#8212; said that the peak shopping hour on its platform was actually 9am Eastern, when there were as many as $3 million in sales per minute. The average cart size for US shoppers was $95.60, it added.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Shopify&#8217;s per-minute sales number underscores how the long tail of merchants are still quite a ways behind the very biggest: Adobe noted that its figures, across the sites that it tracks (which have at least $1 billion in annual sales) tally to $6.3 million spent per minute on Black Friday.</p>
<p>In either case, smartphones continue to be a major driver of how sales get made. Adobe said 40% of all sales were on handsets, lower than the day before but 7% higher than in 2019.</p>
<p>And just as it was yesterday, it seems that smaller retailers are attracting more shoppers on mobile: Shopify said that some 70% of its sales are being made via smartphones.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see how all of that plays out later today also with the initial figures from &#8220;Small Business Saturday&#8221;, which is the latest of the shopping designations added to the holiday weekend, this one trying to hone focus more squarely away from major chains and big box merchants.</p>
<p>One big takeaway from the bigger weekend figures will be that offering items &#8212; electronics, tech, toys and sports goods being the most popular categories &#8212; at the right price will help retailers continue to bring in sales, in what has proven to be an especially strong year for online shopping. Many have opted to stay away from crowded places due to the pandemic, and it has also been a critical year for retailers because of the drag that the pandemic has had on the wider economy.</p>
<p>Cyber Monday is likely to continue to be the biggest of them all, expected to bring in between $11.2 billion and $13 billion in e-commerce transactions, up 19%-38% year-on-year.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the shift to more online shopping, and the concern over flagging sales, it&#8217;s interesting that &#8220;holiday season&#8221; has also been extended and now comes earlier. Adobe said a survey of consumers found that 41% said they would start shopping earlier this year than previous years due to much earlier discounts. Recall too that Amazon&#8217;s Prime Day was delayed to start in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/amazons-prime-day-mega-sale-event-will-take-place-october-13-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October this year</a>, an &#8216;event&#8217; that many treated as a moment to get a jump start on holiday shopping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Friday is headed for record-breaking levels as consumers flock online to shop for both holiday gifts and necessities,&#8221; said Taylor Schreiner, director, Adobe Digital Insights. &#8220;Concurrently, it’s also worth noting that this year, we’re seeing strong online sales momentum across not only the major shopping days like Thanksgiving weekend, but throughout the holiday season as consumers spread out their shopping across several weeks in reaction to continued, heavy discounting from retailers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tony Hsieh, the former head of Zappos who catapulted the shoe company into the big leagues with a sale to Amazon and then used the proceeds of his success in a huge project kickstarting regeneration of a run-down part of Las Vegas, Nevada, with tech and wider business investments, has died at the age of 46.</p>
<p>The cause was injuries he sustained from a house fire, a spokesperson for Hsieh confirmed to TechCrunch. He was with his brother in Connecticut at the time of the fire. It&#8217;s not clear if anyone else was injured.</p>
<p>The ultimate cause of Hsieh&#8217;s death is still under investigation. We will update this as and if we learn more. The full statement from DTP Companies, which ran the Downtown Project (Hsieh&#8217;s mammoth initiative to regenerate the very run-down, older part of Las Vegas) is below.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news has sent shock waves in the midst of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, and through a community in a city &#8212; heavily dependent on tourism &#8212; that has been hit extraordinarily hard by the Covid-19 global health pandemic.</p>
<p>Hsieh was a brilliant, offbeat, and &#8212; to many people, often very directly &#8212; kind-hearted person who was regularly described as a visionary.</p>
<p>That was not an overstatement. Growing up in the Bay Area, he sold his first company &#8212; a marketing tech firm called LinkExchange &#8212; to Microsoft when he was just 24, in 1998.</p>
<p>Using some of the proceeds from that, he formed a venture capital firm called Venture Frogs. One of his early investments there was ShoeSite.com, founded in 1999 by Nick Swinmurn at a time when the latter could see a shift happening in how people were shopping for footwear, doing a lot more of it online.</p>
<p>Hsieh was entrepreneurial in his investing instincts and subsequently took a more hands-on role in the startup, which eventually rebranded to Zappos. As Zappos&#8217; CEO, Hsieh moved the company from the Bay Area to the outskirts of Vegas in 2004 to build out a bigger customer service operation, run under a particularly strong ethos of flat management aimed at empowering and inspiring employees. His leadership helped catapult it to huge growth: by 2009 he had sold Zappos to Amazon for around $1.2 billion (a truly giant sum for an e-commerce startup at the time).</p>
<p>He then continued to run the company, and used the proceeds of that work to focus on his next big project: urban regeneration.</p>
<p>Las Vegas is a city that leaves little to sentimentality. Situated in the middle of the desert, the city&#8217;s relentless focus has long been on growth, breaking new, seemingly limitless, ground to do so. For years, that meant huge swathes of &#8220;older&#8221; Vegas enterprises, in the Downtown region, simply sat empty, leading to the larger area eventually becoming a hotbed of crime and poverty. As with many other urban centers, it has been a vicious cycle: people focus on building newer homes and businesses elsewhere, and that makes the older areas even more neglected and vulnerable.</p>
<p>Hsieh saw the charm of Downtown, full of 20th-century modernist flourishes underneath its more obvious signs of decline, and proceeded to buy up huge chunks of the area: apartment buildings, houses, small business structures, old casinos and hotels, and empty lots.</p>
<p>His vision was not just to be a real estate magnate &#8212; although that is clearly something that interested him, too &#8212; but to regenerate Vegas in the mold of what he knew best: tech.</p>
<p>He proceeded to invest in a huge run of startups, provided they move to Vegas to build their businesses Downtown, to bring entrepreneurs and jobs to the area.</p>
<p>There were lots of quirky elements to the effort: it was not all about hard-nosed business, and some of it was just about trying to have fun on a grand scale. Inspired by Burning Man, for example, Hsieh paid to have several of the structures built for the festival in the desert to be transported and installed permanently in the Downtown area.</p>
<p>A couple of memorable evenings I spent with him in Vegas really underscored to me his profile in the city.</p>
<p>Hopping from casino to bar to restaurant, one night we ended up in an excellent piano karaoke dive where his best friend from childhood and I sang Duran Duran duets and he knocked back Frenet Brancas. People flocked around him wherever he went (so many breathless &#8220;Hi, Tony&#8221;&#8216;s from many women we walked past). I remember wondering if this was what being a mafia boss (with his friend playing the role of a consigliere, and me a visiting guest for the night) was like back in the day.</p>
<p>Of course, the Downtown Project, as it came to be called, was a grand vision, and like many grand visions, it has had its ups and downs.</p>
<p>Some of that is unsurprising: Simply willing something to exist isn&#8217;t always enough, and the strike rate for success in tech is, in reality, very low.</p>
<p>And the offbeat approach didn&#8217;t always play in the best way, and sometimes obscured what might actually be going on. Case in point: Hsieh abruptly stepped down as CEO of Zappos earlier this year, with no explanation provided for the move, after being in the role for 21 years.</p>
<p>Still, between Zappos and what Hsieh built in the city, his work and bigger ideas were and are an important testament to the impact that the tech industry, including tech money, can have with a little imagination and a lot of hard work and persistence.</p>
<p>Our condolences go out to his family and his many friends, and also those in the slice of the tech and business world he helped to create.</p>
<p>Statement from DTP below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good Afternoon, my name is Megan Fazio and I handle&nbsp;public relations for DTP Companies, formerly known as Downtown Project, which Tony Hsieh serves as the visionary of. With a heavy and devastated heart, we regret to inform you that Tony Hsieh passed away peacefully on November 27, 2020 surrounded by his beloved family.</p>
<p class="p1">Tony’s kindness and generosity touched the lives of everyone around him, and forever brightened the world. Delivering happiness was always his mantra, so instead of mourning his transition, we ask you to join us in celebrating his life.</p>
<p class="p1">On behalf of all DTP Companies employees and staff, we would like to express our deepest condolences to Tony’s family and friends who have all lost Tony as a cherished loved one, visionary and friend. Tony was highly regarded by all of his fellow friends and colleagues in the tight-knit family at DTP Companies, so this heartbreaking tragedy is one that affects many involved.</p>
<p class="p1">We ask that you continue to respect the family’s privacy during this most difficult and challenging time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to a report from the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cfe4ca11-139a-4d4e-8a65-b3be3a0166be">Financial Times</a>, Facebook-backed cryptocurrency Libra could launch in January. More interestingly, the Libra Association, the consortium created by Facebook, could scale back its ambitions once again.</p>
<p>When it was first unveiled, the Libra cryptocurrency was supposed to be a brand new currency tied to a basket of fiat currencies and securities. Originally, it wouldn’t be based on a single real world currency, but on a mix of multiple currencies.</p>
<p>Many central banks and regulators have been concerned about this vision. That’s why the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/libra-association" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="libra-association">Libra Association <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/facebook-backed-association-revamps-libra-following-regulatory-concerns/">changed course</a> and started working on several single-currency stablecoins.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5kHmUWgU5q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/facebook-backed-association-revamps-libra-following-regulatory-concerns/">Facebook-backed association revamps Libra following regulatory concerns</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook-backed association revamps Libra following regulatory concerns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/facebook-backed-association-revamps-libra-following-regulatory-concerns/embed/#?secret=5kHmUWgU5q" data-secret="5kHmUWgU5q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that don’t fluctuate in value against a specific fiat currency. For instance, one unit of a USD-backed stablecoin is always worth one dollar. Libra mentioned USD, EUR, GBP or SGD as base currencies for its various stablecoins.</p>
<p>According to the Financial Times, the Libra Association now plans to launch a single dollar-backed coin. It’ll compete directly with other stablecoins, such as USDC, PAX and Tether (USDT). The Libra Association still plans to roll out other currencies, but it’ll happen at a later time.</p>
<p>Facebook will most likely launch its own Libra wallet at the same time. Originally called Calibra, the Facebook subsidiary has been rebranded to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/">Novi</a> back in May.</p>
<p>In addition to a standalone app that will let you send and receive Libra tokens, you’ll be able to manage your Novi account from Messenger and WhatsApp. Facebook expects people to start using Novi for remittance purposes and peer-to-peer payments.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether other members of the Libra Association also plan to launch their own Libra-based service at the same time. Members include Farfetch, Lyft, Shopify, Spotify and Uber.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ride-hailing firms such as <a href="https://www.olacabs.com/">Ola</a> and <a href="http://uber.com">Uber</a> can only draw a fee of up to 20% on ride fares in India, New Delhi said in guidelines on Friday, a new setback for the SoftBank-backed firms already struggling to improve their finances in the key overseas market.</p>
<p>The guidelines, which for the first time bring modern-age app-based ride-hailing firms under a regulatory framework in the country, also put a cap on the so-called surge pricing, the fare <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Ola charge during hours when their services see peak demands.</p>
<p>According to the guidelines, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ola" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ola">Ola <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Uber &#8212; and any other app-operated, ride-hailing firm &#8212; can charge a maximum of 1.5 times of the base fare. They can, however, choose to offer their services at 50% of the base fare as well. The rules also state that drivers will not be permitted to work for more than 12 hours in a day, and that the companies need to provide them insurance cover.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Uber and Ola have not previously publicly shared precisely how much they charge their drivers for each ride, but industry estimates show that a driver partner with either of these firms makes up to 74% of the ride fare, after paying taxes. The new guidelines say drivers should get to keep at least 80% of fares.</p>
<p>The cap on the ride fare and implied insurance costs will raise operating costs in India for Uber and Ola, both of which have eliminated jobs in recent months amid the pandemic to trim costs. The South Asian nation, which has attracted many giant international firms in recent years as they look for their next growth market, in the meantime has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-27/india-enters-recession-with-back-to-back-contraction-in-gdp">entered an unprecedented recession</a>.</p>
<p>But not everything about the guidelines will hurt Uber and Ola, both of which had no comment to share on Friday. The rules will enable the companies to offer pooling (shared car) services on private cars, though there is a daily limit of four intra-city rides on such cars, and two weekly inter-city rides.</p>
<p>Ujjwal Chaudhry, an associate partner at Bangalore-based marketing research consulting firm Redseer, said the guidelines by the government will have a mixed impact.</p>
<p>“While it is positive in terms of formalizing the sector as well as increasing the consumer trust on aggregators through improved safety regulations. But, overall the impact of these guidelines on the ecosystem growth are negative as capping surge and platform fee will ultimately lead to reduced earnings for 5 Lac (500,000) drivers (currently on these platforms) and will also lead to increased prices and higher wait times for the 6-8 crore (60 to 80 million) consumers who use it for their mobility and commute needs,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The rules also address a range of other factors surrounding a ride. For instance, under no circumstance can the cancellation fee imposed on a rider or driver be more than 10% of the total fare, and the fee cannot exceed 100 Indian rupees, or $1.35. Also, female passengers looking for a pooled service will have the option to share the cab with only female passengers, the rules say. Cab aggregators are also required to establish a control room with round-the-clock operations.</p>
<p>Ola and Uber dominate the app-based ride-hailing market in India. Both the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/08/uber-claims-top-spot-in-indian-ride-hailing-market/">companies claim to lead the market</a>, though SoftBank, a common investor, said recently that Ola had a slight lead over Uber in India.</p>
