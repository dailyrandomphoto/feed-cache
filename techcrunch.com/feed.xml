										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global shipping and freight industry has never been more in the spotlight, as the pandemic and other disruptions have led to enormous supply chain bottlenecks. While trucking logistics company Flock Freight can’t solve the global supply chain crisis, it could help get goods to their destinations faster and with less waste.</p>
<p>Less than a year after it closed its Series C, the company has raised a $215 million Series D round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, making it the industry’s most recent unicorn at a valuation of more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>Flock Freight has developed a software-driven “shared truckload” service called FlockDirect &#8212; think of it as carpooling for shipping customers, letting them pool their goods and avoid terminals and hub transfers in the process. By using probability pricing algorithms, the company pools midsized freight from multiple shippers that are all heading in the same direction.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221053" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to the company, both customers and vehicle haulers benefit: customers by avoiding costs associated with repeated loading and unloading, as well as paying for trailer space they don’t actually need; and haulers by filling their trucks to capacity. Flock Freight offers additional savings through its “prebate” program, an incremental cost-savings program for freight that is less than 40 feet and 36,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The savings aren’t just monetary. Flock Freight says its tech reduces carbon emissions &#8212; as much as 40% &#8212; compared to the traditional hub-and-spoke shipping system. The company estimates that it has eliminated more than 15,000 tons of emissions to date.</p>
<p>The six-year-old startup is also aiming to use the funds to expand its operations and to hire, especially in Chicago, where it will open a new office this year.</p>
<p>SoftBank was an early investor in Flock Freight, leading its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/softbank-volvo-back-flock-freight-with-113-5m-to-help-shippers-share-the-load/">$113.5 million Series C last year</a>. In addition to the Japanese firm, this latest round also saw participation from new minority investor Susquehanna Private Equity Investments, as well as Eden Global Partners. Existing investors SignalFire, GLP Capital Partners and Alphabet’s venture fund GV also participated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/amazon-news-app-now-has-free-local-news-coverage-in-158-cities-d7d56216ca72">announced</a> on Wednesday that its news app on Fire TV is expanding local coverage to 158 cities across the U.S. The app, which launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/amazon-is-rolling-out-a-news-aggregation-app-for-fire-tv-and-tablets/">last year</a>, is a customizable news aggregator preinstalled on all Fire TV streaming media players and smart TVs in the U.S. It initially rolled out in 12 cities and expanded to 88 cities earlier this year.</p>
<p>Today’s expansion includes cities like Charleston, Wichita, Tucson, Reno, Raleigh-Durham, Honolulu, and Lincoln, and doubles the local stations available from 126 to 259. Amazon notes that Fire TV will automatically detect your local news station when you open the app.</p>
<p>When users launch the app for the time, they can select the news that they’re most interested in. From there, a custom playlist will be generated based on your selections. You can access local news for your city using the “Local News” tab within the Amazon news app or by saying “Alexa, play local news.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221044" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Amazon notes that the local news channels that are launching today are in addition to the national news channels already available on the app, such as ABC News, Bloomberg TV+, Black News Channel, CBS News, CBS Sports HQ, Court TV, Estrella News, People TV, USA Today and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">Twilio bought Segment</a> last year for a hefty $3.2 billion, you knew it was going to put it to work. Today at the company&#8217;s Signal customer conference, it announced a new omni-channel marketing tool built on top of Segment called Twilio Engage.</p>
<p>Segment CEO Peter Reinhardt says the new tool is designed to take advantage of several pieces of the Twilio product family including Segment to create an entirely new cloud marketing technology (MarTech) tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re launching today is Twilio Engage, a brand new growth automation platform, built natively on Segment as the customer data platform (CDP) and natively on Twilio&#8217;s communications APIs,&#8221; he said. The goal of the new application is to help marketers to understand their customers better and provide a way to deliver more customized messaging.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220930" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It starts by taking advantage of Segment, gathering customer info from over 50 data sources. Next, the piece that really drives this tool is a new journey orchestration component, which lets marketers define a workflow for each set of customers. They can then write and deliver customized messages across the different communications channels including email and SMS, which is where Twilio&#8217;s core communications APIs come into play, and they can also connect to a variety of external tools.</p>
<p>These different communications components can be delivered in the form of customized text messages, emails or ads when the journey workflow meets certain conditions or encounters certain triggers. &#8220;You can create an entire campaign now, soup-to-nuts, with all the content, all the audience creation, all the targeting inside of Twilio Engage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As an example, say a sneaker company has a running app. Using Twilio Engage, they could set up a campaign that begins when a user logs 100 miles in the company&#8217;s app. That milestone could trigger an SMS text with a congratulatory message (using Twilio&#8217;s Communications API). If the individual is also an existing customer, the system could automatically send an email congratulating them on reaching their first goal and include a 20% off coupon. If the user was not a customer, the company could re-target them across different ad channels &#8212; Facebook, Snapchat, Google &#8212; with a similar discount and message.</p>

<p>Daniel Newman, founder and principal analyst at Futurum Research says that while the full plunge into MarTech is new, the company has had a foothold there with the CDP and its messaging platform, and he thinks it can leverage its developer community to make this move successfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the CDP and MarTech environments are highly competitive, I do believe that Twilio, and it’s loyal developer community will be attracted to the company’s expanded offering as the aspirational goals of understanding your customer&#8217;s [full] journey continues to be a complex, yet increasingly possible goal for marketers and revenue leaders,&#8221; Newman said.</p>
<p>It is clear that Twilio wants to expand its platform and revenue opportunities beyond the core communications APIs the company was built on. Reinhardt says that it became clear to him and Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson that the best use case for combining the two companies&#8217; tool sets involved marketing, and that&#8217;s why they are placing this bet.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spoke with customers, and as we looked at how folks were using the messaging API&#8217;s on Twilio and how folks were using the data on the Segment side, it was really obvious that on both sides the [biggest use case] is marketing. And there&#8217;s a lot that we could do to make that easier and better,&#8221; he said. That resulted in them building Twilio Engage.</p>
<p>It will be going into pilot with select customers today and is expected to be generally available in the first half of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Microsoft announced Windows 11, it didn&#8217;t mention anything about how it wanted to annoy users with a less functional taskbar, but it did talk quite a bit about how its new operating system would feature support for Android apps. It quickly became clear, though, that the first version, which went out only a few weeks ago, wouldn&#8217;t actually support Android apps. Now, however, Microsoft &#8212; in <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/appstore/post/fe7771ac-f2df-42be-ac51-eb7fe0df1b5b/amazon-and-microsoft-announce-next-steps-for-bringing-the-amazon-appstore-to-windows-customers">partnership with Amazon</a> and its app store &#8212; is bringing a small subset of about 50 Android apps <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/20/introducing-android-apps-on-windows-11-to-windows-insiders/">to the Windows 11 Insider Program</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on the beta build (not the dev build, because that&#8217;s on a different development cycle), you can now try apps like Amazon&#8217;s own Kindle app, The Washington Post app, Clash of Kings, Coin Master and Lego Duplo World.</p>
<p>All of this should work on AMD and Intel devices, with the apps running on what Microsoft calls the &#8216;Windows Subsystem for Android,&#8217; which itself is powered by Intel&#8217;s <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-tech-unleashes-windows-experience.html#gs.dldf2i">Intel Bridge Technology</a>. It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft is using the Linux Kernel and Android OS based on the open-source version of Android 11. With that, it gets virtually all of Android&#8217;s capabilities, but not some of the apps and additional functionality that Google brings to its Android build. Since that&#8217;s pretty much also what Amazon does, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that apps from the Amazon Appstore should work well on the Windows subsystem, too.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221003" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Your PC must have <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting#error-0x80370102-the-virtual-machine-could-not-be-started-because-a-required-feature-is-not-installed">virtualization enabled</a> and fulfill Microsoft&#8217;s overall requirements for running Windows 11, of course. You&#8217;ll also need an Amazon account to access the store.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221074" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221074" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2221074" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2221074" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Is any of this a game-changer? I don&#8217;t know. I have no issues reading the Washington Post on the web &#8212; and I think many parents would prefer it if their kids played Lego Duplo World on a cheap tablet anyway. If you play Clash of Kings or Coin Master, there are other questions you have to ask yourself first anyway.</p>
<p>Now if Microsoft would allow me to move my taskbar up to the top of the screen again, where it belongs, that would be nice, though.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has acquired London-based Sphere, which operates an eponymous chat app for groups, the latest in a series of recent moves from the social network as it looks to aggressively broaden and improve its product offerings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sphere.me">Sphere</a> &#8212; founded by Nick D’Aloisio, who previously founded news summary app Summly, which he famously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/17/summlys-nick-daloisio-on-yahoos-approach-to-ephemerality-and-its-startup-mentality/" target="_top" rel="noopener noreferrer">sold to Yahoo at the age of 17</a> for a <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130325/yahoo-paid-30-million-in-cash-for-18-months-of-young-summly-entrepreneurs-time/" target="_top" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> $30 million &#8212; did not disclose the financial details of the deal. The startup had reportedly raised <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/43a05ff4-45b0-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3">at least $30 million</a> &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/sphere/">$11.8 million in the first two rounds</a> that TechCrunch first reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much like others, we’ve been watching and admiring Twitter’s growing investment in community-building with the release of Communities, Spaces, and features that promote safety,&#8221; Sphere <a href="https://blog.sphere.me/sphere-has-joined-twitter-e7127cfe0467">said in a blog post</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221054" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we met the team, we were even more impressed by how seriously they are pursuing interest-based community and how much they believe in its potential impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sphere said as part of the move, it will be winding down the standalone app next month. The startup didn&#8217;t disclose the number of users or customers it had amassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s been a long and exciting journey to this point. Like many startups, Sphere started with a very different mission — to help anyone find and share knowledge instantly through the creation of a &#8216;global brain.&#8217; We originally built a marketplace of paid experts from all around the world, connecting them through group chat,&#8221; the startup said in the blog post.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we realised is that some of the most helpful and knowledgeable conversations came from groups where members felt a strong sense of belonging to one another. In other words, at the heart of our challenge was helping every single person find their community. The opportunity is massive.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Truly effective customer service is rooted in empathy, because it’s people who reach other people, and customers crave that kind of authenticity in their interactions with brands.</p>
<p>A customer service representative sets the tone for how a customer will perceive and engage with the company going forward. The more diverse your people are, the more they can relate to a diverse customer base.</p>
<p>Companies that not only embrace — but champion — grassroots diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are typically well positioned to deliver outstanding customer and employee experiences at every level and touch point. In order to do so, businesses must first focus on creating and preserving a happy, safe and healthy company culture that stems from nurturing a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Companies that deliver the best customer experiences tap into empathy powered by the human element.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When working to fine-tune company culture, start from the bottom up. Don’t first dictate what the company’s culture will be and then create programs or initiatives around it. Instead, connect with employees from diverse backgrounds with varied perspectives and priorities to learn what they think and what differences they want to make in the workplace and in their communities.</p>
<p>From there, create the support, forums and opportunities for them to put forward solutions. But remember, program leaders should be careful to not assume or try to educate the masses, as social matters are localized by community.</p>
<p>Outlined below are four key ways to help diversity, equity and inclusion take root as core elements of your company’s culture:</p>
<h2>Start with an inclusive onboarding process</h2>
<p>Regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, appearance or ability, customer service teams must be provided with the training and tools needed for their own success. Not every representative’s onboarding experience should look or feel the same. Accordingly, you should design programs that take into account individual learning styles, physical accommodations and cultural considerations.</p>
<p>Navigate each training experience so they are flexible and nimble to widen the talent pool as well as minimize stressors associated with onboarding. For example, deploy microlearning tactics where millennial and Gen Z employees can learn in short and visual video clips rather than through traditional manuals or lecture formats. Or provide screen readers for employees who are visually impaired and noise-cancelling headphones for those with hearing challenges.</p>
<p>Also set clear intentions on the front end to welcome and absorb employee feedback throughout their tenure. This could include regularly scheduled check-ins with each customer service rep at every phase — day 1, 30, 60, 90, etc. — alongside a “confidence meter” to gauge how they’re feeling about their progress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Entrepreneur<a href="https://twitter.com/ankurnagpal"> Ankur Nagpal</a> spent seven years building up Teachable, a marketplace for teachers to make their online courses into full-fledged businesses. He raised only $12.5 million in funding before selling to Hotmart, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/edtech-notches-a-win-as-teachable-is-acquired-by-hotmart/">a deal reportedly worth a quarter-of-a-billion dollars</a>. Now, Nagpal wants to use his experience as a founder to help other founders scale their businesses.</p>
<p>Amid a proliferation of emerging fund managers, Nagpal’s “big pitch” is that founders want to take advice from people who feel like peers, are on their level and work at their speed. In other words, entrepreneurs want investments from people who have good vibes.</p>
<p>This ethos in mind, Nagpal announced today the official launch of <a href="https://vibe.vc/">Vibe Capital</a>, a $60 million fund to back pre-seed and seed startup founders working across all sectors, but especially those working on physical and mental health. The fund will raise another $10 million post-launch, from community and other LPs via the AngelList platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220988" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Yes, there are too many funds, and yes everyone is trying to start a fund, but that does mean that it’s more likely now that founders will find investors they get along with and can really connect with,” Nagpal said. He likened the trend to what he saw happening within Teachable, where the rise of more teachers led to more students connecting with their instructors.</p>
<p>Vibe Capital thinks it can differentiate from the steady drumbeat of new emerging fund manager funds by going out of its way to back talented founders. Literally.</p>
<p>Nagpal says that Vibe Capital will make roughly half of its investments in emerging markets, because there is a shortage of operator solo GP funds focused outside of the United States. Among its first 10 investments in the fund, Vibe Capital has companies in Portugal, Kenya, Zambia, Canada, Pakistan, India and Chile.</p>
<p>The international angle is one that is personal to the entrepreneur. Nagpal is a first-generation American who has lived all over the world. He plans to move, for three to four weeks, to geographies in which he plans to invest: in December he’s spending a month in India, in January he’s spending two months in Latin America and in the spring, he’ll find a new place to live.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A key investment area of Vibe Capital will be in the world of proactive wellness, further proven by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/">rise of once-nascent hormonal health startups. </a></p>
<p>“Most healthcare dollars have traditionally been spent on sickness and when things go wrong. But we are entering a time where proactive wellness is finally coming of age,” Vibe Capital’s website reads. “We are extremely interested in businesses that proactively enable people to be their best physical and mental selves.”</p>
<p>Vibe is not Nagpal’s first foray into the world of investment. He debuted an <a href="https://twitter.com/ankurnagpal/status/1429783140961247232">$11.75 million fund</a> last spring before raising today’s chunk of cash. As the entrepreneur described in a Twitter thread, portfolio performance was well above expectations: 24 companies had a priced round mark-up, and another six had a substantial SAFE markup, leading to around 70% net internal rate of return (on paper).</p>
<p>Still, he admitted that he’s unsure how much of the growth is the portfolio, and how much is simply market conditions. The bizarreness of the market, and its impact on numbers, is a sentiment shared across any emerging fund manager operating today.</p>
<p>As a founder, Nagpal also joined <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spearhead-launches-100m-fourth-fund-to-transform-founders-into-top-notch-vc-investors/">Spearhead</a>, a program created by AngelList’s Naval Ravikant and Accomplice’s Jeff Fagnan to help promising founders become investors. The program gives founders between $200,000 and $1 million investable capital and sets them up with legal entities to invest. Now, Spearhead is an investor in his fund. It’s proof, in some ways, that emerging fund managers can raise more than a micro-fund, and actually create an institutionally backed investment vehicle.</p>
<p>Limited partners in Vibe Capital include Bessemer Venture Partners, Tribe Capital and Foundation Capital, as well as individuals including GSV Managing Partner Deborah Quazzo, Andresseen Horowitz’s Andrew Chen, Better Tomorrow Ventures’ Sheel Mohnot, Gumroad founder Sahil Lavinigia and Sounding Board’s Christine Tao.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Department of Commerce has announced that it will ban the export of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/hacking/">hacking</a> tools to authoritarian governments in an effort to curb violations of human rights and other malicious cyber activities.</p>
<p>The rule, first reported by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/commerce-department-announces-new-rule-aimed-at-stemming-sale-of-hacking-tools-to-repressive-governments/2021/10/20/ecb56428-311b-11ec-93e2-dba2c2c11851_story.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main">The Washington Post</a> and later confirmed by the <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/10/commerce-tightens-export-controls-items-used-surveillance-private">Commerce Department</a>, will effectively ban the export or resale of hacking software and equipment to China, Russia, and other countries of concern for national security reasons, without a license from the department&#8217;s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).</p>
<p>The move comes after the Biden administration in March restricted the export of U.S. technologies — including advanced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a> and software that uses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/encryption/">encryption</a> for information security — to China and Russia as it continues to take a hard-line national security approach towards the two countries.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220950" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latest sanctions are due to go into effect in 90 days and will cover software such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pegasus/">Pegasus</a>, spyware developed by Israeli firm NSO Group that several authoritarian governments have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/03/digital-violence-nso-group-spyware/">used to hack into the phones of their most vocal critics</a>, including journalists, activists, politicians and business executives.</p>
<p>Software intended for cyber defense purposes, on the other hand, is exempt from needing an export license, since the new rule won’t prevent U.S-based cybersecurity researchers from collaborating with colleagues overseas or disclosing flaws to software makers. When BIS first published a proposed rule in 2015, it received almost 300 comments that raised &#8220;substantial concerns&#8221; about the the impact it would have on legitimate cybersecurity research and incident response activities.</p>
<p>The rule brings the U.S. in line with the 42 European nations and allies that are members of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which sets voluntary export control policies on military and dual-use technologies.</p>
<p>“The United States is committed to working with our multilateral partners to deter the spread of certain technologies that can be used for malicious activities that threaten cybersecurity and human rights,” said Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo. “The Commerce Department’s interim final rule imposing export controls on certain cybersecurity items is an appropriately tailored approach that protects America’s national security against malicious cyber actors while ensuring legitimate cybersecurity activities.”</p>
<p>The Commerce Department — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">which last year become one of the first victims of the Russia-linked SolarWinds hack</a> — is giving the public 45 days to comment on the rule, and is seeking including comments on the potential cost of compliance and any impacts it could have on legitimate cybersecurity activities. The agency will have another 45 days to make changes before the rule becomes final.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what would be a blockbuster acquisition, PayPal is reportedly exploring the purchase of social media company Pinterest, according to </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/paypal-weighs-purchase-of-social-media-firm-pinterest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the publication, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Jose, California-based PayPal has “recently approached” Pinterest about a potential buyout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citing an anonymous source, Bloomberg said PayPal could pay around $70 a share, which would value Pinterest at about $39 billion.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221000" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest declined to comment on the report. PayPal had not responded to requests for comment as of press time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest’s stock jumped by about 12% on the news, trading at just above $62 by midday Wednesday. That’s still down from a 52-week-high of $89.90. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rumored purchase price would be in line with Pinterest’s current market cap of $40 billion. For its part, PayPal has a market cap of $308 billion.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve been on Twitter lately, you&#8217;ve probably seen the red flag meme that&#8217;s going around &#8212; you quote a phrase that would be a &#8220;red flag&#8221; for someone to say to you, then add a bunch of red flag emojis. <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1448007008670650370">Twitter itself</a> joined in on the fun, as well as brands like <a href="https://twitter.com/drpepper/status/1448324919008403464">Dr. Pepper</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MTV/status/1448307539368570884">MTV</a> and even the NFL&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/HoustonTexans/status/1448310174096179209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1448310174096179209%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Ftech%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2Fred-flag-meme-takes-over-tik-tok-twitter-facebook-instagram%2F8437407002%2F">Houston Texans</a>.</p>
<p>But for Blind and visually-impaired people that use screen readers and voiceover technology, the red flag meme doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Every time I saw that meme come up, I would have voiceover saying &#8216;triangular flag on a post,'&#8221; said Steve Saylor, a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/BlindGamerSteve">Blind Twitch gamer</a> and accessibility advocate. &#8220;That&#8217;s technically the description of the emoji, but it ruins the meme, because this is about the color of the flag.&#8221; iPhone&#8217;s voiceover will tell you the number of &#8220;triangular flag on post&#8221; emojis, rather than reading them one by one, but some screen readers do read out each individual emoji, which means you have to hear &#8220;triangular flag on post&#8221; 48 times unless you scroll down. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220259" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p class="p1">“Memes are quite important in communication, in terms of feeling included in the conversation and being able to respond when someone posts one,&#8221; said Amy Pavel, an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at Austin who researches tech accessibility. &#8220;So it&#8217;s important you understand the meaning of the meme in order to fully participate in the conversation.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://tejkohlifoundation.com/">Tej Kohli Foundation</a>, an India-based non-profit that treats blindness in poor and underserved communities, <a href="https://tejkohlifoundation.com/emoji-access/">analyzed 100,000 tweets</a> to learn more about how emojis are used online. From its dataset, 10% of tweets with emojis contain more than three emojis, and 40% of tweets with emojis repeat those emojis. In particular, the &#8220;face with tears of joy&#8221; emoji is repeated 93% of the time it&#8217;s used. The foundation recommends that people place emojis at the end of sentences, never use emojis to replace words (i.e. saying &#8220;it is very <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2600.png" alt="☀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> today&#8221; instead of &#8220;it is very sunny today&#8221;), and don&#8217;t use more than three emojis in repetition.</p>

<p>The red flag meme sparked conversations about meme accessibility last week, but this is far from the first time that a meme has made its rounds on social media despite being a nuisance for people using screen readers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/clap-emoji-%F0%9F%91%8F">clapping hands meme</a> can be really tedious to read. You have to have the clapping hands after each word, so it can be difficult to remember exactly what the full sentence was,&#8221; Pavel told TechCrunch. She also referenced a social trend where people use uncommon characters to simulate writing in a different font, as well as memes made from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art">ASCII art</a>, like the &#8220;<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/forums/meme-research/topics/52956-in-this-house-we-ascii-house-posts">in this house</a>&#8221; meme or &#8220;<a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6331753/sign-bunny-meme-explained">bunny holding a sign</a>&#8221; meme. &#8220;They sound completely nonsensical, because<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>it reads out every character and then some of those are Cyrillic characters, Greek characters or Kanji.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Pavel hopes that researchers and developers can look toward using artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify common tropes in digital communication, then explain them in simpler ways on a voiceover &#8212; instead of saying &#8220;clapping hands emoji&#8221; in between each word, for example, the screen reader could say the sentence, then note that there&#8217;s a clapping emoji in between each word. But this technology has a long way to go, so in the meantime, accessibility experts are working to educate people about how to make their memes more accessible, rather than <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2021/10/blaming-screen-readers-red-flag.html">waiting for technology</a> to catch up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I totally get the point of the meme, especially the whole red flag thing,&#8221; said Saylor. &#8220;I never want to stifle anyone&#8217;s creativity. I never want to say to anyone, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want you to use that meme.&#8217; But I just want people to think about, hey, if you want as many people as possible to enjoy the meme, make it accessible for those who need it, whether it&#8217;s adding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/facebook-and-instagrams-ai-generated-image-captions-now-offer-far-more-details/">alt text</a> for screen readers, or adding captions in videos.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the case of emoji-based memes and ASCII art memes, one workaround is to screenshot the meme, post it as a photo, and add alt text to describe the photo. On Twitter, adding alt text is relatively forward &#8212; after you upload an image, you can click an &#8220;add description&#8221; button beneath the image to add alt text before you send the Tweet. But on Instagram, on the screen before you post an image, you need to scroll down to the bottom to click a small &#8220;advanced settings&#8221; button. Then, you scroll down to &#8220;accessibility,&#8221; where you can click on a button that says &#8220;write alt text&#8221; to add an image description.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s just not enough knowledge and education out there for digital marketers and professional communicators &#8212; part of the issue is that we just don&#8217;t know about accessibility,&#8221; said Alexa Heinrich, a social media manager and accessibility advocate. &#8220;When marketers, content creators and everyday users make content, it would be helpful if they took a second to remember that not everyone experiences the internet the same way.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Heinrich and Saylor told TechCrunch that they found Twitter to be one of the more accessible social media platforms &#8212; but the bar isn&#8217;t high (somehow, Clubhouse still doesn&#8217;t have live captioning). Last summer, Twitter piloted an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/twitter-begins-rolling-out-audio-tweets-on-ios/">audio tweets</a> feature, but the clips didn&#8217;t have captions, making the tweets inaccessible to Deaf and hard of hearing users. When disabled people pointed out the massive oversight in rolling out an inaccessible feature, it was revealed that Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/somehow-twitter-does-not-have-a-team-dedicated-to-accessibility/">didn&#8217;t have</a> a dedicated accessibility team &#8212; rather, their accessibility efforts were coordinated on a volunteer basis by full-time employees with many other responsibilities. Since then, Twitter has established an accessibility team.</p>
<p class="p1">“Twitter is definitely the platforms that tries the hardest and is most transparent about its efforts with accessibility and the platform. They&#8217;re open to feedback, which is really great,&#8221; said Heinrich. Still, Twitter has since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/twitters-web-redesign-isnt-as-accessible-as-it-should-be-experts-say/">unveiled major updates</a> that hampered accessibility. “Platforms themselves need to do a better job of educating the brands and marketers that they partner with on how they can create accessible content,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p class="p1">According to app researcher Jane Manchun Wong, Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1440409247137746950">working on</a> a feature that lets users opt-in to pop-up notifications that would appear if they&#8217;re about to post an image without alt text. Twitter confirmed to TechCrunch that it&#8217;s working on this feature, and that it is expected to roll out by the end of the year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220447" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220447" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220447" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?w=680" alt="Two identical spidermans pointing at each other" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg 4096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220447" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spider-Man</p></div></p>
<p>But even when users know how to add alt text, it can be tricky to figure out the best way to describe an image, especially when it comes to memes. The Spider-Man pointing meme, for example, is straight-forward &#8212; Saylor said he would describe it as &#8220;two identical Spider-Man pointing at each other.&#8221; But how would you describe a meme like <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain">galaxy brain</a> or the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/5/15/17351806/is-this-a-pigeon-anime-butterfly-meme-explained">butterfly meme</a>?</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially in regard to memes, what really matters is what the subject is in context of the image itself. Sometimes, it&#8217;s a little more complicated, like in a photo or an animated GIF,&#8221; Saylor said. &#8220;But you don’t have to describe everything that’s in the photo &#8212; just enough information that gets the point across. In most cases, that extra information is completely superfluous to us. Describe what the subject is, what’s in the foreground, what the context of the photo is or why you’re posting that photo, and then that allows us to be short and to the point, so the screen readers can understand what the image is without having to listen to 1000 characters of the entire photo being described.”</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why, in Saylor&#8217;s description of the Spider-Man pointing meme, he doesn&#8217;t say that Spider-Man is standing on a blue floor, and that in the background, there&#8217;s an NYPD truck with an open door next to a red wall and some wooden boxes. We don&#8217;t need those details to understand the meme.</p>
<p>But accessibility isn&#8217;t one size fits all, and not all disabilities are the same. Even people with the same disability will have different preferences on how they want to experience the internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think each user knows best what they would prefer, especially for accessibility, because disability is a really individual experience,&#8221; Pavel said.</p>
<p>In October 2020, Pavel published a paper titled &#8220;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3373625.3417027">Making GIFs Accessible</a>.&#8221; In her research, she offered participants multiple ways to experience an animated GIF, surveying them about which way they preferred. Earlier that year, Twitter had added alt texts for GIFs.</p>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/JFau5y7m9pkEU" width="480" height="269" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">“I think GIFs are pretty interesting because oftentimes, a lot of them are taken from existing media that has audio. For instance, a great one is, Michael from &#8216;The Office,&#8217; yelling, &#8220;No, no, no&#8221;, and it gets longer and louder,&#8221; Pavel said. In her experiment, one version of alt text simply explained the animation in the same way one would write alt text for an image. Another iteration used the literal audio from &#8220;The Office.&#8221; The third option had a voiceover explain that this was a GIF of Michael from &#8220;The Office,&#8221; then played the audio where he screams &#8220;no, no, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The main sentiment we got back was like, &#8216;Yes, I want all of these, but I don&#8217;t want to have to pick one that&#8217;s there all the time,'&#8221; Pavel said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s all about giving the user the option to customize what they want their screen reader to do. They might want to change their settings depending on how interested they are in a GIF.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, experts say that the most immediate way to make content more accessible is for the general public to improve their own posting practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;People want to have the discussion of, &#8216;Oh, is it going to get as much engagement?'&#8221; said Heinrich. &#8220;But my answer is I don&#8217;t care. If it&#8217;s not accessible, then that&#8217;s what I care about. I care about the people, not the numbers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meditation hardware is a tricky thing. Anyone who’s been frustrated in the pursuit of mindfulness has no doubt longed for some way to short circuit &#8212; or, at very least, jumpstart &#8212; a practice. I quite liked the original Muse headband’s addition to the category &#8212; affording an almost gamified approach to focusing (trust me, it’s better than it sounds).</p>
<p>Introduced at CES 2020, the Muse S promised something even more fundamental: better sleep. When I wrote about it at the time, I was still in the very early days of testing it and, frankly, having trouble getting to sleep with a gadget on my head. I wondered aloud whether I would be able to keep it up (spoiler: I wasn’t). Today, the company is introducing a follow-up, the  simply named, Muse S (Gen. 2)</p>
<p>This time out, the product is about staying asleep as much as getting to sleep in the first place. As someone who has more trouble with the former than the latter, I can appreciate this. Certainly it’s been a theme for me during the pandemic &#8212; passing out early and waking up for a couple (or several) hours in the middle of the night. Part of me firmly believes that we weren’t <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/u-magazine/our-ancestors-probably-didn-t-get-eight-hours-of-sleep-a-night-either">wired to sleep through the night</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220924" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Muse notes that according to the CDC, more than one-third of U.S. adults don’t get seven hours of sleep a night &#8212; and honestly, that sounds low to me. The new Muse utilizes something called Digital Sleeping Pills &#8212; an odd choice of a name that uses the band’s EEG readings to deliver sleep content on waking, in an attempt to lull the wearer back to sleep. There are a number of choices there, including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Original, Classic, and Adventure Sleep Stories that have a voice narration of some of your favorite childhood stories &amp; a variety of new original stories</li>
<li>Ambient Sleep Soundscapes that offer soothing ambient music and harmonized sounds without a voice narrative</li>
<li>Biofeedback Sleep Soundscapes that offer nature sounds and music that respond to biofeedback without a voice narrative</li>
<li>Guided Sleep Meditations that have a meditation teacher guide you through a relaxing sleep meditation</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The content will also be coming to Gen 1 users via a software update. Beyond this, there are some slight tweaks to the new headband, including improved accuracy and better battery life. Pricing, I think is still a major obstacle here, at $400. I suspect plenty of people would be willing to give a sleep gadget a go at a fraction of that.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Countable is taking a cue from the positives of social media to build technology that nurtures more authentic communication and facilitates business and social outcomes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise engagement company <a href="https://www.countable.com/">Countable</a> raised $12 million in Series A funding so that brands can more easily engage with customers, even in a way that shows a brand’s values and stance on issues.</p>
<p>Existing investor Canaan Partners led the round and was joined by Ulysses Management and Global Catalyst Partners. In total, the company has raised about $16 million since the company was founded in 2014, Bart Myers, CEO of Countable, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In fact, the San Francisco-based company started out in solutions-based journalism, providing content around communities and people who wanted to drive outcomes. When Countable pivoted in 2017, Canaan Partners invested in the seed round and assisted the company’s transition into an enterprise SaaS organization.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220609" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“A lot of things are changing quickly with social media, which has become more toxic in some ways and less trustful about safety and security of its users, as well as taking away some of the controls that brands had to engage with their audience on their terms,” Myers said. “It used to be that you had free viral reach and traffic, but that has gone away, and it is now pay-for-play, which is not so good for reaching people organically.”</p>
<p>Instead, Countable is taking a cue from the positives of social media to build technology that nurtures more authentic communication and facilitates business and social outcomes. Myers considered it “like what Shopify did with the shopping cart, we are doing for community engagement.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RyhaQI4KMb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/how-engaged-are-your-employees/">How engaged are your employees?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How engaged are your employees?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/how-engaged-are-your-employees/embed/#?secret=RyhaQI4KMb" data-secret="RyhaQI4KMb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Here’s how it works: The company works with brands to establish the look of their site, including goals, timelines and feedback processes. After the site launches, brands can manage their audience of employees, consumers and partners. It can promote action items beyond a “like” button and leverage Countable’s “Causes” network of more than 190 million people.</p>
<p>The company then provides analytics to the brand on how the community is growing and insights on driving revenue, retention and innovation. On the community side, members can engage with the brand, even record video testimonials and attend events around the cause.</p>
<p>Countable has made over 120 “implementations” for brands like Starbucks, which uses it for employee engagement, Uber, Patagonia, Levi’s and PG&amp;E, which Myers said uses its site to provide tips and resources to homeowners and businesses on how to prepare for emergencies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We give brands a lot of power to drive engagement and measure efficacy,” he added. “They can ask for feedback or encourage their audience members to share content with friends and tie it to incentives for deployment.”</p>
<p>In the past year, the company grew its revenue by nearly 300%; annual recurring revenue increased 277%, and it has more than doubled its customer acquisition and site usage.</p>
<p>To continue to meet that growth and scale its business operations, Myers expects to deploy the new funding into product development, go-to-market, expanding internationally and third-party integrations. It is also serving as a launchpad for social token community exchange.</p>
<p>“Brands increasingly want to have conversations with customers, and doing more of that bears fruit everywhere,” he added. “If you have your own community, it opens doors in terms of incentivization, is a way to quantify value and give customers ways to invest more in this experience.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest has been trying to reposition its business as a home to creators, not just a shopping inspiration site. Today, the company revealed its latest efforts on this front, which include more Snapchat and TikTok-inspired features, including a vertical video feed and plans to invest $20 million in &#8220;Creator Rewards.&#8221; It&#8217;s also announcing a series of expanded creator tools, like the ability to respond to videos with &#8220;Takes,&#8221; support for Amazon Affiliates and more, as well as the launch of original content.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">earlier this year introduced Idea Pins</a>, a video-first feature aimed at creators which is something like a mix of both TikTok and Stories. These Pins allow Pinterest users to record and edit creative videos using tools similar to those you would find on other short-form video platforms &#8212; like background music, transitions and interactive elements. The Idea Pins can be up to 60 seconds in length, but unlike traditional short-form video, video can be just one part of what the Pin offers &#8212; it can also include up to 20 pages of content per Pin, which you tap through like in Stories. This could allow a creator to explain the various steps involved in recreating their recipe or DIY project, for example.</p>
<p>Now, Pinterest is giving its home page a redesign to better highlight these Pins in a more TikTok-like format. Users can choose to either &#8220;browse&#8221; or &#8220;watch&#8221; the Pins when looking for inspiration by selecting the associated tab on the home feed. The new Watch tab will launch users into a full-screen feed of Idea Pins which you scroll through vertically and can engage with, by leaving likes and comments, or by saving the Pin for later access. Though the experience of watching these video-enabled Pins feels a lot like browsing TikTok or Instagram Reels, you can still tap through to see more of the Pins&#8217; pages, as you would with Stories, when available.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220913" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>(You&#8217;ll know if the Pin has more pages as the bottom progress bar will be dashed, instead of showing you the video&#8217;s progress.)</p>
<p>Overall, the design of this Watch feed is very much TikTok-inspired, as it showcases full-screen videos and interaction buttons stacked vertically on the right. While Pinterest is varying the format a bit by offering support for additional pages, the resulting content feels very much like a Pinterest-fied TikTok feed.</p>
<p>However, one area where Pinterest could have an advantage is that it lets viewers save the Pin and organize it into your Pinterest Boards. TikTok, meanwhile, is very lacking in terms of saving and organizing the content you liked and want to refer back to, leading many users to download videos to their phone instead. This oversight on TikTok&#8217;s part could become a competitive advantage if not addressed, as many users want to save things like beauty tutorials, recipes, cleaning tips, decorating ideas and other content that overlaps with Pinterest.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220944" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220944" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220944" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png 1431w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220944" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest (Takes)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In another nod to TikTok &#8212; which allows creators to interact with each others&#8217; content through features like Duets and Stitches &#8212; Pinterest is also today introducing its own creator response feature called &#8220;Takes.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Takes, creators will be able to respond to someone else&#8217;s Idea Pin with one of their own, where the response is linked back to the original. Think: A creator could try someone&#8217;s recipe but then offer their own variation; they could attempt to replicate the project another creator suggested, and show their results; they could show off their Halloween costume ideas and invite responses. And so on.</p>
<p>To kick off &#8220;Takes,&#8221; Pinterest is pulling in celebs to participate, including Jennifer Lopez, Megan Thee Stallion and Storm Reid. (The company has before used celebs to promote its other creator-focused efforts, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/pinterest-announces-500k-creator-fund-creator-code-content-policy-moderation-tools-and-more/">including</a> Queer Eye&#8217;s Jonathan Van Ness, during a virtual creator event this year.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220940" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220940" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220940" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png 2550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220940" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, creators can add a new &#8220;Try On&#8221; sticker to their Idea Pins, which allows viewers to virtually try on lip products using augmented reality. This is a fairly common use of AR these days, as even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-now-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-using-ar-shop-from-influencer-videos/">Google</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/youtubes-new-ar-feature-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-while-watching-videos/">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.perfectcorp.com/business/services/virtual-makeup-snapchat">Snap</a> and other beauty apps and retailers have adopted the tech. Pinterest, which has offered lipstick try-on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/pinterest-launches-an-ar-powered-try-on-experience-for-eyeshadow/">since last year</a>, expanded to include eyeshadow try-on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/pinterest-launches-an-ar-powered-try-on-experience-for-eyeshadow/">in early 2021</a>. The new sticker will support more than 10,000 try-on enabled products, Pinterest says.</p>
<p>The company is also launching its own original content series, Creator Originals, featuring over 100 creators across 10 countries, which runs now through January 2022. The creators will teach Pinterest users new skills in areas like beauty, home décor, wellness, fashion, cooking and more. Participants include <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/priscillaono/_created/">Priscilla Ono</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/kellywearstler/_created/">Kelly Wearstler</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/allymisslove/_created/">Ally Love</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/ZerinaAkers/_created/">Zerina Akers</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/kahhspence/_saved/">Kahh Spence</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/joshuaweissman/_created/">Joshua Weissman</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/kiadamon/_created/">Kia Cooks</a>,<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/thematfinish/_created/"> Mat Sanders</a> and others.</p>
<p>Beyond the new product announcements, the bigger news is that Pinterest will now try to seed its network with more creator content by paying creators directly.</p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s launching a $20 million Creator Rewards fund in the U.S. &#8212; its first-ever in-product creator monetization program &#8212; that will pay creators for participating in its challenges issued by Pinterest. This is an expansion on Pinterest&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/pinterest-announces-500k-creator-fund-creator-code-content-policy-moderation-tools-and-more/"> April announcement of its $500,000 Creator Fund,</a> which offered U.S. creators compensation with funds for content creation and advertising credits.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220943" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220943" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220943" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png 1431w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220943" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest (creator rewards)</p></div></p>
<p>Access to Creator Rewards is available through the new &#8220;Creator Hub&#8221; on Pinterest, where creators can manage their Pinterest presence. The company says it will also offer &#8220;micro-grants&#8221; to fund various projects. This could include things like a community garden, a wellness program or a new beauty look, the company suggests.</p>
<p>Creators will have other ways to make money, too. U.S. creators will now be able to tag their Pins using the existing product tagging tool with links from their Amazon Associates program. (The program already offered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/pinterest-rolls-out-new-features-that-let-creators-make-money-from-pins/">support for affiliate programs</a> like Rakuten and ShopStyle as of this summer.)</p>
<p>And creators can now enable shopping recommendations powered by Pinterest&#8217;s visual search (its &#8220;shop similar&#8221; feature), which is being enabled for video for the first time &#8212; another attempt at catching up with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">TikTok and its e-commerce feature set. </a></p>
<p>Combined, the products indicate a Pinterest that&#8217;s very much trying to reinvent itself for the TikTok era, largely by copying TikTok features then adding its own twists. It would not be alone in doing so. TikTok, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58155103">most downloaded app worldwide</a>, has been fueling clones across top social media platforms including Instagram, YouTube, Snap, Reddit and others. But for Pinterest, it&#8217;s a particular threat, as many of TikTok&#8217;s best videos are those that are instructive or inspirational and then lead directly to purchases &#8212; basically, Pinterest&#8217;s entire business model. The company&#8217;s hope is to recapture creators&#8217; interest with these new tools, while also providing them with ways to actually monetize their following beyond virtual tipping or brand engagements.</p>
<p>Pinterest says its new features will roll out starting today on iOS, Android, and the web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sure, Facebook is apparently rebranding as a metaverse company &#8212; because <em>that</em> will fix its trust deficit &#8212; but this morning we&#8217;re jumping right back into the IPO game instead of making rude jokes at the social giant&#8217;s expense.</p>
<p>This time our target <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">is Backblaze</a>, which you may not be familiar with. Frankly, given how limited my knowledge of the storage-focused software company was before reading its IPO filing, I was almost ready to stick it in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> for the weekend.</p>
<p>But!</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>It turns out that there are a few twists to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001462056/000119312521301141/d62601ds1.htm#toc">the company&#8217;s filing</a> that make it really worth our time. So, we&#8217;re digging in.</p>
<p>Backblaze, based in San Mateo, California, has a very limited venture capital history. That&#8217;s because it has a track record of not losing money. Indeed, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/backblaze/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>, it only raised a handful of millions during its private life. The company confirmed that in its filing, stating that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our operations have historically been efficient with limited outside investment. Prior to issuing $10.0 million of convertible notes (which we also refer to as a Simple Agreement for Future Equity agreement (SAFE)) in a private financing round in August 2021, we had raised less than $3.0 million in outside equity since our founding in 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did anyone else mostly forget that you can build IPO-ready software companies without utter truckloads of external cash? Here&#8217;s a reminder.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Naturally, we&#8217;re going to figure out just how the company managed to grow to its current size without losing nine figures worth of venture money. And we&#8217;ll want to look at its gross margins.</p>
<p>Why? Because by offering storage, our presumption is that Backblaze has somewhat lackluster gross margins. But we could be wrong. Finally, we&#8217;ll pick up a topic we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/16/techcrunch-exchange-gitlabs-mega-ipo/">touched on last weekend</a>, namely specialty cloud infra providers and how they may stack up with the public cloud giants.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>How Backblaze grew to IPO scale without losing all of god&#8217;s money</h2>
<p>Backblaze has two main products, both of which sit atop its &#8220;storage cloud.&#8221; Or, as I like to think of it, a large bucket of online storage capacity. The company offers &#8220;B2 Cloud Storage,&#8221; a tool that includes API access for developers looking to back up information, mesh with third-party content delivery networks (CDNs), and the like. Its second product is called &#8220;Computer Backup.&#8221; It does what it says on the tin, for one computer or many.</p>
<p>For whom does Backblaze build? While the company claims that its &#8220;solutions are designed for individuals and businesses of all sizes and across all industries,&#8221; it does note a &#8220;particularly strong appeal to mid-market organizations,&#8221; or those with under 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>All of this matters because it frames our question: How did Backblaze grow to a greater than $60 million annual run rate (based on H1 2021 data; more on the matter shortly) without more venture dollars?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a hint:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220839" style="width: 367px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220839" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2220839 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-8.47.22-AM.png?w=357" alt="" width="357" height="79" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-8.47.22-AM.png 357w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-8.47.22-AM.png?resize=150,33 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-8.47.22-AM.png?resize=300,66 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-8.47.22-AM.png?resize=50,11 50w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220839" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Backblaze S-1 filing</p></div></p>
<p>When we were first reading the company&#8217;s S-1 filing, this statistic caught our eye and we laughed at it. <em>What a silly non-GAAP metric!</em> However, it turns out that online demand generation through native content is actually a huge lever for Backblaze, so, sure, the blog readers metric actually does matter.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The life of a startup founder is not typically relaxing. Long hours are a given and days off are few. Your startup is your baby, and it needs care and feeding 24/7.</p>
<p>So what happens when a pandemic forces office shutdowns and a move to remote work for everyone? Great things, as it turns out.</p>
<p>For several years, my partner and I &#8212; normally based in Paris &#8212; discussed living a more nomadic life, spending a few months in one city and then moving on to another. When we started talking about it, we both worked in jobs (customer support and software development, respectively) that could in theory be done from anywhere. Then I co-founded my company, and we put our plans for a nomadic life on hold.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220205" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We already had a small number of employees working remotely. But when we shut our Paris office and went fully remote in March 2020, some of our staff were in a bit of a panic.</p>
<p>But a funny thing happened on the way to our home offices: Productivity didn’t change at all.</p>
<p>Inbound sales requests skyrocketed &#8212; within just a couple of weeks of the pandemic being declared, our leads had increased by 10x. We were signing clients left and right. We even made dozens of new hires while completely remote, doubling the size of the company &#8212; we now have people working from 17 countries.</p>
<p>Once things stabilized &#8212; albeit at a new, faster pace &#8212; my partner broached the topic again. If we’re remote anyway, what’s the difference between being remote from down the street or in another country? She had a point. Either way, we’re not in the office. It’s not as if I would be the only person working remotely &#8212; we all were.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We worked together to come up with some criteria. First, any location we chose had to be no more than a time zone or two outside of Paris, to make communication with the office smoother. Second, any apartment we rented had to have reliable, high-speed internet and two separate workspaces or nearby space, like a café or coworking space, since we’d both be working remotely. Third, I would need to travel back to Paris every four to six weeks, primarily to reduce my anxiety about being away.</p>
<p>We started off with a one-month trip to Iceland, where we worked from an Airbnb with a beautiful view of the mountains. We kept the same hours as we did before and did meetings via video conferences, the same way we did in Paris.</p>
<p>The only difference is when we were able to take a break from work, we used our time to explore and have new experiences. I remember speaking to one of our investors from Iceland, and he remarked on the view in my background &#8212; he didn’t realize I wasn’t in Paris and didn’t mind at all. He said that as long as the company was growing &#8212; and it was &#8212; he didn’t care where my desk was located.</p>
<p>The trip went so well that we decided to do this for a year. After a quick reset in Paris, we moved on to Barcelona for two months and then Greece. As I write this, I’m in Paris for a week and then we leave for Amsterdam. Next on our itinerary are trips to Scotland, Sweden and Norway.</p>
<p>We don’t consider ourselves on vacation &#8212; both my partner and I are still working fairly intense hours. We make the most of our off time but are primarily focused on work.</p>
<p>Here’s my advice if you decide to do this yourself:</p>
<p>Consider staying in a similar time zone to your usual office to make your travel less disruptive for others. You don’t want everyone to have to reschedule regular calls and video meetings, for instance.</p>
<p>Check and double-check the internet quality of every destination. We have stayed primarily at Airbnbs — I not only asked hosts about internet quality but also had them send me screenshots of speed tests. I also scout local coworking spaces in advance in case there is a problem with the internet, so I can get resettled quickly if needed.</p>
<p>Dress each morning as if you are going to work. This helps you not fall into vacation mode and stay in a work mindset.</p>
<p>Keep the same hours and routine as you did at home. Wake up at the same time, have your tea or coffee at the same time, and head to your desk.</p>
<p>Curate your remote work kit. Initially, I traveled with much more than I actually needed. Now I’m down to a laptop, a foldable laptop stand, a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, and a noise-canceling headset and mic. Have as few wires as possible. Initially, I had a mini router in case of emergencies, but I’ve learned that using my phone as a hotspot works just as well, and even that I’ve needed sparingly.</p>
<p>Very few people (at least in tech) work 9 to 5 — we are all connected, all the time. Often, we’re working with customers, colleagues and investors in different countries. Asynchronous communications have become the norm. Even before the pandemic, there were Livestorm employees and investors based in other countries whom I’d never met in person.</p>
<p>Over the past year as we&#8217;ve almost fully remote, we’ve doubled our headcount and nearly doubled revenue. We also closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/livestorm-series-b/">$30 million funding round</a>, completely via email and video conferencing.</p>
<p>Our Paris office has reopened, but in a different format — it’s now organized as more of a co-working space, with room for 30 (our total head count is more than 150). Staff who want to come in can make a reservation, and we have more meeting and hangout space than we used to, since most people who come in are there to collaborate with others.</p>
<p>The weeks I’m in Paris, I go in for meetings most days — but often can still be found working from a Paris apartment, which could be anywhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp is launching a new feature called &#8220;Collections&#8221; to make it easier for users to shop for items using categories. The Facebook-owned platform is rolling out catalog collections to small businesses around the world starting today.</p>
<p>The new collections feature essentially allows businesses to organize items in their catalogs by category so customers won’t have to scroll through long lists of items to find what they’re looking for and can instead go directly to what they want to shop for.</p>
<p>For instance, restaurants can create collections featuring appetizers, entrees and desserts, while a clothing store could add collections for men’s clothes, women’s clothes, shirts, pants and more. Once shoppers have browsed collections, they can add items to their carts and send the order to the business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220886" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We want to make WhatsApp the best way for people to shop for goods and services and for businesses to connect with their customers, which is why we are making it easier to see what a business offers on WhatsApp,” the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>WhatsApp first rolled out its &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/whatsapps-latest-feature-catalogs-caters-to-small-businesses-skipping-the-web-for-mobile/">Catalogs</a>&#8221; feature in 2019 to allow businesses to showcase their products and services to potential customers who could then browse photos and view prices. The catalogs effectively serve as a mobile storefront on WhatsApp — and one that can be operated without the need for a web page at all. The company then launched its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/facebook-adds-carts-to-whatsapp-to-make-shopping-easier/"> &#8220;Carts&#8221; feature</a> last year to make it easier for consumers to buy multiple items from a business and for merchants to keep better track of order inquiries and manage requests.</p>
<p>WhatsApp has added a number of shopping features in recent years to expand the e-commerce experience on its app. Most recently, Facebook added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">&#8220;Shops&#8221;</a> on WhatsApp to give customers the option to chat with businesses before buying something. Since Facebook has been pushing e-commerce on platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/instagram-adds-affiliate-and-shop-features-for-creators/">Instagram</a>, it makes sense that it&#8217;s doing the same for WhatsApp too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.upequity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UpEquity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a digital mortgage company that makes cash offers on a buyer’s behalf, announced today it has raised $20 million in equity funding and secured $30 in debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S3 Ventures led the equity raise, which brings the startup’s total funding haul since its 2019 inception to $77 million, with $29.15 million of that in equity. Next Coast Ventures, BP Capital Management, Alumni Ventures, Gaingels, Launchpad Capital and Early Light Ventures also put money in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many digital lenders out there (Better.com being among the higher-profile ones). And there are also many companies that will make cash offers on behalf of buyers. But there aren’t many that do both. (We </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/accept-inc-secures-90m-in-debt-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overed the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of another such startup, Accept.inc, in June).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220678" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with TechCrunch, UpEquity co-founder and CEO Tim Herman said the company has seen 500% year-over-year growth in revenue and transaction volume. He expects that it will originate more than $1 billion in mortgages over the next 12 months. UpEquity has so far worked with “thousands” of buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup pledges faster closing times, thanks to its mortgage underwriting technology &#8212; saying that it reduces closings from the industry standard of about 50 days to 18, Herman said. Its goal within the next year is to reduce that to an average 10-day close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also claims to offer lower interest rates than other companies in what it describes as the “power buying” space, with no incremental fees. UpEquity, he said, also can turn clients into all-cash buyers so they don’t risk losing a desired home in a competitive situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the first time in history, single family homes are an institutional asset class,” Herman told TechCrunch. “You have Blackstone and other private equity firms or sovereign wealth funds that are buying full neighborhoods with all-cash offers. And so, in this environment with constrained supply and increased demand, the average American is being excluded from accessing single-family housing, And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here to help solve.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herman met co-founder Louis Wilson while both were at Harvard Business School. They started the company in the spring of 2019 and participated in Y Combinator’s summer batch that year. UpEquity officially made Austin its home base in 2020. Since then, it has grown its team from about 15 to 90 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can automate the underwriting of a mortgage, there&#8217;s three things that you can do. You can remove cost from the mortgage, and you can increase speed and add certainty to that mortgage,” Herman said. “And we take that speed and certainty, and use that to create an all-cash offer for our borrowers that we can give them for free.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other lenders, UpEquity makes its revenue </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on a portion of the interest that a buyer pays over the life of the loan. Not all of its customers take advantage of the company’s ability to make an all-cash offer, but the “vast majority” do, according to Herman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Herman said, the mortgage industry has claimed they are going to have a digital mortgage, but “all they have done is put a slick user interface on the front end and poured money into marketing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But then if you look under the hood, it looks like technology from 1985,” he added. “And so, what we think really differentiates us is that we are the only company that has focused our technology on the back end of producing a mortgage.” As such, Herman said, UpEquity&#8217;s true competition is not other startups, but the legacy mortgage industry “that has failed to innovate, and is driving such bad user experience to consumers everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UpEquity is licensed in Texas, Colorado, Florida, Illinois and Georgia. It plans to expand state by state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S3 Ventures partner Charlie Plauche, who is taking a board seat as part of the financing, believes the company is solving a “very real, growing” problem in the mortgage industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Large institutional investors are buying up housing inventory at a record pace and winning bids by making all-cash offers and promising quick close times,” he wrote via email. “The average consumer is going to have to be able to make similar offers in order to buy their dream home and UpEquity empowers them to do that with their accelerated close times and all-cash offers.”    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plauche also believes that the company’s ability to make cash offers for buyers for no additional cost helps set it apart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Other mortgage companies charge up to 2% on the mortgage for a cash offer option,” he said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.stampli.com/">Stampli</a>, a SaaS company that streamlines corporate invoice management, has announced the launch of Stampli Card.</p>
<p>The idea here is that some corporations sign on with vendors who only accept, or prefer to accept, credit card payments. This can lead to something Stampli refers to as &#8220;shadow spend.&#8221; When a corporation pays a vendor through ACH or by check or even through a third-party payments service, there are usually pretty strict rules and procedures about how those invoices and payments are handled.</p>
<p>When a vendor asks for credit payment, that can get thrown off. It can end up on an employee&#8217;s corporate card or something else without the same stringent processes, leading to a breakdown in the system.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220872" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With Stampli Card, accounts payable or other departments within the organization can create a digital card with a set limit, expiration date, etc. to pay out the vendor without abandoning the system already set in place. For example, Accounts Payable can issue, limit, suspend or cancel cards at any time, as well as control who is authorized to make the purchase, spending limits and how often the card can be used. AP can even predefine fields of the payment, such as GL-coding or the vendor.</p>
<p>Once used, Stampli Card transactions are automatically captured and processed just like other invoices, and the cardholder is reminded to upload the supporting documentation, such as a receipt.</p>
<p>For now, Stampli Card is fully digital, but the company has plans to offer a physical card soon.</p>
<p>Stampli Card is built on top of the Stampli platform, which integrates all payments into a single system. Whether organizations are paying through ACH, check, direct pay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/stampli-an-invoice-management-software-startup-launches-a-payments-product/">(which the company launched this year)</a> or card, everything goes through Stampli&#8217;s software to help accounts payable manage the finances of the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Yiky7ddwr4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/stampli-raises-50-million-in-series-c-to-help-companies-intelligently-manage-invoices/">Stampli raises $50 million in Series C to help companies intelligently manage invoices</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Stampli raises $50 million in Series C to help companies intelligently manage invoices&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/stampli-raises-50-million-in-series-c-to-help-companies-intelligently-manage-invoices/embed/#?secret=Yiky7ddwr4" data-secret="Yiky7ddwr4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In May, Stampli raised a $50 million Series C led by Insight Partners. At the time, the company was seeing $20 billion in transaction volume on the platform, with around 1,000 customers. Today, Stampli has about 1,200 customers and is seeing $26 billion in transaction volume via those customers.</p>
<p>The company has raised just under $85 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest challenge for a company like Stampli is that we&#8217;re scaling really fast,&#8221; said CEO Eyal Feldman. &#8220;We want to make sure we keep the same values and customer-centric approach, which works really well for us. This is what keeps me up at night — how to bring in the right people and how to modify the processes in order to make sure that our customers continue to experience the same intimate relationship with us as a company, even as we grow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday show, the time of the week when we niche down to a single topic. Today? The written word.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> got together to dig into the recent NerdWallet IPO filing, and what it can tell us about how the written word &#8212; in its digital form &#8212; can still be worth quite a lot. Here&#8217;s an outline of the chat:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220397" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>NerdWallet shows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/nerdwallets-ipo-filing-reveals-high-margin-content-business-accelerating-marketing-spend/">the financial power of the written word</a>, even if it isn&#8217;t the precise form of writing that we know and love.</li>
<li>Automattic is a large, startup bet on the written word, amongst other things. Danny had notes for us on the scale of its business, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1/">thanks to a new TC-1 </a>all about the publishing empire. Here we talked about the importance of proving value internally, before going external with word power.</li>
<li>And from <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/bringing-books-tiktok-era-amazons-kindle-vella-rise-new-story-platforms/">Kindle Vella</a> to <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/what-i-learned-from-a-year-on-substack">Substack</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/memberful-a-patreon-subsidiary-launches-a-newsletter-product-to-challenge-substack/">Memberful</a> from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/patreon-business/">Patreon,</a> there are more and more models for getting paid to write these days. Hell, you can charge for your <em>tweets</em> now.</li>
</ul>
<p>We were left with questions about if the return of text is inevitable, in an everyone-runs-to-video world. As Natasha notes, distribution is still a bottleneck and human attention is not entirely predisposed to sitting around reading things. But with Gen Z perhaps a little over screen time, perhaps there&#8217;s good news ahead for writers of all stripes.</p>
