										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat is rolling out new tools and educational resources to prevent younger users from buying counterfeit pills and illicit drugs via the platform. The company said on Thursday that the goal of the new tools is to keep its users safe from “the devastating impacts of the fentanyl crisis.”</p>
<p>“We are determined to remove illegal drug sales from our platform, and we have been investing in proactive detection and collaboration with law enforcement to hold drug dealers accountable for the harm they are causing our community,” Snapchat’s parent company, Snap, said in a <a href="https://snap.com/en-US/safety-and-impact">blog post</a>. “While we still have work to do, across all types of law enforcement requests we receive, our response times have improved 85 percent year over year.”</p>
<p>The company says it has improved its proactive detection capabilities to remove drug dealers from its platform before they are able to engage with users and cause harm. Snapchat notes that its enforcement rates have increased by 112 percent during the first half of 2021, and that it has increased proactive detection rates by 260 percent. It also claims nearly two-thirds of drug-related content found on the platform is detected proactively by its artificial intelligence systems. It has also worked to improve its in-app reporting tools to make it easier for users to report drug-related content.</p>
<p>Further, when users search for drug-related keywords, they’ll now see a new in-app educational portal called “Heads Up.” The portal will show relevant educational content designed to prevent harm. Heads Up distributes content from reputable organizations such as Song for Charlie, Shatterproof and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Additional resources from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be added in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The launch of the new tools comes as a recent report from <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/pills-bought-on-snapchat-deadly/index.html">NBC News</a> investigated the deaths of teens and young adults who allegedly used Snapchat to purchase pills that had turned out to be laced with fentanyl. The report alleged that drug dealers have been using the social media platform to find buyers and that Snapchat isn&#8217;t doing enough to prevent harm.</p>
<p>“We have heard devastating stories from families impacted by this crisis, including cases where fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills were purchased from drug dealers on Snapchat. We are determined to remove illegal drug sales from our platform,” the company said.</p>
<p>Social media platforms like Snapchat and Tiktok, which are catered towards young users, are facing increased pressure to crack down on the sale and promotion of illicit drugs as overdose deaths continue to soar. Parent groups have argued that the digital giants aren’t doing enough to prevent harm to young users on these apps. Additionally, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration issued a warning last week about the increase of fake pills laced with fentanyl.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The administration released <a href="https://www.dea.gov/alert/sharp-increase-fake-prescription-pills-containing-fentanyl-and-meth">a public safety alert</a> “warning the American public about the increasing availability of fake pills that are more deadly than ever before, and that are easy to purchase, widely available, and often contain deadly doses of fentanyl.”</p>
<p>Snapchat has said it’s “heartbroken” that drugs have taken the lives of people in its user community and that it will work to do better and keep its users safe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.otto.xyz"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fintech startup which aims to allow people to tap into their vehicle’s equity for access to credit, has raised $4.5 million in a seed round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dallas-based company is building a mobile platform that will essentially let people borrow against their vehicles at the same interest rate as standard credit cards. But unlike other cards, Otto will not charge fees or overdraft charges, and will not require applicants to supply their FICO credit scores. Users will be able remotely verify and collateralize their cars through Otto’s mobile platform, which is set to launch in early 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncommon Capital led the startup&#8217;s seed financing, which included participation from Pelion Venture Partners, 1930 Capital, Bloom VP and Spacecadet Ventures. Other investors include Mark Cuban, entrepreneur and Shark Tank investor; Leo Polovets, co-founder and general partner at Susa Ventures; Bill Clerico, co-founder and CEO of WePay; and Vivek Garipalli, co-founder and CEO of Clover Health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends and former colleagues George Utkov, Jordan Miller and Daniel Ashy came up with the idea for the company after Utkov’s friend became the victim of a “predatory” title loan agreement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Millions of people every year take out what are called title loans &#8212; and it&#8217;s when you own your car outright, and basically go pledge the title of your car as collateral against the loan,” said Miller. “These loans are 30 days long. There are 500%+ APR, and they absolutely crush people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uktov’s friend, who had lost a job during COVID, got a title loan against a truck that was worth between $15,000 and $20,000. When he couldn’t pay it back, he lost his car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That exposed us to this whole world of lending products for the underserved, for the non-banked,” Miller said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio began work on Otto at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. After Uktov’s friend’s experience, they realized that people, for example, with unstable incomes or that are recent immigrants are extremely limited in options when needing money. As such they often have to resort to payday and title lenders, pawn shops or other non-bank credit lenders who often charge “exorbitant” fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Otto, the friends/founders want to give people another option and one that won’t make their financial situation worse, but instead, better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otto chose the asset class since vehicles are often the most common and biggest asset owned by so many who are struggling financially and are underbanked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the company’s mobile app, users will be able to apply and get pre-approved “within minutes” for standard interest credit cards, which are about 96% cheaper than the loans typically available to this user. The user is then guided through a step-by-step process of remotely validating their information and activating their new Otto credit card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers can use their credit cards to help pay for in-store and online purchases, build credit, and earn rewards. Part of the goal is to help users build their credit so they can gain access to even more affordable credit products. When consumers use Otto, their repayment history will be reported to all three major credit bureaus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like all major credit card issuers, Otto will make money in two ways &#8212; via interchange fees and interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to provide financial mobility to those that need it most, regardless of their credit history, and help them move forward in their lives by giving them credit options that they may not otherwise be able to access,” Uktov said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides helping people build credit, the Otto team also will track a user’s financial health and tell them things like what they’re spending their money on, and to be prepared for certain expenses based on their previous charging history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really what we’re creating is a system that is 95% cheaper than the lending products that these people use every day,” Miller said. “We feel like as we build this, and launch it, we have the power to fundamentally change millions of people&#8217;s lives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of their plan to get their word out is tap into the resources of their investors. For example, Mark Cuban is already helping Otto forge local partnerships with businesses doing adjacent services such as advancing financial literacy and credit repair that are already doing outreach in communities, Uktov noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that building trust from the ground up is very important, and that there’s a benefit to building on the community level,” Miller said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via email, Cuban said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he invested in Otto simply because he liked “the idea of helping people use the equity in their cars.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think Otto has a strong commitment to helping those who are underbanked and need financial support rather than extracting every dollar they can,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tikhon Bernstam, managing partner at lead investor Uncommon Capital, said his firm was inspired by Otto&#8217;s vision of offering a new type of asset-backed loan for the underbanked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you&#8217;re unbanked or underbanked you currently don&#8217;t have access to credit at the price that Otto is going to provide it at,” Bernstam wrote via email. “Your alternatives are traditional payday loans at predatory interest rates or traditional title loans at predatory interest rates. Otto is changing that.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The platform enables enterprises to design intelligent user access policies and automate reviews of current company access points.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remember when a Twitter contractor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/meet-the-man-who-deactivated-trumps-twitter-account/">deactivated Donald Trump’s personal account</a> for 11 minutes in 2017? <a href="https://opal.dev/">Opal</a> co-founder Stephen Cobbe says that is one example of an instance where certain employees were provided too much access to the inner-workings of the company.</p>
<p>His company, based in San Francisco and New York, is working with enterprises to design intelligent user access policies and automate reviews of current company access points. Cobbe explained that companies either grant access that is too broad or restrict it too much.</p>
<p>Cobbe and his founding team come from companies like Dropbox, Scale, Brex, MuleSoft and Palo Alto Networks. He personally saw at Dropbox some of the pain points of managing access at scale. What happens is that organizations have access policies around which roles do what, but in reality, life doesn’t fit perfectly into those access structures, he added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213697" style="width: 3594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213697" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2213697 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png" alt="Opal" width="3584" height="1842" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png 3584w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=768,395 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=680,349 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=1536,789 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=2048,1053 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3584px) 100vw, 3584px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213697" class="wp-caption-text">Opal dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Opal</p></div></p>
<p>“Employees can have too much access, which is how the Twitter employee was able to go rogue,” Cobbe told TechCrunch. “When companies that we talked to tried to deal with the problem, they weren’t happy with existing solutions. We interviewed 100 companies and found that they all have versions of the same internal tool that they were individually updating each time.”</p>
<p>The tools are also typically based on SAML, or Security Assertion Markup Language, and not up to the task of managing the diverse systems companies have. Instead, Opal’s approach is to turn a once rigid model into a needs-based one through API integrations.</p>
<p>Companies can log in and see a list of engineering infrastructure, SaaS apps and internal tools. When access requests are made, they are routed to an owner for approval. On the flip side, when an employee leaves the company, an owner can go in and remove access with the push of a button.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To continue developing its platform, Opal closed on a $1.8 million seed round led by Greylock. Angel investors participating in the deal include Expanse CEO Tim Junio, Abnormal Security CEO Evan Reiser and Signal Sciences CEO Andrew Peterson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every enterprise knows that managing permissions at scale is challenging,” said Saam Motamedi, partner at Greylock, in a written statement. “More systems mean more attack vectors, places to audit, and overhead to ensure engineers have the access they need. Opal is tackling these problems with a strong team of security experts, and I look forward to partnering with them on their journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opal was founded in 2020, but came out of stealth mode a few months ago. It already touts a list of customers including Blend and Coffee Meets Bagel. The company used the new investment to hire on both the engineering and business side, Cobbe said.</p>
<p>He did not disclose growth metrics, but did say the company is poised to raise another round of funding in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand grocery delivery platform Instacart announced this morning that it’s acquiring FoodStorm, a SaaS order management system (OMS) that powers end-to-end order-ahead and catering for grocery retailers. The companies have not disclosed the financial details of the deal, but as part of the acquisition, Instacart will integrate FoodStorm’s technology into its suite of enterprise grocery e-commerce solutions.</p>
<p>FoodStorm has developed a SaaS offering that covers multi-channel ordering, order management, payment and fulfillment. Its technology also integrates with several third-party systems, including point-of-sale systems (POS). The technology also offers CRM capabilities that help grocers collect feedback and leverage promotional features.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to help our retail partners increase their sales and ensure more of their customers’ everyday meals come from the grocery store. That’s why we’re excited to welcome the talented FoodStorm team to Instacart and integrate their end-to-end, order-ahead and catering platform into Instacart’s leading enterprise offering,” said Instacart’s chief technology officer, Mark Schaaf, in a statement.</p>
<p>FoodStorm, which was founded 14 years ago, has formed partnerships with several of Instacart’s existing retail partners, including Bi-Rite Market, Mollie Stone’s Markets, Uncle Giuseppe’s and Roche Brothers. Instacart plans to make FoodStorm’s technology available to more retailers.</p>
<p>Instacart states that this new enterprise solution helps retailers bring even more of their inventory online and enhance their e-commerce capabilities while meeting the needs of customers. As for customers, Instacart says the technology unlocks a more affordable alternative to restaurant delivery.</p>
<p>“Grocery is an incredibly complex retail category, making the need for enterprise-grade solutions like FoodStorm and Instacart critical to the long-term success of the industry we all rely on to put food on our tables. We’re excited about this next chapter as we join the Instacart team and create new ways for retailers to serve the ever-changing needs of their businesses and customers,” said FoodStorm CEO Rob Hill in a statement.</p>
<p>Instacart notes that order-ahead technology solutions provide grocery retailers with a significant growth opportunity. For instance, Instacart customers who purchase prepared foods and catering items like hot and cold side dishes, cakes and sushi from the grocery store have significantly larger baskets and shop more frequently than customers who don’t. As for retailers, Instacart outlines that order-ahead items and prepared foods are also typically more profitable than traditional groceries like produce and package goods.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, Instacart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">raised a $265 million funding</a> round from existing investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners and others. The funding pushed the company’s valuation to $39 billion. Instacart also recently debuted a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/instacart-speeds-up-grocery-orders-with-priority-delivery-option/">faster delivery service, &#8220;Priority Delivery,</a>&#8221; in select markets in the U.S. and Canada with the aim of attracting customers who would have otherwise quickly run to the store for their smaller orders or more urgent needs.</p>

You wouldn&#8217;t have to switch between CarPlay and your car&#8217;s (likely clunky) infotainment software just to turn up the heat.</p>
<p>IronHeart is still early in development, according to the tipsters, and would require partnerships with car brands. Apple has declined to comment.</p>
<p>An initiative like this could extend Apple&#8217;s presence in cars far beyond limited technologies like CarPlay or its more recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carkey-apple-unlock-car-iphone-nfc-bmw-ios-14-13-175711038.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">CarKey</a> feature. While it&#8217;s not necessarily part of the company&#8217;s long-rumored <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-car-hyundai-010548978.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">electric car strategy</a>, it could give the company experience with more aspects of cars and help with any in-house vehicle development.</p>
<p>Whether or not automakers embrace the concept is another matter. Apple would effectively bypass a car&#8217;s native interface for many common tasks. It&#8217;s easy to see manufacturers balking after pouring extensive work into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-30-fords-sync-4-add-wireless-carplay-android-auto.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">their own car interfaces</a> and companion apps, particularly if they have any services that compete with Apple offerings. If IronHeart ships, it may be limited to a handful of makes and models unless there&#8217;s an enthusiastic response from car buyers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://brighthire.com">BrightHire</a>, a startup that wants to transform the way people are hired inside organizations, announced a $20.5 million Series B investment today led by 01 Advisors with participation from Index Ventures and Zoom Apps Fund.</p>
<p>The fact that Zoom Apps Fund is involved is not a coincidence, as the company is based on taking information from a Zoom-based interview and using the data to drive hiring decision making. Company co-founder and CEO Ben Sesser says that while most business decisions are grounded in data, hiring decisions have been an obvious exception with a lot of emotion and gut feelings involved. He is hoping to change that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to transform the way teams are built. In business, it&#8217;s kind of expected that any critical decision will be grounded in hard data and rigorous analysis. And yet in hiring which is perhaps the most important thing a company does for its future, the decisions are made largely based on gut feel and memories and recollections,&#8221; Sesser told me.</p>
<p>He said that most companies are not terribly consistent about the way they hire and BrightHire brings some order to the hiring exercise and in that way improves the experience for everyone involved.</p>
<p>The company records and transcribes each interview, which is conducted over Zoom, enabling the interviewer to concentrate solely on the candidate, and not on taking notes or other tasks. In addition, throughout the interview, the software will surface critical questions to ask the candidate, which helps ensure every interview is conducted in a consistent way.</p>
<p>After every interview, the software surfaces highlights and insights that help companies as they hire new employees and ultimately to continually improve hiring overall.</p>
<p>Dick Costolo, who is managing partner at lead investor 01A, says that one of the reasons he liked what BrightHire was doing was because he recognized that they were solving a fundamental hiring problem he had when he was running Twitter from 2009-2015 during a period of extreme growth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;One of the things we noticed at Twitter was there was all this unconscious or unintentional bias in the interview process or even in the promotion process,&#8221; he said. This led them to try to seek a more data-driven way to make better decisions, something that&#8217;s much easier to do with a tool like BrightHire. &#8220;This would have solved so many issues we had around subjectivity and unconscious bias,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>During the pandemic when so much business was shifting online, the idea of interviewing over Zoom became much more normalized than perhaps it would have been when the company launched in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;Six months or seven months prior to the pandemic, just based on the problem, hiring was too important to not fix in really fundamental ways, but ultimately 2020 was a very interesting year due to the pandemic, and ultimately there have been a bunch of changes that have been big accelerants for our business,&#8221; Sesser said.</p>
<p>As the company grows, Sesser says he is using the product to drive diversity in hiring inside his own organization, but it&#8217;s just one tool in the arsenal. &#8220;We don&#8217;t solve diversity in hiring, but what our product does is create a more equitable process,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He adds, &#8220;How can you have an equitable approval process if you&#8217;re assessing candidates inconsistently [&#8230;], and if we have no grounding or basis for our decisions that we can fall back on or hold ourselves accountable to. Otherwise, it&#8217;s literally our subjective memory and our feelings, which is a really really hard thing to do.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.withmedley.com/">Medley</a>, the group coaching platform that focuses on both personal and professional development, announced the close of a $3.7 million seed round led by A16Z today</p>
<p>Connie Chan and Anne Lee Skates of Andreesen Horowitz led the round, with participation from Aglaé Ventures, Foundation Capital, Ciara Wilson, Jen Rubio, Dara Treseder (Peloton). and Sanyin Siang (Duke University), among others.</p>
<p>Medley was cofounded by Edith Cooper and Jordan Taylor, a mother-daughter duo who believe that the personal and professional development of people are inextricably linked together. The platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/medley-a-life-and-career-coaching-community-for-everyone-launches-today/">launched back in July of 2020</a> with the goal of facilitating small group discussions led by a professional development coach. These groups were matched with the express intention of fostering diversity and inclusion, with different age groups, genders, ethnicities and backgrounds represented in each group.</p>
<p>With inclusivity top of mind, Medley welcomes everyone to join the membership, and even launched with an opportunity-based sliding scale for the annual membership fee.</p>
<p>Alongside the announcement of the funding, Medley is also introducing Medley Moments in the coming months. Moments are specifically designed courses that members can enroll in to focus on their particular goals. Taylor gave a few examples of the kinds of topics that Moments will cover, including becoming a new parent, learning about leadership, relocating, career pivots and more.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pxlpYDyjSf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/medley-a-life-and-career-coaching-community-for-everyone-launches-today/">Medley, a life and career coaching community for everyone, launches today</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Medley, a life and career coaching community for everyone, launches today&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/medley-a-life-and-career-coaching-community-for-everyone-launches-today/embed/#?secret=pxlpYDyjSf" data-secret="pxlpYDyjSf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;There was a heightened focus on the significance of gaining perspective on other people&#8217;s reality that was in people&#8217;s consciousness when we first launched, but now is critical to their center of gravity, in terms of what people are seeking when participating in groups,&#8221; said Edith Cooper. &#8220;There&#8217;s also an increasing expectation from people that their employers actually care about them and provide offerings that are not tactically oriented but for the benefit of them as people.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Given these insights, and a successful pilot program with LinkedIn, Medley is now looking at B2B options for the company, with the potential to sell the programs to larger organizations for the benefit of their employees.</p>
<p>Following the LinkedIn pilot, which saw a 99 percent NPS score, the professional social behemoth will be expanding that partnership in 2022.</p>
<p>The fresh funding means hiring is certainly on the table for Medley this year. Cooper, who sits on numerous boards including those of Amazon and PepsiCo, says that the biggest challenge for Medley, or any organization for that matter, is attracting and retaining world-class talent, where both the passion and the vision are aligned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best part of being an entrepreneur is getting to work with people who challenge me, who I learn from and who I can enjoy spending time with,&#8221; said Jordan Taylor. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great challenge but also something that I feel grateful for, is being able to, with Edith, build out a team of people who are always looking to learn.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aside from billions of dollars of personal wealth and historically impressive levels of corporate control, what&#8217;s the point of being a successful tech CEO these days?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not asking in the abstract. There are tweets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>

<hr />
<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget how lucky we are to have Twitter in the world. The company&#8217;s social media service has handed a digital megaphone to anyone who wants one, allowing you and me the chance to not only be expressive on a regular &#8212; obsessive, in my case, I know &#8212; basis, but also the opportunity to hear directly from folks who are otherwise ensconced behind walls of minders and communications professionals.</p>
<p>Not that I agree with what everyone says on Twitter, of course; I just like the chance to listen a bit, because it can be rather illustrative.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I enjoy the occasional Twitter threads from <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/">Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong</a> because they provide a neat, clear window into his thinking &#8212; not only what&#8217;s on his mind, but what he thinks could be solutions to the issues he sees. It&#8217;s useful as someone who writes about the business world where he holds influence.</p>
<p>And the crypto-focused exec had quite the thread earlier this week, digging into how large companies are treated in the United States.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://paddle.com/">Paddle</a>, a solutions provider subscription-based businesses, is betting on a future where App Store developers are able to use third-party payment systems &#8212; and it wants to be among the first to market with an alternative once such a system is permitted. The company today <a href="https://twitter.com/PaddleHQ/status/1446050078301605890?">announced</a> a new in-app purchasing (IAP) system aimed at iOS developers that&#8217;s designed to be a drop-in replacement for Apple&#8217;s own IAP. And it&#8217;s one where developers get to keep more of the revenue they earn, Paddle says.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big bet and not one that&#8217;s clear to pay off.</p>
<p>Paddle says its system will provide developers with access to customer data throughout their lifecycle; will offer a combination of direct subscription management and tools to pause subscriptions; and will support other payment mechanisms, like PayPal. It will also allow developers to manage their own refunds, which is something many developers have wanted for some time. Its fees would be 10% on transactions under $10 and 5% on transactions over $10. That&#8217;s less than Apple&#8217;s fees of 30% (which drop to 15% for year two of subscription-based apps, and for small businesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">program</a> and Apple News Partner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/">program</a> participants.)</p>
<p>But Paddle&#8217;s entire product&#8217;s product hinges on its belief that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">court&#8217;s ruling</a> in the Epic v. Apple lawsuit will be held up upon appeal, and that the way Apple will interpret the ruling will allow payment system alternatives such as Paddle&#8217;s to operate. That&#8217;s not something Paddle at this point could definitively know.</p>
<p>In September, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">sided with Fortnite maker Epic Games</a> on the topic of third-party payments in the App Store in the landmark decision, though she found that Apple was not engaging in antitrust conduct. Epic, which wants to be able to also distribute its games directly to iOS users in addition to using its own payment mechanisms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">said it would be appealing</a> the court&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the ruling was that Apple could no longer prohibit developers from including buttons, external links, and other calls to action inside their apps that could direct users to alternative payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>Even if this part of the judgment is not adjusted following the appeal, the judge&#8217;s wording on the matter of third-party payments is still open to interpretation by Apple. And currently, the thinking here is that it simply blocks Apple from rejecting apps pointing to other means of payment outside its store &#8212; not that Apple would have to go so far as to support a competitive payment system that&#8217;s built into the apps themselves. <a href="https://www.imore.com/app-purchase-alternative-paddle-will-see-apps-rejected-says-expert">Experts have already pushed back</a> on the idea this system could make it through App Review.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paddle, however, believes it has a shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our understanding, and that of our legal advisors, is that Paddle In-App Purchase is permissible within the Apple vs Epic legal ruling,&#8221; said Paddle, in a statement. &#8220;We would welcome Apple sharing its own interpretation on this to bring further clarity to an issue that will have a significant impact on iOS developers and the wider market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company plans to make its system available from Dec. 7, 2021, in line with the court&#8217;s ruling.</p>
<p>Paddle today has over 3,000 software clients (sellers) using its platform for other services today, and processes billions of dollars in payment volume per year. It will be interesting to see if any developers actually go so far as to implement this Apple IAP alternative, which could risk having their apps rejected from the App Store. So far, Paddle says some devs have agreed to try it, including MacPaw.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Increasingly, conversations about big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence are going hand-in-hand with conversations about privacy and data protection. Now, a startup that is building tools to make it easier for engineers to implement the two simultaneously is announcing a round of growth funding to continue expanding its operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://gretel.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gretel AI</a>, which lets engineers create anonymized, synthetic, datasets based on their actual datasets to use in their analytics and to train machine learning models has closed $50 million in funding, a Series B that it will be using to get the company to the next stage of development. The product &#8212; which is built as a SaaS product but can also be accessed via APIs &#8212; is still in beta but aims to be open to general availability later this year.</p>
<p>Anthos Capital is leading the round with Section 32 also participating alongside Greylock and Moonshots Capital. Greylock led the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/gretel-announces-12m-series-a-to-make-it-easier-to-anonymize-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s previous round in 2020</a>, and the startup has raised $65.5 million to date.</p>
<p>From what we understand, this latest round puts the company&#8217;s valuation at between $320-$350 million.</p>
<p>The idea behind using synthetic datasets is that it lets an organization remove the risk of data leaking that might contain personal information or other kinds of sensitive data. There are other solutions to address the same issue involving data encryption, although this can be a costly, time-consuming and resource intensive approach that faces scaling challenges.</p>
<p>The germination for Gretel.ai came out of the direct experiences of the three co-founders in work they did as cybersecurity specialists at a range of organizations including IBM, AWS, Netscout and the U.S. military and over the years.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&#8220;We always found that using the right permissions with data was always the bottleneck,&#8221; said Ali Golshan, the CEO who co-founded the company with Alex Watson (CPO) and John Myers (CTO). The could see that the longer-term issue wold be a growing need and priority for data privacy. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As the world moves from the web to the immersive world of sensors and IOT we are transitioning into a world where people will share their data unconsciously or unknowingly. But humans are not meant to be mined.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">As data engineers, their priority is to be able to work with data easily and quickly, but as citizens of the world, they were unhappy with data protection implications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Removing the bottleneck of compute is the problem we’ve solved, and we have created high velocity development,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But now we are running into the bottleneck of the data. AI is on a collision course with privacy. At this collision course, we should create tools&#8221; to fix that.</p>
<p class="p1">Gretel&#8217;s opportunity is one that many companies targeting the enterprise market have taken in the world of digital transformation: many organizations now have large engineering operations working on applications to run their businesses, but they still do not have the firepower of the world&#8217;s largest technology companies. So Gretel set out to build a toolkit that would let any company build anonymized datasets for themselves, similar to what big tech companies use in their own data work.</p>
<p>The advantage of anonymized data goes beyond simply replacing a synthetic dataset for an actual one; they can also be used to augment a dataset, or to fill in the gaps where the real-world data might be lacking. Both of these are critical components especially in cases where the data is needed to train systems, such as in the case of autonomous services, where you seemingly can never have enough teaching data.</p>
<p>Watson had previously worked at AWS (fun fact: we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/amazon-aws-harvest-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scooped</a> when Amazon acquired his previous startup, harvest.ai), and he says that to date Gretel.ai <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has secured early customers in areas like </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">life sciences, financial services and gaming. In more basic use cases, it can take as little as 10 minutes to create a synthetic dataset. In more complex applications &#8212; for example in a genomic database, it could take several days. </span></p>
<p>Relatively speaking, this represents &#8220;very low friction&#8221; for engineers, Watson said, both compared to other approaches such as data encryption using techniques like homomorphic encryption, or indeed the analogue approach of contacting third parties and getting permissions to use datasets. The latter can take six months or longer, too long in cases where time is of the essence;</p>

<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>“This significant Series B investment is a direct reflection of Gretel’s ambitious vision, swift growth, and strength of position in the AI industry as the standard-bearer of tools that enable privacy by design,” said Emily White, President of Anthos Capital, in a statement. “Gretel’s ease of use, the extendability of its services, and the superior accuracy and quality of its synthetic data are much-needed solutions to simplify the exceedingly complex legal and technical barriers companies face due to data privacy concerns.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Gretel gives data teams working in any framework or language the tools they need to build privacy by design into their existing workflows and data pipelines, greatly simplifying this process,&#8221; added Sridhar Ramaswamy, partner at Greylock. &#8220;Time and time again I hear from software engineers and data scientists about the value Gretel offers. Its developer-first, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">tech-agnostic approach to solving privacy issues is incredibly valuable to every business sector.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I work in talent acquisition for a rapidly scaling startup, and I’m looking for an edge to onboard top engineers. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m seeing many stellar candidates who are about to graduate from a U.S. university and who mention programs like CPT, OPT and STEM OPT. How do we recruit and retain them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Rigorous Recruiter</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dear Rigorous,</p>
<p>Many startups overlook the pool of talented international students or those who recently graduated or will soon graduate from U.S. colleges or universities &#8212; many of whom want to remain here to work &#8212; because the companies might feel intimidated by what they know they don’t know about the U.S. immigration process.</p>
<p>Early-stage startups often assume that offering a job to an international student or recent graduate on an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/f-1-visa-students/">F-1 student visa</a> might be too complicated, or they worry if it’s too hard for an early-stage startup to secure them an H-1B. I recently dove into <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/091-what-you-need-to-know-about-hiring-student-on-opt/">What You Need to Know About Hiring Students on OPT</a> on my podcast. Fortunately, international students and grads provide a rich talent pool full of highly motivated individuals, and managing their immigration is totally possible.</p>
<p>The two main types of training programs available to most international students who hold an F-1 visa to work in their field of study include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curricular Practical Training (CPT), which is available at some colleges and universities to currently enrolled students. Not every university or degree program offers it.</li>
<li><a href="http://alcorn.law/opt-optional-practical-training/">Optional Practical Training</a> (OPT), which is available during coursework (Pre-Completion OPT) or after graduation (Post-Completion OPT) and in some cases can be extended through the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/stem-opt-extension/">STEM OPT</a> extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike work visas, employers do not have to directly “petition” F-1 students for CPT and OPT (for example, the Form I-129, which is used for H-1Bs and O-1As, is not involved). However, CPT and OPT require the student to work in an area directly related to their field of study, and the employer may need to provide information or other documents such as a training plan for the student to qualify or apply. I’ll go into these in more depth below.</p>
<p>For an H-1B in the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/002-2020-h-1b-lottery-update/">lottery</a>, a startup only needs to meet some basic <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B sponsorship requirements</a> to have a shot. These can include being incorporated, offering a specialty occupation job, and having the ability to pay the H-1B candidate’s salary for the term of the requested H-1B petition (usually up to three years). Then a startup’s candidate has the same chance of being selected in the annual lottery as a candidate with the same education level who is sponsored by a tech giant. (Big Tech and tech consulting companies may tend to sponsor a lot of people in the lottery, but their candidates are not given extra weight in the government’s process!) In addition, a proposal to shift from a random H-1B lottery to a wage-based lottery was thrown out by a federal court judge in September, so next year’s lottery will be random with a slight preference for candidates with advanced U.S. degrees, but no preference based on salary.</p>
<p>I recommend that you consult with an experienced immigration attorney to guide you, your startup and the student or graduate through this process. An immigration attorney can also help you strategize the best course of action for the students and graduates that you decide to sponsor for a work visa or green card.</p>

<h2>How does CPT work?</h2>
<p><a href="https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/sevis-help-hub/student-records/fm-student-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training-cpt">Curricular Practical Training (CPT)</a> is available at somes universities where training is already an integral part of the school’s established curriculum. Some graduate programs allow or even require students to apply for CPT at the very beginning of the program, dubbed “Day 1 CPT.”</p>
<p>Students must get approval for CPT from the Designated School Official (DSO) at their university or college. If you want to hire an international student on CPT, the student will need to provide information about the job to the DSO, such as the position, duties, wage, time commitment and any other information the DSO may request to decide whether the job qualifies.</p>
<p>One year of full-time (more than 20 hours per week) CPT eliminates a student’s eligibility for OPT. However, part-time (20 hours per week or less) CPT will not impact a student’s eligibility.</p>
<h2>How does OPT work?</h2>
<p>Like CPT, Optional Practical Training (OPT) is limited to 12 months. OPT is available to international students at each education level: bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral.</p>
<p>There are two types of OPT: pre-completion (before graduation) and post-completion. Most F-1 students choose to start OPT after graduation so that they can work full time. Under pre-completion OPT, students can only work part time. Every two months of part-time, pre-completion OPT will reduce by one month the amount of OPT that can be done after graduation.</p>
<p>If a student wants to work while taking courses, I often recommend pursuing CPT if available and work part time to preserve post-completion OPT.</p>
<p>For OPT, the student must apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a work permit. How do they do it? The student must obtain the DSO’s authorization and signature on Form I-20 (Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status). That form, along with Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization Document) and the filing fee, must be submitted to USCIS within 30 days of the DSO’s endorsement.</p>
<p>For post-completion OPT, Form I-765 can be filed as early as 90 days before the student graduates, but no later than 60 days after graduation. If a student is applying on or before October 31, 2021, then the application can be filed as early as 120 days before graduation. That temporary change resulted from a settlement in a class-action lawsuit. The student or graduate can begin working once the work authorization card is received.</p>
<h2>How does the STEM OPT extension work?</h2>
<p>Students or graduates on OPT can qualify for a 24-month extension if they earned a <a href="https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/stem-list.pdf">STEM degree</a>. To be eligible to hire an individual on STEM OPT, your startup must:</p>
<p>Be enrolled and in good standing in the government’s <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/e-verify">E-Verify</a> program; provide a formal training program in the individual’s field of study and complete <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/i983.pdf">Form I-983</a> (Training Plan for STEM OPT Students); and offer a position that is equivalent to others in duties, hours and compensation, among other legal requirements.</p>
<p>STEM OPT also requires a new work permit. Form I-765, an updated Form I-20 that is signed by the DSO can be filed as early as 90 days before OPT ends (or 120 days if filing on or before October 31, 2021), but no later than 60 days after the DSO signs off on the I-20. Candidates seeking a STEM OPT extension can still <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/complete-correct-form-i-9/completing-section-1-employee-information-and-attestation/foreign-academic-students">continue to work</a> for I-9 purposes for up to 180 days while they are waiting for the approval.</p>
<h2>What happens next?</h2>
<p>Graduates have a 60-day grace period following their OPT or STEM OPT expiration date to either leave the U.S., change to another status or start a new degree program on an F-1 visa.</p>
<p>Any students your startup wants to retain should be registered in the annual H-1B lottery in March of each year. You can enter students in the H-1B lottery even before they graduate. If they don’t get selected, you can register them the following year, and so on until they’re selected or their time on OPT or STEM OPT runs out.</p>
<p>Some students might be eligible to stay working in the U.S. while their H-1B is pending in a status called “Cap Gap.” Your immigration attorney can help you determine alternatives to the H-1B for students and graduates based on their situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you think about service meshes, a somewhat esoteric cloud native tool designed to stitch different microservices together, you might not think it&#8217;s the most lucrative side of the Kubernetes led cloud native market, but you would be wrong. Today, <a href="http://solo.io">Solo.io</a>, a Cambridge, Massachusetts service mesh startup, announced a $135 million Series C at a fat $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Altimeter Capital led today&#8217;s round with participation from existing investors Redpoint Ventures and True Ventures. By the way, that valuation is a 10x increase over their previous valuation at the time of their $23 million Series B round in October 2020 and brings the total raised to $171.5 million.</p>
<p>While founder and CEO Idit Levine says the company she started in 2017 anticipated the rise of the service mesh market in general, she doesn&#8217;t see her company strictly focusing on that particular technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We predicted everything that will happen in the market and honestly service mesh is catching on like crazy. But I will say that saying Solo is [strictly] a service mesh company, to me it&#8217;s like saying that Amazon only sells books. That&#8217;s where we started, and we&#8217;ll do whatever we need to do and go with the market,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company made some early bets on the open source Envoy proxy and Istio service mesh, Both projects have grown to be leaders in this space, and the company has been a major contributor to both from the very beginning, which puts it in a good position to build commercial products on top of these projects.</p>
<p>Just recently, Solo released <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/solo-io-integrates-a-cloud-native-api-gateway-and-service-mesh-into-its-enterprise-platform/">an updated version of Gloo Mesh technology</a>. The startup was able to combine an API gateway and service mesh into a single control plane, vastly simplifying the management of these technologies.</p>
<p>As they grow, as you would expect, the team is growing too with around 70 employees. She said her strategy has been to hire young people and teach them the business and it&#8217;s been working well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of diversity, she says that as a woman with a highly technical background, she has sometimes been frustrated by tokenism. &#8220;I never asked for anybody to give me this discount because I&#8217;m a woman. Actually, sometimes it has been irritating. Oh, we want to give you a talk because you&#8217;re a woman. It pissed me off. You need me to give a talk because I am damn good,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As she builds her company, she is making the effort to find more diverse candidates. Her current group of engineers is 30% women, which is high by tech company standards, and she continually looks for historically underrepresented groups as she hires.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of diversity in the company. [&#8230;] I think that it&#8217;s contributing to [our success]. We are reaching out to women in tech and people of color in tech, so we are definitely trying. We are going to meetups [and other places] and looking out for [diverse] people. And so we are trying and it&#8217;s definitely what we want to achieve,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>While Levine didn&#8217;t want to share specific revenue numbers, she said that the company&#8217;s goal for FY2021, which runs February to February, was to triple their ARR from the previous year, and they were able to do that by the end of Q2 of the fiscal year, putting them on track for some explosive growth. And she says, part of the reason for that is that companies are signing up for Solo&#8217;s products for multiple years. In fact, 35% of their contracts are for 2-3 years, accounting for over 100 contracts so far.</p>
<p>That could explain why investors were willing to pour so much money into this company and value it so highly. Levine says that she wasn&#8217;t looking for funding, but customer demand has been growing so quickly, and the funds will enable them to accelerate and keep the growth they&#8217;ve been experiencing going.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically there wasn&#8217;t any reason to take the money. I think that the reason I took this on is because we want to take over [the entire] market, and we need to grow. There&#8217;s so many demands and we need to scale dramatically, and that&#8217;s the main reason that we took this round,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rise of privacy-oriented financial blockchain projects are going to be crucial if “DeFi” (decentralized finance) is to have any kind of future. We have come to expect privacy in our “normal” financial lives, so we will expect it in the blockchain and Crypto world, whatever some might claim.<br />
We saw murmurs of that starting to happen back in May, when the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/in-the-race-towards-web-3-financial-privacy-secret-network-attracts-backing-from-key-players/">Secret Network blockchain</a>, a privacy-first smart contract platform, attracted investment from Arrington Capital, and Blocktower Capital. Furthermore, it was apparent when decentralized finance company Sienna Network <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/signalling-that-privacy-is-coming-to-defi-sienna-network-raises-11-2m-for-its-platform/">raised $11.2 million</a> from institutional investors and public supporters.</p>
<p>It was no coincidence that Sienna is built on the aforementioned Secret Network. Thus today Sienna is launching its &#8216;Automated Market Maker’ SiennaSwap, which works on its platform. Sienna token holders can now convert tokens into their private equivalent and then swap or place them in liquidity pools to gain yield.</p>
<p>It means users can avoid the lack of privacy on exchanges that allow others to see what users are doing and arbitrage on those transactions with “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp">front-running</a>” &#8211; a key weakness of Crypto transactions today.</p>
<p>Also playing in this privacy space are Uniswap, PancakseSwap and other DEXs in the crypto ecosystem. However, where SiennaSwap differentiates, it says, is its privacy-preserving features, which, it claims, address the front-running issue. Sienna is also part of the Cøsmos Ecosystem, where plenty of new projects are launching, virtually every day, further enhancing its broader offering.</p>
<p>The SiennaSwap launch follows the organization’s $11.2 million private and public sale of its tokens in May when the organization raised $10 million in the private sale from investors such as Magnus NGC, Inclusion Capital, Lotus Capital, FBG, Skyvision Capital, and others.</p>
<p>It’s perhaps also worth noting that Sienna Network is a ‘carbon-friendly’ Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, requiring vastly less energy Proof-Of-Work chains like Bitcoin which require miners to use large amounts of power.</p>
<p>Tor Bair, Founder, Secret Foundation said: “Sienna’s launch marks a massive turning point both for Secret’s DeFi ecosystem and for DeFi in general. Providing privacy by design to users is critical to securing and scaling these new financial platforms, meaning Sienna is primed to create a new explosion of growth.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Sequoia partner Stephanie Zhan and Nick Fajt, founder and CEO of social gaming platform Rec Room, explained what the venture capital firm looks for in consumer-facing startups.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sequoia is one of the most sought-after VC firms in the world, and predictably, it sees plenty of startups competing for its attention.</p>
<p>In a recent episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/extra-crunch-live/">TechCrunch Live (formerly Extra Crunch Live)</a>, Sequoia partner Stephanie Zhan and Nick Fajt, founder and CEO of social gaming platform <a href="https://recroom.com/">Rec Room</a>, explained what the venture capital firm looks for in consumer-facing startups. We even took a look at Rec Room&#8217;s earliest pitch deck, the seed that ultimately grew into a business that has raised nearly $150 million.</p>
<p>This episode also featured the ECL Pitch-off, where founders in the audience pitched their products and services to our expert guests to get their live feedback. You can check out the whole episode as well as the Rec Room pitch deck below.</p>
<h2>Love is the answer</h2>
<p>Sequoia, alongside almost every other VC firm, prizes one factor when deciding to investing in a consumer-facing company: User love.</p>
<p>There are a handful of ways to measure user love, from NPS scores to retention and engagement metrics to reviews of the product.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks after it launched, Rec Room was seeing users average 26 minutes per session, and around 90 minutes per user every day, which meant that many users were coming back for multiple sessions.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that we aren&#8217;t talking about tens of thousands of users. But in small numbers, the product was resonating, so it stood to reason that it would also resonate with more people. Sequoia was very drawn to this, and Zhan noted that in consumer companies, user love is the most important thing she looks for.</p>
<p>&#8220;This wasn&#8217;t just people coming in, saying hi, and popping out,&#8221; said Zhan. &#8220;There was real engagement here, even in relatively small numbers. That&#8217;s what stood out most. That was the real magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside time per session, Sequoia used Rec Room&#8217;s &#8216;high five&#8217; metrics to evaluate user love.</p>
<p>High fives don&#8217;t actually have any value in Rec Room games themselves. You don&#8217;t win or earn anything by giving a high five. But the metrics around high fives continued to go up as more people played.</p>
<p>Zhan elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nick had been thinking a lot about what forms of communication and interaction matter. One of the things that I forgotten about, but I remembered re-reading some of our internal communication at Sequoia from while we were evaluating Rec Room at the time, was that we kept talking about this notion of high fives. It&#8217;s interesting. I literally had a count of the number of high fives that the current user base had at the time. And I wondered why do high fives matter?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cord.com">Cord</a>, a startup that offers a single API to add Slack-like collaboration features to any app, has bagged $17.5 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The round &#8212; which is pegged to fund product development, including by hiring engineers, designers and product managers &#8212; was led by European VC Index. Other investors participating include NFX and Stride, along with angel investors Elad Gil, Jeff Morris Jr., Charlie Songhurst, Guy Podjarni and Matt Robinson.</p>
<p>The London based startup was only founded last year. It&#8217;s not disclosing customers numbers yet but has today revealed a partnership with the &#8216;conversational data collection&#8217; platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/typeform-a-platform-for-conversational-data-collection-raises-35m/">Typeform</a> &#8212; which is using Cord&#8217;s API to offer its customers the ability to collaborate as they design online forms.</p>
<p>Cord says a private beta it was running, which ended in August when it opened up for general access, has involved &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of clients &#8212; including other undisclosed SaaS makers, startups and scale-ups.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&#8220;Our best markets are really B2B SaaS that&#8217;s used by teams, so we see everything from people using it in CRMs like HubSpot, CMSs like Webflow or WordPress, marketing tools like Mailchimp, BI tools like Amplitude, no-code tools like Retool and everywhere else you work with other people you need approval, or help, or feedback from,&#8221; the startup tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now it&#8217;s more heavily taken up by teams that are from early stage startups to scale up, we do see use amongst Typeform&#8217;s enterprise clients so some very big multi-billion dollar tech companies and consumer brands that are Typeform users<b> </b>or a big motion picture studio who uses <span class="il">Cord</span> in their BI tools.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cord&#8217;s API &#8212; which it touts as a single line of Javascript &#8212; enables paying customers to quickly add a range of collaborative features to their own products, taking the strain out of developing social add-ons like real-time chat, presence, annotations, integrations with task managers and Slack, screen recordings, audio messages, live co-browsing and video chat.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213483" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213483" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2213483" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00LeadImage.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="408" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00LeadImage.jpg 2085w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00LeadImage.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00LeadImage.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00LeadImage.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00LeadImage.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00LeadImage.jpg?resize=1536,922 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00LeadImage.jpg?resize=2048,1229 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00LeadImage.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213483" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot showing Cord&#8217;s integration with Typeform (Image credits: Cord)</p></div></p>
<p>Information workers of the world who already find themselves struggling to stay on top of all the channels they need to check for Slack-style notifications, pings and other digital chatter should prepare for this kinda of social noise to get exponentially worse; essentially it could end up like omnipresent background radiation &#8212; spread across every piece of business software.</p>
<p>Commenting on Cord&#8217;s raise in a statement, Jan Hammer, partner at Index Ventures, predicted resistance to this trend will nonetheless be futile.</p>
<p>“The growth of remote working, combined with a proliferation of software-as-a-service tools, means that teams lose time moving back and forth between productivity and communications applications, such as Slack. Cord allows users to stay within the app that best supports their workflow but still get the benefits of collaboration,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;We like that Cord adds to existing apps – it’s not yet another solution customers will have to adopt, it’s a solution inside what they’re already used to. Eventually, we believe SaaS tools will ship with Cord straight out of the box.”</p>
<p><span class="il">Cord&#8217;s pitch is that its API </span>saves companies &#8220;years&#8221; of development time by making it super simple for them to add a social dimension &#8212; and thereby steal a competitive march on more siloed peers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Most web products will become a multiplayer experience in the coming years,” suggests Nimrod Priell, <span class="il">Cord</span>’s CEO and co-founder, in a statement. “We already see it happening: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/figma-raises-50-million-series-d-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">Figma</a> reached 4 million users in 4 years and decimated Adobe, Invision and Sketch to become the dominant prototyping design app &#8212; in major part thanks to its built-in collaboration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;If Figma is the ‘Google Docs of design,’ we empower every product to become the Google Docs of their respective industries.”</p>
<p>Priell is a former Facebook product manager. While another Cord co-founder, Jackson Gabbard, who is also its CTO, was an early Facebook engineer who worked on some formative features of its platform and an internal suite of tools used by tens of thousands of Facebook employees.</p>
<p>On the competitive front, Cord is not the only startup trying to sell other companies a easy route to adding real-time collaborative features &#8212; it points to <a href="http://roomservice.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://roomservice.dev/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633611719004000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcNpzuLuTkVE6cLEhEmdIt_ksPfw">roomservice.dev</a> as another team building similar APIs, for example.</p>
<p>There are other startup too, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/liveblocks-is-an-api-that-lets-you-add-real-time-collaboration-to-your-product/">Liveblocks</a> &#8212; or, at the lower level of the collaboration pipe, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/ably-raises-70-million-for-its-developer-platform-that-enables-realtime-features/">Ably</a>.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/google-launches-drive-realtime-api-to-let-developers-build-apps-with-real-time-collaboration/">Google has been offering an API</a> for devs to add Google Docs-style collaboration to their own apps for the best part of a decade.</p>
<p>But Cord also argues its main competition is internal dev efforts to build collaboration tools in-house &#8212; making a SaaS-style pitch to other businesses not to bother investing precious time and money away from their &#8220;core experience and mission&#8221;, and instead outsource the building of a &#8220;high quality communication experience&#8221;, which integrates with core services like Slack and Teams and is kept up to date by a dedicated team of API builders, to yet another third party provider.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Since its launch a year ago, the company has grown 32% month over month, has approximately 1,000 brand clients and processed over 500,000 orders.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://pidedirecto.mx/">PideDirecto</a>, a Mexico-based company, is developing a platform that enables local businesses in Latin America to sell directly to their consumers and deliver orders in less than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Hussein Fawzi and Ronni Samir launched the company with Anders Steiner and Antonio Nacoud in September 2020. Fawzi, Samir and Nacoud knew each other from Iraq and studied together in college in Sweden, which is where they met Steiner.</p>
<p>After going their separate ways for a bit, they met up in Mexico and launched a corporate wellness program in 2018 that connected people with restaurants to order lunch or snacks. During the pandemic, many of their customers were working from home, and the demand for home deliveries went from 10% to 80%.</p>
<p>At the same time, customers were telling Fawzi and Samir that 25 to 30% of every sale was going to delivery marketplaces, something that was difficult to sustain. They were also at the mercy of the drivers and reliant on the marketplaces for their deliveries.</p>
<p>“That is when we started PideDirecto, to enable local businesses to scale their direct-to-consumer sales channels,” Fawzi said. “We build the online storefronts for the brands and operate logistics for businesses, like pharmacies, local retailers, restaurants and CPG brands. Think of us as Shopify with 30-minute deliveries.”</p>

<p>Today, the company announced an oversubscribed $5.25 million round of seed funding, led by JAM FUND, with participation from Soma Capital, Acacia Ventures, Kube VC, Flexport, Y Combinator and a group of individual investors from companies including Grubhub, Jeeves, Par Technologies, Uber and Google.</p>
<p>“PideDirecto is making it simple and cost effective for brands to build a scalable direct to consumer sales channel within minutes,” Justin Mateen, founder of JAM FUND, said via email. “I am excited to support the team’s mission to empower brands to expand their reach and own their customer relationship.“</p>
<p>Since its launch a year ago, the company has grown 32% month over month, has approximately 1,000 brand clients and has processed more than 500,000 orders.</p>
<p>PideDirecto charges customers like a SaaS model, with pricing starting at $1,900 a month, which includes delivery service and marketing tools. Other levels include a website, unlimited ordering and advanced marketing tools. Delivery fees are paid by the consumer, Fawzi said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While there are delivery services and ordering apps in Latin America, Samir added that very few third-party companies are offering a complete suite of products. This enables companies to be on marketplaces, but to own every sales channel and provide the same level of customer service no matter what communication method is being used.</p>
<p>“Their business is to sell, but many people don’t realize that logistics and e-commerce are two different businesses,” Samir added.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used to build out a technology team for future product features. PideDirecto will also look into marketing and to scale its presence in Mexico as well as expanding into new countries, like Colombia and Costa Rica, by the end of next year.</p>
<p>As it now gears up to raise a Series A round, Fawzi said the company’s aim is to build an all-in-one platform for businesses to manage and scale online sales. It is focusing on direct integration with marketplaces and onboarding brands into its operating system.</p>
<p>“The future of commerce is a hybrid one where you will have to service the client on every sales channel,” he added. “We are building out the necessary infrastructure that merchants need to do this and leveraging technology for the online storefront, the payment solutions, CRM data and marketing and logistics.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is launching a new website and app this fall with about 200 luxury retailers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luxury wholesale marketplace <a href="https://themaintab.com/tmt-landing/index.html">The Main Tab</a> is redesigning its platform following a $1 million pre-seed raise earlier this year from serial entrepreneur Jason Bright, who is now the company’s CTO.</p>
<p>The New York-based company is poised to launch the new website and app this fall with about 200 retailers, but has a waiting list of approximately 1,000 retailers, Liseda Shelegu, The Main Tab’s founder, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We have deployed a significant amount of the funding to the technology side to completely replatform our website from scratch,” she said. “We are the only marketplace that is sales rep-friendly. Sales reps write all of the orders and were initially one of our biggest roadblocks because of contracts, so we brought them on board and made them part of the company.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213711" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213711" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2213711" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg" alt="The Main Tab" width="1024" height="717" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg 3543w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=680,476 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=1536,1075 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1434 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213711" class="wp-caption-text">The Main Tab landing page. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Main Tab</p></div></p>
<p>Additional funding will go toward adding to its team of three, and sales and marketing, something Shelegu, who has a background in sales, was cautious about — not wanting to throw a bunch of money into advertising, so she connected with retailers, brands and sales reps the “old-school way” by reaching out directly.</p>
<p>One of the challenges the company is anticipating is inventory, she added. Inventory shortages and supply chain slowdowns that are plaguing e-commerce right now are affecting her retailers. For example, one owner said inventory of candles would be about 20% of the normal units due to not being able to source glass.</p>
<p>“When you are running a business, this will hugely impact us if we normally do $20,000 a month in October, but may do $5,000 because they don’t have the stock,” Shelegu said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shelegu jokes that much of The Main Tab’s product sourcing comes from her being a “shopaholic” and her background in brands. She also gets many targeted ads on social media and will connect with the owners, but she looks for retail price point, packaging and owner story.</p>
<p>Though there are 1,000 retailers vying to get on The Main Tab, the company approves about 30% of them, saving retail buyers time from sifting through thousands of SKUs. Brands are charged a commission when they receive orders from retailers and pay zero commission on any retailers they refer and currently work with. Retailers can also buy now and pay later and take advantage of other rewards based on their business status, Shelegu said.</p>
<p>The website features curated luxury brands, like Agraria and Bodewell Living, and enables them, independent sales reps and retailers to connect and conduct business from one website, Bright said via email.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way retail stores discover their products has changed in response to the global health crisis,” he added. “I am always looking to invest in companies that solve issues and was thrilled to invest and join the team as CTO.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Freelance marketplace Fiverr announced this morning that it’s acquiring Seattle-based online learning company CreativeLive for an undisclosed amount. CreativeLive is an entrepreneurial learning platform where users can attend courses on video, photography, design, business, marketing and more.</p>
<p>Fiverr, which is an online marketplace that connects businesses with on-demand freelancers, says that the ability to gain new skills in a changing work environment is part of its role in leading transformation for buyers and sellers on its platform.</p>
<p>​​“Fiverr is more than just a work platform, we fundamentally believe in supporting the entire freelance lifestyle, and that includes professional education and training,” said Fiverr founder and CEO Micha Kaufman in a statement. “The acquisition of CreativeLive is part of this broader strategy. The depth and caliber of the courses that CreativeLive offers are exceptional and we look forward to offering them to our entire community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company notes that CreativeLive’s instructors include a diverse group of Pulitzer Prize, Grammy and Oscar winners, along with New York Times best-selling authors and notable entrepreneurs. Fiverr states that CreativeLive’s expertise in creating compelling learning experiences is a natural fit for its platform.</p>
<p>CreativeLive will remain a standalone service and grow its team from its current headquarters in Seattle. Fiverr’s current online learning platform, Fiverr Learn, will be folded into CreativeLive as it works to expand its offerings following the acquisition.</p>
<p>“The future favors people and companies that can create, innovate and adapt to a fast-paced, work environment,” said CreativeLive founder and CEO Chase Jarvis in a statement. “We are excited to be part of the Fiverr family and to grow our inventory of compelling courses that increase economic opportunity for our community, the Fiverr community and today’s modern workforce.”</p>
<p>CreativeLive was founded in 2010 with the aim to “sit at the intersection of the future of creativity, learning, and of work” and to fill the gap that exists in online courses for creative professionals. Since then, the company has offered over 2,000 classes that have reached over 10 million users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fiverr, which was also founded in 2010, says four million customers bought services from freelancers on its platform across more than 160 countries in its latest fiscal year. Additionally, the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/fiverr-files-to-go-public/"> company filed to go public</a> on the NYSE in 2019.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Fiverr expanded<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/fiverr-subscriptions/"> beyond project-based payments</a> with the launch of three- or six-month subscriptions. Through this feature, sellers on Fiverr can offer to provide a defined set of work each month. The buyer or seller can cancel at any time without having to pay fees on the remaining months of the subscription</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.ridezum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ridezum.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633609606207000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-VSxGduL1Si65T9JDcEUO2CiIhg">Zūm</a>, a startup that provides optimized transportation services for school-age children, has announced the close of a $130 million Series D raise, bringing its total funding to more than $200 million. The company intends to use the funds to add 10,000 new electric vehicles to its platform with the end goal of achieving 100% EVs by 2025.</p>
<p>In anticipation of having a large number of batteries parked during off-peak hours, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/zum-ceo-ritu-narayan-explains-why-equity-and-accessibility-works-for-mobility-services/">Zūm recently partnered with AutoGrid</a>, which provides energy management and distribution software, to transform its fleet into a giant virtual power plant that gives energy back to the grid.</p>
<p>The Series D funding, which is led by Softbank Vision Fund 2 with participation from existing investors including Sequoia and BMW i Ventures, comes just a few months after Zūm was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/zum-wins-150m-from-san-francisco-schools-to-modernize-and-electrify-student-transport/">awarded a $150 million contract</a> to modernize the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) transportation service. Zūm also hopes to use the capital to further expand into new markets and districts, according to the company.</p>
<p>School transportation hasn&#8217;t changed much in the last century, despite the fact that it&#8217;s often referred to as the nation&#8217;s largest mass transit system. More than <a href="http://www.ncbussafety.org/lovethebusnc/documents/LovetheBusFacts_ae.pdf">26 million children</a> in the U.S. ride the bus every day, and it&#8217;s likely still an outdated yellow bus that coughs out diesel fuel as it travels on inefficient, untracked routes. Zūm&#8217;s service aims to bring that system to 2021 and beyond by distributing buses, vans and cars around school districts in ways that save transit time and address students with special needs, as well as using its advanced fleet management program to optimize logistics.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started out as a company for parents to directly schedule rides for their kids, yet we knew there was an opportunity to build on our success and expand our services to the entire system,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Ritu Narayan said in a statement. &#8220;Today, we are taking a huge step forward in solving the systemic issues that have plagued school transportation. We’re modernizing the entire system because we believe schools, parents, kids and drivers all deserve better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Transportation is one of a school district&#8217;s biggest costs. By correcting inefficiencies like circuitous routes and rigid schedules, Zūm has been able to save school districts like SFUSD $3 million per year on average, according to the company. It has already worked with 4,000 schools throughout California, Seattle, Chicago and Dallas, and is planning to expand its service to 12 states over the coming years, with an eye on Washington, D.C., as its next target.</p>
<p>“Using data and technology, we believe Zūm is modernizing school transportation by offering better services, efficiency and sustainability — while increasing safety for children,” Andrew Straub, investment director at Softbank Investment Advisers, said in a statement. “We are impressed with the immediate impact that Zūm has made for school districts who have deployed its service across their entire network of schools over the past year, including significant cost savings.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four search engine rivals to Google have called on European Union lawmakers to address the tech giant&#8217;s continued dominance of the market by setting rules for search engine preference menus, arguing that the tech giant&#8217;s ability to set damaging defaults is continuing to limit how easily consumers can switch to a non-Google alternatives.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://ddg-staticcdn.s3.amazonaws.com/press/2110_Search_coalition_letter_calling_on_a_default_ban_in_DMA.pdf">open letter</a> today, the non-tracking search engines <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?va=b&amp;t=hc">DuckDuckGo </a>and <a href="https://www.qwant.com/?l=en">Qwant</a>, along with tech-for-good focused <a href="https://www.lilo.org">Lilo</a> and tree-planting not-for-profit <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/?c=en">Ecosia</a>, urge the region&#8217;s lawmakers to go further to tackle platform giants&#8217; market power.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DMA [Digital Markets Act] urgently needs to be adapted to prevent gatekeepers from suppressing search engine competition,&#8221; they write. &#8220;Specifically, the DMA should enshrine in law a requirement for a search engine preference menu that would effectively ban Google from acquiring default search access points of the operating systems and the browsers of gatekeepers. Moreover, the DMA should ensure that, in addition to selecting their preferred search default in initial onboarding, consumers are able to one-click switch at any time via prompts from competing search engine apps or websites. These actions would finally lead to significant implications for competition in the search engine market and ensure there is real consumer choice online.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission presented the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Digital Markets Act</a> at the end of last year &#8212; proposing a fixed set of ex ante rules for so-called Internet &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; with the aim of ensuring that these intermediating Internet giants cannot abuse their power to crush competitors and squeeze consumers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out its plan to reboot digital rules and tame tech giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/embed/#?secret=Yw4USB9tqe" data-secret="Yw4USB9tqe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However the four Google search rivals say the proposed legislation doesn&#8217;t currently contain any measured that will help break the tech giant&#8217;s continued dominance of search in Europe (where it has <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/europe">around 93%</a>) &#8212; hence their call for<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> EU lawmakers to make amendments to add binding rules for search preference screens so that consumers always have an effortless ability to switch their default search engine choice, whether on mobile or desktop.</span></p>
<p>While the Commission was responsible for the original draft of the DMA, the EU&#8217;s other core institutions &#8212; the European Parliament and Member States, via the EU Council &#8212; have to agree on the details so negotiations over the exact shape of the regulation are continuing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We welcome the Commission’s goals with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) but t</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he DMA fails to address the most acute barrier in search: Google’s hoarding of default positions,&#8221; the four search rivals also write. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Google would not have become the overall market gatekeeper they are today without years of locking up these defaults. If the DMA fails to address this fundamental issue, we believe the status quo will continue, leaving the root cause of this problem unchanged.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Google has been contacted for comment on the claims.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, the EU&#8217;s competition commission fined Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">$5BN </a>over antitrust abuses in how it operates its Android smartphone platform.</p>
<p>Following that intervention the tech giant introduced a regional search preference screen that was shown on set-up of a new Android smartphone in Europe. However Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-to-auction-slots-on-android-default-search-choice-screen-in-europe-next-year-rivals-cry-pay-to-play-foul/">quickly implemented a sealed bids auction model</a> that required rivals to pay it (and outbid each other) to appear in one of the available slots which competitors immediately decried it as unfair and non-transparent.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google to auction slots on Android default search &#8216;choice screen&#8217; in Europe next year, rivals cry &#8216;pay-to-play&#8217; foul&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-to-auction-slots-on-android-default-search-choice-screen-in-europe-next-year-rivals-cry-pay-to-play-foul/embed/#?secret=PR1NsweN4r" data-secret="PR1NsweN4r" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Some three years later, following another intervention by the Commission &#8212; and after absolutely no dent in Google&#8217;s search marketshare in Europe &#8212; the tech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/">finally announced</a> it would drop the auction model, replacing it with a choice screen that displays eligible search rivals without requiring a fee.</p>
<p>But, again, rivals quickly pointed out continuing limitations with Google&#8217;s &#8216;remedy&#8217; &#8212; such as the fact it only applies to mobile devices, not to users of Google&#8217;s browser Chrome on desktop devices; and the fact that Android users are only shown the choice screen on set-up or at a factory reset, so most of the time they use a device they do not see it.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/duckduckgo-presses-the-case-for-true-one-click-search-competition-on-android/">DuckDuckGo</a>, for example, has been loudly pressing the case for a &#8216;truly fair&#8217; search choice that only requires one click for consumers to switch &#8212; not the <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/one-click-away/">15+ clicks</a> it says it takes to switch default search engine on an Android device currently at any other point after initial set up (or a factory reset).</p>
<p>Using such dark patterns to lock in self-preferencing defaults is something that should be proscribed by EU law, the search rivals argue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google-imposed limitations make it hard for consumers to adopt other search engines, despite the Commission’s antitrust decision,&#8221; they argue. &#8220;Like MEP Yon-Courtin proposed in her <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/ECON-PA-693930_EN.pdf">draft report</a> for the Economic Affairs committee, we believe a properly-designed preference menu should be mandated more broadly.&#8221;</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the Commission for comment on the call for dedicated search preference screen rules to be baked into the DMA and will update this report with any response.</p>
<h2>Where&#8217;s the remedy?</h2>
<p>The European Commission has &#8212; for years &#8212; shied away from imposing specific remedies on Google, despite a string of antitrust enforcements. Instead EU lawmakers have typically said it is up to Google to figure out exactly how to comply with its various orders to cease infringements in areas like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/">product search</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/google-fined-1-49bn-in-europe-for-antitrust-violations-in-search-ad-brokering/">search ad brokering</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">Android</a>.</p>
<p>The result of such a hands-off approach by the EU&#8217;s executive is that Google has been able to find ways to maintain its dominance of key strategic markets like search &#8212; <em>in spite of</em> a string of high profile antitrust enforcements in Europe.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an uncomfortable record for the EU&#8217;s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, who has carved out a reputation as the &#8216;iron lady&#8217; willing to take on Big Tech &#8212; yet whose enforcements in the digital sphere haven&#8217;t actually moved the needle on platform giants&#8217; market share. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">Nor blocked Google from continued consolidation</a>.)</p>
<p>However some EU Member States are starting to take a much more hands on approach to reigning in big tech&#8217;s market abuse which looks like it will have an impact.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s competition authority, for example, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">extracted a series of interoperability requirements</a> from Google in a case related to self-preferencing of its adtech.</p>
<p>While Germany&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office started this year armed with beefed-up powers to impose ex ante remedies on digital giants that are deemed to have substantial market power. It&#8217;s now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">in the process of assessing whether Google</a> &#8212; and a number of other tech giants &#8212; meet that bar. If it finds they do it looks eager to get to work setting pre-emptive rules for how they can operate in Germany.</p>
<p>Outside the EU, the UK is also reforming domestic competition rules to clip Big Tech&#8217;s wings. It&#8217;s in the process of shaping an ex ante regime for digital giants with what it describes as &#8220;strategic market status&#8221; &#8212; that, unlike the Commission&#8217;s approach with the DMA, won&#8217;t be one-sized fits all.</p>
<p>Instead the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">UK has said it wants to tailor rules to the specific business</a> &#8212; which would give its regulators more leeway to, for example, impose a search preference menu remedy on a firm like Google if they decide such a step is necessary.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s centralized single set of rules for Big Tech does, therefore, look like it could end up being a weak tool in the face of extremely well resourced &#8216;innovators&#8217; who have years of experience building and iterating services that are designed to eliminate friction and topple barriers to greater scale.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s executive risks being caught flat-footed on the issue of tech antitrust at a time when lawmakers all around the world are fired up and active on the issue &#8212; from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/global-antitrust-gaining-serious-momentum/">China to the US</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to note how, in the wake of a very bad week for (another tech giant:) Facebook, including Congressional testimony by the latest tech whistleblower, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Francis Haugen</a>, EU commissioners were falling over themselves to tweet about their &#8220;urgency&#8221; to tackle Big Tech&#8230;</p>

<p>Antitrust chief Vestager also tweeted in the wake of the global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">Facebook outage</a> &#8212; which was also an Instagram and a WhatsApp outage, since all three social services run on the same infrastructure, all being owned by Facebook &#8212; with the EU&#8217;s EVP saying the episode demonstrated the need for &#8220;alternatives and choices in the tech market&#8221;.</p>
<p>Given that headline anti-consolidation message, EU citizens might be forgiven for asking why Vestager&#8217;s department hasn&#8217;t blocked a single tech acquisition &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/europe-urged-to-block-google-fitbit-ahead-of-major-digital-policy-overhaul/">Google&#8217;s recent gobbling of health tech company Fitbit</a>?</p>
<p>How exactly does Vestager propose to support startups and alternatives in gaining the necessary scale to challenge platform giants?</p>
<p>Sadly her tweet didn&#8217;t contain any solutions &#8212; so the search for a remedy goes on.</p>

<p>It also remains to be seen where the Commission&#8217;s next Google antitrust investigation will go.</p>
<p>This summer the bloc&#8217;s executive confirmed it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">looking into the tech giant&#8217;s adtech</a> &#8212; lagging antitrust interventions already been taken elsewhere in the region, including in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/"> the UK</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">France</a>.</p>
<p>As for Google, the tech giant has been busy fighting the Commission&#8217;s existing antitrust enforcements against it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-tells-court-staggering-5-bln-eu-antitrust-fine-flawed-2021-09-30/">Last week </a>its lawyers were up in court for their appeal against the Commission&#8217;s $5BN Android antitrust fine &#8212; claiming that penalty was based on flawed calculations, was not &#8220;appropriate&#8221; and that it had not had any anti-competitive intent.</p>
