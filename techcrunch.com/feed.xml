										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration has officially appointed Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel acting FCC chairwoman, and she very well may be the first woman to hold the official position if she is nominated for it later this year, as many expect. With her record of standing for equal access, industry accountability and net neutrality, Rosenworcel&#8217;s FCC will be very different from her predecessor&#8217;s.</p>
<p>(<strong>Update</strong>: This article previously stated that Rosenworcel would be the first acting FCC chairwoman, but the formidable <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/04/fcc-commissioner-mignon-clyburn-talks-privacy-compromise-and-connecting-communities/">Mignon Clyburn</a> briefly held the acting role in 2013 while Tom Wheeler was being confirmed. If nominated and confirmed, Rosenworcel would be the first nonacting chairwoman.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I am honored to be designated as the acting chairwoman of the Federal Communications Commission by President Biden.  I thank the president for the opportunity to lead an agency with such a vital mission and talented staff. It is a privilege to serve the American people and work on their behalf to expand the reach of communications opportunity in the digital age,&#8221; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>While Rosenworcel&#8217;s agenda will be made clear over the coming weeks and months, it is likely we will see the return of net neutrality from the shallow grave dug for it by Ajit Pai, and probably a new effort to better understand where in the country actually needs help getting broadband to those who need it, and how to do so quickly and equitably. Her first items of business, however, will likely pertain to getting internet access to those most affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p><em> (Disclosure: The FCC regulates TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company, Verizon, but this has no effect on our coverage.)</em></p>
<p>Rosenworcel first started at the FCC in 2003 and filled other federal communications regulation roles over the years. She was nominated for commissioner by President Obama in 2011 (confirmed in 2012), and was in the running for chair in 2013, though Tom Wheeler ended up taking the spot. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/fcc-fills-vacant-seats-as-jessica-rosenworcel-and-brendan-carr-are-confirmed-by-senate/">Her second term as commissioner began in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout her tenure at the FCC Rosenworcel has pushed for net neutrality and improved broadband access for schools and economically disadvantaged areas. During Ajit Pai&#8217;s tumultuous term as chairman she offered implacable resistance to what she saw as an unjustified hands-off approach to regulating telecoms, and a fierce indictment of the FCC&#8217;s failure to act in the best interest of the people it serves. Here are a few examples.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5VyW69huXa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/the-fcc-officially-votes-to-kill-net-neutrality/">The FCC officially votes to kill net neutrality</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The FCC officially votes to kill net neutrality&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/the-fcc-officially-votes-to-kill-net-neutrality/embed/#?secret=5VyW69huXa" data-secret="5VyW69huXa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At the 2017 vote killing net neutrality, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/the-fcc-officially-votes-to-kill-net-neutrality/">Rosenworcel was unsparing in voicing her fury</a> at the shadiness of the entire rule-making process:</p>
<blockquote><p>I dissent from this rash decision to roll back net neutrality rules. I dissent from the corrupt process that has brought us to this point. And I dissent from the contempt this agency has shown our citizens in pursuing this path today. This decision puts the Federal Communications Commission on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of the law and the wrong side of the American public.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2018, with an epidemic of robocalling growing by the month, she contradicted Pai&#8217;s claim that a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/fcc-slaps-robocaller-with-record-120m-fine-but-its-like-emptying-the-ocean-with-a-teaspoon/">$120 million fine</a> (almost certainly never collected) for one offender proved there was a &#8220;cop on the beat&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today the FCC adopts a forfeiture order to impose a penalty on one operation that made tens of millions of robocalls two years ago.  I support it. But let’s be honest: Going after a single bad actor is emptying the ocean with a teaspoon — and right now we’re all wet.</p></blockquote>
<p>That the industry <em>still</em> has not widely adopted the framework that would nip robocalls in the bud is testament to this, though they should soon after the FCC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/fcc-mandates-strict-caller-id-authentication-to-beat-back-robocalls/">finally got in gear</a>. (This year she also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/10/its-time-to-chart-a-course-for-5g-success/">contributed a piece to TechCrunch to call for immediate action on the rollout of 5G</a>.)</p>

<p>In 2019, Rosenworcel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/a-year-after-outcry-carriers-are-finally-stopping-sale-of-location-data-letters-to-fcc-show/">called out the agency&#8217;s seeming lack of concern</a> about a major loophole in telecoms regulation that allowed every mobile service vendor to essentially sell real-time location data to anyone willing to pay for it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FCC has been totally silent about press reports that for a few hundred dollars shady middlemen can sell your location within a few hundred meters based on your wireless phone data. That’s unacceptable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Her office released letters to the agency from the major carriers as a stopgap measure to inform people. When the FCC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/carriers-violated-federal-law-by-selling-your-location-data-fcc-tells-congress/">finally formally moved against the practice</a>, she noted, &#8220;It’s a shame that it took so long for the FCC to reach a conclusion that was so obvious.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2020, Rosenworcel raised for the nth time the FCC&#8217;s lack of good data concerning broadband deployment in the country. The problem had rankled for years but was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/fcc-dings-company-for-164k-after-its-false-broadband-claims-distorted-national-report/">highlighted by a spectacular failure to vet industry data</a> provided more or less on the honor system, which ended up throwing off numbers nationally:</p>
<blockquote><p>This should have set off alarm bells at the FCC. In fact, agency staff reached out to the company nearly a dozen times over multiple years, including after this suspect data was filed. Despite these efforts behind the scenes, on February 19, 2019, the FCC used the erroneous data filed by BarrierFree in a press release, claiming great progress in closing the nation’s digital divide. When an outside party pointed out this was based on fraudulent information, the FCC was forced to revise its claim.</p></blockquote>
<p>An embarrassing demonstration of how poor the current system is. Of the broadband report itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/fccs-broadband-deployment-report-called-fundamentally-at-odds-with-reality/">she had written earlier</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This report deserves a failing grade. Putting aside the embarrassing fumble of the FCC blindly accepting incorrect data for the original version of this report, there are serious problems with its basic methodology. Time and again this agency has acknowledged the grave limitations of the data we collect to assess broadband deployment.</p></blockquote>
<p>After all, if the FCC doesn&#8217;t know who actually is getting decent broadband and who isn&#8217;t, how can they direct funds to help bridge that gap?</p>
<p>Lastly, late in 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/with-absurd-timing-fcc-announces-intention-to-revisit-section-230/">when Pai caved to administration pressure</a> to reevaluate the hugely important Section 230, which limits the liability of internet platforms for the content posted on them, Rosenworcel once again summed up the situation simply and honestly:</p>
<blockquote><p>The timing of this effort is absurd. The FCC has no business being the president’s speech police.</p></blockquote>
<p>This abortive attempt to weaken Section 230 never had legs to begin with and will not be pursued further, according to an FCC source.</p>
<p>These are only a handful of the more high-profile moments of Rosenworcel&#8217;s latest term, and in fact it is something of a disservice to list just them. The work of an FCC commissioner, their staff and the bureaus they rely on, is largely obscure and technical, with moments like those listed above more the exception than the rule.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/senate-confirms-nathan-simington-as-fcc-commissioner-potentially-setting-up-years-of-stonewalling/">last-minute confirmation of Republican Commissioner Nathan Simington</a>, the FCC is currently at a 2-2 in its normally 3-2 partisan makeup in favor of the presiding administration. Since Democrats won both Senate seats in Georgia, the feared deadlock will likely be avoided, with a fifth commissioner nominated and confirmed in short order so that work can begin. We&#8217;ll know more about Rosenworcel&#8217;s priorities and agenda soon.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Regulators may still want to imply Bitcoin is merely a tool for criminals, but for many middle-class users, it’s proving to be a lifeline.</p>
<p>Even as politicians like European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde criticize cryptocurrency for providing &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1349341678335893504"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loopholes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; used for “funny business,” people like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saeed, an Iranian immigrant to France, see cryptocurrency as a necessity, because of the difficulty using mainstream financial systems.</span></p>
<p>Until 2020, Saeed, who asked to be identified only by his first name, was a software engineer in Iran whose salary barely reached €300 due to <a href="https://www.iranfocus.com/en/economy/46057-irans-poor-economic-outlook/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rampant inflation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2017, he started freelancing for international clients that paid him in Bitcoin. By September 2020, he’d finally saved enough Bitcoin to go to graduate school in France. However, the pandemic made his immigration process much harder.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I passed all that strange bureaucracy and to get to a course in France last September, with only €1,000 in my pocket,” Saeed said. “HSBC, Banque Nationale de Paris, La Banque Postale, all rejected me, declining to open a bank account. I finally found a bank after a month.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Saeed used Bitcoin. He is exactly the type of person who benefits from “loopholes” in the traditional banking system.</p>
<p>“Many people in Iran are working with European tech companies,” Saeed said. “Maybe I can’t buy Bitcoin directly from the exchange because of my nationality.”</p>
<p>Saeed thinks Lagarde represents bankers’ and government interests, not average citizens, who are happy to work with him. He said stricter regulations would make his access to the financial system more time-consuming and expensive, because he’d have to pay friends and colleagues to transact on his behalf. However, Iranian migrants are hardly the sole user group relying on Bitcoin during the pandemic.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, a British expat named Paul found himself trapped in London when flights back to his Asian country of residence got canceled. Due to tight capital controls in his former country, and the challenges of repatriation during constant lockdowns, Paul was living in between regulatory systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;I closed down the business [in Asia] just before the pandemic started. My father passed away and it was difficult to continue my company,&#8221; Paul said. &#8220;I was in hotels and Airbnbs for weeks and didn’t have a residential address&#8230;without Bitcoin I would have been locked out of cash. I could only take money out of the ATM for a certain number of months because it’s limited to holidays.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luckily, Paul had a little Bitcoin from earlier that year. Unlike Saeed, he didn’t feel comfortable with the technical aspects, but he learned quickly. He used Bitcoin to buy gift cards for groceries, phone bills, hotels and Uber, plus paid a friend back in Asia to help wrap up his apartment and put things in storage.</p>
<p>“I think it was generally a bad idea but, at least with Brexit, thank god we won’t be subject to whatever Lagarde does,” Paul said, adding that regulation can be beneficial if it avoids restrictions for people who don’t have banking access.</p>
<p>Today, almost a year later, Paul still doesn’t have access to most of his financial accounts. Instead, he downloaded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/monzo-the-u-k-challenger-bank-picks-up-additional-60m-in-funding/">Monzo</a>, a banking app that uses passports for identity verification instead of residential addresses. He pays friends in London to deposit to his Monzo account.</p>
<p>“It becomes really convoluted. I primarily use crypto because it’s easier,” Paul said. “One of my friends is a student from Nigeria and had a similar experience. He used Bitcoin to pay his school fees… I’ve been at my current residence for a couple of months, so I would be able to finally open a bank account. But now I don’t really see the need, especially with the news of negative interest rates.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the fiat-denominated price of Bitcoin<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/bitcoin-passes-20k-and-reaches-all-time-high/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the past six months. This provided Saeed and Paul both with a little extra capital to spend time figuring out what they want to do next. For Saeed, does it make sense to do the graduate program online, with fewer networking benefits and hands-on experiences (the reason he came to France)? How does Paul move forward with his career now that his family business closed and his sector (music marketing) is in shambles? </span></p>

<p>Buying Bitcoin could be considered a form of gambling. Indeed, many <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/normies-crypto-rich-defi"><span style="font-weight: 400;">middle-class hobbyist traders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accrued life-changing amounts of wealth over the past year, usually by experimenting with risky software. For people like Paul and Saeed, who generally avoid experimental trades and lack alternative investment options, Bitcoin’s price appreciation is helping them get through a period of abysmal job markets and intermittent lockdowns. People don’t need to live in a dictatorship or a country suffering from high inflation to benefit from Bitcoin. I would know; I’m one of them. </span></p>
<p>Like many people during the pandemic, my living situation changed dramatically and I initially couldn’t work full-time from home. I was lucky to sell a few poems in exchange for cryptocurrency, usually via direct messages and Bitcoin wallets or as <a href="https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:2855:0x2b555c64f7bdf8d26a0d4065ce872e6ce1830257?tab=owners"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital collectibles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through </span><a href="https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:1133:0x8124b02b4967bd7338a450420a572d574915ff9c?tab=owners"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collaborations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><a href="https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:7408:0xbdceed3d7ec60ecf9fb50215e767ca51daa96f01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tech-savvy artists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then the bull market surged again, sending those meager earnings high enough to cover some of my bills. A valet worker and student in Kansas named Hess had a similar experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quarantine helped kill his relationship of six years and he found himself needing to move out. He put his savings into Bitcoin during spring 2020, so that by December he was able to move out.</span></span></p>
<p>“COVID hit and I was out of steady work for four months,” Hess said. “Honestly, if it wasn&#8217;t for my decision to basically throw 70% of my net worth into Bitcoin, I don&#8217;t think I would be in as good of a place mentally and financially.”</p>
<p>To be clear, that is an extremely risky financial move and I would not advise it as a first resort. Yet, for many people experiencing unexpected change due to COVID-19, Bitcoin has become the lifeline it was for Hess.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Bitcoin donations may have gained popularity with several American communities, including some of the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/bitcoin-and-alt-right"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremist groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involved with storming Capitol Hill. Incoming </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/janet-yellen-says-cryptocurrencies-are-a-concern-in-terrorist-financing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> echoed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lagarde’s concerns about Bitcoin being used for criminal activities.</span></p>
<p>However, so far, the analytics company <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/extremist-crypto-donations-chainalysis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such donations add up to roughly </span><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/capitol-riot-bitcoin-donation-alt-right-domestic-extremism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$522,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These numbers might also be compared to the cumulative totals managed by other subjects referenced in this article. For yet another lawful example, Lawrence Douglas, a former operations director at an event security company in California, lost his job as a result of the pandemic.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Biden administration can change the world with new crypto regulations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/the-biden-administration-can-change-the-world-with-new-crypto-regulations/embed/#?secret=yZa0akVjAX" data-secret="yZa0akVjAX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Cash App pretty much changed my financial life,” Douglas said. “Bitcoin prices during the calendar year of 2020 provided me with lots of wiggle room, while I currently search for a new job.”</p>
<p>As an unemployed Black man, he was <a href="https://www.ellevest.com/magazine/investing/investing-and-systemic-racism">statistically less likely to have connections who could help him learn about stocks or precious metals</a>, for example. He said Bitcoin, comparatively, has a “low barrier to entry.” In April 2020, he turned his stimulus check into a little Bitcoin nest egg. By November, he was utilizing a strategy called dollar-cost averaging, routinely buying small amounts of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Douglas, like Paul, first bought cryptocurrency during the pandemic. On the other hand, when I interviewed more than a dozen Bitcoin users across Europe and North America for this article, most of them were crypto veterans who said Bitcoin gave them “peace” during the year-long crisis. Anesthesiologist Quentin Lobb, for example, said “bottom line, our net worth grew tremendously in 2020, thanks to Bitcoin. It has provided a pleasant and exciting sense of financial security.”</p>
<p>Yet another crypto veteran, Texas real estate agent broker Brandon Arnold, said the national political and economic situation was more “mentally taxing than ever before.” Against that backdrop, controlling a fraction of his own wealth gives him a sense of security. The price appreciation helps too, to be sure, though it’s not why Bitcoin is now so popular with middle-class users.</p>
<p>“If I factor in the risk of not having access to my capital, the price volatility doesn’t really matter,” Paul said. “As long as the price of Bitcoin doesn’t go to zero, it’s still more useful for me than the other options available.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://omnipresent.com">Omnipresent</a>, which helps companies employ remote-working local teams worldwide, has closed a $15.8 million Series A funding round. The fundraise was led by an undisclosed investor with participation from existing investors, Episode 1, Playfair Capital and Truesight Ventures. The company said it closed the round five months after its July 2020 $2 million seed round.</p>
<p>Founders Matthew Wilson and Guenther Eisinger started the company as part of Entrepreneur First’s London cohort in 2019.</p>
<p>Omnipresent says it ensures the process of remote-hiring costs a fraction of what it would if the company did it on their own, by using Omnipresent&#8217;s platform to onboard employees compliantly in 150 countries. It provides employees with local contracts, tax contributions, and local and international benefits such as health insurance, pensions and equity options.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a joint statement, Guenther Eisinger and Matthew Wilson, co-CEOs of Omnipresent said: “Even before the pandemic we recognized the revolutionary potential of breaking down legal and administrative barriers of international employment. As former business owners, we had firsthand experience of what a headache it is to navigate the complexity and bureaucracy of building global teams. Now with the pandemic and the global shift toward remote working it’s confirmed that we are on the right track.”</p>
<p>Wilson told me in an interview: “For instance, in Canada, we have a Canadian entity and we enter into an employment relationship with that person in Canada, on behalf of our client, so they don&#8217;t have to set up any of the legal infrastructure themselves in Canada, or any of the 149 countries that we operate in. We then manage all the ongoing administration of the employment relationship, whether that&#8217;s from an HR perspective, from an employee benefits perspective, or if they want to get health care for instance.”</p>
<p>The company competes with other firms like Remote.com and Boundless HQ.</p>
<p>Carina Namih, general partner at Episode 1 Ventures commented: “While talent is evenly distributed around the world, for too long, opportunities have not been. I have experienced firsthand the challenge of hiring globally. Omnipresent has already become a crucial piece of infrastructure for global teams working across different countries.”</p>
<p>Joe Thornton, general partner at Playfair Capital commented: “Remote work undoubtedly represents the future of the modern workforce. The sooner companies adapt, the sooner they will reap the massive competitive advantage associated with a globally distributed workforce, including increased workforce productivity and satisfaction and a larger and more diverse pool of talent from which to recruit workers.”</p>
<p>Omnipresent said its own employer surveys show that over 85% of employers will be employing remote or international employees in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instacart plans to lay off nearly 2,000 of its workers, including the 10 workers from the Kroger-owned Mariano&#8217;s who unionized early last year, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9deg/instacart-says-it-will-lay-off-all-of-its-unionized-workers">Vice reports</a>. These workers are responsible for in-store shopping and packing of groceries.</p>
<p>According to Vice, 10 of the workers affected unionized with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1546 in Skokie, Illinois. However, they have yet to negotiate a contract with Instacart, according to Vice. Instacart notified the union of the planned changes earlier this week.<a href="https://www.ufcw.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/61/files/2021/01/Jan-2021-Instacart-Fires-Nearly-2000-Grocery-Workers.pdf"> In the letter</a>, Instacart said it planned to stop using in-store shoppers at Kroger-owned stores, which includes the Mariano&#8217;s store in Skokie, in Q1 and Q2 of this year, but no earlier than mid-March.</p>
<p>Currently, Instacart says it&#8217;s working to place the impacted employees with jobs at retailers or place them at other grocery stores that still rely on Instacart shoppers. In total, Instacart said about 1,800 employees will be affected by these changes. Those laid off will receive separation packages, according to Instacart. But according to UFCW, Instacart will provide between $250 to $750 to the workers they let go.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instacart <a href="https://medium.com/shopper-news/introducing-new-instacart-pickup-retailer-models-d9d5ef56d46f">referenced the potential layoffs in a blog post</a> earlier this week in a post about new pickup retailer model. In it, Instacart said it would wind down some of its in-store operations at some retail locations to switch to what it&#8217;s calling Partner Pick. Through Partner Pick, instead of relying on Instacart shoppers to pick and pack groceries, retailers will rely on their own workforces with the help of Instacart&#8217;s technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result of some grocers transitioning to a Partner Pick model, we’ll be winding down our in-store operations at select retailer locations over the coming months,&#8221; an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;We know this is an incredibly challenging time for many as we move through the COVID-19 crisis, and we’re doing everything we can to support in-store shoppers through this transition. This includes transferring impacted shoppers to other retailer locations where we have Instacart in-store shopper roles open, working closely with our retail partners to hire impacted shoppers for roles they’re looking to fill and providing shoppers with transition assistance as they explore new work opportunities. We’re also providing all impacted shoppers with separation packages based on their tenure with Instacart.&#8221;</p>
<p>This all comes as Instacart is gearing up to go public. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-instacart-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-instacart-taps-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-at-30-billion-valuation-sources-idUSKBN27S3AG">In November</a>, Reuters reported Instacart picked Goldman Sachs to lead its IPO at a $30 billion valuation. That would be a big jump from the $17.7 post-money valuation Instacart secured in October with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/instacart-raises-200m-more-at-17-7b-valuation/">new $200 million funding round</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ufcw.org/press-releases/ufcw-instacart-firing-grocery-workers-is-ruthless-attempt-to-eliminate-jobs-of-essential-workers-on-frontlines-of-covid-19-protecting-food-access-in-pandemic/">In a statement</a>, UFCW International president Marc Perrone called these workers a lifeline during the COVID-19 pandemic and called on Instacart to stop these plans to fire them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instacart firing the only unionized workers at the company and destroying the jobs of nearly 2,000 dedicated frontline workers in the middle of this public health crisis, is simply wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As the union for Instacart grocery workers in the Chicago area and grocery workers nationwide, UFCW is calling on Instacart to immediately halt these plans and to put the health of their customers first by protecting the jobs of these brave essential workers at a time when our communities need them most.&#8221;</p>

<p>DuVernay has directed theatrically released films including &#8220;Selma&#8221; and &#8220;A Wrinkle in Time,&#8221; but she also made &#8220;13th&#8221; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/26/when-they-see-us-viewership/">&#8220;When They See Us&#8221;</a> for Netflix, and she&#8217;s been an eloquent proponent for streaming as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/movies/ava-duvernay-movies.html">a more accessible way of telling her stories</a>.</p>
<p>Spotify says that through this multiyear partnership, Array will be creating exclusive scripted and unscripted programming for the streaming audio platform. For these productions, it will be working with Gimlet, the podcast network that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/spotify-doubles-down-on-podcasts/">Spotify acquired in 2019</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Recognizing the undeniable power of voice and sound, I’m thrilled to extend ARRAY’s storytelling into the realm of podcasts,” DuVernay said in a statement. “The opportunity to work with [Gimlet&#8217;s head of content] Lydia Polgreen and her passionate team drew us to Spotify as a home for our audio narratives and we couldn’t be more excited to begin this new creative journey.”</p>

<h3 id="google-says-solarwinds-exposure-limited-as-more-confirm-breaches">Google says SolarWinds exposure &#8220;limited,&#8221; more breaches confirmed</h3>
<p>The cyberattack against SolarWinds, an ongoing espionage campaign <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">already blamed on Russia</a>, claimed the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as <a href="https://www.bls.gov/bls/bureau-of-labor-statistics-security-statement.htm">another federal victim</a> this week. The attack also hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/marcin-kleczynski-message-boards-malwarebytes/">cybersecurity company Malwarebytes</a>, the company&#8217;s chief executive confirmed. Marcin Kleczynski said <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/malwarebytes-news/2021/01/malwarebytes-targeted-by-nation-state-actor-implicated-in-solarwinds-breach-evidence-suggests-abuse-of-privileged-access-to-microsoft-office-365-and-azure-environments/">in a blog post</a> that attackers gained access to a &#8220;limited&#8221; number of internal company emails. It was the same attackers as SolarWinds but using a different intrusion route. It&#8217;s now the third security company known to have been targeted by the same Russian hackers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cybersecurity-firm-fireeye-says-it-was-hacked-by-a-nation-state/">after a successful intrusion</a> at FireEye and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-crowdstrike-202000735.html">an unsuccessful attempt</a> at CrowdStrike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced Thursday that its newly established external policy review group will take on one of the company&#8217;s most consequential acts: The decision to suspend former President Trump.</p>
<p>On January 7, Facebook suspended Trump&#8217;s account indefinitely. That decision followed the president&#8217;s actions the day prior, when he incited a violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol, leaving American democracy on a razor&#8217;s edge and a nation already deep in crisis even more shaken.</p>
<p>Facebook VP of Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg called the circumstances around Trump&#8217;s suspension an &#8220;unprecedented set of events which called for unprecedented action&#8221; and explained why the Oversight Board would review the case.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our decision to suspend then-President Trump’s access was taken in extraordinary circumstances: A U.S. president actively fomenting a violent insurrection designed to thwart the peaceful transition of power; five people killed; legislators fleeing the seat of democracy,&#8221; <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/referring-trump-suspension-to-oversight-board/">Clegg said in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has never happened before — and we hope it will never happen again.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mark Zuckerberg announces Trump banned from Facebook and Instagram for &#8216;at least the next two weeks&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/embed/#?secret=tYid2KFmxF" data-secret="tYid2KFmxF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In its own <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/236821561313092-oversight-board-accepts-case-on-former-us-president-trump-s-indefinite-suspension-from-facebook-and-instagram/">statement on taking the case</a>, the Oversight Board explained that a five-member panel will evaluate the case soon with a decision planned within 90 days. Once that smaller group reaches its conclusions on how to handle Trump&#8217;s Facebook status — and, potentially, future cases involving world leaders — the decision will require approval from the majority of the board&#8217;s members. After that, the pace picks up a bit and Facebook will have one week to implement the board&#8217;s final decision.</p>
<p>Facebook likes to say that the board is independent, but in spite of having the autonomy to make &#8220;binding&#8221; case-by-case decisions, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/under-consideration/">the board grew out of Facebook itself</a>. The company appointed the board&#8217;s four original co-chairs and those members went on to expand the group into a 20-member body.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve previously reported, the mechanics of the board bias its activity toward Facebook content taken down — not the stuff that stays up, which generally creates larger headaches for the company and society at large. Facebook has responded to this critique, noting that while the board may initially focus on reviewing takedowns, content still up on the platforms will be part of the project&#8217;s scope &#8220;as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given some of the criticism around the group, the Trump case is a big moment for how impactful the board&#8217;s decisions will really wind up being. If it were to overturn Facebook&#8217;s decision, that decision would likely kick up a new firestorm of interest around Trump&#8217;s Facebook account, even as the former president recedes from the public eye.</p>
<p>The most interesting bit about the process is that it will allow the former president&#8217;s account admins to appeal his own case. If they do so, the board will review a &#8220;user statement&#8221; arguing why Trump&#8217;s account should be reinstated.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s external decision-making body is meant as a kind of &#8220;supreme court&#8221; for the company&#8217;s own policy making. It doesn&#8217;t really move quickly or respond in the moment, but instead seeks to establish precedents that can lend insight to future policy cases. While the per-case decisions are binding, whether the broader precedents it creates will impact Facebook&#8217;s future policy decisions remains to be seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re somewhat famous on various social networks, chances are you are exposed to hate speech in your replies or in your comments. French startup <a href="https://www.bodyguard.ai">Bodyguard</a> recently launched its app and service in English so that it can hide toxic content from your eyes. It has been available in French for a few years and the company has attracted 50,000 users so far.</p>
<p>“We have developed a technology that detects hate speech on the internet with a 90% to 95% accuracy and only 2% of false positive,” founder and CEO Charles Cohen told me.</p>
<p>The company has started with a mobile app that anyone can use. After you download the app and connect the app with your favorite social networks, you choose the level of moderation. There are several categories, such as insults, body shaming, moral harassment, sexual harassment, racism and homophobia. You can select whether it’s a low priority or a top priority for each category.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After that, you don’t have to open the app again. Bodyguard scans replies and comments from its servers and makes a decision whether something is OK. For instance, it can hide comments, mute users, block users, etc. When you open Instagram or Twitter again, it&#8217;s like those hateful comments never existed.</p>
<p>The app currently supports Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Twitch. Unfortunately, it can’t process content on Snapchat and TikTok due to API limitations.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, most moderation services rely heavily on machine learning or keyword-based moderation. Bodyguard has chosen a different approach. It algorithmically cleans up a comment and tries to analyze the content of a comment contextually. It can determine whether a comment is offensive to you, to a third-party person, to a group of persons, etc.</p>
<p>More recently, the startup has launched a B2B product. Other companies can use a Bodyguard-powered API to moderate comments in real-time on their social platforms or in their own apps. The company charges its customers using a traditional software-as-a-service approach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As 2020 fades into the rearview mirror of history (huzzah!), it’s time to map out strategies to transform your early-stage startup dream into reality. If there’s one thing every early founder needs it’s information, and you’ll find it in abundance at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1">TechCrunch Early Stage 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Introduced last year — and one of the most popular events in TechCrunch history — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1">TC Early Stage</a> provides new startup founders (pre-seed through Series A) access to top experts to help them develop and strengthen their core entrepreneurial skills.</p>
<p>We’re talking everything from legal issues, fundraising, marketing, growth, product-market fit, tech stack, recruiting, pitch deck teardowns and more. Think of it as a condensed accelerator experience packed with workshops and highly interactive Q&amp;As.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This conference was so popular that we’re hosting <strong>two</strong> virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1">TC Early Stage</a> events this year. <strong>Early Stage part one (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/">April 1-2</a>)</strong> and <strong>Early Stage part two (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">July 8-9</a>)</strong>. Even better, each event stands on its own merit with different topics, content, speakers and perspectives. Attend both to double your knowledge, double your networking, double your opportunities.</p>
<p>We might be biased, but we’re not the only people raving about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1">TC Early Stage</a>. Listen to what these early-stage founders said about TC Early Stage 2020:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I recommend going to Early Stage. The virtual aspect helps in terms of scheduling, it offers community-building through networking and it gives early-stage founders a framework for navigating the startup ecosystem. This is the stage where founders need more support, especially if they haven’t done this before.” — Ashley Barrington, founder, MarketPearl.</p>
<p>“Sequoia Capital’s session, Start with Your Customer, looked at the benefits of storytelling and creating customer personas. I took the idea to my team, we identified seven different user types for our product, and we’ve implemented storytelling to help onboard new customers. That one session alone has transformed my business.” — Chloe Leaaetoa, founder, Socicraft.</p>
<p>“Early Stage 2020 provided a rich, bootcamp experience with premier founders, VCs and startup community experts. If you’re beginning to build a startup, it’s an efficient way to advance your knowledge across key startup topics.” — Katia Paramonova, founder and CEO of Centrly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s the skinny on passes. Founder passes for either April or July event cost $199. Investors and startup enthusiasts can purchase Innovator passes for $299. <strong>Note:</strong> Early-bird pricing ends Feb 27 and May 1, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save more when you buy a dual-event pass. Attend both Early Stage events for just $299 (Founder) or $349 (Innovator). Remember: The events feature different speakers, topics and content.</p>
<p>Don’t miss this unparalleled, interactive opportunity to learn best startup practices from leading experts, investors and successful founders. Mark your calendar and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets">buy your Early Stage passes</a> today!</p>

<p>The enterprise-focused <a href="https://www.alchemistaccelerator.com">Alchemist Accelerator</a> is hosting its 26th Demo Day today, with 20 companies expected to debut.</p>
<p>This is Alchemist&#8217;s third Demo Day to be fully virtual due to the ongoing pandemic. Alchemist Accelerator Director Ravi Belani tells me that this virtual format has thus far &#8220;outperformed the in-person Demo Day format,&#8221; with Alchemist&#8217;s internal data indicating that follow-up meetings have increased by around 20%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Want to watch along with the presentations? They&#8217;re scheduled to start at 10:30 a.m. PST, and you can <a href="https://youtu.be/2260ecmiO48">find a livestream here</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here&#8217;s a list of all 20 companies in the order they&#8217;re expected to present, along with a bit about what they&#8217;re working on based on what&#8217;s publicly available:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.g-71.com">G-71</a>: A system that helps prevent and track leaks by automatically marking company documents &#8220;in a way that is invisible to the naked eye.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Can any news organization bridge the separate realities that the left and right seem to occupy in U.S. politics? A new startup with the odd-yet-memorable name <a href="https://walkingduck.com/">Walking Duck</a> is going to try.</p>
<p>Walking Duck (an inversion of a &#8220;lame duck&#8221; president — a phrasing that has <a href="https://medium.com/@LiaSeth/i-dont-want-to-hear-your-ableist-slurs-anymore-229538b9fc80">earned criticism as ableist</a> — and a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test">the duck test</a>) was founded by journalist Mark Halperin, as well as Paul and Audra Wilke, who are also backing it with their PR firm Upright Position Communications.</p>
<p>While the startup is producing a variety of content and events, including virtual town halls, there are three main pieces to the Walking Duck strategy at launch — <a href="https://walkingduck.com">the Walking Duck website</a>, which aggregates news from other publications, usually focused on a few key stories for the day, with additional commentary; plus Halperin&#8217;s newsletter <a href="https://markhalperin.substack.com/">Wide World of News</a> and his Newsmax show Mark Halperin&#8217;s Focus Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Halperin also serves as Walking Duck&#8217;s managing editor, and he said that he and the Wilkes have a shared vision for a publication that&#8217;s different from &#8220;the partisan media,&#8221; where &#8220;everything is cast through the lens of the red tribe or the blue tribe.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yes, aggregation is a key part of that vision, not just allowing the startup to cover national news with a relatively small team of five (for now), but also to offer different perspectives. In fact, Halperin argued that any news organization that&#8217;s being honest will admit that it&#8217;s doing aggregation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098988" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098988" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2098988" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Focus-Group-Title-Slate.jpg?w=680" alt="Mark Halperin's Focus Group" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Focus-Group-Title-Slate.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Focus-Group-Title-Slate.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Focus-Group-Title-Slate.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Focus-Group-Title-Slate.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Focus-Group-Title-Slate.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Focus-Group-Title-Slate.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2098988" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walking Duck</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Even if you have a big scoop about something, people want to know: What’s the reaction to the scoop, how is that scoop being treated elsewhere?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Aggregation can be smarter and faster and less ideological than exists in a lot of places. You can aggregate for everyone and elevate smart over angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>In my conversation with Halperin and Paul Wilke (Walking Duck&#8217;s CEO), I suggested that the &#8220;both sides&#8221; approach (which <a href="https://www.cjr.org/criticism/chris-evans-a-starting-point.php">other new publications</a> are also touting) has its limitations: When you&#8217;ve got a (now former) president seeking to undermine an election that he lost, and when his supporters violently storm the Capitol, simply presenting two sides of an argument as if they were equally valid seems insufficient.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t always try to show both sides, accuracy matters,&#8221; Wilke said. Similarly, Halperin said that it&#8217;s less about making sure there&#8217;s a 50-50 balance, and more about avoiding the limitations of a partisan lens. As an example, he argued that liberal outlets demonized former FBI director James Comey after his memo may have cost Hillary Clinton the 2016 election, then reversed course and valorized him after President Trump fired him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he should be covered on the individual incidents in a way that’s consistent,&#8221; Halperin said.</p>
<p>All of that might sound incongruous from a journalist with a show on Newsmax — which, far from being a center-of-the-road network, has attracted an audience by being more pro-Trump and more willing to spread <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/20/business/media/smartmatic-lawsuit-fox-news-newsmax-oan.html">election misinformation</a> than Fox News. But Halperin and Wilke said that by creating a show that brings four Trump voters and four Biden voters (not professional pundits) from across the country together over Zoom and attempting to find common ground, they&#8217;re exposing conservative viewers to new points of view — and they&#8217;d be happy to do the same for liberals if the show was on MSNBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just go to any cable news network and try to find a show that&#8217;s talking to Trump voters and talking to Biden voters,&#8221; Halperin said. &#8220;We’re doing it every week. That’s the essence of trying to grapple with how do these two groups talk to each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Halperin does have <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/yes-mark-halperin-works-at-newsmax-now">an existing relationship with Newsmax</a>, which came after he lost his contracts at more mainstream networks following <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-accuser-serial-harasser-mark-halperin-targeted-college-girls-too?ref=scroll">numerous accusations of sexual harassment</a>.</p>
<p>When I brought up the accusations in my initial email correspondence with Wilke, he said, &#8220;[Mark&#8217;s] history is firmly in his past. He’s expressed remorse, been through counseling and has publicly (and privately) apologized to his victims, and they have … accepted his apologies. Additionally, Upright (my other company) is a PR firm that has more women than men, and we’re bringing some of them over to Walking Duck, and we discussed this issue with them and made sure they felt comfortable and knew that a safe workplace was a priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>I also broached the topic on our call, and Halperin said, &#8220;I recognize the expectations that people have. I’ve just continued to do my best to be a good colleague and a good professional. If people are willing to let me work, I appreciate the opportunities. But it&#8217;s up to them.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://otter.ai/">Otter.ai</a>, the A.I.-powered voice transcription service that <a href="https://otter.ai/zoom">already integrates with Zoom</a> for recording online meetings and webinars, is today bringing its service to Google Meet&#8217;s over 100 million users. However, in this case, Otter.ai will provide its live, interactive transcripts and video captions by way of a Chrome web browser extension.</p>
<p>Once installed, a &#8220;Live Notes&#8221; panel will launch directly in the Chrome web browser during Google Meet calls, where it appears on the side of the Google Meet interface. The panel can be moved around and scrolled through as the meeting is underway.</p>
<p>Here, users can view the live transcript of the online meeting, as it occurs. They can also adjust the text size, then save and share the audio transcripts when the meeting has wrapped.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company says the feature helps businesses cut down on miscommunication, particularly for non-native English speakers who may have trouble understanding the spoken word. It also offers a more accessible way for engaging with live meeting content.</p>
<p>And because the transcriptions can be shared after the fact, people who missed the meeting can still be looped in to catch up &#8212; an increasing need in the remote-work era of the pandemic, where home and parenting responsibilities can often distract users from their daily tasks.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/iu2N44Por-4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The transcripts themselves can also be edited after the fact by adding images and highlights, and they can be searched by keywords, as with any Otter.ai transcription.</p>
<p>In addition, users can access the company&#8217;s Live Captions feature that supports custom vocabulary. Otter points out that there are other live captioning options already available for Google Meet, but the difference here is that Otter&#8217;s system creates a collaborative transcript when the meeting ends. Other systems, meanwhile, tend to just offer live captions during the meeting itself.</p>
<p>To use the new feature, Chrome users will need to install <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/otterai/bnmojkbbkkonlmlfgejehefjldooiedp">the Otter.ai Chrome extension</a> from the Chrome Web Store, then sign in to their Otter.ai account. The new feature is available to all Otter.ai customers, including those on Basic, Pro and Business plans.</p>
<p>Otter in the past <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/otter-ais-newest-feature-offers-live-interactive-transcripts-of-your-zoom-meetings/">leveraged its earlier Zoom integration</a> to push more users from free plans to paid tiers and will likely do the same with the new Google Meet support. The company&#8217;s paid plans offer the ability to record more minutes per month and include a range of additional features like the ability to import audio and video for transcription, a variety of export options, advanced search features, Dropbox sync, added security measures and more.</p>
<p>The company has seen its business increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying shift to online meetings. Last April, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/otter-ais-newest-feature-offers-live-interactive-transcripts-of-your-zoom-meetings/">Otter said it had transcribed</a> over 25 million meetings, and its revenue run rate had doubled compared with the end of 2019. In 2020, Otter.ai&#8217;s revenue was up 8x over last year, the company said. It has now transcribed over 100 million meetings and 300 billion+ minutes to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In TechCrunch investor surveys of years past, we&#8217;ve seen a big focus on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-digital-health/">fixing what&#8217;s broken </a>or bringing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-healthcare-b2b-and-infrastructure/">infrastructure into the modern era</a>. But the world has dramatically changed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>More of us saw our doctor on video than ever before in 2020 &#8212; reaching a <a href="https://www.ehrn.org/articles/as-office-visits-fall-telehealth-takes-hold">300-fold increase </a>in telehealth visits. It was the year healthcare finally moved fully into the digital space with data management solutions as well. And, though those digital visits have fallen slightly from the beginning of the pandemic, it doesn&#8217;t look like people want to go back to the way things were in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re onto the next phase where more people will be getting vaccinated, more of us will likely start to return to the office towards the end of the year, and there&#8217;s now a slew of new tech solutions to the issues 2020 presented. If you are investment-minded, as so many of our TechCrunch readers are, you will likely see a lot of potential in this space in 2021.</p>
<p>So we asked some of our favorite health tech VCs from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/the-techcrunch-list/">The TechCrunch List</a> where we are headed in the next year, what they&#8217;re most excited about and where they might be investing their dollars next. We asked each of them the same six questions, and each provided similar thoughts, but different approaches. Their responses have been edited for space and clarity:</p>

<h2>Bryan Roberts and Bob Kocker, partners, Venrock</h2>
<p><strong>Do you see more consumer demand for digital services? How does this trend affect what you are looking to invest in for 2021?</strong><br />
The pandemic certainly intensified pressure on the legacy, fee-for-service, activity-based healthcare system since volumes dried up for several months. People were scared to go to the doctor and doctors who are only paid when they see patients saw their revenue evaporate overnight. Telemedicine offered some revenue salvation fee-for-service healthcare but it was impossible to do as many tests and procedures so they have by and large, since summer 2020, reverted back to in-person as much as possible for increased revenue capture.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, value-based providers were, in the short term, more insulated as they are paid based on typical levels of utilization. Not surprisingly, COVID-19 has motivated more providers to embrace value-based care because it offers much more stable cash flows and does not depend on the tyranny of cramming more patients into the daily schedule.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With value-based care, the incentives are strongly aligned for more, and continued, tech-enabled virtual care since it is more profitable for those clinicians when they detect diseases earlier and take action to avoid hospitalizations. The beauty of virtual and tech-enabled care is that it can be delivered more frequently and group visits can be facilitated easily, with multiple specialists or people supporting a patient, to improve coordination and speed of action. Also, much more data can be brought to bear to make these interactions higher quality. Imagine how much better blood pressure is controlled when a doctor has not just the in-office reading but also all of the daily readings, or diabetic control when it is informed by all the data from a patient&#8217;s continuous glucose monitor, or post-surgical care when a surgeon can review daily pictures of the surgical site.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The enormity of the opportunity to make healthcare more productive and recession-proof growth from our aging population will attract more entrepreneurs and more capital to healthcare IT.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Digital health funding broke records in 2020, with investors</strong><strong style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> <a href="https://mercomcapital.com/product/9m-and-q3-2020-digital-health-healthcare-it-funding-and-ma-report/">pouring in over $10 billion</a> in</strong><strong style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the first three quarters and a jump in deals overall, compared to the previous year. Do you see that trend continuing as we move back to offices and out of this pandemic or do you think this was a blip due to special circumstances?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We think growth in healthcare IT has been and will continue to be, driven by (1) better businesses and business models via aligned economic incentives and information and (2) some big wins in the space via Teladoc-Livongo merger and JD Health IPO — so both sides of the supply (great businesses) — demand (investor interest) equation. For payers, many healthcare providers and patients, it is in their interest to adopt more cost-effective approaches for care delivery and to access new data to derive insights and remove arbitrages. These prerequisites are strongly aligned in favor of more healthcare IT company formation, rapid growth and successful exits.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While people may spend more time receiving in-person HC in the future than today, we think the rapid adoption of virtual care in 2020 coupled with ever-stronger incentives for the healthcare system to emulate consumer technology usability and the never-ending imperative of improving affordability, will continue to drive demand for startups. We also think that downward cost pressures will drive demand for technology to replace fax-machine-era, labor-first administrative processes too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">What do you think are the biggest trends to look out for in the digital healthcare industry this next year, given we are likely toward the end of the year to see more workers return to the office and everyone resuming activities as they did before this pandemic hit?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We think that telehealth will become the “Intel Inside” for many of the full stack healthcare IT businesses — Medicare Advantage payers, navigation companies, virtual pharmacies, virtual primary care practices — and that patients will continue to embrace telehealth. As a result, payers will increasingly redesign how insurance benefits work to encourage every patient to start with a telehealth visit every time. In many cases, telehealth will be able to fully resolve the problem and if not, guide the patient, along with the relevant data, to the best next step in care. This will improve responsiveness and reduce costs. We do think that brick-and-mortar players will lag behind since they continue to have strong incentives for in-person care and procedures to cover their large fixed costs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 has also made inescapable the inadequacy of behavioral healthcare in America. We have observed this firsthand through our investment in Lyra Health, which experienced dramatic growth in 2020. We think greater access to behavioral health, better coordination of behavioral health and primary care, better use of medications and tech-enabled care for more complex behavioral health conditions are all large opportunities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We also foresee virtual care growing in more specialty care areas as patients demand more convenient ways to access specialist expertise and value-based primary care doctors desire more rapid and cost-effective ways to co-manage patients.</p>
<p><strong>How will the Biden administration possibly affect your funding strategy in the digital health field now that there’s a change of the guard?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Economic incentives to lower healthcare cost growth and the desire to use information and data to find arbitrages and insights are as aligned as ever. Remember, the law driving the adoption of new payment models is MACRA, which passed the Senate in a bipartisan 92-8 vote in 2015. This implies an uninterrupted effort to drive the adoption of value-based care in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. A Biden administration will also continue efforts to create more interoperable data systems and support telehealth adoption.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A Biden administration also reduces uncertainty around the permanence of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). They instead will focus their efforts on expanding coverage through enhanced subsidies to buy insurance, more marketing of ACA plans, greater support for e-broker enrollment and strong incentives for states to expand Medicaid. And we do not think Medicare for All will be seriously considered by a ~50/50 Senate, although it will likely be spoken about periodically and loudly by the far left.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">What’s the biggest category in your mind for digital health this next year? Why is that?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Technology-enabled, virtual-everything” as the initial journey in healthcare, until you need to visit a facility because in-person is necessary. In 2020, we witnessed about a decade of user adoption compressed into six months as COVID-19 made it scary, or even impossible, to access in-person healthcare. Nearly every clinician in America, and at about half of the population, conducted a virtual healthcare visit in 2020. What happened? Patients liked it. Clinicians found virtual visits useful. And going forward we think that most care will incorporate aspects of virtual care, asynchronous communication and in-person encounters only when a procedure is needed. As importantly, payers found these approaches to be more cost-effective since care was delivered more rapidly and with only the most necessary diagnostics tests ordered.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Finally, are there any rising startups in your portfolio we should keep our eyes on at TechCrunch? </strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have two portfolio companies that may be very compelling candidates:  Suki and NewCo Health.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.suki.ai/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.suki.ai/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610825534890000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwFqPXQIzFl4ooGHmZ5YaGxowZMg">Suki </a>has created a virtual medical assistant that acts as a voice user interface for electronic health records, enabling a doctor to write their clinical notes, enter orders, view information and exchange data with other providers dramatically and more efficiently. They have launched primary care and specialist doctors across dozens of health systems in 2020.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">NewCo Health is a startup trying to democratize access to world-class cancer outcomes. Starting initially in Asia, they are tech-enabling the diagnosis, treatment planning and care management processes for cancer patients, connecting expert clinicians to every cancer case.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Galaxy S21 is a tank. It’s a big, heavy (8.04 ounces versus its predecessor’s 7.7), blunt instrument of a phone. It’s quintessential Samsung, really &#8212; the handset you purchase when too much isn’t quite enough. In fact, it even goes so far as adopting S-Pen functionality &#8212; perhaps the largest distinguishing factor between the company’s two flagship lines.</p>
<p>In many ways it &#8212; and the rest of the S21 models &#8212; are logical extensions of the product line. Samsung hasn’t broken the mold here. But the company didn’t particularly need to. The line remains one of the best Android devices you can buy. It’s a product experience the company is content to refine, while saving more fundamental changes for the decidedly more experimental <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/samsung-galaxy-z-flip/">Galaxy Z line.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 line arrives with camera bumps, price drops and S Pen compatibility&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsungs-galaxy-s21-line-arrives-with-camera-bumps-price-drops-and-s-pen-compatibility/embed/#?secret=VKD164YZDJ" data-secret="VKD164YZDJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Samsung certainly deserves credit for going all in on 5G early. The company was ahead of the curve in adopting next-gen wireless and was among the first to add it across its flagship offerings. 5G became a utilitarian feature remarkably fast &#8212; owing in no small part to Qualcomm’s major push to add the tech to its mid-tier chips. In fact, the iPhone 12 may well be the last major flagship that can get away with using the addition of the tech as a major selling point.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, smartphone makers are returning to familiar terrain on which to wage their wars &#8212; namely imaging. S-Pen functionality for the Ultra aside, most of the top-level upgrades of this generation come on the camera side of things. No surprise there, of course. The camera has always a focus for Samsung &#8212; though the changes largely revolved around software, which is increasingly the trend for many manufacturers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098893" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098893" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2098893" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-100500548.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-100500548.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-100500548.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-100500548.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-100500548.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-100500548.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-100500548.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-100500548.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-100500548.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2098893" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>There are, however, some hardware changes worth noting. Namely, the new S models represent one of the bigger aesthetic updates in recent memory. I’d mentioned being kind of on the fence about them in my original write up of the news, owing largely to that weird wrinkle of 2020/2021 gadget blogging: not being able to see the device in person. Now that I’ve been toting the product around the streets of New York for several days, I can say definitive that, well, I’m mostly kind of okay with them, I guess.</p>
<p>The big sticking point is that massive contour cut camera housing. Pretty sure I used the word “brutalist” to describe it last time. Having used the product, I&#8217;d say it’s fairly apt. There’s something…industrial about the design choice. And it’s really pronounced on the Ultra, which sports four camera holes, plus a laser autofocus sensor and flash. It’s a big, pronounced camera bump built from surprisingly thick metal. I suspect it’s owed, in part, to the “folded” telephoto lens.</p>
<p>Samsung sent along the Phantom Black model. The color was something the company devoted a surprising amount of stage time to during the announcement. It was the kind of attention we rarely see devoted to something as inconsequential as a color finish, outside of some Apple bits. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQtVzO1Rs_w&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo">Here’s a long video</a> about it if you’re curious. I don’t know what to tell you. It’s nice. It’s matte black. I do dig the new metallic back; even with Corning on your side, a glass back really feels like an accident waiting to happen.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/eQtVzO1Rs_w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The curved screen looks nice, per usual, accented well by the round corners. The screen itself is striking &#8212; Samsung’s displays always are. The screens on the S21, S21+ and S21 Ultra are 6.2, 6.7 and 6.8 inches, respectively. Those are all unchanged, save for the Ultra, which is, strangely, 0.1 inches smaller than its predecessor. It’s not really noticeable, but is an odd choice from a company that has long insisted that bigger is better when it comes to displays.</p>
<p>Eye Comfort Shield is a welcome addition, adjusting the screen temperature based on time of day and your own usage. If you’ve used Night Shift or something similar, you know the deal &#8212; the screen slowly shifts toward the more yellow end of the white balance spectrum, reducing blue light so as to not throw your circadian rhythms out of whack. It’s off by default, so you’ll have to go into settings to change it.</p>
<p>The company has also introduced a Dynamic Refresh Rate feature, which cycles between 46 and 120Hz, depending on the app you’re using. This is designed to save some battery life (a 120Hz along with 5G can be a big power hog). The effect is fairly subtle. I can’t say I really noticed over the course of my usage. I certainly appreciate the effort to find new ways to eke out extra juice.</p>
<p>The new era of Samsung is equally notable for what it left off. The new S models mark the end of an era as the company finally abandons expandable storage (following in the footsteps of the Z line). I mean, I get it. These devices range from 128 to 512GB of storage. For a majority of users, the microSD reader was superfluous. I certainly never needed to use it. Per the company, “Over time, SD card usage has markedly decreased on smartphones because we&#8217;ve expanded the options of storage available to consumers.”</p>
<p>Of course, expanding the built-in memory is going to cost you. Mostly, though, it’s always a bit of a bummer to say farewell to a long-time distinguishing factory. Speaking of, the company also ditched the in-box headphones and power adapter, notably deleting some ads in which it mocked Apple for recently doing the same. It’s the headphone jack all over again.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2098887" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-095320565.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-095320565.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-095320565.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-095320565.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-095320565.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-095320565.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-095320565.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-095320565.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-21-095320565.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The company offered up a similar sustainability explanation in a recent statement. “We discovered that more and more Galaxy users are reusing accessories they already have and making sustainable choices in their daily lives to promote better recycling habits.” As a consequence, the box is nearly half as thick as those from earlier S lines, for what that’s worth.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the cameras are remarkably similar to their predecessors, with a few key differences. The S20 Ultra sported an 108-megapixel wide lens (f/1.8), 12-megapixel ultrawide (f/2.2) and 48-megapixel (f/3.5) telephoto (4x zoom), while the S21 Ultra features a 108-megapixel wide (f/1.8), 12-megapixel ultrawide (f/2.2), 10MP (f/2.4) telephoto (3x zoom) and 10MP telephoto (f/4.9) (10x zoom). The dual telephoto lenses are the biggest differentiator.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098900" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098900" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2098900" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PNA6jzcI.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PNA6jzcI.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PNA6jzcI.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PNA6jzcI.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PNA6jzcI.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PNA6jzcI.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PNA6jzcI.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2098900" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: Brian Heater</strong></p></div></p>
<p>The device will switch between telephotos, depending on how much you zoom in. The device performs a lot better than many competing handsets at distances requiring around 10x. Though, while the ability to zoom up to 100x is an extremely impressive thing for a phone to do on paper, the images degrade really quickly at higher levels. At a certain point, the image starts taking on the style of an impressionist painting, which isn’t particularly useful in a majority of cases.</p>
<p>Once Samsung (or whoever) can properly crack the code on translating that noise into signal, it will really be a breakthrough. Still, Zoom Lock is a nice addition in helping to minimize hand shake while zooming. Accidental movements tend to increasing exponentially the tighter you get in on an image. The Super Steady, too, has been improved for video recording.</p>
<p>Portrait mode has been improved. There still tends to be trouble with more complex shapes, but this is a problem I’ve run into with pretty much all solutions. Samsung gets some points here for offering a ton of post-shot portrait editing, from different bokeh levels, to adjusting the focal point to other effects. As with much of the camera software, there’s a lot to play around with.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2098908,2098905,2098906,2098907,2098909,2098910,2098911,2098913,2098916"]</p>
<p>Other key additions include 8K snap, a nice addition that lets you pull high-res images from a single frame of 8K video. There’s also Vlogger Mode, which shoots from the front and back simultaneously. Someone will no doubt find some social use for this, but it feels a bit gimmicky &#8212; one of those features a majority of users will promptly forget about. Additional options are generally a good thing, though the camera software has gotten to the point where there are a ton of menus to navigate.</p>
<p>I get the sense that most users want a way to quickly snap photos and shoot videos. The lower-end S21 entries are great for that. The hardware is strong enough to give you great shots with minimal effort. If you’re someone who really enjoys drilling down on features and getting the best images on-device without exporting to a third-party app, the Ultra is the choice for you. In addition to being a kind of kitchen sink approach, the high-end device is all about choice.</p>

<p>The addition of S Pen functionality is probably the most notable &#8212; and curious &#8212; thing the Ultra has going for it. On the face of it, this feels like the latest &#8212; and most pronounced &#8212; in a series of moves effectively blurring the lines between the company’s two flagships. Perhaps Samsung will make a move to further differentiate the next Note, or maybe the company is content to simply let the device meld over time.</p>
<p>There is one major difference off the bat, of course. Namely the fact that there’s no pen slot on the S21. This means that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The stylus is sold separately.</li>
<li>You need to buy a case with an S Pen holder (also sold separately, naturally) if you’ve got any hope of not losing it.</li>
</ol>

<p>I happened to have a Note S Pen lying around and found the experience to be pretty smooth. I’ve been upfront about the fact that I’m not really a stylus person myself, but Samsung’s done a good job building up the software over the years. The S Pen is a surprisingly versatile tool, courtesy of several generations of updates. But I would say if the peripheral is important to you, honestly, just buy a Note.</p>
<p>The components are what you’d expect from a high-end Samsung. That includes the brand new Snapdragon 888 (in some markets, at least), and either 12 or 16GB of RAM and 128, 256 or 512GB of storage on the Ultra. The battery remains the same as last year, at 5,000mAh. In spite of 5G and a high refresh rate, I’ve gotten more than a day and a half of moderate use on a single charge.</p>
<p>In the end, the S21 isn’t a huge change over the S20. It’s more of a refinement, really. But it does represent a big change for Samsung. The company has implemented a $200 price drop across the board for these products. The S21, S21+ and S21 Ultra start at $799, $999 and $1,199, respectively. None are what you would call cheap, exactly, but $200 isn’t exactly insignificant, whether it means easing the blow of getting in on the entry level or taking the pain out of going for a higher-end model.</p>
<p>It’s a clear reflection of a few years&#8217; worth of stagnating smartphone sales, exacerbated by some dire numbers amid COVID. It’s nice to see a company take those issues &#8212; and concern around spending $1,000+ on a smartphone &#8212; to heart beyond simply offering up a flagship “lite.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Copy and paste the converted output. --></p>
<p>Plaid is launching FinRise, a nine-month incubator for early-stage fintech founders from underrepresented backgrounds. Inspired by an internal hackathon amid Black Lives Matter protests last summer, the accelerator is explicitly looking at startups led by Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC).</p>
<p>Plaid Growth Manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nellnmalone/">Nell Malone</a> and Design Manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhargavi-kamakshivalli-1a3289203/">Bhargavi Kamakshivalli</a> are spearheading the project.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Malone tells TechCrunch that the incubator is looking to accept three to five post-seed and pre-Series B tech startups with a product in the beta stage. In order to apply, startups need to have a minimum of two employees and a founder to join the program. The startup should obviously operate in the fintech space, but specifically have a part of its business focused on consumer business finance data.</p>
<p>That last prerequisite dovetails exactly into what Plaid does: It’s a software startup that acts as connective tissue between consumer bank accounts and fintech apps. Thus, FinRise feels like a creative extension of these integrations, albeit one focused more on helping founders start companies than simply gaining new customers.</p>
<p>Accepted startups will get mentorship from Plaid leaders, a dedicated account manager who will help with product insights, and a network where founders can go to for advice on the bootcamp sessions. The incubator is longer than an accelerator program like Y Combinator or TechStars, which usually run for three months, but less intensive.</p>
<p>“The three-day virtual bootcamp will be the most intensive part of the FinRise program,” Malone said. “After the workshop, participants will work with their dedicated account managers and have access to ongoing programming support structures … our goal is to provide ongoing support at every stage of our participant’s journey over the course of nine months.”</p>
<p>The announcement fortuitously comes just a week after Plaid announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/plaid-ceo-touts-new-clarity-after-failed-visa-acquisition/">it would not merge with Visa</a> after running into regulatory hurdles. The deal, which was valued at $5.3 billion when announced, was met with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/venture-capitalists-react-to-visa-plaid-deal-meltdown/">optimism from fintech founders and VCs</a>. That said, it did underscore how private fintech startups will increasingly have to deal with policy issues as the sector continues to grow.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Tsw56FjB5q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/16/plaid-for-x-startups/">Stay gold, ‘Plaid for X’ startups</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Stay gold, ‘Plaid for X’ startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/16/plaid-for-x-startups/embed/#?secret=Tsw56FjB5q" data-secret="Tsw56FjB5q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The accelerator’s bootcamp portion, which will be a three-day affair, plans to address this dynamic in the lens of how startups should deal with regulatory and legal pressures in the financial services space. Other topics of discussion will include information security, engineering practices and user-centric design.</p>
<p>The hurdle for underrepresented founders tends to be <a href="https://twitter.com/cindygallop/status/1343945580914081795">access to funding instead of access to mentorship</a>. For now, the incubator isn’t taking any equity nor is it giving any capital itself, but FinRise did commit to introducing its cohort to a network of VC firms and accelerators with checkbooks.</p>
<p>Of course, Plaid could also consider investing in any of these startups, taking a classic corporate venture capital approach. When asked if this could happen, Malone said that “this is not part of our plan right now. It’s early, we’re excited to pilot the program and see how it goes.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[How many recent tech IPOs are down from their opening price? We looked at 14 debuts from the last year to find out.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This morning, while checking the latest price for shares of recent IPO Poshmark, I noticed that they were down from their first-day results. The company&#8217;s pricing was more than strong, and its first trading results were nearly comical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/at-35-to-39-per-share-poshmarks-ipo-could-5x-its-last-private-valuation/">setting a $35 to $39 per-share IPO price range</a>, Poshmark sold <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/poshmark-prices-ipo-above-range-as-public-markets-continue-to-yolo-startups/">shares in its IPO at $42 apiece</a>. Then it opened at $97.50. Such was the exuberance of the stock market regarding the used goods marketplace&#8217;s debut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But today it&#8217;s worth a more modest $76.30 &#8212; for this piece we&#8217;re using all Yahoo Finance data, and all current prices are those from yesterday&#8217;s close ahead of the start of today&#8217;s trading &#8212; which sparked a question: How many recent tech IPOs are also down from their opening price?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>So The Exchange, ever at your service, raced around to collect the data. And what did we find? Most hot tech IPOs have held onto their gains, and many have actually run up the score in the ensuing weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lemonade is a great example. It first targeted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/lemonade-targets-down-round-pricing-in-impending-ipo/">a $23 to $26 per-share IPO price</a>. That <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/insurtech-unicorn-lemonade-raises-ipo-range-ahead-of-debut/">rose to $26 to $28 per share</a>, then it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/understanding-hippos-valuation-in-a-post-lemonade-ipo-world/">priced at $29 per share</a>. It opened at $50.06 per share, closing the day worth $69.41. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today? A single Lemonade share will set you back $145.21. The company is now worth $8.22 billion, despite only <a href="http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001691421/4543f4c1-7065-4423-ad05-310f67c6f4e1.pdf">posting Q3 revenues</a> of $17.8 million, a decline from the year-ago period (for more on why that is, and why it isn&#8217;t as bad as you might initially think, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/as-metromile-looks-to-go-public-insurtech-funding-is-on-the-rise/">read this</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts anticipate that Lemonade will post revenues of $18.91 million in Q4 2020, again via Yahoo Finance, putting the company on an annualized run rate of 109x. For a business running with net margins of -173.6% in its most recent quarter. And that&#8217;s <em>after</em> Lemonade <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2021/01/15/597655.htm">announced</a> a large share sale!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this is to say that the fiery optimism fueling dazzling IPO debuts has the potential to keep pushing them higher. Which you can view as troubling, if you are a boring index funder like myself; enticing, if you are a founder looking to go public in the near-future; and potentially irksome if you are a VC annoyed when upside leaks to parties other than yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings us to our data set. Below, I&#8217;ve collated a host of recent IPOs, their opens and their current prices. Only one has shed value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then we reexamined eight 2020 offerings that you will recall so we could run the same exercise. The results were not what I expected and indicate a stock market &#8212; let alone an IPO market &#8212; sufficiently inflated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to warrant the whispered moniker of <em>bubble</em>.</span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have some fun.</p>
<h2>Up, and then up some more<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube is embracing the hashtag. The company has been <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/93057712?hl=en">quietly working</a> on a new feature that allows users to better discover content using hashtags &#8212; either by clicking on a hashtag on YouTube or by typing in a hashtag link directly. Before, these actions would return a mix of content related to the hashtag, but not only those videos where the hashtag had been directly used. Now that&#8217;s changing, as YouTube has fully rolled out its new &#8220;hashtag landing pages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Going forward, when you click on a hashtag on YouTube, you&#8217;ll be taken to a dedicated landing page that contains only videos that are using the hashtag. This page is also sorted to keep the &#8220;best&#8221; videos at the top, YouTube claimed. The ranking algorithm, however, may need some work as it&#8217;s currently surfacing an odd mix of both newer and older videos and seems to be heavily dominated by Indian creator content, in several top categories.</p>
<p>The result, then, is not the equivalent to something like a hashtag search on a social network like Facebook or Twitter, for example, where more recent content gets top billing. For that reason, it may be difficult to use these hashtag landing pages for discovery of new videos to watch, as intended, but could still serve as an interesting research tool for creators looking to better leverage the hashtag format.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, you may find that the #interiordesign hashtag is a crowded place, with 8,400 channels and 29,000 videos, but a niche hashtag like #interiordesignlivingroom has under 100 channels and videos. If people began to use hashtags regularly to seek out videos, using narrowly targeted tags could potentially help creators&#8217; videos be more easily found.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098931" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098931" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2098931" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-10.36.43-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="394" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-10.36.43-AM.jpg 2874w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-10.36.43-AM.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-10.36.43-AM.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-10.36.43-AM.jpg?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-10.36.43-AM.jpg?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-10.36.43-AM.jpg?resize=1536,890 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-10.36.43-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1187 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-10.36.43-AM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2098931" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>The hashtag landing pages are accessed through clicking on a tag on YouTube, not by doing a hashtag search. However, if you want to go to a particular hashtag page directly, you can use the URL format of youtube.com/hashtag/[yourterm] (e.g., youtube.com/hashtag/beauty).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve noticed, in testing the feature, that there are not hashtag pages for some controversial terms associated with content <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/harmful-conspiracy-theories-youtube/">YouTube previously said it would block</a>, like QAnon and election conspiracy videos, such as #stopthesteal.</p>
<p>The feature itself was first announced through <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/93057712?hl=en">YouTube&#8217;s Community forum earlier this month</a>, where it was described as a new way that YouTube would &#8220;group content together and help you discover videos through hashtags.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zTbA8KEV7I">noted</a> on its &#8220;Creator Insider&#8221; channel that the feature had been fully rolled out to 100% of all users. (The video&#8217;s creator, however, misspoke, by saying you could &#8220;search&#8221; for hashtags to reach the new landing page. That is not the case today.) The hashtag landing pages are available on both desktop and mobile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the global agricultural industry stretches to meet expected population growth and food demand, and food security becomes more of a pressing issue with global warming, a startup out of South Africa is using artificial intelligence to help farmers manage their farms, trees and fruits.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.aerobotics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aerobotics</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> a South African startup that provides intelligent tools to the world’s agriculture industry, has raised $17 million in an oversubscribed Series B round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South African consumer internet giant Naspers led the round through its investment arm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/naspers-foundry-is-open-for-south-african-startup-pitches-ceo-says/">Naspers Foundry</a>, investing $5.6 million, according to Aerobotics. </span><a href="https://cathayinnovation.com/fund/cathay-africinvest-innovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cathay AfricInvest Innovation,</span></a> <a href="https://www.fmo.nl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FMO: Entrepreneurial Development Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://platformips.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Platform Investment Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also participated.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2014 by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Paterson</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Benji Meltzer, Aerobotics is currently focused on building tools for fruit and tree farmers. Using artificial intelligence, drones and other robotics, its technology helps track and assess the health of these crops, including identifying when trees are sick, tracking pests and diseases, and analytics for better yield management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has progressed its technology and provides to farmers independent and reliable yield estimations and harvest schedules by collecting and processing both tree and fruit imagery from citrus growers early in the season. In turn, farmers can prepare their stock, predict demand and ensure their customers have the best quality of produce.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aerobotics has experienced record growth in the last few years. For one, it claims to have the largest proprietary data set of trees and citrus fruit in the world, having processed 81 million trees and more than a million citrus fruit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seven-year-old startup is based in Cape Town, South Africa. At a time when many of the startups out of the African continent have focused their attention primarily on identifying and fixing challenges at home, Aerobotics has found a lot of traction for its services abroad, too. It has offices in the U.S., Australia and Portugal &#8212; like Africa, home to other major, global agricultural economies &#8212; and operates in 18 countries across Africa, the Americas, Europe and Australia. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within that, the U.S. is the company’s primary market, and Aerobotics says it has two provisional patents pending in the country, one for systems and methods for estimating tree age and another for systems and methods for predicting yield.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it plans to use this Series B investment to continue developing more technology and product delivery, both for the U.S. and other markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re committed to providing intelligent tools to optimize automation, minimize inputs and maximize production. We look forward to further co-developing our products with the agricultural industry leaders,” said Paterson, the CEO in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="hardreadability"><span data-offset-key="f4t2k-0-0">Once heralded as a frontier for technology centuries ago, the agriculture industry has stalled in that aspect for a long while</span></span><span data-offset-key="f4t2k-1-0">. </span><span class="complexword"><span data-offset-key="f4t2k-2-0">However</span></span><span class="veryhardreadability"><span data-offset-key="f4t2k-3-0">, agritech companies like Aerobotics that support climate-smart agriculture and help farmers have sprung forth trying to take the industry back to its past glory. Investors have taken notice and over the past five years, investments have flowed with breathtaking pace. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Aerobotics, it raised $600,000 from 4Di Capital and Savannah Fund as part of its seed round in September 2017. The company then raised a further $4 million in Series A funding in February 2019, led by Nedbank Capital and Paper Plane Ventures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naspers Foundry, the lead investor in this Series B round, was launched by Naspers in 2019 as a 1.4 billion rand (~$100 million) fund for tech startups in South Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa, CEO of Naspers South Africa, said of the investment, &#8220;Food security is of paramount importance in South Africa and the Aerobotics platform provides a positive contribution towards helping to sustain it. This type of tech innovation addresses societal challenges and is exactly the type of early-stage company that Naspers Foundry looks to back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Aerobotics, Naspers Foundry has invested in online cleaning service SweepSouth, and food service platform Food Supply Network.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/playvs/">PlayVS</a>, the esports company bringing organized leagues to high schools and colleges, is today announcing its first acquisition. The startup, which has raised more than <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/playvs">$100 million</a>, has acquired <a href="https://gameseta.com/">GameSeta</a>, a Vancouver-based startup that is also looking to provide infrastructure for high school esports teams. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The deal will accelerate PlayVS during its growth phase and help it expand into the Canadian market. GameSeta has a partnership with BC School Sports, the governing body for organized school sports in British Columbia, which will transfer to PlayVS.</p>
<p>PlayVS has a similar (and exclusive) partnership with NFHS, the high school equivalent of the NCAA, here in the States. The company has also sprinted into the college market, launching a college product as part of a partnership between PlayVS and Epic Games. Since launching a college offering, total player growth is up 460 percent. The company has also launched a new $900,000 scholarship pool for high schools and colleges.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Delane Parnell in the beginning of 2018, PlayVS has grown rapidly, brokering partnerships with school sports organizations and publishers alike. In fact, PlayVS title offerings include League of Legends, Rocket League, SMITE, Overwatch, Fortnite, FIFA 21 and Madden NFL 21. PlayVS has served more than 19,000 high schools across all 50 states. It boasts more than 230,000 registered users.</p>
<p>PlayVS acts as a portal for schools to create esports teams and compete against other schools. Traditional sports like basketball and baseball have established systems (and governing organizations) to organize league schedules, playoffs, referees and more. PlayVS has positioned itself as that governing body and organizational system for esports.</p>
<p>Not only does PlayVS facilitate these leagues, but it also offers colleges and esports organizations a much-needed recruitment tool, letting them view games and track metrics of individual players.</p>
<p>As part of the acquisition, GameSeta&#8217;s Tawanda Masawi and Rana Taj will join the PlayVS team and lead Canadian operations.</p>
<p>Alongside geographic expansion, PlayVS is also looking to expand beyond high schools and colleges with plans to launch a direct to consumer product.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to launch some direct consumer products directly in partnership with publishers to open up the PlayVS ecosystem so people can organize and join competitions, whether they are associated with high schools or otherwise,&#8221; said Parnell. &#8220;We&#8217;re really excited about that. The markets in general have just shown great appetite for gaming as a form of entertainment and content. Obviously, players are really excited about eSports as a form of content and a way to engage in competition and so we want to make sure that PlayVS is a place where people compete more broadly.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MIT researchers are looking to address the significant gap between how quickly robots can process information (relatively slowly), and how fast they can move (very quickly thanks to modern hardware advances), and they&#8217;re using something called &#8220;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/robot-customized-hardware-0121">robomorphic computing</a>&#8221; to do it. The method, designed by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAIL) graduate Dr. Sabrina Neuman, results in custom computer chips that can offer hardware acceleration as a means to faster response times.</p>
<p>Custom-built chips tailored to a very specific purpose are not new &#8212; if you&#8217;re using a modern iPhone, you have one in that device right now. But they have become more popular as companies and technologists look to do more local computing on devices with more conservative power and computing constraints, rather than round-tripping data to large data centers via network connections.</p>
<p>In this case, the method involves creating hyper-specific chips that are designed based on a robot&#8217;s physical layout and its intended use. By taking into account the requirements a robot has in terms of its perception of its surroundings, its mapping and understanding of its position within those surroundings, and its motion planning resulting from said mapping and its required actions, researchers can design processing chips that greatly increase the efficiency of that last stage by supplementing software algorithms with hardware acceleration.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Xilinx launches a new reconfigurable space-grade chip optimized for local machine learning on orbit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/xilinx-launches-a-new-reconfigurable-space-grade-chip-optimized-for-local-machine-learning-on-orbit/embed/#?secret=bSPMA25yyi" data-secret="bSPMA25yyi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The classic example of hardware acceleration that most people encounter on a regular basis is a graphics processing unit, or GPU. A GPU is essentially a processor designed specifically for the task of handling graphical computing operations &#8212; like display rendering and video playback. GPUs are popular because almost all modern computers run into graphics-intensive applications, but custom chips for a range of different functions have become much more popular lately thanks to the advent of more customizable and efficient small-run chip fabrication techniques.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a description of how Neuman&#8217;s system works specifically in the case of optimizing a hardware chip design for robot control, per <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/robot-customized-hardware-0121">MIT News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The system creates a customized hardware design to best serve a particular robot’s computing needs. The user inputs the parameters of a robot, like its limb layout and how its various joints can move. Neuman’s system translates these physical properties into mathematical matrices. These matrices are “sparse,” meaning they contain many zero values that roughly correspond to movements that are impossible given a robot’s particular anatomy. (Similarly, your arm’s movements are limited because it can only bend at certain joints — it’s not an infinitely pliable spaghetti noodle.)</p>
<p>The system then designs a hardware architecture specialized to run calculations only on the non-zero values in the matrices. The resulting chip design is therefore tailored to maximize efficiency for the robot’s computing needs. And that customization paid off in testing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Neuman&#8217;s team used a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), which is sort of like a midpoint between a fully custom chip and an off-the-shelf CPU, and it achieved significantly better performance than the latter. That means that were you to actually custom manufacture a chip from scratch, you could expect much more significant performance improvements.</p>
<p>Making robots react faster to their environments isn&#8217;t just about increasing manufacturing speed and efficiency &#8212; though it will do that. It&#8217;s also about making robots even safer to work with in situations where people are working directly alongside and in collaboration with them. That remains a significant barrier to more widespread use of robotics in everyday life, meaning this research could help unlock the sci-fi future of humans and robots living in integrated harmony.</p>
