										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The longer we continue to work with either all or part of our teams in remote, out-of-physical-office environments, the more imperative it becomes for those teams to have some tools in place to keep the channels of communication and management open, and for the individuals in those teams to have a sense of how well they are performing. Today, one of the startups that provides a team productivity app with that in mind is announcing a round of funding to fuel its growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pathlight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathlight</a>, which has built a performance management platform for customer-facing teams &#8212; sales, field service and support &#8212; to help managers and employees themselves to track and analyze how they are doing, to coach them when and where it&#8217;s needed, and to communicate updates and more, has picked up $25 million &#8212; money that it will be using to continue growing its customer base and the functionality across its app.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Insight Partners, with previous backers Kleiner Perkins and Quiet Capital also participating, alongside Uncorrelated Ventures; Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO of Yelp; David Glazer, CFO of Palantir; and Michael Ovitz, co-founder of CAA and Owner of Broad Beach Ventures. Pathlight has now raised $35 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pathlight today provides users with a range of tools to visualize team and individual performance across various parameters set by managers, using data that teams integrate from other platforms like Salesforce, Zendesk and Outreach, among others.</p>
<p>Using that data and specific metrics for the job in question, managers can then initiate conversations with individuals to focus in on specific areas where things need attention, and provide some coaching to help fix it. It can also be used to provide team-wide updates and encouragement, which sits alongside whatever other tools a person might use in their daily customer-facing work.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2135006,2135007,2135008,2135009,2135010"]</p>
<p>Since launching in March 2020, the startup has picked up good traction, with customers including Twilio, Earnin, Greenhouse, and CLEAR. But perhaps even more importantly, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the pandemic and resulting switch to remote work has underscored how necessary tools like Pathlight&#8217;s have become: the startup says that engagement on its platform has shot up 300% in the last 12 months.</span></p>
<p>Alexander Kvamme, the CEO of Pathlight, said that he first became aware of the challenges of communicating across customer-facing teams, and having transparency on how they are doing as individuals and as a group, when he was at Yelp. Yelp had acquired his startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/18/yelp-acquires-online-reservation-service-seatme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reservations service SeatMe</a>, and used the acquisition to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/13/yelp-bites-back-at-opentable-tripadvisor-and-google-with-free-yelp-reservations-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build and run Yelp Reservations</a>.</p>
<p>He was quick to realize that there weren&#8217;t really effective tools for him to see how individuals in the sales team were doing, how they were doing compared to goals the company wanted to achieve and based on the sales data they already had in other systems, how to work more effectively with people to communicate when something needed changing, and how to tailor all that in line with new variations in the formula &#8212; in their case, how to sell new products like a reservations service alongside advertising and other Yelp services for businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s five or 3,000 people, the problem doesn&#8217;t go away,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everyone uses their own systems, and it hurts front line employees when they don&#8217;t know how they are doing, or don&#8217;t get recognition when they are doing well, or don&#8217;t get coaching when they are not. Our thesis was that if software is eating the world, and you as a company are buying more software and analytics, over time managers will be more like data analysts. So we are providing a way for managers to be more data-driven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five years down the line, Kvamme got the bug again to start a company and decided to return to that problem, teaming up with co-founder Trey Doig, the engineer who designed SeatMe and then turned it into Yelp Reservations and is now Pathlight&#8217;s CTO.</p>
<p>As they see it, the challenge has still not really been addressed. That&#8217;s not to say that there are not a number of companies &#8212; competitors to Pathlight, looking to fill that gap as well. Another people management platform called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/lattice-a-people-management-platform-picks-up-45m-at-a-400m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lattice last year picked up $45 million</a>  (I&#8217;m guessing it will be raising money again around about now); HubSpot, Zoho, SalesLoft and a number of others also are taking different approaches to the same challenge: front-line customer-facing people spend the majority of their time and attention on interacting with people, and so there need to be better tools in place to help them figure out how to make that communication more effective, figure out what is working and what is not.</p>
<p>And all of this, of course, is not at all new: it&#8217;s not like we all woke up one day and suddenly wanted to know how we are doing at work, or managers suddenly felt they needed to communicate with staff.</p>
<p>What has changed, however, is how we work: many of us have not seen the inside of our offices for more than a year at this point, and for a large proportion of us, we may never return again, or if we do it will be under different circumstances.</p>
<p>All of this means that some of the more traditional metrics and indicators of our performance, praising, management relationships, and learning from team mates simply is not there anymore.</p>
<p>In customer-facing areas like sales, support and field service, that lack of contact may be even more acute, since many of the teams working in these environments have long relied on huddles and communication throughout the day, week and month to continuously tweak work and improve it. So while tools like Pathlight&#8217;s will be useful as data analytics provision for teams regardless of how we work, it can be argued that they are even more important right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think people have started to realize that if you can empower front line to be more independent, your numbers will go up and do better,&#8221; Kvamme said.</p>
<p>This is part of what went into the investment decision made here.</p>
<p>“With the acceleration of digital transformation across the enterprise, it’s not enough to rethink the way we work—we must also rethink the way we manage,” said Jeff Lieberman, MD at Insight Partners. “Pathlight is ushering in a new age of data-driven management, an ethos that we believe every enterprise will need to embrace—quickly. We are excited to partner with the Pathlight team as they bring their powerful platform to companies across the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Polestar, the Swedish electric vehicle brand spun out of Volvo Car Group, set on Wednesday a “moonshot goal” of creating the first climate neutral car by 2030. But instead of getting there through more widely-practiced offsetting measures, such as planting trees, the company said it’s going to fundamentally change the way the new EV is made.</p>
<p>That means rethinking every piece of the supply chain, from materials sourcing through to manufacturing, and even by making the vehicle more energy efficient.</p>
<p>“We’re going to do it by reducing emissions, eliminating emissions, rather than offsetting, like many are relying on today, because we see that offsetting is a worrying strategy,” Fredrika Klarén, Polestar’s Head of Sustainability, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “The science is not actually backing it up in terms of its capability of offsetting emissions from producing products.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the direct outcome will be a new car – what the company is calling Polestar 0 – it will require a total overhaul of the manufacturing process that could eventually extend to Polestar’s other models. Klarén said that although Polestar’s entire fleet will not be climate neutral by 2030, the company and its parent Volvo have already set targets of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/volvo-to-roll-out-a-new-electric-vehicle-every-year-through-2025/">being climate neutral across their operations, including Polestar, by 2040</a>.</p>
<p>Both of Polestar’s current models, Polestar 1 and 2, are manufactured in China. Klarén said while much about the Polestar 0 has yet to be determined, the company hopes that it, too will be Chinese-made. Although the country still has a strong reliance on coal, there’s massive development in sustainable technology and manufacturing, she pointed out.</p>
<p>“If I get to vote, we will continue producing in China, but that being said, the Polestar 0, the solutions we will use are not identified yet and we’re going to need to think in new ways we didn’t think was possible prior – where it will be produced, what materials will go in [it],” said Klarén.</p>
<p>Nor are any of the internal systems settled. Geely AG, the parent company of Volvo Cars and Polestar, has been developing its own internal computer-and-battery platform, but it hasn’t been decided whether the new Polestar model will use this system.</p>
<p>She said the most challenging parts of the EV manufacturing process to transition to climate neutral are the materials, specifically aluminum, steel, and battery components.</p>
<p>“We need to tackle the production-related emissions,” she explained. The environmental impact of producing steel, aluminum and the basic materials found in lithium-based batteries is still significant.</p>
<p>Along with the new vehicle, Polestar also launched a product sustainability declaration that clearly lists the carbon footprint of Polestar 2 and all coming models.</p>
<p>“Offsetting is a cop-out,” Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement. “By pushing ourselves to create a completely climate-neutral car, we are forced to reach beyond what is possible today.  We will have to question everything, innovate and look to exponential technologies as we design towards zero.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is sharing more details today about its upcoming App Tracking Transparency feature, which will allow users to control, on an app-by-app level, whether their data is shared for ad-targeting purposes.</p>
<p>In a sense, anyone using the current version of iOS can see App Tracking Transparency in action, since iOS already includes a Tracking menu in the Privacy settings, and some apps have already started asking users for permission to track them.</p>
<p>But when iOS 14.5 (currently in developer beta) is released to the general public sometime in early spring, Apple will actually start enforcing its new rules, meaning that iPhone users will probably start seeing a lot more requests. Those requests will appear at various points during the usage of an app, but they&#8217;ll all carry a standardized message asking whether the app can &#8220;track your activity across other companies&#8217; apps and websites,&#8221; followed by a customized explanation from the developer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once an app has asked for this permission, it will also show up in the Tracking menu, where users can toggle app tracking on and off at any time. They can also enable app tracking across all apps or opt out of these requests entirely with a single toggle.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Zq8Hvb2VfA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature will be enabled by default and arrive in &#8216;early spring&#8217; on iOS</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature will be enabled by default and arrive in &#8216;early spring&#8217; on iOS&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/embed/#?secret=Zq8Hvb2VfA" data-secret="Zq8Hvb2VfA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One point worth emphasizing — something already stated <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">on Apple&#8217;s developer website</a> but not entirely clear in media reports (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">including our own</a>)— is that these rules aren&#8217;t limited to the IDFA identifier. Yes, IDFA is what Apple controls directly, but a company spokesperson said that when a user opts out of tracking, Apple will also expect developers to stop using any other identifiers (such as hashed email addresses) to track users for ad targeting purposes, and not to share that information with data brokers.</p>
<p>This does not, however, stop developers from tracking users across multiple apps if all those apps are operated by a single company.</p>
<p>The Apple spokesperson also said that Apple&#8217;s own apps will abide by these rules — you won&#8217;t see any requests from Apple, however, since it doesn&#8217;t track users across third-party apps for ad targeting purposes. (As previously noted, there&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">a separate Personalized Ads option </a>that determines whether Apple can use its own first-party data to target ads.)</p>
<p>Facebook has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">particularly vocal in criticizing the change</a>, arguing that this will hurt small businesses who use targeting to run effective ad campaigns, and that the change benefits Apple&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>Apple has pushed back against criticism in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/">privacy-focused speeches</a>, as well as in a report called <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf">A Day in the Life of Your Data</a>, which lays out how users are actually tracked and targeted. In fact, the report has just been updated with more information about ad auctions, ad attribution and Apple&#8217;s own advertising products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular saving and investing app </span><a href="https://www.acorns.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acorns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has acquired Pillar, an AI-powered startup built to help manage student loan debt, in its second acquisition of 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based Pillar helps consumers optimize their debt payments by focusing first on student loans. It launched in May 2019 with </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/pillar-launches-with-5-5m-from-kleiner-perkins-and-others-to-tackle-your-student-loan-debt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5.5 million in seed funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Kleiner Perkins. The companies declined to reveal the financial terms of the deal, only noting that within six months of launching, Pillar managed over $500 million worth of student loan debt of more than 15,000 borrowers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Bloch dropped out of Stanford Business School and co-founded Pillar after he and his wife had amassed more than $500,000 of student loan debt after she graduated from law school. Prior to that, he had led the Strategy &amp; Operations division for DoorDash, growing it to $100 million in revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem Pillar has aimed to tackle is massive. Student loan debt is the </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2021/02/20/student-loan-debt-statistics-in-2021-a-record-17-trillion/?sh=dffd94714310"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second-largest type of consumer debt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S., with 45 million borrowers collectively owing nearly $1.7 trillion in student loans.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Acorns was apparently one of several companies that had courted Pillar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were in a pretty lucky position to have a lot of interest from many of the top fintech companies that are out there,” Bloch told TechCrunch. “We had multiple offers on the table and Acorns was really our top choice just given how the business has been doing and the team, the culture and the mission.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal marks the second acquisition this year and third overall for Acorns, which says it notched its strongest quarter in its history the first three months of this year. In March, Acorns also acquired Harvest, a fintech that helped customers reduce more than $4 million in debt in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pillar and Harvest teams will help Acorns accelerate its product roadmap of helping customers pay down debt, “an essential part of the financial wellness system,” said CEO and founder Noah Kerner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, Pillar will become part of one of Acorns’ monthly subscription tiers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The IP and technology that the Pillar team created in debt management is really interesting to us when we think about how we scale our Smart Deposit feature,” Kerner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Smart Deposit, when a customer’s paycheck hits the Acorns bank account, the app automatically allocates a percentage of that paycheck into an individual’s different investment accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From a behavioral perspective, the best way to get somebody to save and invest is to enable them to set aside a piece of their paycheck as soon as it hits the account so that they don&#8217;t spend it. That feature has been really well adopted by our direct deposit customers,” Kerner said. “And so Michael and his team are coming in to manage that feature, and also our bank accounts product. I think their past experience is going to be really useful for us to take what we have and help the team catalyze it further.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its latest acquisition, Irvine, California-based Acorns now has more than 350 employees. In 2017, the company acquired Vault, now called “Acorns Later.” As a result of that acquisition, the company has seen its number of retirement accounts grow to 1.2 million from 500.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, Acorns has had a good year so far. In the first six weeks of 2021, the company added nearly 600,000 new accounts, reaching a total of more than 9 million users having saved and invested a total of $7.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first quarter was our biggest growth quarter on record,” Kerner told TechCrunch. “In particular we crossed the $4.3 billion in dollars in assets under management, which is a really exciting milestone when you think about the fact that these are customers that are saving small amounts of money in the relative scheme of money invested typically.”</span></p>

<p>COVID-19 forced many retailers and brands to adopt new technologies. Retail analytics unicorn <a href="https://traxretail.com/">Trax</a> expects that this openness to tech innovation will continue even after the pandemic. The Singapore-based company announced today that it has raised $640 million in Series E funding to expand its products, which combine computer vision and cloud-based software to help brick-and-mortar stores manage their inventory, merchandising and operations. The round included primary and secondary capital, and was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and returning investor BlackRock. Other participants included new investors OMERS and Sony Innovation Fund by IGV.</p>
<p>Before this round, Trax had raised $360 million in primary funds. J.P. Morgan acted as a placement agent to Trax on its Series E, which brings its total funding so far to $1.02 billion. Trax did not disclose a new valuation, but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trax-funding-idUSKCN1UH1W3">reportedly hit unicorn status in 2019</a>. Reports emerged last year that it is <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/DealStreetAsia/Singapore-startup-Trax-said-to-be-in-early-talks-for-US-listing">considering a public offering</a>, but chief executive officer Justin Behar had no comment when asked by TechCrunch if Trax is planning for an IPO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2010 and headquartered in Singapore, Trax <a href="https://traxretail.com/company/about-us/">also has offices</a> in Brazil, the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Israel, Mexico, Japan, Hungary, France, Russia and Australia. The company says it serves customers in more than 90 countries.</p>
<p>Behar told TechCrunch that the new funding will be used to “invest heavily in global [go-to-market] strategies and technology for our flagship Retail Watch solution, as we look for ways to make it easier for retailers and brands to continue their digitization journey. More specifically, we will use the capital to accelerate growth and triple-down on continued innovation across our core vision, machine learning, IoT and marketplace technologies.”</p>

<p>Launched last year, Retail Watch uses a combination of computer vision, machine learning and hardware like cameras and autonomous robots, to gather real-time data about the shelf availability of products. It sends alerts if stock is running low, corrects pricing errors and checks if planograms, or product display plans for visual merchandising, are being followed. Retail Watch currently focuses on center shelves, where packaged goods are usually stocked, but will expand into categories like fresh food and produce.</p>
<p>The funding will also be used to expand Trax’s Dynamic Merchandising, a partnership with on-demand work platform Flexforce, and Shopkick, the shopping rewards app <a href="https://traxretail.com/news/trax-acquires-shopkick-bridge-gap-mobile-physical-worlds-retail/">Trax acquired in 2019</a>, into new markets over the next one to two years.</p>
<p>“Finally, we see many opportunities to help retailers along their digitization journey and will be expanding into new use cases with products we develop internally and via potential acquisitions,” Behar said.</p>
<p>Early in the pandemic, retailers had to cope with surge buying, as customers emptied shelves of stock while preparing to stay at home. As the pandemic continued, buying patterns shifted dramatically and in April 2020,<a href="https://go.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-retail-will-see-a-2-1-trillion-loss-globally-in-2020-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic/"> Forrester forecast COVID-19</a> would cause global retail sales to decline by an average of 9.6% globally, resulting in a loss of $2.1 trillion, and that it would take about four years for retailers to overtake pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://go.forrester.com/press-newsroom/the-covid-19-pandemic-where-are-we-one-year-later-retail-and-ecommerce/">more recent report</a>, Forrester found despite spending cuts, nearly 40% of retailers and wholesalers immediately increased their tech investment, in some cases implementing projects in weeks that would have otherwise taken years.</p>
<p>Behar said “the pandemic made it clear the retail industry was not prepared for a sudden change in demand, as consumers faced empty shelves and out-of-stocks for extended periods in key categories. These extreme shifts in consumer behavior, coupled with global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, changing channel dynamics (such as e-commerce) and decrease in brand loyalty forced brands and retailers to develop new strategies to meet the evolving needs of their customers.”</p>
<p>He expects that willingness to adopt new technologies will continue after the pandemic. For example, to get shoppers back into brick-and-mortar stores, retailers might try things like in-store navigation, improved browsing, loyalty programs and new check out and payment systems.</p>
<p>Trax&#8217;s Retail Watch, Dynamic Merchandising and Dynamic Workforce Management solutions were in development before the pandemic, though “it has certainly expedited the need for innovative digital solutions to longstanding retail pain points,” Behar added.</p>
<p>For example, Retail Watch supports online ordering features, like showing what products are available to online shoppers and helping store associates fulfill orders, while Dynamic Merchandising lets brands find on-demand workers for in-store execution issues—for example, if new stock needs to be delivered to a location immediately.</p>

<p>Other tech companies focused on retail analytics include Quant Retail, Pensa Systems and Bossa Nova Robotics. Behar said Trax differentiates with a cloud-based platform that is “extensible, flexible and scalable and combines multiple integrated technologies and data-collection methods, optimized to fit each store, such as IoT-enabled shelf-edge cameras, dome cameras, autonomous robots and images taken from smartphones, to enable complete and accurate store coverage.”</p>
<p>Its proprietary computer vision technology was also designed specifically for use in retail stores, and identifies individual SKUs on shelves, regardless of category. For example, Behar said it can distinguish between near identical or multiple products, deal with visual obstructions like odd angles or products that are obscured by another item and recognize issues with price tags.</p>
<p>“Like many innovative solutions, our most meaningful competition comes from the legacy systems deeply entrenched in the world of retail and the fear of change,” he added. “While we do see an acceleration of interest and adoption of digital innovation as a result of the ‘COVID effect,’ this is by far our biggest challenge.”</p>
<p>In a press statement, SoftBank Investment Advisers director Chris Lee said, “Through its innovative AI platform and image recognition technologies, we believe Trax is optimizing retail stores by enabling [consumer packaged goods] brands and retailers to execute better inventory strategies using data and analytics. We are excited to partner with the Trax team to help expand their product offerings and enter new markets.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new UK public body that will be tasked with helping regulate the most powerful companies in the digital sector to ensure competition thrives online and consumers of digital services have more choice and control over their data has launched today.</p>
<p>The Digital Markets Unit (DMU), which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">announced in November last year</a> &#8212; following a number of market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/competition-policy-must-change-to-help-startups-fight-winner-takes-all-platforms-says-uk-report/">reviews</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/competition-policy-must-change-to-help-startups-fight-winner-takes-all-platforms-says-uk-report/">studies</a> examining concerns about the concentration of digital market power &#8212; does not yet have statutory powers itself but the government has said it will consult on the design of the new &#8220;pro-competition regime&#8221; this year and legislate to put the <span class="il">DMU</span> on a statutory footing as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>
<p>Concerns about the market power of adtech giants Facebook and Google are key drivers for the regulatory development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>As a first job, the unit will look at how codes of conduct could work to govern the relationship between digital platforms and third parties such as small businesses which rely on them to advertise or use their services to reach customers &#8212; to feed into future digital legislation.</p>
<p>The role of powerful intermediary online gatekeepers is also being targeted by lawmakers in the European Union who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">proposed legislation at the end of last year</a> which similarly aims to create a regulatory framework that can ensure fair dealing between platform giants and the smaller entities which do business under their terms.</p>
<p>The UK government said today that the DMU will take a sector neutral approach in examining the role of platforms across a range of digital markets, with a view to promoting competition.</p>
<p>The unit has been asked to work with the comms watchdog Ofcom, which the government named<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/uk-names-its-pick-for-social-media-harms-watchdog/"> last year</a> as its pick for regulating social media platforms under planned legislation due to be introduced this year (aka, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">Online Safety Bill</a> as it&#8217;s now called).</p>
<p>While that forthcoming legislation is intended to regulate a very wide range of online harms which may affect consumers &#8212; from bullying and hate speech to child sexual exploitation and other speech-related issues (raising plenty of controversy, and specific concerns about associated <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/endgame-for-end-to-end-encryption/">implications</a> for privacy and security) &#8212; the focus for the DMU is on business impacts and consumer controls which may also have implications for competition in digital markets.</p>
<p>As part of its first work program, the government said the secretary of state for digital has asked the DMU to work with Ofcom to look specifically at how a code would govern the relationships between platforms and content providers such as news publishers &#8212; &#8220;including to ensure they are as fair and reasonable as possible&#8221;, as its press release puts it.</p>
<p>This suggests the DMU will be taking a considered look at recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">legislation passed in Australia</a> &#8212; which makes it mandatory for platforms to negotiate with news publishers to pay for reuse of their content.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the head of the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which the DMU will sit within, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p097vbtc">told the BBC </a>that Australia’s approach of having a backstop of mandatory arbitration if commercial negotiations between tech giants and publishers fail is a &#8220;sensible&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>The DMU will also work closely with the CMA&#8217;s enforcement division &#8212; which currently has a number of open investigations into tech giants, including considering complaints against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">Google</a>; and an in-depth probe of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">Facebook&#8217;s Giphy acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>Other UK regulators the government says the DMU will work closely with include the data protection watchdog (the ICO) and the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>
<p>It also said the unit will also coordinate with international partners, given digital competition is an issue that&#8217;s naturally globally in nature &#8212; adding that it&#8217;s already discussing its approach through bilateral engagement and as part of its G7 presidency.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Digital Secretary will host a meeting of digital and tech ministers in April as he seeks to build consensus for coordination on better information sharing and joining up regulatory and policy approaches,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>The DMU will be led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-hayter-649576/?originalSubdomain=uk">Will Hayter</a>, who takes up an interim head post in early May following a stint at the Cabinet Office working on Brexit transition policy. Prior to that he worked for several years at the CMU and also Ofcom, among other roles in regulatory policy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.avant.com/">Avant</a>, an online lender that has raised over $600 million in equity, announced today that it has acquired Zero Financial and its neobank brand, Level, to further its mission of becoming a digital bank for the masses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2012, Chicago-based Avant started out primarily as an online lender targeting “underserved consumers,” but is evolving into digital banking with this acquisition. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company notched gross revenue of $265 million in 2020 and has raised capital over the years from backers such as General Atlantic and Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our path has always been to become the premier digital bank for the everyday American,” Avant CEO James Paris told TechCrunch. “The massive transition to digital over the last 12 months made the timing right to expand our offerings.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acquisition of Zero Financial and its neobank, Level (plus its banking app assets), will give Avant the ability to offer “a full ecosystem of banking and credit product offerings&#8221; through one fully digital platform, according to Paris. Those offerings include deposits, personal loans, credit cards and auto loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed other than the fact that the acquisition was completed with a combination of cash and stock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2016, San Francisco-based Zero Financial has raised $147 million in </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zero-financial/company_financials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debt and equity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to Crunchbase. New Enterprise Associates (NEA) led its $20 million Series A in May of 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level was unveiled to the public in February of 2020, c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reated by the same California-based team that founded the “debit-style” credit card offering Zero, according to this FintechFutures </span><a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/02/us-gets-new-challenger-level-bank-by-zero-creators/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The challenger bank was created to target millennials dissatisfied with the incumbent banking options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Financial co-founder and CEO Bryce Galen said that Avant shared his company&#8217;s mission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenge the status quo by bringing innovative financial services products to consumers who might otherwise be unable to access them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avant, notes Paris, uses thousands of AI-driven data points to determine credit risk. With this acquisition, that lens will be expanded with data, such as a deposit customer’s cash flow, how they manage their finances and whether they pay their bills on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will allow us to make credit decisions faster and deliver personalized options to help underbanked consumers gain financial freedom, at any and every stage of their financial journey,” Paris told TechCrunch. “It will also build long-term engagement and loyalty and help grow our reach beyond the 1.5 million customers we’ve served to date.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a growing number of fintechs, Avant operates under the premise that a person’s ability to get credit shouldn’t be dictated by a credit score alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A significant amount of Americans have poor, bad or no credit at all. For these people, accessing credit isn’t exactly easy and often comes with extra fees,” Paris said. That’s why, he added, Avant has focused on providing options for such consumers with “transparent, rewards-driven products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level’s branchless, all-digital platform offers things such as cashback rewards on debit card purchases, a “competitive APY” on deposits, early access to paychecks and no hidden fees, all of which are especially beneficial for consumers on the path to financial freedom, according to Paris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception in 2012, Avant has connected more than 1.5 million consumers to $7.5 billion in loans and 400,000 credit cards. The company launched its credit card in 2017 and over the past two years alone, it has grown its number of credit card users by 170%.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than 200 million people in India transact money digitally, but fewer than 30 million invest in mutual funds and stocks.</p>
<p>An Indian startup that is attempting to change this figure by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/groww-raises-6-2m/">courting millennials</a> announced a new financing round on Wednesday and turned into the newest unicorn in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="https://groww.in">Groww</a> has raised $83 million in its Series D financing round, which valued the Indian startup at more than $1 billion, up from $250 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/groww-an-investment-app-for-millennials-in-india-raises-30m-led-by-yc-continuity/">$30 million Series C in September last year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tiger Global led the new round, and existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, YC Continuity and Propel Venture Partners participated in it, said the four-year-old Indian startup, which has raised $142 million to date.</p>
<p>On a side note, Groww is the eighth Indian startup to attain the unicorn status this year &#8212; and fourth this week. Social commerce Meesho <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/">turned a unicorn on Monday</a>, fintech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">CRED on Tuesday</a>, and earlier today epharmacy firm PharmEasy <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/04/pharmeasy-raises-350-mn-round-led-by-prosus-and-tpg-enters-unicorn-club/">announced</a> a new financing round that valued the firm at about $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Groww allows users to invest in mutual funds, including systematic investment planning (SIP) and equity-linked savings, gold, as well as stocks, including those listed at U.S. exchanges. The app offers every fund that is currently available in India.</p>
<p>The startup has amassed over 8 million registered users, two-thirds of whom are first-time investors, Lalit Keshre, co-founder and chief executive of Groww, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Keshre said the startup &#8212; &#8212; co-founded by four former Flipkart executives including Harsh Jain, Neeraj Singh and Ishan Bansal &#8212; will deploy the fresh funds to accelerate its growth, and hire more talent. “We now have the fuel for longer-term thinking and faster growth,” he said.</p>
<p>More than 60% of Groww users come from smaller cities and towns of India and 60% of these have never made such investments before, said Keshre. The startup said it has conducted workshops in several small cities to educate people about the investment world.</p>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic has also accelerated the startup&#8217;s growth as youngsters explore new hobbies. The startup competes with a handful of firms including Zerodha, Paytm Money, Upstox, ET Money, Smallcase, and traditional firms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started Groww almost five years back to make investing accessible and transparent to everyone in India. We have made good progress, but it feels we have just got started,&#8221; said Keshre.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, a unicorn that helps connect consumers&#8217; bank accounts to financial applications, has raised a $425 million Series D, it announced this morning. TechCrunch understands that the new capital infusion, led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/altimeter-capital">Altimeter Capital</a>, values the company at around $13.4 billion.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that Plaid, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/">former takeover target</a> for consumer credit giant Visa, is raising more capital. After its $5.3 billion sale to the larger company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">fell through this January</a>, it became clear that Plaid would chart its own future, sans a corporate parent.</p>
<p>When the Visa-Plaid deal did finally grind to a halt in the face of regulatory scrutiny there was chatter amongst startup and venture folks that the sale dying out was a good thing. Why? Because Plaid had had a great 2020 and was generally agreed to be worth far more than what Visa had agreed to pay.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Series D valuation confirms the sentiment. And it wasn&#8217;t merely Altimeter that was willing to put capital into the company at its new valuation. The group was joined by two more news investors, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/silver-lake">Silver Lake Partners</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ribbit-capital">Ribbit Capital</a>. Silver Lake is a private equity leviathan with dozens of billions of dollars under management, while Ribbit is known for its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ribbit-capital/recent_investments">myriad fintech bets</a>.</p>
<p>In short, Plaid has picked up a hybrid of investor scale, late-stage guidance, and fintech acumen in a single round. A number of prior investors also put capital into round.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Plaid&#8217;s Zach Perret: &#8216;Every company is a fintech company&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/plaids-zach-perret-every-company-is-a-fintech-company/embed/#?secret=wxKKaEdY7B" data-secret="wxKKaEdY7B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Plaid CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/zachperret?lang=en">Zachary Perret</a> about the deal, who told TechCrunch in a brief phone call that Altimeter was selected as its new lead investor over other options due to shared alignment regarding the future of financial services for consumers. He added that he&#8217;s excited to learn from his trio of new backers, which will help the company build for the long-term.</p>
<p>The CEO also made passing mention of a future IPO, though TechCrunch doesn&#8217;t expect to see paperwork regarding a potential flotation from Plaid for some time; it was, however, refreshing to hear an executive admit to having future financial goals.</p>
<p>Regarding the amount of capital that it raised, Perret said that it was the &#8220;right level&#8221; of capital to allow Plaid to invest in scale, both in terms of its team and its product lineup. The CEO also said that the funds will allow his company to be opportunistic.</p>
<p>The last 12 months for Plaid have been busy. Perret mentioned the time period several times during the interview, explaining how rapidly the world evolved regarding the digitization of consumer financial services over the last year.</p>
<p>Finally, what of growth? What was Plaid willing to share on the growth front was light, merely disclosing that it grew its customer count by 60% in 2020. Perret said that the figure represented an acceleration from previous years. With around 650 staffers today, Plaid grew its headcount by around 20% in the first quarter according to its CEO.</p>
<p>Plaid sits in the midst of the fintech boom that TechCrunch has covered extensively over the past several quarters. As far as external signals go, watching the companies that must partially comprise Plaid&#8217;s customer base expand is about as close as we can get to other growth metrics. That particular signal bodes well for Plaid.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how well the company can fend off domestic and international competition. It certainly now has the funds to do so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Artificial intelligence has become a fundamental cornerstone of how a lot of business software works, providing a useful boost in reading, understanding, and using the often-fragmented trove of data that organizations generate these days. In the latest development, an Israeli startup called <a href="https://www.bluedotcorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue dot</a>, which uses AI to help companies handle their tax accounting, is announcing $32 million in funding to continue its growth, specifically addressing the demand from companies for more user-friendly tools to help read and correctly itemize expenses for tax purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tax sector is very complicated, and we are playing in a very large space, but it&#8217;s a huge revolution,&#8221; Blue dot&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Isaac Saft said in an interview. &#8220;Business and enterprise accounting is just not going to look the same in the future as it does today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Ibex Investors in partnership with Lutetia Technology Partners, with past investors Lamaison Partners, Viola and Target Global also contributing. Blue dot <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vatbox-the-leading-ai-driven-cloud-based-tax-compliance-platform-announces-a-new-company-name-blue-dot-301259604.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranded only last week from its original name, VATBox</a> (part of the funding will be used to help Blue dot move deeper into the U.S. market, where the concept of VAT is not quite so ubiquitous: there is no national sales tax and states determine the rates themselves).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/104757-49/company/profile#general-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pitchbook</a> notes that under its previous name, the startup last raised money in 2017, a $20 million Series B led by Viola at a $120 million post-money valuation.</p>
<p>While Blue dot is not disclosing valuation today, it&#8217;s likely to be significantly higher than this based on some of its engagements. In addition to customers like Amazon, tobacco giant BAT and Dell, it also has a partnership with one of the bigger names in expense accounting, <a href="https://www.concur.co.uk/tax-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAP Concur, which uses Blue dot</a> to power its expense data entry tool to automatically read charges and figure out how to itemize them so that employees or accountants don&#8217;t need to go through the pain of that themselves.</p>
<p>As Saft describes it, part of what is propelling his company&#8217;s business is the bigger trend of consumerization and the role that it has played in enterprise services: the working world has picked up a lot of technology tools, led by the smartphone, to help them organize their personal lives, and a lot of what they are being &#8220;served&#8221; through technology is increasingly personalized with lower barriers of entry, whether its on e-commerce sites, entertainment or social media. In the working world, they can often be frustrated as a result with how much work something like expenses can involve &#8212; a process that gets ever more complicated the more strict tax regimes become.</p>
<p>Blue dot&#8217;s approach is to essentially view the tax accounting process as something that can be improved with AI to make it easier for people to use &#8212; whether those people are workers itemizing their expenses, or accounts auditing them and running those through even bigger accounting processes. With a machine learning system that both takes into account a company&#8217;s own internal compliance and company policies, and the wider tax and regulatory framework, Blue dot helps &#8220;read&#8221; an expense and figure out how to notate it, how much tax should be accounted and where, and so on.</p>
<p>This is especially important as the process of entering and managing expenses gets pushed out to the people spending the money, rather than dedicated accountants handling that work on their behalf. An awareness of how modern offices are functioning today and evolving is one reason why investors were interested here.</p>
<p>“We believe Blue dot can change the way organizations worldwide manage accounting and its tax implications for their expenses,” Gal Gitter, a partner at Ibex, said in a statement. “There’s been a major market shift away from centralization of enterprise functions, including procurement. As that accelerates, more companies will be looking for ways to replace costly and complex manual processes with digital, automated solutions that use data and AI to essentially enable transactions to report themselves, which Blue dot delivers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">No-code startups continue to see a lot of traction among enterprises, where employees &#8212; strictly speaking, non-technical, but still using software every day &#8212; are getting hands-on and building apps to take on some of the more repetitive aspects of their jobs, the so-called &#8220;citizen coders&#8221; of the working world.</p>
<p>And in one of the latest developments, a <a href="https://bryter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryter</a> &#8212; an AI-based no-code startup that has built a platforms used by some 100 global enterprises to date across some 2,000 business applications and workflows &#8212; is announcing a new round of funding to double down on that opportunity. The Berlin-based company has closed a Series B of $66 million, money that it will be investing into its platform and expanding in the U.S. out of a New York office it opened last year. The funding comes on the heels of seeing a lot of demand for its tools, CEO and co-founder Michael Grupp said in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a great year for low-code and no-code platforms,&#8221; said Grupp, who co-founded the company with Micha-Manuel Bues and Michael Hübl. &#8220;What everyone has realized is that most people don&#8217;t actually care about the tech. They only care about the use cases. They want to get things done.&#8221; Customers using the service include the likes of McDonald’s, Telefónica, and PwC, KPMG and Deloitte in Europe, as well as banks, healthcare and industrial enterprises.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tiger Global is leading this round, with previous backers Accel, Dawn Capital, Notion Capital and Cavalry Ventures all also participating, along with a number of individual backers (they include Amit Agharwal, CPO of DataDog; Lars Björk, former CEO of Qlik; Ulf Zetterberg, founder and CEO of Seal Software; and former ServiceNow global SVP James Fitzgerald). The valuation is not being disclosed; Bryter has raised around $90 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/bryter-raises-16m-for-a-no-code-platform-for-non-technical-people-to-build-enterprise-automation-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accel and Dawn co-led Bryter&#8217;s Series A of $16 million</a> less than a year ago, in June 2020, a rapid funding pace that underscores both interest in the no-code/low-code space &#8212; Bryter&#8217;s enterprise customer base has doubled from 50 since then &#8212; and the fact that startups in it are striking while the iron is hot.</p>
<p>Bryter&#8217;s not the only one: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/genesis-raises-45m-to-expand-its-fintech-focussed-low-code-platform-to-more-verticals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/rows-formerly-dashdash-raises-16m-to-build-and-populate-web-apps-using-only-spreadsheet-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rows</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/creatio-raises-68m-as-the-low-code-space-keeps-attracting-huge-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creatio</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/ushur-raises-25m-for-its-no-code-platform-to-build-customer-communication-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ushur</a> are among the many startups building &#8216;hands-on tech creation for non-techie people&#8217; that have raised money in the last several months.</p>
<p>Automation has been the bigger trend that has propelled a lot of this activity. Knowledge workers today spend most of their time these days in apps &#8212; a state of affairs that pre-dates the Covid-19 pandemic, but has definitely been furthered throughout it. While some of that work still requires manual involvement and evaluation from those workers, software has automated large swathes of those jobs.</p>
<p>RPA &#8212; robotic process automation, where companies like UiPath, Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism have taken a big lead &#8212; has accounted for a significant chunk of that activity, especially when it comes to reading forms and lots of data entry. But there remains a lot of other transactions and activities within specific apps where RPA is typically not used (not yet at least!). And this is where non-tech workers are finding that no-code tools like Bryter, which use artificial intelligence to deliver more personalised, yet scalable, automation, can play a very useful role.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sit on top of RPA in many cases,&#8221; said Grupp.</p>
<p>The company says that business functions where its platform has been implemented include compliance, legal, tax, privacy and security, procurement, administration, and HR, and the kinds of features that are being built include virtual assistants, chatbots, interactive self-service tools, and more.</p>
<p>These don&#8217;t replace people as such but cut down the time they need to spend in specific tasks to process and handle information within them, and could in theory also be used to build tools for customers to interact with services more easily, cutting down on the amount of time that agents are getting details and handling engagements.</p>
<p>That scalability, and the rapid customer up-take from a pool of users that extends beyond tech early-adopters, are part of what attracted the funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bryter has all the characteristics of a top-tier software company: high quality product that solves a real customer pain point, a large market opportunity and a world-class founding team,&#8221; said John Curtius, a partner at Tiger Global, in a statement. &#8220;The feedback from Bryter&#8217;s customers was resoundingly positive in our research, and we are excited to see the company reach new heights over the coming years.”</p>
<p>“Bryter has seen explosive growth over the last year, signing landmark customers across a large number of sectors and use cases. This does not come as a surprise. In the pandemic-affected world, digitalisation is no longer a nice to have, it is an imperative,&#8221; added Evgenia Plotnikova, a partner at Dawn Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China is pushing forward an internet society where economic and public activities increasingly take place online. In the process, troves of citizen and government data get transferred to cloud servers, raising concerns over information security. One startup called <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/threatbook/company_financials">ThreatBook</a> sees an opportunity in this revolution and pledges to protect corporations and bureaucracies against malicious cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Antivirus and security software has been around in China for several decades, but until recently, enterprises were procuring them simply to meet compliance requests, Xue Feng, founder and CEO of six-year-old ThreatBook, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Starting around 2014, internet accessibility began to expand rapidly in China, ushering in an explosion of data. Information previously stored in physical servers was moving to the cloud. Companies realized that a cyber attack could result in a substantial financial loss and started to pay serious attention to security solutions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the meantime, cyberspace is emerging as a battlefield where competition between states plays out. Malicious actors may target a country&#8217;s critical digital infrastructure or steal key research from a university database.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of cyberattacks between countries is reflective of their geopolitical relationships,&#8221; observed Xue, who oversaw information security at Amazon China before founding ThreatBook. Previously, he was the director of internet security at Microsoft in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;If two countries are allies, they are less likely to attack one another. China has a very special position in geopolitics. Besides its tensions with the other superpowers, cyberattacks from smaller, nearby countries are also common.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like other emerging SaaS companies, ThreatBook sells software and charges a subscription fee for annual services. More than 80% of its current customers are big corporations in finance, energy, the internet industry, and manufacturing. Government contracts make up a smaller slice. With its Series E funding round that closed 500 million yuan ($76 million) in March, ThreatBook boosted its total capital raised to over 1 billion yuan from investors including Hillhouse Capital.</p>
<p>Xue declined to disclose the company&#8217;s revenues or valuation but said 95% of the firm&#8217;s customers have chosen to renew their annual subscriptions. He added that the company has met the &#8220;preliminary requirements&#8221; of the Shanghai Exchange&#8217;s STAR board,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/china-new-tech-board/"> China&#8217;s equivalent to NASDAQ</a>, and will go public when the conditions are ripe.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes our peers 7-10 years to go public,&#8221; said Xue.</p>
<p>ThreatBook compares itself to CrowdStrike from Silicon Valley, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/crowdstrike-a-cybersecurity-unicorn-files-to-go-public/">which filed to go public in 2019</a> and detect threats by monitoring a company&#8217;s &#8220;endpoints&#8221;, which could be an employee&#8217;s laptops and mobile devices that connect to the internal network from outside the corporate firewall.</p>
<p>ThreatBook similarly has a suite of software that goes onto the devices of a company&#8217;s employees, automatically detects threats and comes up with a list of solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like installing a lot of security cameras inside a company,&#8221; said Xue. &#8220;But the thing that matters is what we tell customers after we capture issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>SaaS providers in China are still in the phase of educating the market and lobbying enterprises to pay. Of the 3,000 companies that ThreatBook serves, only 300 are paying so there is plentiful room for monetization. Willingness to spend also differs across sectors, with financial institutions happy to shell out several million yuan ($1 = 6.54 yuan) a year while a tech startup may only want to pay a fraction of that.</p>
<p>Xue&#8217;s vision is to take ThreatBook global. The company had plans to expand overseas last year but was held back by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a handful of inquiries from companies in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. There may even be room for us in markets with mature [cybersecurity companies] like Europe and North America,&#8221; said Xue. &#8220;As long as we are able to offer differentiation, a customer may still consider us even if it has an existing security solution.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Patreon has tripled its valuation to $4 billion in a $155 million funding round led by Tiger Global, the company confirmed to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/patreons-valuation-triples-to-4-billion-as-creators-and-fans-flock-to-platform-11617762374">Wall Street Journal</a> on Tuesday.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The creator economy platform, which allows artists to be directly funded by their fans, received new attention amid the Covid-19 pandemic as creators were forced to push more of their work online. The creator payments space has seen a multitude of new entrants in recent months but the eight-year-old Patreon has already built up an extensive network. In a blog post last year, Patreon noted that more than 30,000 creators signed up for the service in the first weeks of March 2020.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Patreon makes money by taking a 5-12 percent fee from creators depending on which of the company&#8217;s services they use. The company wrapped a $90 million round in September that valued the company at $1.2 billion.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Other investors in this new round include Woodline Partners, Wellington Management, Lone Pine Capital and New Enterprise Associates, the report notes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European regulators have questions about a Facebook data breach, Clubhouse adds payments and a robotics company has SPAC plans. This is your Daily Crunch for April 6, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Facebook faces questions over data breach</strong></p>
<p>A data breach involving personal data (such as email addresses and phone numbers) of more than 500 million Facebook accounts came to light over the weekend thanks to a story <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4">in Business Insider</a>. Although Facebook said the breach was related to a vulnerability that was &#8220;found and fixed&#8221; in August 2019, the Irish Data Protection Commission — Facebook&#8217;s lead data regulator in the European Union — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/answers-being-sought-from-facebook-over-latest-data-breach/">suggested that it&#8217;s seeking the &#8220;full facts&#8221; in the matter</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The newly published dataset seems to comprise the original 2018 (pre-GDPR) dataset and combined with additional records, which may be from a later period,” said deputy commissioner Graham Doyle in a statement. &#8220;A significant number of the users are EU users. Much of the data appears to been data scraped some time ago from Facebook public profiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, it looks like EU regulators may also look into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebooks-kustomer-buy-could-face-eu-probe-after-merger-referral/">Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of customer service company Kustomer</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Encrypted chat app Signal is <a href="https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/">adding payments</a> to the services it provides, a long-expected move and one the company is taking its time on. A U.K.-only beta program will allow users to trade the cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.mobilecoin.com/">MobileCoin</a> quickly, easily, and most importantly, privately.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the U.K., or have some way to appear to be, you&#8217;ll notice a new Signal Payments feature in the app when you update. All you need to do to use it is link a MobileCoin wallet after you buy some on the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, the only one that lists it right now.</p>
<p>Once you link up, you&#8217;ll be able to instantly send MOB to anyone else with a linked wallet, pretty much as easily as you&#8217;d send a chat. (No word on when the beta will expand to other countries or currencies.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just as Signal doesn&#8217;t have any kind of access to the messages you send or calls you make, your payments are totally private. MobileCoin, which Signal has been working with for a couple years now, was built from the ground up for speed and privacy, using a zero-knowledge proof system and other innovations to make it as easy as Venmo but as secure as … well, Signal. You can read more about their approach <a href="https://github.com/UkoeHB/Mechanics-of-MobileCoin/blob/master/Mechanics-of-MobileCoin-v0-0-39-preview-10-11.pdf">in this paper (PDF)</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency advised early on by Signal&#8217;s Moxie Marlinspike, has raised venture funding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/mobilecoin-a-cryptocurrency-involving-signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-just-raised-venture-funding/embed/#?secret=Vo0MdYZVEl" data-secret="Vo0MdYZVEl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>MobileCoin just snagged a little over $11 million in funding last month as rumors swirled that this integration was nearing readiness. Further whispers propelled the value of MOB into the stratosphere as well, nice for those holding it but not for people who want to use it to pay someone back for a meal. All of a sudden you&#8217;ve given your friend a Benjamin (or perhaps now, in the U.K., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/computing-pioneer-and-lgbt-icon-alan-turing-will-grace-the-50-note-in-2021/">a Turing</a>) for no good reason, or that the sandwich has depreciated precipitously since lunchtime.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason you <em>have</em> to hold the currency, of course, but swapping it for stable or fiat currencies every time seems a chore. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-mobilecoin-payments-messaging-cryptocurrency/">Speaking to Wired</a>, Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike envisioned an automatic trade-out system, though he is rarely so free with information like that if it is something under active development.</p>
<p>While there is some risk that getting involved with cryptocurrency, with the field&#8217;s mixed reputation, may dilute or pollute the goodwill Signal has developed as a secure and disinterested service provider, the team there seems to think it&#8217;s inevitable. After all, if popular payment services are being monitored the same way your email and social media are, perhaps we ought to nip this one in the bud and go end-to-end encrypted as quickly as possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of Democratic lawmakers wrote to Mark Zuckerberg this week to press the CEO on his plans to curate a version of Instagram for children. In a hearing last month, Zuckerberg confirmed<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"> reporting by BuzzFeed</a> that the company was exploring an <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/03/25/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-congress-hearing-exploring-instagram-kids/7001956002/">age-gated version of its app</a> designed for young users.</p>
<p>Senators Ed Markey (D-MA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Representatives Lori Trahan (D-MA) and Kathy Castor (D-FL) signed the <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/instagram_kids_letter.pdf">letter</a>, expressing &#8220;serious concerns&#8221; about the company&#8217;s ability to protect the privacy and well-being of young users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook has an obligation to ensure that any new platforms or projects targeting children put those users’ welfare first, and we are skeptical that Facebook is prepared to fulfill this obligation,&#8221; the lawmakers wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They cited previous failures with products like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/04/facebook-messenger-kids/">Messenger Kids</a>, which had a flaw that allowed kids to chat with people beyond their privacy parameters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although software bugs are common, this episode illustrated the privacy threats to children online and evidenced Facebook’s inability to protect the kids the company actively invited onto this platform,&#8221; the lawmakers wrote.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mn21Ajb9vB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/">MIT professor wants to overhaul &#8216;The Hype Machine&#8217; that powers social media</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MIT professor wants to overhaul &#8216;The Hype Machine&#8217; that powers social media&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/embed/#?secret=mn21Ajb9vB" data-secret="mn21Ajb9vB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In light of these and other previous privacy and security issues on Facebook’s platforms, we are not confident that Facebook will be able to adequately protect children’s privacy on a version of Instagram for young users.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter set a deadline of April 26 for the company to provide answers to a comprehensive and helpfully specific set of questions about a future kid-targeted product.</p>
<p>In the letter, lawmakers posed a number of questions about how Facebook will handle the private data for young users and if that data would be deleted when an account is terminated. They also asked the company to commit to not targeting kids with ads and not employing push alerts and behavior-shaping features designed to make apps more addictive.</p>
<p>During last month&#8217;s big tech hearing in the House, committee members from both political parties grilled Zuckerberg about how Facebook and Instagram adversely affect mental health in young users. Rep. Castor also pressed the chief executive about underage users who circumvent Instagram&#8217;s existing age guidelines to use a platform full of posts, videos and ads designed for adults.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, every parent knows there are kids under the age of 13 on Instagram, and the problem is that you know it,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the first quarter of 2021, American consumer cryptocurrency trading giant <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> grew sharply, generating strong profits at the same time.</p>
<p>For Coinbase, the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210406006015/en/">disclosure</a> of its preliminary Q1 2021 results <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/coinbase-to-direct-list-on-april-14th-provide-financial-update-on-april-6th/">comes a week ahead</a> of its direct listing, an event that will see the company begin to trade publicly. As it is both cash rich and well known, Coinbase is foregoing a traditional IPO in favor of the more exotic method of going public.</p>
<p>In its release, Coinbase disclosed the following metrics, which TechCrunch has compared to metrics from <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm">its S-1 filing</a>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monthly transacting users (MTUs)</strong> of 6.1 million, up from 2.8 million at the end of 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Platform assets</strong> of $223 billion, up from $90.3 billion at the end of 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Trading volume</strong> of $335 billion, up from $193.1 billion at the end of 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> of $1.8 billion, up from $585.1 million in Q4 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Net income</strong> of &#8220;approximately $730 million to $800 million,&#8221; up from $178.8 million in Q4 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Adjusted EBITDA</strong> of &#8220;approximately $1.1 billion,&#8221; up from $287.7 million in Q4 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>The growth of Coinbase from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 is so extreme that the company&#8217;s year-over-year comparisons are farcical. For example, in Q1 2020 Coinbase&#8217;s revenues were $190.6 million, or just under 11% of its Q1 2021 top line. The company&#8217;s adjusted profits alone in Q1 2021 were more than five times its year-ago revenues.</p>
<p>The new numbers may help solidify some valuation marks that the company has been discussed as approaching, like the $100 billion threshold, or even boost them.</p>
<p>The company did present some warnings in its public release, noting that cryptocurrency price &#8220;cycles can be highly volatile, and as a result, [Coinbase] measure[s] [its] performance over price cycles in lieu of quarterly results.&#8221; The company also stated that future declines in crypto trading activity will not slow its investment:</p>
<blockquote><p>MTUs, Trading Volume, and therefore transaction revenue currently fluctuate, potentially materially, with Bitcoin price and crypto asset volatility. This revenue unpredictability, in turn, impacts our profitability on a quarter-to-quarter basis. <strong>In terms of expenses, we intend to prioritize investment, including in periods where we may see a decrease in Bitcoin price.</strong> This is because we believe that scale is central to achieving our mission and it is still early in the development of this industry. <em><strong>[Emphasis: TechCrunch]</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Or more simply, it is willing to sacrifice future profitability if its revenues decline, as it is building for the future instead of hewing to more near-term investor expectations. At least Coinbase is being clear in its messaging to investors: Don&#8217;t buy Coinbase stock expecting the company to tune its results to quarterly expectations.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five takeaways from Coinbase&#8217;s S-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/embed/#?secret=XadpEXQcUo" data-secret="XadpEXQcUo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Looking ahead, Coinbase did provide some guidance for its full-year results. For 2021, the company provided three scenarios. The first &#8220;assumes an increase in crypto market capitalization and moderate-to-high crypto asset price volatility,&#8221; leading to 7 million MTUs. The second &#8220;assumes flat crypto market capitalization and low-to-moderate crypto asset price volatility&#8221; and 5.5 million MTUs. The third &#8220;assumes a significant decrease in crypto market capitalization, similar to the decrease observed in 2018, and low levels of crypto asset price volatility thereafter&#8221; and 4 million MTUs for the year.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t think that Coinbase is anticipation stagnant growth, simply because its best scenario anticipates mere growth from 6.1 million MTUs to 7 million MTUs. The company wrote in its release under the headline &#8220;institutional revenue&#8221; that it expects &#8220;meaningful growth in 2021 driven by transaction and custody revenue given the increased institutional interest in the crypto asset class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s quarter was bonkers good. But so was the performance of cryptocurrencies themselves. A bet on the company&#8217;s shares, then, could easily be seen as a bet on the value of bitcoin and its ilk. April 14 is going to be a fun day to watch.</p>
