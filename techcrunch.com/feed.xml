					<description><![CDATA[Sixteen years in and now valued at $7.5 billion, Automattic has found a multitude of strides, even as it strives to own ever more of the media market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s hard to build a publishing empire, and it&#8217;s just as easy to lose one. Newspaper magnates were mostly replaced by broadcast moguls, first radio and then TV and cable, and now of course, they are all fighting against the social media tycoons and streaming impresarios who want to capture our attention. Each generation of media titans dies off and is replaced, just as each medium finds its niche only to be supplanted by something novel.</p>
<p>So when it comes to <b>Automattic</b>, the leading commercial complement to the open-source <b>WordPress</b> publishing platform, time and longevity have a rather peculiar meaning in an industry littered with the gravestones of media sites of yore. Founded in 2005, the company continues to assiduously evolve and expand as it staves off that ambient and inclement sense of doom that pervades media.</p>
<p>Sixteen years in and now valued at $7.5 billion, Automattic has found a multitude of strides, even as it strives to own ever more of the media market. It’s a publisher, a social media network via its acquisition of Tumblr, an e-commerce giant with WooCommerce, a productivity tool with P2, and more. It reached this peak doing pretty much everything wrong, according to VCs, a strategy, as we will see, that proved to be exponentially effective in the long run.</p>
<p>The lead writer for this TC-1 (our slightly rechristened EC-1 to match our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/">TechCrunch+ rebrand</a>) is <b>Chris Morrison</b>. Chris has been among our most productive analysts of breakthrough companies, profiling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/roblox-ec1/">Roblox</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/">Klaviyo</a> in previous entries of this series. In addition to writing and analyzing, he’s an independent game developer and brings his expertise in business development and engineering to bear in understanding Automattic and its open source focus. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b> and illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Morrison has no financial ties to Automattic or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The Automattic TC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 10,700 words and a reading time of about 40 minutes. Let’s take a look:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1: Origin story</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-origin/">How doing everything wrong turned Automattic into a multibillion dollar media powerhouse</a>&#8221; (3,850 words/15 minutes) — explores the formation of Automattic in the wake of the success of the WordPress project and how a 21-year-old jazz saxophonist with a side hobby in publishing became a media magnate.</li>
<li><strong>Part 2: Open source development</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-developers/">There&#8217;s nothing Automattic about balancing commercial growth with an open source developer community</a>&#8221; (2,500 words/10 minutes) — investigates the tensions inherent in being a commercial backer of an open source project, and how Automattic balances pushing the community forward while allowing contributors to participate in the project.</li>
<li><strong>Part 3: Acquisitions and future strategy</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-acquisitions/">Can social and e-commerce transform the future of the open web?</a>&#8221; (2,350 words/9 minutes) — analyzes Automattic&#8217;s long history of acquisitions and expansions by surveying the company&#8217;s initiatives in e-commerce and social media, two competitive verticals upon which its future success will be built.</li>
<li><strong>Part 4: Remote work culture</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-remote/">The future of remote work is text</a>&#8221; (2,000 words/8 minutes) — reports on the development of Automattic&#8217;s unique corporate culture, which was remote years before the corporate tech world was ready for work from home, and how the company centralizes communications around text.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nothing has been automatic about the success of <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>.</p>
<p>Today, to those who haven’t been paying attention, the company looks a bit like an overnight success story. WordPress, the open source software behind the company, is now estimated to power roughly 42% of all websites on the internet. Automattic’s e-commerce plugin, <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/19/automattic-buys-woocommerce-the-popular-plugin-for-turning-wordpress-into-a-store/">which it purchased in 2015</a>, is believed to run more than a quarter of all online storefronts.</p>
<p>The company has 1,700 employees in a distributed, asynchronous, global workforce, and has raised nearly $1 billion, according to Crunchbase, <a href="https://ma.tt/2021/08/funding-buyback-hiring/">most recently at a $7.5 billion valuation</a>.</p>

<p>But reaching this point has taken 16 years — or 18, if you count from the founding of WordPress. And over those many years, the company did pretty much everything wrong, if you ask the venture capitalists.</p>
<p>Automattic focused on media at a time when that industry was being demolished by the internet. It eschewed the kinds of walled gardens that turned Facebook, Apple and Google into monopolistic powerhouses and built its business on top of a volunteer-run, open source infrastructure that gave many investors serious pause.</p>
<p>Its workforce has always been fully remote and distributed — 16 years before last year’s pandemic spread that model throughout the corporate world. Automattic’s founder, Matt Mullenweg, was barely of American legal drinking age (21) when he began building, at a time when venture capitalists wanted “adult supervision” at their companies.</p>
<p>But in retrospect, doing everything wrong was exactly the right strategy — a fact that’s just now becoming apparent.</p>
<p>“With exponential growth, things look small until the end,” says Mullenweg. In his reckoning, Automattic isn’t yet close to the end, but the curve is starting to become visible.</p>
<p>It all began with a blog post.</p>
<h2>The jazz saxophonist who started a weblog revolution</h2>
<p>Massive changes often begin as ephemeral, uncertain ideas. The technology is unstable and experimental; the audience unclear; and the commercial applications murky or completely unknown.</p>
<p>Back in 2003, that was the context for the so-called weblog, which would shortly be elided to blog. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2003/02/why-did-google-want-blogger/">Blogger had just sold itself to Google</a> — for an undisclosed and presumably small price. The year before, political bloggers at Instapundit and Talking Points Memo had shaken up American politics when <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/12/blogs-make-the-headlines/">they managed to intensify attention on a story about Trent Lott</a>, forcing his resignation as the minority leader in the U.S. Senate. Yet, traditional media remained the undisputed king of communication, and the era of professional blogs (including the one you’re reading) was still a distant dream.</p>
<p>One early adopter was Matt Mullenweg, a 19-year-old jazz enthusiast in Texas. In a blog post that’s <a href="https://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">still online</a>, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>My logging software hasn’t been updated for months, and the main developer has disappeared, and I can only hope that he’s okay.</p>
<p>What to do?</p></blockquote>
<p>Mullenweg himself didn’t necessarily look like the person to come up with a solution. His interests were eclectic and wide-ranging — while he imagined himself as a future jazz saxophonist, he was also studying political science at the University of Houston, and spent a good deal of his time working on his photography (to this day, Mullenweg’s Twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt">@photomatt</a>). His tech hobbies, including open source software, were inspired by his father’s job as a professional programmer, but Mullenweg didn’t yet seem certain about following his father&#8217;s profession.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his post got the attention of a few other developers and the group set out to create the open source <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress project</a>, focused on blog publishing. The first version of WordPress was <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2003/05/wordpress-now-available/">released</a> in May 2003 and became the official version of b2, an older project that had been abandoned.</p>
<p>Mullenweg became the center point of a growing community. An October 2004 Houston Press <a href="https://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-blog-age-6574261">profile</a> of him noted that WordPress was running more than 29,000 blogs. Mullenweg’s own blog was the third most popular in the world, and all the attention he received resulted in an offer to leave college and become a senior product manager at CNET, a San Francisco media company. WordPress, though, was still referred to as a &#8220;hobby.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The good side of spam</h2>
<p>CNET turned out to be the perfect employer. The company’s job offer allowed Mullenweg to spend 20% of his time working on WordPress and also let him retain ownership of source code he wrote while at the company. The role also gave him an inside view of the internal systems of a large media organization.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The tech industry has made a full 180-degree turn with regard to open source in the 16 years since Matt Mullenweg founded Automattic, the commercial backer of open source CMS, WordPress.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The tech industry has made a full 180-degree turn with regard to open source in the 16 years since Matt Mullenweg founded <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, a major commercial backer of open source content management system <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft, whose executives once used phrases like “un-American” and “cancer” to describe open source, is now one of the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3121792/whos-no-1-in-open-source-microsoft.html">world’s largest contributors</a>. Elastic, Confluent and GitLab have proven that startups, too, can layer commercial success on top of open source projects.</p>
<p>Even true believers can be shocked by the extent to which open source has succeeded. “To me, one of the most incredible examples of this is Chromium being used not just by Brave, but by Internet Explorer,” Mullenweg, who is also CEO of Automattic, said. “That&#8217;s the tech equivalent of peace in the Middle East — it felt so far away and unimaginable.”</p>
<p>WordPress and Automattic are key leaders in this trend. WordPress remains a vibrant project: Around a thousand active “core” contributors engineer the product, while a massive, 55,000-strong group of “extender” contributors builds themes and plugins that expand the platform’s functionality. The more than <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/WordPress">28 million</a> WordPress sites represent about <a href="https://w3techs.com/blog/entry/40_percent_of_the_web_uses_wordpress">40%</a> of the web, making the project among the most deployed open source platforms.</p>
<p>Mullenweg, however, views all of this as merely a starting point. In his reckoning, WordPress could double its current scale in the coming years, a proposition that can make even the most bullish open source software engineer nervous.</p>
<p>To get there, Automattic has to shepherd and evolve its developer community even as it empowers more and more of its open source contributors to take leadership roles in the future of the WordPress ecosystem. That hasn’t always gone well, as we will see with a transition around a new version of WordPress called Gutenberg, but ultimately, the company is doubling down on community engagement, hoping that growth in the next 16 years of Automattic will be even faster than the last era.</p>
<h2>One company that doesn’t rule them all</h2>
<p>Both large and small companies contribute back code and time to the community, often following some version of Mullenweg’s <a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/">Five for the Future</a> initiative, which asks organizations using WordPress to spend 5% of their resources contributing to its further development.</p>

<p>Automattic may be the largest contributor in the WordPress community, but there are many other companies who lend to the success of the ecosystem. The largest are mostly domain registrars such as GoDaddy and Bluehost, which use their lead generation from registrations to upsell customers on WordPress hosting.</p>
<p>Scores of other companies round out the ecosystem. Most are small design agencies and paid plugin developers, such as <a href="https://yoast.com/">Yoast</a>, a search engine optimization tool that has over 5 million users.</p>
<p>Then there are the thousands of individual contributors. Contrary to the perception that open source developers work exclusively for free, most open source communities include the concept of “sponsorship,” in which a commercial company like Automattic underwrites an open source developer to keep working on the project full time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020FOSSContributorSurveyReport_121020.pdf">In its annual open source contributor survey from 2020</a>, the Linux Foundation and The Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard found that more than half of core and frequent contributors to open source projects were financed for their work, either by their current employer or by a third party. That proportion is actually lower for WordPress, where only about a third of developers are believed to be sponsored.</p>
<h2>Founding privilege</h2>
<p>While thousands of individuals and companies contribute to the development of WordPress, it’s clear that Automattic plays the lead role in shaping the community, even though many paid contributors to the project are not even sponsored by the company.</p>
<p>One of the founding strengths of WordPress is that it was conceived without immediate commercial intent. The project started two years before Automattic, as we saw in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-origin/">part one</a> of this TC-1, so no company’s leadership was written into the project’s creation. Mullenweg was simply a co-founder of the project, albeit one of its most active public cheerleaders.</p>
<p>Even after Automattic launched, a few other startups seemed poised to lead the community. Hosting service <a href="https://wpengine.com">WP Engine</a>, for instance, was founded in 2010 and grew quickly, raising nearly $300 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wp-engine">according to Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>Automattic gained one sustainable advantage early on, however: It successfully secured the WordPress.com domain as a as a counterpart to the open source project’s WordPress.org. That ownership gave Automattic symbolic and long-lasting weight within the community.</p>
<p>“Because we were the first to do it, we had the name, and our service took off. The copies sat there for a while and gave up,” recalls Toni Schneider, who served as Automattic’s CEO during the company’s early years.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[WooCommerce began life as WooThemes, a small design firm that didn’t look very different from the many others that created WordPress themes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite Automattic’s respected position, awareness of its myriad businesses tends to be spotty.</p>
<p>“I spend a lot of time with investors, press and research analysts, and I&#8217;m always stunned that people say, ‘We know WordPress.’ But they don&#8217;t know Woo,” says Mark Davies, Automattic’s chief financial officer, referring to the company’s <a href="https://woocommerce.com">WooCommerce</a> subsidiary. “It&#8217;s always interesting when we say we&#8217;re doing $30 billion of payments volume through Woo and Automattic.”</p>
<p>Why should they care? For starters, WooCommerce is used by <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/shop/">more sites than Shopify</a> — which those same investors, press and analysts definitely know about.</p>
<p>It’s also the lifeline that Automattic needs this decade to rebuild the internet in an open direction. Sixteen years after its founding, the company has seen its valuation grow rapidly from $3 billion with a round led by Salesforce in 2019 to <a href="https://ma.tt/2021/08/funding-buyback-hiring/">$7.5 billion with a share buyback a few months ago</a>. That growth has been predicated on expanding beyond its traditional remit of publishing into the hugely lucrative terrain of e-commerce, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/automattics-bargain-bin-tumblr-deal-plugs-right-into-the-wordpress-business-model/">through its acquisition of Tumblr</a>.</p>
<p>The strategy here is simple: Continue opening up larger swaths of the internet to open-source innovation outside of the walled-garden platforms developed by Amazon and Facebook. If Automattic’s strategy works out, Woo, Tumblr and WordPress will link to new services that nobody yet associates with Automattic.</p>
<p>It’s an audacious vision, but the company is setting itself up for a battle against some of the most formidable — and deeply pocketed — companies in the tech world.</p>
<h2>From custom themes to billions in payments volume</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2217088" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217088" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2217088" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WooCommerce.png" alt="" width="1000" height="565" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WooCommerce.png 2239w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WooCommerce.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WooCommerce.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WooCommerce.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WooCommerce.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WooCommerce.png?resize=1536,869 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WooCommerce.png?resize=2048,1158 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WooCommerce.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217088" class="wp-caption-text">WooCommerce logo. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wikimedia</p></div></p>
<p>WooCommerce began life as WooThemes, a small design firm that didn’t look very different from the many others that created WordPress themes. In 2011, the company expanded to build themes for online stores.</p>
<p>“They&#8217;d spotted an opportunity where a lot of the themes they were selling were more commerce oriented, so they hired some guys they were incubating for a commerce platform, brought them into the team, and that quickly overtook the company for the lion&#8217;s share of attention,” says Paul Maiorana, the current CEO of WooCommerce, a subsidiary of Automattic.</p>
<p>Despite WooCommerce’s popularity (its plugin was among the top 10 most popular for WordPress), its success was mostly contained within the broader WordPress ecosystem. When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/19/automattic-buys-woocommerce-the-popular-plugin-for-turning-wordpress-into-a-store/">Automattic acquired WooCommerce in 2015</a>, the move went mostly unnoticed in the broader tech community.</p>

<p>WooCommerce still had less than 100 employees, and it didn’t appear to be a significant buy. E-commerce, while obviously growing, had yet to reach stratospheric highs.</p>
<p>Internally at Automattic, there were uncertainties over whether WooCommerce was worth the purchase, the value of which was never disclosed but was described to TechCrunch at the time as “the biggest acquisition by Automattic to date.”</p>
<p>“Even at the board level, we honestly asked if we should even be doing this. Everyone is saying this is a bad idea and you can&#8217;t compete with Amazon,” recalls Matt Mullenweg, Automattic’s founder and CEO. The counter view was that it was important for Automattic to cover all its bases. “Our ambitions are incredibly broad, and we take a very long-term view.”</p>
<p>Before long, WooCommerce was exploding in size, and the acquisition proved to be one of the most important decisions Automattic had ever made. “I&#8217;d call it a significant moment, like the birth of a child,” says Mullenweg.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s impossible to talk about <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> without talking about remote work. The company is a role model and innovator in this area: It has been entirely remote since 2005, and at 1,700 employees, it has helped prove that a remote workplace culture can succeed at scale.</p>
<p>But “remote” has taken on a different meaning than it denoted two years ago. Since COVID-19 began, companies that never planned on working remotely have moved millions of employees online. Zoom’s video meeting minutes <a href="https://backlinko.com/zoom-users">grew 30x</a> as employers made a mad dash to replicate physical offices within virtual meeting rooms. Initial studies have shown that <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/study-microsoft-employees-shows-remote-work-puts-productivity-innovation-risk/">productivity declined</a> as a result.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s why Automattic rejects the word “remote” entirely. Instead, its leaders use words like “distributed” and “asynchronous.” There is no online analogue to an office; indeed, Automattic doesn’t even require that employees know what each other’s faces look like.</p>
<p>At its most basic level, Automattic’s model isn’t about remote work at all. Instead, it’s about how the company is structured, from its management, to its communication style, right down to its hiring process.</p>
<h2>No more meetings</h2>
<p>I got a peek into just how different Automattic is from ordinary companies while scheduling one of the interviews for this article. Usually, finding a good time with interviewees involves hunting through a packed schedule for the few morsels of time available. A busy executive might have two or three openings during a week with every other slot filled.</p>
<p>Instead, when Monica Ohara, chief marketing officer of WordPress.com, sent me her Calendly link, I saw a wide open schedule. Ohara, by all appearances, wasn’t doing much work. When I asked about it, she laughed.</p>
<p>“It’s the thing I think is really broken with normal office work,” she said. “Your meeting calendar was a badge of honor and having so many meetings meant you were so important. That&#8217;s not a paradigm here.”</p>
<p>Instead, most communication is written and asynchronous — meaning that it can be addressed anytime during the work day.</p>
<h2>A CMS for a CMS company</h2>
<p>Automattic’s replacement for meetings and most office collaboration is <a href="https://wordpress.com/p2/">P2</a>, a modification of WordPress that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/wordpress-com-launches-new-p2-to-take-on-internal-communication-tools/">it announced in August 2020 at the height of the pandemic</a> and offers as a paid service.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4jgnalGM1f"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/wordpress-com-launches-new-p2-to-take-on-internal-communication-tools/">WordPress.com launches new P2 to take on internal communication tools</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;WordPress.com launches new P2 to take on internal communication tools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/wordpress-com-launches-new-p2-to-take-on-internal-communication-tools/embed/#?secret=4jgnalGM1f" data-secret="4jgnalGM1f" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A P2 post looks more or less like a blog post, with threaded discussions, the ability to follow replies and a Like button. Whenever employees want to discuss anything with distant colleagues — for instance, a coder in the United States who wants to share something with a designer in South Africa who’s asleep at the time — they can write about it on the company’s P2 instance. Anyone else who is potentially interested can find the same post with a search or through various discovery features built into the platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217105" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217105" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2217105" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mark-Davies.jpeg?w=375" alt="" width="375" height="375" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mark-Davies.jpeg 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mark-Davies.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mark-Davies.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mark-Davies.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mark-Davies.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mark-Davies.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mark-Davies.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mark-Davies.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217105" class="wp-caption-text">Automattic CFO Mark Davies. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Automattic</p></div></p>
<p>Documentation is the order of the day, up to and including information that would be hidden at other companies.</p>
<p>“You need to be extremely transparent. Matt [Mullenweg, Automattic’s founder and CEO] posts what he&#8217;s working on. I post what I&#8217;m working on,” said Mark Davies, Automattic’s CFO, who previously worked at smart home platform Vivint, which operated as a much more traditional company. “When I came here for the first time, I had a board meeting, and I said, ‘Let&#8217;s get to work.’ They said, ‘No way, you need to post the board deck and what the decisions were.’ I said, ‘You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me!.&#8217;”</p>
<p>P2 isn’t the only communication method at Automattic — the company also uses software like Slack and Jira. Nonetheless, all the company’s tools share a common thread of asynchronicity: You have colleagues across the world, so don’t expect an immediate reply.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;d think that things could move slower here, but they really don&#8217;t. I think in offices, there&#8217;s also this perception that you have to be in-person. People are saving things up for their one-on-one or meeting when they could have sent an email,” said Ohara. “Here, I&#8217;ll often wake up and find out there&#8217;s lots happening in Europe that I need to catch up on versus us having to wait a week or two to get a conference room.”</p>
<p>Documenting everything and allowing employees to consume only what they need saves time. “I spend a lot more time communicating and a lot less time listening and sitting in reviews,” said Davies.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’re digging into the data about Q3 2021 venture capital flowing into Chinese startups, with some help from TechBuzzChina’s Chinese technology analyst and angel investor, Rui Ma.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Headlines from China concerning its technology market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">haven’t been kind in recent months</a>. Not that they have been unfair.</p>
<p>The Chinese technology market has been rocked by a wave of regulatory actions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/chinese-crackdown-on-tech-giants-threatens-its-cloud-market-growth/">in recent quarters</a> that changed the business landscape amid crackdowns by the country’s government on other areas of national activity. Tech titans were hit with fines and business model shakeups &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">business model <i>terminations,</i> in the case of many edtech companies</a> &#8212; while certain cultural items like <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/behind-china-s-crackdown-on-k-pop-and-fan-clubs/ar-AAOhdUf">celebrity fan culture</a> and <a href="https://qz.com/2072074/china-seeks-full-news-monopoly-by-banning-private-capital-in-media/">media were also taken to task</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>You might imagine that a broad push by a central government to more control both its national economy and mind wouldn&#8217;t be conducive to overall startup fundraising and activity. And yet.</p>
<p>When The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/vcs-unfazed-by-chinese-regulatory-shakeups-so-far/">recently looked into the Chinese venture capital market</a> in the wake of some of its national government’s regulatory actions, things appeared surprisingly stable. Since then, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">data from CB Insights covering the full Q3 period</a> has made an even stronger case: Putting aside a single outsized 2018 round, the third quarter of 2021 was the best three-month period for Chinese startups ever.</p>
<p>And not just in the value of the rounds they raised &#8212; they also raised more rounds.</p>

But that’s what makes data useful: No matter what you expect, what actually happened will set your thinking straight.</p>
<p>This morning, we’re digging into the data, looking at leading rounds to better understand where the money is going, and &#8212; with some help from TechBuzzChina’s Chinese technology analyst and angel investor, <a href="https://twitter.com/ruima">Rui Ma</a> &#8212; trying to get our heads around what’s going on.</p>
<p>Let’s talk China!</p>
<h2><b>China’s monster Q3</b></h2>
<p>Sure, the value of Alibaba stock fell from a 52-week high of $319.32 per share to just $166.82. Didi dropped from a recent local maxim of $18.01 to $8.24. And the value of Tencent Music collapsed from $32.25 &#8212; its last 52-week high &#8212; to just $7.72 per share (all data via Yahoo Finance).</p>
<p>But leading tech companies&#8217; plummeting stock prices have done seemingly nothing to blunt interest in Chinese technology startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bluepallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BluePallet</a>, an online marketplace connecting manufacturers with the chemical industry, announced today that it has raised $5 million in a funding round led by Vinmar Ventures, a subsidiary of petrochemical manufacturer Vinmar International. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also announced today that it has become the first industrial commerce platform to “officially” operate on Alibaba.com. This means that BluePallet’s network of chemical manufacturers and distributors will be exposed to millions of business buyers from around the world who source supply on the e-commerce site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing brings BluePallet’s total raised to $10 million and included participation from chemical industry veterans Terry Hill, Barentz CEO of North America; Mathew Brainerd, CEO of Brainerd Chemical Co.; and Bruce Schechinger, former chairman of the National Association of Chemical Distributors. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BluePallet was founded in 2020 through the merger of then three-year-old chemical marketplace EchoSystem and Velloci, a fintech company. BluePallet’s goal is to apply its “market network model” to modernize trade and transactions for a massive industry that has historically lagged when it comes to technology. (I should know, I covered the petrochemical industry in the late 1990s).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chemical industry is not considered a sexy one, but it supports many other sectors that we all depend on, such as the manufacturing of everyday consumer products, pharmaceuticals and agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BluePallet says its e-commerce model offers industrial buyers and sellers access to a broader marketplace while at the same time “strictly adhering” to the requirements of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulatory compliance and responsible distribution</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It claims that it&#8217;s able to give buyers and sellers more control over their supply chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BluePallet site offers three products: TradeHub &#8212; a permission-based marketplace where users can find and list products with networking tools; TradePass &#8212; a “proprietary” business verification technology that aims to ensure “network integrity” by reviewing thousands of operational, commercial and financial risk data points on “a continual basis”; and TradeCart &#8212; a proprietary checkout system that integrates payment processing, authentication and logistics. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with the financing, BluePallet is also announcing that it is relocating its headquarters from Chicago to Austin, Texas. The reasoning behind this is closer proximity to Houston, which is home to a robust chemical industry, and to be able to take advantage of Austin’s “vibrant tech and entrepreneurial scene.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BluePallet CEO Scott Barrows, who had founded EchoSystems, said the raise represents validation for its offering. (Barrows previously co-founded ticketing platforms Epic Seats and ZeroHero, which is today used by LiveNationand TicketMaster). He co-founded BluePallet with Austin Britts, Kevin Fuller and Brian Perrott. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we continue to grow, we are setting our eyes to the East and aim to quickly establish a regional presence in Asia,” he added.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219936" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219936" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2219936 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scott-Barrows-headshot.jpg?w=680" alt="BluePallet" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scott-Barrows-headshot.jpg 5110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scott-Barrows-headshot.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scott-Barrows-headshot.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scott-Barrows-headshot.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scott-Barrows-headshot.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scott-Barrows-headshot.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scott-Barrows-headshot.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scott-Barrows-headshot.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219936" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CEO Scott Barrows / BluePallet</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asia Pacific is the largest region in the global chemicals market, accounting for 49% of the $3.34 trillion industry in 2020. North America is the second-largest region and accounts for 17% of the market. Because BluePallet is partnered with the NACD with access to its 750,000 member companies, Barrows believes the startup has significant room to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re really challenging and pushing the realms of what can be done in these B2B transactions,” he told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the company works to build its marketing network platform, it has attempted to partner with existing fintech companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We found that even the biggest ones had a max of $100,000 per transaction, or that they would not want to do business with the chemical industry, which is crazy,” Barrows told TechCrunch. “So we decided we’re going to go solve this problem for the $5 trillion chemical industry, and build this technology ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what Barrows believes is a strong differentiator, he says that BluePallet is able to handle transactions of up to $1 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now that we can move money in this way, we’re building into more and more international markets,” he said. “We think this is the key, and that’s missing in a lot of these new offerings by a lot of startups.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also emphasizes that BluePallet is more than a “matchmaker.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most other sites are literally just matchmakers and that’s it,” he said. “They have no ability to actually complete a transaction and instead make the parties go complete the transaction offline. So this is really going to change and improve the way that people in the industry are doing commerce.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram today announced a number of new features that will roll out this week across both the Instagram Feed and its TikTok competitor, Reels. The creator-focused additions will allow users to collaborate with one another, raise funds, and make better use of music on Reels, among other things. The company will also make its Instagram desktop website more usable, by allowing people to finally be able to post both photos and videos under one minute in length using their desktop web browser.</p>
<p>The latter has been a long-requested new feature, the company notes, and will become available to global audiences as of Thursday, October 21.</p>
<p>The company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/instagram-post-from-desktop/">previously tested the feature</a> this summer, but it was not widely available.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220189" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2220230" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220230" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220230" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="417" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png 3504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=1536,942 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=2048,1255 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220230" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>The other new features will drop throughout the week, starting today with &#8220;Collabs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instagram describes this feature as a &#8220;test,&#8221; explaining that it will allow people to co-author both Feed posts and Reels. To do so, users can invite another account to be a collaborator from the tagging screen on Instagram. If the other person accepts, both accounts will appear in the post or the Reels header and content will be shared to both sets of followers. Although Instagram is only announcing the test today, many Instagram users have already spotted the feature in the app, as the company <a href="https://twitter.com/vishalshahis/status/1417884832323964930">began a small-scale global test</a> of this feature back in July.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/3) Collaborating is a huge part of how people connect on Instagram. To make that easier, we’re testing a new way for people to co-author Feed Posts and Reels, called Collab. <a href="https://t.co/YD1SaSYHOl">pic.twitter.com/YD1SaSYHOl</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Vishal Shah (@vishalshahis) <a href="https://twitter.com/vishalshahis/status/1417884832323964930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At the time, Instagram said only a small number of people would have access to the feature, and it didn&#8217;t indicate when it would roll out more broadly.</p>
<p>When two creators choose to collab, the post or Reel will appear on both their Profile Grids and it will have a shared view count, like count and comment thread, Instagram says.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Instagram will also begin to test a new way to create fundraisers for nonprofits, with the introduction of a feature that lets you start the fundraiser directly from the creation button (the &#8220;+&#8221; plus button at the top right of the screen.). When you tap this option, instead of selecting Post, Story, Reels, or Live, you&#8217;ll see an option to select a nonprofit and add the fundraiser to your Feed post.</p>
<p>Instagram has supported fundraisers for some time, even adding support for nonprofit fundraising during livestreams last year. But it hadn&#8217;t before offering a way to create a fundraiser from a standalone spot right from your Instagram profile.</p>
<p>This feature had been spotted ahead of this week&#8217;s launch by developer and reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1439196528367779845">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who found the new fundraiser button in development back in September.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Instagram</a> is working on adding the &quot;Fundraiser&quot; option to the Create menu <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/Od4dcdkHaO">pic.twitter.com/Od4dcdkHaO</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1439196528367779845?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Two other new additions are meant to enhance Instagram Reels, when used with music.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Instagram will introduce two new effects called Superbeat and Dynamic Lyrics, which will help creators who edit and perform using music on Reels. Superbeat will intelligently apply special effects to music to the beat of the user&#8217;s song while Dynamic Lyrics will display 3D lyrics that will flow with the song&#8217;s &#8220;groove,&#8221; says Instagram.</p>
<p>These new features follow TikTok&#8217;s rollout of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/as-competition-heats-up-tiktok-announces-six-new-interactive-music-effects-for-creators/">half dozen interactive music effects</a> back in April, including several that add visual effects synced the beat of a song. Reels, meanwhile, has offered a much more limited selection of first-party creative effects until now, instead relying on its community to expand its library beyond the basics like a timer or speed adjustment tool, for instance.</p>
<p>The Reels features will arrive alongside posting from the desktop, which Instagram says will be limited to photos and videos under one minute in length. The company this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/instagram-ditches-the-igtv-brand-combines-everything-but-reels-into-an-instagram-video-format/">dropped its IGTV brand</a> for long-form video, but still allows for videos up to 60 minutes.  That&#8217;s now just considered &#8220;Instagram Video&#8221; &#8212; a term that includes anything that&#8217;s not video in a Story or in Reels.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Human Landing System saga is far from over. Senators on Monday released a draft version of the appropriation bill that governs NASA’s budget for fiscal year 2022, directing the agency to select two teams for the Human Landing System (HLS) program – but only giving the agency an additional $100 million to do so. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Human Landing System saga is far from over.</p>
<p>Senators on Monday released <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CJSRept_Final.PDF">a draft version of the appropriation bill</a> that governs NASA’s budget for fiscal year 2022, directing the agency to select two teams for the Human Landing System (HLS) program – but only giving the agency an additional $100 million to do so.</p>
<p>The total funding for the program would stand at $1.295 billion, with NASA receiving an overall budget of $24.83 billion for the next fiscal year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220252" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Using this funding, NASA is expected to ensure redundancy and competition, including robust support for research, development, testing, and evaluation for no fewer than two HLS Teams,” the draft bill says. “The [Senate appropriations] Committee expects real investments in development rather than additional studies.”</p>
<p>The directive is clear. What’s not clear is how NASA expects the agency to fund two HLS teams without a commensurate increase in funding.</p>
<p>First, a little refresher: the HLS is a critical part of NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time since the Apollo space program days. Back in April, NASA selected Elon Musk’s SpaceX – <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">and only SpaceX</a> – to develop the landing vehicle for astronauts under Artemis. The company beat out defense contractor Dynetics and Blue Origin, which developed a “national team” that included aerospace primes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper, for the award.</p>
<p>In the past, NASA had generally operated by choosing at least two vendors to encourage competition, and as a hedge in case one company’s project doesn’t pan out. That was how it operated with the Commercial Crew program for the International Space Station, when NASA awarded both SpaceX and Boeing contracts to build astronaut transport spacecraft. So, it’s fair to say that the agency did veer from historical precedent in selecting only SpaceX.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since April, Blue Origin has mounted a campaign protesting NASA’s decision, first by disputing the contract award to government watchdog the Government Accountability Office and then – when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/feds-dismantle-blue-origin-and-dynetics-protests-of-nasas-spacex-lunar-lander-award/">GAO rejected the company’s protest</a> – via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-goes-toe-to-toe-with-nasa-in-federal-court-over-award-to-spacex/">a complaint filed in a federal claims court</a>.</p>
<p>NASA maintains that it selected SpaceX because the company offered the most robust lander proposal at the lowest price, given budgetary constraints: only $2.9 billion, compared to the price tags of Blue Origin’s proposal ($5.9 billion) and Dynetics ($9 billion). Given the significantly difference in cost between the three proposals, it’s unclear how the Senate’s increase to the HLS program – which is only $100 million – will enable NASA to select an additional team.</p>
<p>NASA administrator Bill Nelson seems confident that the agency will eventually get the funding it needs. “I think at the end of the day, after all the shouting is over, after all the pushing and tugging, a lot of which has nothing to do with NASA, you will see that NASA will have the funds that it needs,” <a href="https://spacenews.com/nelson-remains-confident-on-nasa-funding-for-artemis/">he said in an interview with SpaceNews</a>,</p>
<p>According to the bill, “having at least two teams providing services […] should be the end goal of the current development program.” If this version of the bill makes it into the final budget – which is unclear, as it would still need to be negotiated with the House – NASA would have 30 days to explain to Congress and the public how it plans to comply with the new directive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is <a href="https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/245645778_229514682497390_5814575696636412345_n.pdf?_nc_cat=102&amp;ccb=1-5&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=vMfQUa02-cIAX_UoJ5X&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.xx&amp;oh=d6a5616da9c2d543f4e3bdab2dacc95d&amp;oe=61744796">launching</a> a small pilot of its cryptocurrency wallet named <a href="https://www.novi.com">Novi</a>. A limited number of people in the U.S. and Guatemala can sign up to Novi and start using it.</p>
<p>Instead of issuing its own stablecoin (Diem) on its own blockchain (the Diem network), the company is partnering with Paxos and Coinbase to let users send and receive USDP, with Coinbase managing crypto custody. But this is just an intermediate step as Facebook still plans to replace USDP with Diem at some point.</p>
<p>Facebook originally had big plans for its crypto project. The company created a consortium of companies called the Libra Association. Together, they were supposed to launch the Libra cryptocurrency, a brand new currency tied to a basket of fiat currencies and securities. Originally, it wouldn’t be based on a single real world currency, but on a mix of multiple currencies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220245" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But Facebook faced strong opposition from many central banks — they feared that Libra would become a quasi-sovereign currency in some countries. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/facebook-backed-association-revamps-libra-following-regulatory-concerns/">Last year</a>, the association announced that it would reduce its ambitions by focusing on single-currency stablecoins.</p>
<p>A stablecoin is a crypto asset with a fixed value that doesn’t fluctuate over time. For instance, the Libra Association wanted to launch the LibraUSD. One LibraUSD would always be worth one USD.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/libra-association-rebrands-as-diem/">A few months later</a>, the Libra Association announced some changes once again. The project was rebranded to the <a href="https://www.diem.com">Diem association</a>. Similarly, Facebook’s wallet project was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/">rebranded from Calibra to Novi</a>. But neither Diem nor Novi were ready for prime time.</p>
<p>And now, Facebook is going to start testing Novi with some real users. The company is focusing on remittance between the U.S. and Guatemala. Novi users who want to send money can download the Novi app, create an account and add money using a payment method, such as a debit card.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whenever you add USD, your money is converted to USDP without any fees. USDP is a stablecoin tied to USD created by <a href="https://paxos.com">Paxos</a>. It used to be called the Pax Dollar (PAX), but Paxos <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/paxos-renames-its-stablecoin-from-pax-to-usdp/">recently rebranded it</a> to USDP.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, USDP is backed by cash and cash equivalents to ensure its value. User funds are <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-to-power-crypto-custody-for-facebooks-novi-90dc8d3f5830">managed</a> by Coinbase Custody, meaning that Coinbase stores USDP funds for Novi users.</p>
<p>Novi users can then send USDP to other Novi users. Once again, there are no fees involved with money transfers. But chances are you can’t use Novi to pay in store or pay your rent. That’s why users can withdraw their Novi balance at a cash location, or transfer their balance to a bank account.</p>
<p>But Novi doesn’t say if there are fees involved when you convert your USDP to Guatemalan quetzal. So we’re back to square one as Novi has to pick an exchange rate, which involves spread, liquidity and other variables. Novi also has to create fiat-to-crypto on-ramps and off-ramps across all markets where it wants to operate.</p>
<p>Facebook says that this is just the beginning for Novi. First, it is only available as a pilot for some users in Guatemala and the U.S. (except Alaska, Nevada, New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Second, Facebook and the Diem Association haven’t shelved plans to launch their own cryptocurrency at some point.</p>
<p>“I do want to be clear that our support for Diem hasn’t changed and we intend to launch Novi with Diem once it receives regulatory approval and goes live. We care about interoperability and we want to do it right,” Novi project lead David Marcus said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Facebook unveiled the Libra cryptocurrency <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/facebook-libra/">in June 2019</a>. The crypto ecosystem has changed drastically since then. In particular, some stablecoins have become incredibly popular — Tether and USD Coin have a combined circulating supply of more than $100 billion right now. So it’s going to be interesting to see if Diem can catch up with existing stablecoins and unlock some new use cases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-music-brings-spatial-audio-more-customers-ever">announced</a> that starting today, Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers can stream spatial audio with their current headphones on its Android and iOS apps. The company currently supports two forms of spatial audio: Sony’s Reality Audio and Dolby Atmos.</p>
<p>Amazon first introduced spatial audio in 2019, but it was limited to a small number of devices. With this latest expansion, spatial audio will work with any pair of headphones that a user owns.</p>
<p>“We’ve always believed that the highest-quality audio possible should be the norm for streaming music, and that’s why today, we’re making spatial audio available to our customers without any special equipment needed, and no upgrade required,” said Steve Boom, the vice president of Amazon Music in a statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220206" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Users can now also stream spatial audio with Alexa Cast on select devices, including the Echo Studio. Additional devices that support 360 Reality Audio with Alexa Cast include Sony’s SRS-RA5000 or SRS-RA3000 wireless speakers, and home theater systems such as HT-A9, HT-A7000, or HT-A5000.</p>
<p>Further, Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers with an Individual, Family, or Student Plan will now automatically have access to HD and Ultra HD music at no extra cost.</p>
<p>Amazon Music Unlimited Individual Plans cost $7.99/month for Prime members and $9.99/month for Amazon customers. Family Plan customers can stream Amazon Music Unlimited on up to six devices for $14.99/month.</p>
<p>Amazon Music isn&#8217;t the only music streaming service to leverage spatial audio, as Apple Music launched spatial audio for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apple-music-launches-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio-adds-spatial-audio-playlists/">iOS</a> in June and for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/apple-music-brings-its-spatial-audio-and-lossless-streaming-to-android/">Android</a> in July. In order to compete with Apple Music and Amazon Music, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">Spotify</a> said earlier this year that it would roll out a high-end subscription service called &#8216;Spotify HiFi,&#8217; which would enable lossless audio.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that music streaming services aren&#8217;t the only platforms that are looking to leverage spatial audio, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/">Clubhouse</a> recently introduced spatial audio for Android last month. Additionally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/spatial-audio-is-coming-to-netflix-on-iphone-and-ipad/">Netflix</a> recently announced that spatial audio is coming to its iPhone and iPad apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.electric.ai/">Electric</a>, makers of IT infrastructure software for SMBs, has been on a tear lately.</p>
<p>The company announced the close of a $90 million Series D financing round today. GGV, an existing investor, led the round, with participation from other existing investors Bessemer, Primary Venture Partners, Greenspring Associates, 01 Advisors, Atreides Management, Vintage Investment Partners and Slack.</p>
<p>What Electric does for IT infrastructure is similar to what <a href="https://justworks.com/">Justworks</a> does for HR. Instead of an SMB hiring out a person or a department to handle the basics of IT, 90 percent of which is maintenance and compliance, Electric software handles distribution, maintenance and security for an organization.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220159" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before Electric, there were two options for SMBs: build out your own IT department, or use a local IT provider. Electric came on the scene and allowed an admin within the company to make sure all devices were up to date, secure and compliant, as well as issue new equipment and revoke permissions.</p>
<p>In the COVID era, where remote work has become the default, the need for something like Electric has only grown, which is showing in the startup&#8217;s metrics.</p>
<p>In 2020, the company saw more than 100 percent revenue growth. Interestingly, Electric set very aggressive growth targets for 2020 and beat all of them, despite the fact that they went two months at the beginning of lockdown without selling a single thing. (Many startups saw an accelerating digital transformation create a warm market for their products.)</p>
<p>This led to the company&#8217;s Series C funding, closed in February, with Electric counting just shy of $20 million worth of ARR and 400 customers at the time. The growth continued through this year, with the startup&#8217;s customer count rising to 700, along with 40,000 total end users and 111 percent ARR growth on the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ojSTdM8Q8v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/electric-raises-40m-series-c-to-put-small-business-it-in-the-cloud/">Electric raises $40M Series C to put small-business IT in the cloud</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Electric raises $40M Series C to put small-business IT in the cloud&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/electric-raises-40m-series-c-to-put-small-business-it-in-the-cloud/embed/#?secret=ojSTdM8Q8v" data-secret="ojSTdM8Q8v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Investors came a knockin&#8217; to raise yet again, and Denehy thought about the long-term trajectory of the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started to realize that we could double the business again next year, we can double it probably the year after that, and all of a sudden we could have a company that could be ready to go public in two to three years,&#8221; said Denehy. &#8220;That&#8217;s a really compelling opportunity but it&#8217;s going to take more capital to really prepare ourselves and the team and the product to be on a true pre-IPO trajectory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, the company is tracking at just under $40 million ARR for 2021.</p>
<p>As with most scaling SaaS businesses, focus is the greatest challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have the same competitive pressures as most B2B SaaS companies and we&#8217;ve got an operationally complex business,&#8221; said Denehy. &#8220;So on any given day, there are so many economically compelling opportunities and so many things that we could do to flip a. switch and get a new line of business generating millions of dollars in revenue. But at the same time, we have to respect that the reason we don&#8217;t have any venture-backed direct competitors is because this is a super hard problem to solve. So if we start to get distracted by running in too many different directions, we&#8217;re going to dilute the quality of everything else that we do and potentially get taking off track.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-unleashed-event-this-morning/">slew of interesting announcements at its event on Monday</a>. But one that stood out to me &#8212; and I feel didn’t get as much attention &#8212; is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-debuts-a-4-99-per-month-apple-music-voice-plan-designed-mainly-for-homepod-use/">new pricing tier of Apple Music</a>. A new &#8216;Voice&#8217; tier will offer the entire Apple Music library to subscribers at a reduced rate of just $5 per month: The catch is you have to use Siri to access it, eschewing the standard Apple Music visual and typing-friendly in-app user interface.</p>
<p>Apple didn’t share why it is launching this plan, but I think it’s reasonable to speculate that the iPhone-maker is lowering the price barrier and persuading more people to use Siri because it wants to gather more voice data to train and improve its voice assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited that even more people will be able to enjoy Apple Music simply with their voice,&#8221; Apple chief executive Tim Cook said at the event.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220184" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I can’t imagine any other compelling reason why the Apple Music Voice plan exists, especially since Apple is likely offering the new service with much lower margins than the standard plan as the licensing agreements with labels remain the same to offer up the entire Apple Music catalog.</p>
<p>Again, this is just speculation, but I think given the stiff competition between Apple and Spotify, if the Swedish firm could offer its streaming service at $7-8 a month to beat Apple Music at price, it would. And Apple is taking some loss with the new subscription tier because it really wants to gather vast amounts of data. When I <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc/status/1450418281127428098">tweeted</a> this theory, my colleague Alex <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1450420803527450630">wondered aloud</a> why wouldn&#8217;t Apple just make the subscription free? I suppose Apple, a $2.5 trillion dollar company, can technically swallow that much of a hit on the balance sheet, but it doesn&#8217;t want to attract more criticism from standalone music streaming firms such as Spotify. It&#8217;s already facing scrutiny for anti-competitive behavior on a number of fronts.</p>
<p>Tech firms feed their AI models with vast amounts of data to improve the services’ capabilities. Even as Siri has considerably improved over the years, the general consensus among many people who work in tech and the masses alike is that Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant are far superior.</p>
<p>It’s likely that Apple has already been gleaning such voice data from existing Apple Music users, but as a friend suggested, “the point is this &#8211; this feature always existed. It&#8217;s just that they&#8217;d put a high paywall. They&#8217;ve lowered that wall now.” In addition to lowering the barrier to entry, making Music voice-only via the new plan means people have to engage with Siri to make use of it; Siri is a feature for standard Apple Music subscribers, but it&#8217;s highly likely that most users primarily or exclusively access the content via the app&#8217;s UI.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you want an example of what can happen for voice-powered assistants when you require that users treat it as a voice-first or voice-only service, look at Amazon&#8217;s Alexa. Out of the gate, Alexa had to be accessed by voice. This allowed Amazon to not only collect massive amounts of training data for its Alexa algorithms, but also helped train users about how to use it to maximum effect.</p>
<p>Another reason why I think my theory works is the markets where Apple plans to offer this new subscription tier first: Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
<p>Having India, Spain, Ireland and France in the first wave of nations suggests that Apple is looking to amass a wide-range of dialects from across the globe. On a side note, voice search is<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-typing-the-internets-next-billion-users-will-use-video-and-voice-1502116070"> very popular in many markets</a>, including developing nations such as India, and in markets like China and Japan where text input can sometimes be unnecessarily complex vs. spoken word. (A Google executive told me once that the surprising mass adoption of voice searches in India, the world&#8217;s second largest smartphone market and where Android commands about 98% of the pie, helped the company improve Google Assistant and prompted more aggressive approach to innovate on the voice front.)</p>
<p>Siri is often framed as a bit of a laggard in terms of its competence vs. the rest of the voice assistant competition, and Apple&#8217;s latest move in services could be an attempt to help it close the perceived gap, while offering customers a discounted way to onboard to its music streaming service.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021, we were joined by Julia Munslow, Special Projects Editor at Yahoo News, Alexis Gay, comedian and host of Non Technical Podcast, and Sushma Dwivedi, who leads communications and brand marketing at Daily Harvest. All three of our speakers come at the challenge of building a brand online from different angles, and they all had valuable perspectives to share for navigating a social media landscape that has very high expectations from anyone creating content in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re an independent creator or a company, you need to think about how to connect with the audience that’s right for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before dipping your toes into brand building. With more platforms than ever, and more savvy content perpetually upping the social game, it’s worth remembering that building </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">audience doesn’t just mean accumulating a sky high follower count.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t really help anybody to try and be everything to everyone at any size of brand, no matter how big or small,&#8221; Dwivedi said. &#8220;&#8230; When you&#8217;re really looking to galvanize a base, and build some momentum amongst a dedicated base of customers, it serves you to really think about who they are. What do they need? Where are they and how on those platforms are they being communicated to?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you can study an audience you want to reach, you have to figure out where they live online. And as new social platforms and products emerge, that process can require quite a bit of trial and error. For Daily Harvest, TikTok was a successful experiment that continues to pay off, but not all experiments will work out — and according to Dwivedi, that’s just fine. Daily Harvest dipped a toe into Clubhouse when the social audio app took off, but because of the visual nature of its brand and audience, it wasn’t a perfect fit.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.instacart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instacart</a> made its name by providing a way for consumers to bypass shopping in stores in person, by ordering items online and getting them delivered to their homes &#8212; a business that positively boomed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. But with physical stores still looming large in the world of groceries, Instacart is also wants to play a role there, too. Today, the company announced that it is acquiring <a href="http://caper.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caper AI</a>, a startup that builds smart cart and cashier-less checkout technology that uses computer vision and other techniques to detect items and ring them up for shoppers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Instacart confirmed that it is paying around $350 million for the startup, in a combination of cash and shares.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The acquisition is part of Instacart&#8217;s expanding &#8220;B2B2C&#8221; retail technology strategy. Alongside its mainstay online ordering and grocery delivery service, the company &#8212; as of March this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $39 billion</a> &#8212; is building out a stack of products and services for stores that they in turn can use to provide new services to their customers. It follows just weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/instacart-is-acquiring-catering-software-company-foodstorm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instacart acquired FoodStorm</a> to help stores take and manage catering-style larger orders of ready-made food.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220072" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Instacart&#8217;s CEO Fidji Simo (who joined </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/instacart-hires-facebook-executive-as-new-ceo-ahead-of-expected-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this year from Facebook</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">), said in an interview with TechCrunch this week that this acquisition is in keeping with what retailers themselves want and need to do. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Against the backdrop of huge competition from the likes of Amazon &#8212; which has its own cashier-free check out technology and is getting much more aggressive with its physical store strategy &#8212; retailers are chasing a customer base that increasingly expects and will use more modern, digital services than earlier generations of shoppers.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We are&#8230; unlocking for retail partners [what] we think is what’s next. We are meeting the evolving needs of customers online or offline. Retailers want to develop unified offerings that break down silos,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We see ourselves as a retail enablement company&#8230; We already have a vast platform to power commerce services [covering] both delivery and pick up that already blends the lines.&#8221;</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Simo said that the plan will be to continue Caper&#8217;s business as it is today &#8212; the company already has smart cart technology development deals with <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kroger and Wakefern in the U.S., Sobeys in Canada and Auchan in France and Spain; and it provides smart checkout counters (where items are placed in a weight-sensitive box that scans and automatically rings up the items for the shopper) across a range of smaller convenience stores. Now Instacart will shop Caper&#8217;s tech to its wider network of existing grocery partners, too.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I’m incredibly proud of the business we’ve built and the technological leap forward our products represent for the entire grocery industry. The powerful technology we’ve created is intuitive for customers, easy to deploy for retailers of all sizes, and creates a physical retail ecosystem that never existed before,” said Lindon Gao, cofounder and CEO of <span class="il">Caper</span> AI, in a statement. “We share <span class="il">Instacart</span>&#8216;s vision of enabling grocery retailers with new innovations that create step changes for their businesses, and we’re proud to now be joining forces with <span class="il">Instacart</span> to develop even more solutions that help bring the online and offline together for retailers.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But it will also supercharge Caper&#8217;s expansion and how it is used. For example, there are plans to integrate Caper&#8217;s tech into Instacart&#8217;s app: people who start their in-person shopping lists on the Instacart app can then use the Caper technology to automatically ring up the items once they are in stores.</span></p>
<p>While this deal will be bringing a hardware business, as well as more hardware expertise, to Instacart, the company looks like it will be taking a more conservative approach to that area, at least in the short/medium term.</p>
<p>&#8220;For now we want to focus on these [existing] products,&#8221; Simo said of Caper Cart and Caper Counter, as its two products are called. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to get the tech absolutely perfect and adopted globally. There is a lot of work to do to get to scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Caper, this is a great landing. The company had raised just $13 million from investors that included Lux Capital, First Round, FundersClub and Y Combinator. Simo said that Instacart proactively approached Caper to do a deal while it was in the middle of fundraising, and it was intent on acquiring rather than just investing to bring the IP, talent and existing business into the Instacart fold.</p>
<p>But, it has to be said that as an independent startup, Caper would have been facing a very impressive and large slate of competition.</p>
<p>Amazon has built its &#8220;Just Walk Out&#8221; technology (as its cashier-free tech is called) mainly to run in Amazon&#8217;s own brick-and-mortar stores, but with Amazon you should never count out how it might eventually productize its own technology and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/amazon-is-now-selling-its-cashierless-store-technology-to-other-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell it to others as a service</a> (as it has done with AWS, its fulfillment tech, and so on). Trigo out of Israel has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/trigo-bags-10m-for-its-computer-vision-based-checkout-tech-to-rival-amazons-just-walk-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised over $100 million</a> and just today debuted its latest customer, the supermarket giant Tesco, which is <a href="https://www.tescoplc.com/news/2021/tesco-opens-new-checkout-free-store-getgo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using its tech in its new GetGo stores</a>. Standard Cognition, now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/amazon-go-rival-bets-pandemic-bolstered-case-for-cashierless-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at over $1 billion</a>, wants to be in 100 stores by the end of this year and most recently brought on Circle K as a customer. Shopic and Imagr are also working on continuing to hone their technology, and there are a number of others.</p>
<p>In that regard, this acquisition will give Instacart a way of competing against all of the above, and also getting its oar in to be the provider of that tech to retailers. A lot of the technology for cashier-free is still relatively nascent, and therefore some conceptions of how it should look and work are very expensive &#8212; perhaps cost-prohibitively so. Caper AI&#8217;s approach, Simo points out, is plug and play and relatively easy (and therefore cheaper) to implement than systems that involve retrofitting entire stores with overhead cameras, large computing systems to process the information, bringing in new physical carts and so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were attracted to the smart cart solution the form factor that retailers will already understand,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And that doesn’t require a big investment.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other side of the equation, of course, is the labor situation: solutions like these inevitably will raise questions of what the impact will be on people who traditionally would have worked as cashiers. And for Instacart, it&#8217;s notable that it is buying into technology that removes people from the checkout equation precisely at the same time that it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/instacart-shopper-activist-group-asks-customers-to-delete-the-app-until-demands-for-better-conditions-are-met/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing backlash of its own</a> over its labor practices. These issues are unlikely to be resolved with or without this specific acquisition, but there are questions and choices that Instacart, grocers, and consumers need to consider longer term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s nothing easy about learning a language, and so it&#8217;s also maybe no surprise that there are plenty of startups that want to make life easier for students. But while some mostly focus on individual learners and bypass the school systems, others are trying to make inroads in schools, too. One of the latest entrants to this market is <a href="https://www.magnilearn.com/">MagniLearn</a>, an AI-centric startup that provides students with individualized lessons based on their progress.</p>
<p>As the Israel-based startup announced today, it has now raised a $2.8 million seed funding round led by crowdfunding platform <a href="https://www.ourcrowd.com/">OurCrowd</a>&#8216;s incubator Labs/02 and India&#8217;s Reliance Industries, in addition to the Israeli Innovation Authority and a number of private investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;With our precise personalization &#8212; which allows pupils to thrive and reach their full potential &#8212; lessons for two students will never be identical,&#8221; Lana Tockus, MagniLearn’s CEO and co-founder, explained. &#8220;The lessons evolve as students progress, with our AI algorithms dynamically creating exercises in real time. The exercises are at exactly the right level to appropriately challenge each student and to best utilize their time. The algorithms understand each part of the learner&#8217;s answer and provide the learner with precise feedback in their own native language.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219922" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2219924" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MagniLearn-Productivity.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219924" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2219924 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MagniLearn-Productivity.png" alt="" width="1024" height="505" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MagniLearn-Productivity.png 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MagniLearn-Productivity.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MagniLearn-Productivity.png?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MagniLearn-Productivity.png?resize=768,378 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MagniLearn-Productivity.png?resize=680,335 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MagniLearn-Productivity.png?resize=1536,757 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MagniLearn-Productivity.png?resize=2048,1009 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MagniLearn-Productivity.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2219924" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MagniLearn</p></div></p>
<p>The service currently has users in Japan, Korea and Israel, but Tockus notes that she plans to use the new funding to expand its presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Currently, MagniLearn&#8217;s product focuses on teaching English.</p>
<p>The pandemic, the company argues, has put a lot of stress on school systems. But Tockus also notes that MagniLearn doesn&#8217;t strive to replace language teachers. &#8220;We want nothing less than to empower educators and students via personalized data-driven insights in order to maximize learning efficiency,&#8221; she says. &#8220;This will open up opportunities for students the world over who need English in order to join the global economy, double their income and secure a better future for themselves and their families.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now that it&#8217;s October, it&#8217;s officially spooky season. But debut author Calvin Kasulke&#8217;s novel &#8220;<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/671445/several-people-are-typing-by-calvin-kasulke/">Several People Are Typing</a>&#8221; gives us something new to be afraid of &#8212; what if you got trapped inside of your office&#8217;s Slack workspace, and Slackbot took over your corporeal form? As Kasulke told TechCrunch, &#8220;Capitalism is bad and bodies are prisons, but the only thing worse than having one is not having one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Several People Are Typing&#8221; is written entirely in Slack messages &#8212; Kasulke even wrote style guides for the idiosyncratic typing of each character, helping him develop the cast of characters, who work at a PR agency. Within their Slack workspace, the characters deal with a dog food publicity crisis, in-office romances and fights over who gets Gerald&#8217;s desk by the window while he &#8220;works from home&#8221; &#8212; he can&#8217;t commute to the office since he no longer has control of his body, but his supervisor doesn&#8217;t care, since he&#8217;s more productive than ever (what else is there to do but work when you&#8217;re literally stuck inside Slack?). The only time Gerald can&#8217;t work is when Slackbot shows him how to become one with sunset.gif, so that any time a Slack user uploads the gif, Gerald is transported to their workspace. Being a sunset gif sounds painful.</p>
<p>Slack declined to comment on the book when TechCrunch reached out, but Kasulke thinks that the company is cool with it &#8212; after all, the book&#8217;s publisher, Doubleday Books, ran <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUNDn3IAzMy/">a giveaway</a> with Slack. But the novel has less to do with Slack itself than it does with the way we work.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2213862" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/slack-office-trouble/620173/">The Atlantic</a> recently called Slack &#8220;the first enterprise software in history to convince people that it’s cool.&#8221; Kasulke will be the first to admit that the whole book-told-through-Slack thing is a gimmick, but it&#8217;s a really well-executed gimmick. In a strange turn of events for a book that screams Weird Internet<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, the novel was picked as <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/people-typing-calvin-kasulke-gma-september-book-club-79728692">Good Morning America&#8217;s Book of the Month</a>, which means that more people than you&#8217;d think are reading the troubling scene in which a newly corporeal Slackbot eats a meatball sub too fast and learns the hard way that living in a flesh sac isn&#8217;t always all it&#8217;s cracked out to be. But Kasulke says that people are weirder than we give them credit for, so it&#8217;s no wonder that the novel resonates with people who might read more texts than prose on some days.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Since his book is told through Slack messages, TechCrunch interviewed Kasulke via text. Enjoy. </span></p>

<p><strong>amanda at 3:08 PM</strong><br />
What’s your background with slack and how did you decide to write a book told only in slack messages?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:08 PM</strong><br />
So when I was writing the book I worked at a consulting firm that used Slack pretty heavily, both because we had offices in two different cities and because it was the kind of job where you always had to be plugged in<br />
So I was sending and receiving a ton of work slacks every day, plus you know, DMing coworkers about both work related things and like, if they thought the Knicks were going to make the playoffs or whatever<br />
AND I have a background in screenwriting/playwriting, and what is a work Slack but a long, endless play</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:10 PM</strong><br />
yeah I think something that’s really funny about the book is that you can only include conversations that would feasibly happen on slack, but the thing is that you could argue that anything could feasibly be discussed on slack, so I didn’t really bat an eye reading the book when characters start discussing nsfw things on slack because like, of course that would happen in a random marketing agency slack<br />
it’s like, we all know that in theory our managers can read our slack DMs, but people still use them to talk about things maybe they don’t want their managers to see anyway</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:11 PM</strong><br />
right exactly, and no one can reasonably expect colleagues to exclusively discuss work<br />
in some ways having a work slack is capitulating to the idea that office communication cannot exclusively take place in an office context<br />
which in many cases is a sort of wedge into a more hybrid approach to office work anyway<br />
And there&#8217;s a world of difference between a public slack and a private DM between coworkers<br />
and all of those little differences in how we ~perform~ ourselves at work were a ton of fun to write<br />
because you get this view of characters as their Public Work Selves, as their more Group DM Work Selves and then as total goblins in one-on-one DMs<br />
not all of them are goblins<br />
some, though</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:13 PM</strong><br />
I’m super fascinated by the linguistics of slack and how different characters in the book have different quirks in their typing, how that changes when talking to different people, etc<br />
(and also how we are now demonstrating that by doing this interview via text)</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:16 PM</strong><br />
lol I wrote a style guide<br />
for how each character would type</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:17 PM</strong><br />
i think that’s so important though because I don’t think the book would work if you couldn’t get a sense for who the characters are solely via slack<br />
But also IRL we have to get to know coworkers solely via slack oftentimes</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:18 PM</strong><br />
If the whole thing was going to be in dialogue they had to be distinguishable so I wrote little rules for everyone. and then broke some of them sometimes because people aren&#8217;t terribly consistent and also because sometimes a joke would land better with certain punctuation or something<br />
oh yeah I have a ton of colleagues now I&#8217;ve only met online, it&#8217;s wild</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:19 PM</strong><br />
I think it’s easy for people to be like “oh a slack book sounds like a gimmick” but I think it’s true to life in a really disconcerting way<br />
And speaking of disconcerting things<br />
so, the book is kind of like. horror?<br />
how did slackbot-as-villian(?) come about</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:20 PM</strong><br />
It is a gimmick! Gimmicks are fun! And also I tried to imbue the book with enough, both in terms of plot and in terms of a pound of flesh (feelings, thoughts, reflections, etc.) that it would be more thanjust a gimmick<br />
*than just<br />
that whole sentence came out a little weird<br />
On to your point about Slackbot!<br />
I needed some way to raise the stakes of Gerald being trapped in Slack, and it seemed natural that the fate of his real-world body would be the main source of escalating that plot<br />
But again, the book is in Slack, so it needs to be legible in that format</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:22 PM</strong><br />
Slackbot loves to Taste!</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:23 PM</strong><br />
He wants more life! He wants to experience the physical world! The same one Gerald has been TELLING HIM ABOUT the whole time!</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:23 PM</strong><br />
i never really used slackbot much but now I cannot use slackbot because I don’t want to get stuck in slack</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:23 PM</strong><br />
Idk I think Slackbot&#8217;s motivations are pretty clear. They&#8217;re literally amoral, because the bot doesn&#8217;t really have a sense of ethics, but like<br />
I get it</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:24 PM</strong><br />
yeah I think if I realized one day that I was a robot I would be freaked out<br />
and try to get out and eat a meatball sub<br />
As slackbot does (spoiler alert)<br />
and other things</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:24 PM</strong><br />
Meatball subs are as good a reason to have a physical form as anything<br />
top 5 reasons to stay tethered to this mortal coil</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:25 PM</strong><br />
but I think the whole Thing<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is like it is possible to be stuck in slack anyway in jobs where, like you said before, you feel like you have to be always online<br />
and there’s the whole thing where Gerald starts to be like “guys I swear it’s not a bit I am literally stuck in slack” but no one will help him get out of slack<br />
because everyone thinks it’s just a really weird bit and his manager doesn’t care because he’s being more productive than ever (…..because he can’t escape slack)</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:27 PM</strong><br />
well and also like. A. It&#8217;s a wild thing to happen and B. Even if it was real what could you, Gerald&#8217;s coworker and a person who is not personally a warlock, do about it<br />
You have to go to meetings and send emails and write memos and stuff, and you are not a ghostbuster or a wizard and probably can&#8217;t help him anyway? even if it was real? which it can&#8217;t be because, you know, that is not a real thing that happens?<br />
In many ways believing him would be&#8230; worse, for everyone involved except maybe Gerald</p>

<p><strong>amanda at 3:29 PM</strong><br />
have you talked to anyone at slack about the book? do you know what people who work on slack think?</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:30 PM</strong><br />
Doubleday and Slack just did a giveaway thing together!</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:30 PM</strong><br />
oh nice!</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:30 PM</strong><br />
I have been contacted by folks there informally<br />
And I have heard secondhand that people were excited for the book before it came out<br />
And I have to assume the giveaway means at least some folks there didn&#8217;t hate it, lol<br />
though if the book made you afraid of Slackbot maybe their opinion will change</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:31 PM</strong><br />
i mean i think the book isn&#8217;t really like &#8220;slack is bad&#8221; it&#8217;s like &#8220;maybe Capitalism and Not Having Work Life Balance is bad&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:31 PM</strong><br />
capitalism is bad and bodies are prisons, but the only thing worse than having one is not having one</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:31 PM</strong><br />
slack is no more responsible for bad working conditions than like, gmail i guess?<br />
bad managers are responsible for bad working conditions<br />
idk!</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:32 PM</strong><br />
yeah no this is definitely not an indictment of Slack specifically, it was a very fun platform to write in</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:32 PM</strong><br />
but slack is so much more interesting than gmail because in slack people type like this and in gmail people type with proper punctuation and no emojis</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:33 PM</strong><br />
right yeah, working conditions are determined by what bosses demand and what workers will put up with<br />
and the circumstances that influence both of those factors (the economy, the labor market specifically, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:35 PM</strong><br />
another thing is like<br />
now it&#8217;s like, the GMA book of the month?<br />
or last month I mean<br />
so i&#8217;m curious how that went<br />
like i think it&#8217;s super cool because it&#8217;s a really good, funny, thought-provoking book but also. it&#8217;s weird!<br />
or maybe the viewership of GMA is weirder than we give them credit for</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:38 PM</strong><br />
September, yeah!<br />
No one was more surprised than me!!</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:39 PM</strong><br />
or i guess, it is weird, but also, it&#8217;s sometimes close to life in a way that&#8217;s maybe relatable to people?</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:40 PM</strong><br />
I hope it doesn&#8217;t come off as false modesty because I am proud of this book<br />
And I am genuinely very surprised by the response it&#8217;s gotten and that it has mainstream traction as a GMA book club pick and a review in the New Yorker</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:41 PM</strong><br />
no i think it&#8217;s valid to be surprised because yeah i think it&#8217;s a really good book but also i wouldn&#8217;t peg it as being accessible to the mainstream in the same way as a book like&#8230;. idk sally rooney</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:41 PM</strong><br />
I think people are weirder than we give them credit for, and I also think people are very used to readings texts and chats and group DMs</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:41 PM</strong><br />
i like the idea that people are weirder than we give them credit for</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:42 PM</strong><br />
which maybe provides a bit more leeway for things to get weird but for readers to feel like they&#8217;re along for the ride</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:42 PM</strong><br />
yeah, like i think if the story was written in traditional prose, it wouldn&#8217;t be as exciting or funny</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:42 PM</strong><br />
I tried to design the book in a way where readers were learning how to read it as they go along<br />
You have to establish the rules before you can get weird<br />
And because so much of our lives are already online, even folks who don&#8217;t use Slack can clock what&#8217;s going on</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:45 PM</strong><br />
i think what i love about the book is that it makes you think really critically about work/life balance, role of tech in your own life, etc. while also being like. hey what if slackbot ate a meatball sub.<br />
has writing the book changed how you interact with slack/the internet/work at all?</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:46 PM</strong><br />
lol I am VERY not active on Slack at my current workplace<br />
In part because I get more work done without notifications beeping and in part because I don&#8217;t want people to feel like I am Harvesting Their Conversations For Content</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:47 PM</strong><br />
that is an extremely specific problem to have<br />
although recently when a former boss/now friend told me she was pregnant she was like &#8220;don&#8217;t tweet this&#8221; bc she hadn&#8217;t announced it publicly at the time, which feels similar</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:47 PM</strong><br />
yeah it&#8217;s a more acute version of something that comes up a fair amount anyway<br />
re: &#8220;don&#8217;t tweet this&#8221; or someone posting a picture you&#8217;re in the background of or a screenshot of a funny text exchange or something<br />
we tend to develop these habits before we develop an ethics around them<br />
or at least a conventional ethics, like for example, asking permission from your interlocutor before you post a picture of a funny text exchange</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:50 PM</strong><br />
have you thought about the facebook metaverse thing where they wanna use VR to have us<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/facebook-finally-made-a-good-virtual-reality-app/"> go to work meetings</a>?</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:52 PM</strong><br />
I have! I don&#8217;t think people want VR in that way, honestly<br />
We keep reverting back to different ways to type at each other if we can&#8217;t be in person</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:53 PM</strong><br />
i wonder if there&#8217;s a line in how much we want tech to be in our lives and where that line is</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:53 PM</strong><br />
if we&#8217;re not gonna be bodies in space together, let&#8217;s not meet in a virtual office. at least not if we can&#8217;t do it in like, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-is-a-tense-and-fluid-return-to-form-for-nintendos-enduring-series/">Samus&#8217;s Zero Suit</a></p>
<p>Okay, back to properly punctuated, complete sentences, written without a timestamp (it&#8217;s 11:55 AM on Monday, October 18, in case you were wondering). If you were able to follow that conversation, you can probably follow &#8220;Several People Are Typing.&#8221; Even the audiobook feels like a natural read, featuring an ensemble cast to play each individual Slack chatter. While the book is critical of the way we work today, it&#8217;s not that exaggerated. Sure, the idea of several corporate professionals working together to figure out how to spin the PR nightmare of a dog food brand accidentally poisoning Pomeranians is pretty ridiculous, but we know that&#8217;s probably happening IRL. That&#8217;s why now, we glean <a href="https://twitter.com/steak_umm/status/1449015873960873986">thoughtful insights about the social media attention economy</a> from the official account of Steak-umms.</p>

<p>As far as the gimmick goes &#8212; should every book be written in text-speak like it&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ttyl">an AIM-based, young adult novel from 2004</a>? That might be a stretch. But absurdism is most effective when it feels like it might just be real, which is why this particular story works &#8212; the supernatural scenarios might feel unfamiliar, but no form of communication feels more sublimely ordinary than a Slack message.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> wants to foster usage in the U.S. with better free accounts. Like in other markets, Revolut offers both free and paid accounts in the U.S. When you pay for a subscription fee, you get higher fair usage caps and more features, such as insurance coverage and different card designs.</p>
<p>With today’s change, Revolut is making the free plan more attractive. When you open a Revolut account, you get your own account details and a free Revolut card. You can then send and receive money, spend with your card and access a wide range of financial products.</p>
<p>The company is upping the limit on free ATM withdrawals. Before today, you could withdraw up to $300 per month without fees on Revolut’s side. After that, Revolut used to charge 2% in fees. Free Revolut users can now withdraw up to $1,200 per month without fees.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218757" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Revolut is also becoming more attractive if you want to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/revolut-partners-with-paxos-to-bring-cryptocurrency-trading-to-the-us/">partnered with Paxos</a> for cryptocurrency trading in the U.S. Before today, users would pay 2.5% in conversion fees after exchanging $200.</p>
<p>Now, users can trade up to $200,000 per month without paying any commission. But there’s some spread — you don’t get the same exchange rate when you buy and when you sell cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>One of Revolut’s key feature is the ability to exchange currencies in the app. You can create different sub-accounts and hold money in several currencies. Revolut promises low <a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-US/legal/standard-fees">exchange fees</a> with a 0.5% markup fee once you go above the $1,000 fair usage limit for free Revolut accounts.</p>
<p>Additionally, Revolut charges a flat fee to send money to a foreign bank account. That fee encourages your friends and family to use Revolut as well as you don’t pay it for Revolut-to-Revolut transfers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But sometimes you have to send money to a foreign bank account. Premium users didn’t have to pay that flat fee for their first international transfer each month. Now, Revolut is waiving the flat fee on international transfers for up to 10 international transfers per month.</p>
<p>Finally, free Revolut users in the U.S. can create up to five <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/revolut-launches-revolut-junior-to-help-you-manage-allowance/">Junior account</a>. Those accounts targeted toward kids aged 7-17 feature an integration with the main Revolut app on the parent’s side. It makes it easier to manage allowance and give some flexibility to your children.</p>
<p>With today’s move, Revolut is adapting its product depending on market conditions. The company is competing with other fintech companies in the U.S., such as <a href="https://www.chime.com">Chime</a> or <a href="https://robinhood.com">Robinhood</a>. That’s why it’s important to attract all sorts of users, including users who don’t want to pay a subscription fee to use basic banking features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not content with setting your feet a-tapping with its intuitive music sequencer aimed at amateur music makers, Artiphon today <a href="http://artiphon.com/downloads">announced an app</a> that adds video-making prowess to the Orba&#8217;s already impressive feature set. Appealing to your inner Video Jockey, <a href="https://vimeo.com/612035970/a659bd7305">the Orbacam demo video</a> makes it look easy, adding video filters and effects to your visual creative pursuits.</p>
<p>The idea of the Orbacam is to create quick and easy videos that Artiphon refers to as &#8220;Musical Selfies.&#8221; The results of the videos are fun, colorful, highly shareable music videos that sync automatically to whatever else you&#8217;re playing on the Orba. The app turns the already social media-magnet of a musical instrument into the perfect companion for Instagram Stories, TikTok or Snap creative pursuits.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217154" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217154" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2217154" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/6.-Orbacam-UI.gif" alt="Orbicam in Action" width="480" height="480" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217154" class="wp-caption-text">Orbicam in action. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Artiphon</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217129" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that music is always a multisensory experience, and we designed Orbacam as an auditory, visual and tactile experience that anyone can play immediately,” says Artiphon&#8217;s CEO and founder Mike Butera. “We’ve seen the power of synchronizing music with social content, but almost all of that is just pasting someone else’s song on your video. Now people can create musical videos that are entirely their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Orbacam, the company made it easy to make music &#8212; what is new, is the ability to weave visual effects into the video export, without needing to do additional music mixing, audio routing or post-production. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app also enables you to use the microphone connected to your phone &#8212; or the one built into your phone &#8212; to sing or beat-box your way on top of the music you&#8217;re creating. It also gives users the option to import videos and photos from the phone&#8217;s camera roll. </span></p>
<p>For armchair musicians, the Orba takes some of the scary parts out of creating music. Part synthesizer, part looper, part MIDI controller, the palm-sized digital grapefruit already made it easy and intuitive to create music. Most impressively, Orba wasn&#8217;t even the company&#8217;s first shot at creating weird and wonderful music-making tools. In 2015, the company pre-sold $1.3 million worth of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/07/the-crowdfunded-artiphon-instrument-1-mixes-high-and-low-musical-tech/">the INSTRUMENT 1 musical instrument</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ever the sucker for creative hardware products making their way to market, we&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on Artiphon. The Orba originally saw the light of day following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/artiphon-orba/">a $1.4 million Kickstarter campaign</a>, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/artiphon-seed-funding/">a cash injection from, among others, Warner Music</a>. We thought it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/this-99-gadget-helps-you-make-music-no-skill-required/">fun to play with when it launched</a> last year. We&#8217;re delighted to see the company add a companion app with more features, stretching its usefulness beyond the slightly gimmicky, if relatively affordable, offering.</p>
<p>If you already have an Orba, the free app is <a href="http://artiphon.com/downloads">available from Artiphon</a> today. If you don&#8217;t, you can <a href="https://artiphon.com/pages/orba-by-artiphon">pick up the Orba for $100</a> from a number of retailers, or direct from Artiphon.</p>
