										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.majority.com/en/">MAJORITY</a>, a mobile banking service for migrants to the United States, said on Tuesday it had raised $27 million in its Series A funding round led by <a href="https://valar.com/">Valar Ventures</a>. Other existing investors, including <a href="https://www.avidventures.com/">Avid Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.heartcore.com/">Heartcore Capital</a>, and a group of Nordic fintech founders, also participated in the raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round comes just six months after MAJORITY </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/majority-raises-19-million-for-its-mobile-banking-service-for-migrants/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $16 million in seed funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which TechCrunch previously reported, bringing MAJORITY’s total funding to $46 million to date. Since the seed round, the company has been building out its advisor program, particularly in Florida, and developing its “know your customer” (KYC) process and remittance offering so it can onboard “larger Hispanic communities within the US,” founder and CEO Magnus Larsson told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is composed of about 45 tech and product employees based in Stockholm, Sweden, 20-plus internal employees in the U.S., Larsson said. He added that the company employs “hundreds” of local advisers who onboard and support members of different migrant communities by working with them in their native languages.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243699" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larsson himself is a Swedish migrant to the U.S. who served as CEO of one of Sweden’s largest telecom companies before launching a previous venture to provide low-cost cross-border calling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is currently awaiting visa approval so he can move from Stockholm to Miami to build out MAJORITY’s marketing and brand efforts. The company is also looking to scale its risk team and back-office functions, which it runs out of its Houston location.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243707" style="width: 1160px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243707" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2243707 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg" alt="MAJORITY's meetup location in Miami, Florida." width="1150" height="774" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg 3854w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=768,517 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=680,458 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=1536,1033 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=2048,1378 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1150px) 100vw, 1150px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243707" class="wp-caption-text"><em>MAJORITY&#8217;s meetup location in Miami, Florida. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> MAJORITY</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larsson founded MAJORITY in 2019 to serve the million-plus migrants who move to the US every year through its mobile app. The app, which costs $5 per month, provides a range of features including an FDIC-insured bank account with no overdraft fees, a debit card with community discounts, no-fee remittances, and at-cost international calling. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it has saved its Cuban members an average of $21 per month and its Nigerian members an average of $10 per member each month beyond its membership fee because of its cost-efficient service offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the app’s core banking services are available in all 50 U.S. states, its advisers are only on the ground in Texas and Florida today. These states are hubs for some of the main communities the app already serves, Larsson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you look at different communities that we serve, they usually have a focal point. There is a town for Cubans – it&#8217;s Miami. For Ethiopians, it’s Washington, DC. For Somalians, it&#8217;s Minneapolis,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAJORITY provides customized services to about seven different specific migrant communities by providing them with culturally specific features, such as discounts at local businesses. Larsson hopes to bring MAJORITY’s full product suite to another five or six communities in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243711" style="width: 1152px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243711" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2243711 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SendMoney-1.png" alt="" width="1142" height="622" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SendMoney-1.png 5878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SendMoney-1.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SendMoney-1.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SendMoney-1.png?resize=768,418 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SendMoney-1.png?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SendMoney-1.png?resize=1536,836 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SendMoney-1.png?resize=2048,1115 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SendMoney-1.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1142px) 100vw, 1142px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243711" class="wp-caption-text"><em>MAJORITY&#8217;s mobile app. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> MAJORITY</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnerships with local stores have proven to be an effective way for MAJORITY to grow its subscriber base, which it says has increased tenfold in the past year, though the company declined to share the number of users on its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can come to meet an advisor outside of the grocery store, and five minutes later, you can walk away from there, with the bank [information] in your hand, and a Visa debit card in your hand, and you can usually add money and send it to another country directly in the store,” Larsson said.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company was founded in January 2020 to make engaging with paying customers and thus building creator businesses as effortless as possible.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Having a thriving community is the backbone for creators, but when the global pandemic hit, brands also found that they needed similar engagement with customers that were now interacting with their products online.</p>
<p><a href="http://circle.so/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circle</a> is working to make those engagements effortless by building a community platform so that creators and brands can bring their discussions, members and content together in one place, kind of like a “Shopify for creator and brand-led communities,” Sid Yadav, co-founder and CEO told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company was founded in January 2020 to make engaging with paying customers and thus building creator businesses as effortless as possible. We profiled the NYC-based startup last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/circle-community-tools-for-creators/">when it announced its $1.5 million seed round </a>in August 2020, and then again in February 2021 when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/the-creator-movement-is-entering-primetime-and-so-is-circle-with-a-fresh-4m/">raised another $4 million</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243626" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2243644" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243644" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2243644" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed.jpg?w=680" alt="Circle" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed.jpg 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243644" class="wp-caption-text">Circle&#8217;s co-founders, from left, Sid Yadav, Rudy Santino and Andrew Guttormsen. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Circle</p></div></p>
<p>Circle now has over 4,000 paying communities, paying subscriptions averaging $40 to $400 per month, that in total have 2 million members, Yadav said.</p>
<p>Investors continue to see the value and injected $24.7 million in Series A funding, Circle announced today. The round was led by Tiger Global, with participation from Box Group, Notation Capital and a group of individual investors including, Brendon Burchard, Adobe’s Scott Belsky, Codecademy CEO Zach Sims, Front CEO Mathilde Collin, Teachable CEO Ankur Nagpal and Menlo Security’s David Eckstein.</p>
<p>In addition to the investment, Burchard joins as an advisor to the company. Circle powers his GrowthDay community for over 300,000 members, Yadav said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The latest investment gives Circle $200 million in post-money valuation. This is a jump from a $40 million valuation from the February seed round. Over the last few months, Yadav said the company got signals that product market fit was there, which put levers in motion for Circle to move faster as the community space began getting competitive.</p>
<p>“For us, this is nice to have,” he added. “We want to make sure we earn the valuation and believe that we can return it for investors. One of the goals was to see how best to utilize the money to leapfrog the competition.”</p>
<p>Yadav wasn’t intending to raise additional capital so soon after its last round; in fact, the company thought it would be able to ride it out for a couple of years and go after capital again in early 2022.</p>
<p>However, after reaching 25% in month over month revenue growth in September and receiving inbound interest, especially from Tiger Global, the company thought it would be best to raise sooner and get the right valuation.</p>
<p>The attention from Tiger “was very flattering,” Yadav said. He was interested in their founder-first approach in investing and that the firm was going to connect Circle with its network of management consulting and recruiting.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The creator movement is entering prime time, and so is Circle with a fresh $4M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/the-creator-movement-is-entering-primetime-and-so-is-circle-with-a-fresh-4m/embed/#?secret=JDjOP5kmo3" data-secret="JDjOP5kmo3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Along with that recent growth, Circle just crossed over $4 million in annual recurring revenue, up from $1 million a year ago. It also now has 40 employees, growing from 15 at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>It also launched several new features in 2021, including discussions, livestreaming, events capabilities and payments — features customers had been requesting.</p>
<p>“We were able to speak to a big chunk of early customers about what they were needing from the community platform,” Yadav said. “Some of our competitors were around for a long time, but what no one was getting right is an all-in-one approach combining chat, social media and community.”</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to further invest in R&amp;D, technology development, building both Android and desktop apps, investing in sales and customer success teams and creating a marketing team. Circle recently brought on a head of sales, so the company will be focused on ramping up that area as demand from brands and businesses comes in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Salespeople are always looking for an edge when it comes to contacting potential customers. Knowing someone who knows someone at your target customer and can make an introduction means that it&#8217;s much more likely the contact will pay attention.</p>
<p>A former Salesforce executive wants to make it easier to find those connections, and he&#8217;s building <a href="https://www.ctd.ai/">Connect the Dots</a>, a startup that aims to build a personalized, professional relationship graph.</p>
<p>The way it works is you sign up and it scans any email accounts you have, looking for connections at different companies. It collects and correlates this data. When you look at a particular company, you can see who you know who knows someone there, with the strength of your connection measured by three colored dots. If they&#8217;re all green, it&#8217;s a solid connection and you can request an email introduction.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Drew Sechrist, who was employee 36 at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/salesforce-at-20-offers-lessons-for-startup-success/">Salesforce in 1999</a>, was on Marc Benioff&#8217;s early sales team, pushing the company when nobody knew who they were or what hosted software was, for that matter. He recognized early on that having connections helped drive sales. He called Benioff the &#8220;number one alpha networker.&#8221; He could go to him at any time in those early days and get an intro, helping to grease the skids for his pitch, giving him a much better shot at a sale than going in cold.</p>
<p>He believes that email is the key connector. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got these emails that have been piling up forever representing relationships. And we just didn&#8217;t have any way to pull [them together] and get value out of them. But technology was getting to the point with machine learning and some other advanced techniques [that] we could extract value from that data and then build a graph of relationships to see who actually knows who,&#8221; Sechrist explained.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that LinkedIn was designed to do the same thing, but that it is too noisy and therefore unreliable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asking for introductions on LinkedIn, salespeople and people who are recruiting or doing anything asking for a relationship introductions, they just get fatigued by asking people who don&#8217;t really know the person that they&#8217;re asking for the introduction,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sechrist wanted to build a better way to do that. Today, Connect the Dots has a social graph in beta by request, or, if you know someone using it, you can also get on, using the Clubhouse approach to user-base building.</p>
<p>The company used a $5 million seed round to build the product and recently closed a $15 million round led by Norwest Venture Partners, with participation from existing investors Cloud Apps Capital Partners and Velvet Sea Ventures. Connect the Dots has now raised a total of $20 million.</p>
<p>The company currently has 55 employees with a home base in San Francisco, though employees are spread out, with a big engineering team in Serbia. Sechrist is living in Miami at the moment. He plans to double the team in the next year with the new capital.</p>
<p>Coming from Salesforce, he recently had his team write their V2MOM, a document idea from his former company that, <a href="https://visible.vc/blog/v2mom-salesforce/">according to Salesforce,</a> is &#8220;a management process and acronym standing for vision, values, mission, objectives and measures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually just finished our V2MOM. We flew people from Europe and the U.S. to Mexico last week. &#8230; We spent a week [defining] our core values, and one of those is being inclusive. So we want to build a company and a product that is inclusive for everybody,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He admits that it&#8217;s challenging to be racially diverse, especially with a large part of the workforce in Serbia, but it is something he&#8217;s working on as the company doubles its head count in the coming year. He plans to keep the company mostly remote, and that should help because he can recruit people from anywhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/crossbeam-lands-76m-series-c-as-network-effect-fuels-partner-cloud-growth/">Much like Crossbeam</a>, a networking company for partnerships, Sechrist hopes that as the networks grow into networks of networks, it will have a flywheel effect, making the product more valuable as more people use it. He hopes to have the product generally available sometime in the first half of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Under a new CEO, Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/nickcald/status/1468221427354517504?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made an acquisition</a> that speaks to what it might be looking at developing down the line to diversify away further from ad-based, open-ended, consumer chatter. It has acquired <a href="http://quill.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quill</a>, a business-focused messaging service meant to compete against the likes of Slack and keep people, well, more focused.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed. Quill had raised <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/339831-55/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around $16 million</a> from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/slack-investor-index-ventures-backs-slack-competitor-quill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backers</a> that included Sam Altman and Index Ventures and it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/the-new-new-slack-quill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came out of stealth</a> in February of this year. One of its biggest selling points &#8212; apart from being bold enough to speak out about the shortcomings of Slack and to try to build something to compete against its juggernaut-like momentum of growth that has been boosted by it getting acquired by Salesforce &#8212; was that it was founded by Ludwig Pettersson, the former creative director of Stripe, who is much admired by many in the startup community.</p>
<p>Quill is not making the cut in the acquisition: it will be winding down as an app, a spokesperson from Twitter said. But the team has: it will be joining Twitter&#8217;s Experience org to work on messaging tools, specifically Twitter direct messages.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244005" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>DMs have long been a source of interest for Twitter observers, and many have wondered when and if Twitter would ever seek to develop them into a more standalone product, and possible business line, especially given the huge boom we&#8217;ve seen in messaging apps in recent years, and the moves so many other open-ended social media platforms have made to boost their own direct messaging businesses.</p>
<p>Now, with Twitter making more moves to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diversify its business</a> lines, maybe this will be an opportunity to do this?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something of a bittersweet ending for Quill: the company, as I said above, was bold both to make the assertion that business people need collaboration and communication, but not at the cost of distraction, and then to try to make the leap to build and scale a completely new product to address that. But scaling a new entrant in that space would have been tough even without the aggressive presence of a lot of other deep-pocketed, platform-squatting players in the space. Quill assembled a talented and ambitious team, so it will be worth watching what their IP, and that grouping of people, get applied to next.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve asked if Pettersson is joining the flock, too, and will update this post with that and anything else we learn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Wednesday, Instagram head Adam Mosseri is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-will-testify-before-the-senate-on-teen-mental-heath/">set to testify before the Senate</a> for the first time on the issue of how the app is impacting teens&#8217; mental health, following the recent testimonies from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen</a> which have positioned the company as caring more about profits than user safety. Just ahead of that hearing, Instagram has announced a new set of safety features, including its first set of parental controls.</p>
<p>The changes were introduced through a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/new-teen-safety-tools-on-instagram/">company blog post</a>, authored by Mosseri.</p>
<p>Not all the features are brand-new and some are smaller expansions on earlier safety features the company already had in the works.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243992" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>However, the bigger news today is Instagram&#8217;s plan to launch its first set of parental control features in March. These features will allow parents and guardians to see how much time teens spend on Instagram and will allow them to set screen time limits. Teens will also be given an option to alert parents if they report someone. These tools are an opt-in experience &#8212; teens can choose not to send alerts, and there&#8217;s no requirement that teens and parents have to use parental controls.</p>
<p>The parental controls, as described, are also less powerful than those <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16/">on rival TikTok,</a> where parents can lock children&#8217;s accounts into restricted experience, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/tiktok-expands-parental-controls-to-include-search-commenting-and-account-privacy/">block access to search,</a> as well as control their child&#8217;s visibility on the platform, and who can view their content, comment or message them. Screen time limits, meanwhile, are already offered by the platforms themselves &#8212; that is, Apple&#8217;s iOS and Google&#8217;s Android mobile operating systems offer similar controls. In other words, Instagram isn&#8217;t doing much here in terms of innovative parental controls, but notes it will &#8220;add more options over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another new feature was previously announced. Instagram earlier this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/">launched a test of its new &#8220;Take a Break&#8221; feature</a> which allows users to remind themselves to take a break from using the app after either 10, 20, or 30 minutes, depending on their preference. This feature will now officially launch in the U.S., U.K., Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244009" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244009" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2244009" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/02_Take-A-Break-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/02_Take-A-Break-1.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/02_Take-A-Break-1.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/02_Take-A-Break-1.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/02_Take-A-Break-1.jpg?resize=768,508 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/02_Take-A-Break-1.jpg?resize=680,450 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/02_Take-A-Break-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244009" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike on rival TikTok, where videos that push users to get off the app appear in the main feed after a certain amount of time, Instagram&#8217;s &#8220;Take a Break&#8221; feature is opt-in only. The company will begin to suggest to users that they set these reminders, but it will not require they do so. That gives Instagram the appearance of doing something to combat app addiction, without going so far as to actually make &#8220;Take a Break&#8221; enabled by default for its users, or like TikTok, regularly remind users to get off the app.</p>
<p>Another feature is an expansion of earlier efforts around distancing teens from having contact with adults. Already, Instagram<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/"> began to default teens&#8217; accounts to private,</a> restrict target advertising and unwanted adult contact &#8212; the latter by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">using technology</a> to identify &#8220;potentially suspicious behavior&#8221; from adult users, then preventing them from being able to interact with teens&#8217; accounts. It has also restricted other adult users from being able to contact teens who didn&#8217;t already follow them, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/instagram-adds-new-teen-safety-tools-as-competition-with-tiktok-heats-up/">sends the teen notifications</a> if the adult is engaging in suspicious behavior while giving them tools for blocking and reporting.</p>
<p>Now it will expand this set of features to also switch off the ability for adults to tag or mention teens who don&#8217;t follow them, and to include their content in Reels Remixes (video content), or Guides. These will be the new default settings, and will roll out next year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244013" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244013" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2244013" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/04_Reels-Remix-Teen-Default.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244013" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Instagram says it will also be stricter about what&#8217;s recommended to teens in sections of the app like Search, Explore, Hashtags, and Suggested Accounts.</p>
<p>But in describing the action it&#8217;s taking, the company seems to have not yet made a hard decision on what will be changed. Instead, Instagram says it&#8217;s &#8220;exploring&#8221; the idea of limiting content in Explore, using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/instagram-sensitive-content-controls-explore/">a newer set of sensitive content control features launched in July</a>. The company says it&#8217;s considering expanding the &#8220;Limit Even More&#8221; &#8212; the strictest setting &#8212; to include not just Explore, but also Search, Hashtags, Reels and Suggested Accounts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244012" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244012" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2244012" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05_Sensitive-Content-Control.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="617" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05_Sensitive-Content-Control.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05_Sensitive-Content-Control.jpg?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05_Sensitive-Content-Control.jpg?resize=300,272 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05_Sensitive-Content-Control.jpg?resize=768,696 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05_Sensitive-Content-Control.jpg?resize=680,617 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05_Sensitive-Content-Control.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244012" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>It also says if it sees people are dwelling on a topic for a while it may nudge them to other topics, but doesn&#8217;t share details on this feature, as it&#8217;s under development. Presumably, this is meant to address <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">the issues raised</a> about teens who are exploring potentially harmful content, like those that could trigger eating disorders, anxiety, or depression. In practice, the feature could also be used to direct users to more profitable content for the app &#8212; like posts from influencers who drive traffic to monetizable products, like Instagram Shopping, LIVE videos, Reels, and others.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2244011" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06_Topic-Nudge.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="617" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06_Topic-Nudge.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06_Topic-Nudge.jpg?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06_Topic-Nudge.jpg?resize=300,272 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06_Topic-Nudge.jpg?resize=768,696 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06_Topic-Nudge.jpg?resize=680,617 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06_Topic-Nudge.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Instagram will also roll out tools this January that allows users to bulk delete photos and videos from their account to clean up their digital footprint. The feature will be offered as part of a new hub where users can view and manage their activity on the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244008" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244008" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2244008" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03_Your-Activity.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03_Your-Activity.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03_Your-Activity.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03_Your-Activity.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03_Your-Activity.jpg?resize=768,508 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03_Your-Activity.jpg?resize=680,450 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03_Your-Activity.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244008" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>This addition is being positioned as a safety feature, as older users may be able to better understand what it means to share personal content online; and they may have regrets over their older posts. However, a bulk deletion option is really the sort of feature that any content management system (that&#8217;s behaving ethically) should offer its users &#8212; meaning not just Instagram, but also Facebook, Twitter and other social networks.</p>
<p>The company said these are only some of the features it has in development and noted it&#8217;s still working on its new solution to verify people&#8217;s ages on Instagram using technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As always, I’m grateful to the experts and researchers who lend us their expertise in critical areas like child development, teen mental health and online safety,&#8221; Mosseri wrote, &#8220;and I continue to welcome productive collaboration with lawmakers and policymakers on our shared goal of creating an online world that both benefits and protects many generations to come,&#8221; he added. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://agentsync.io/">AgentSync</a> this morning announced that it has closed a $75 million Series B, pushing its valuation to $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The new unicorn has been on a rapid-fire fundraising clip since TechCrunch first spoke to the company just over a year ago, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/agentsync-raises-4-4m-for-its-insurtech-compliance-service/">raised a $4.4 million seed round</a> in August 2020. The company stayed busy, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/">raising another $6.7 million that same December</a>.</p>
<p>But the work of bringing modern, digital infrastructure to the U.S. insurance world kept proving to be a growth business. So, AgentSync raised a $25 million Series A in March of this year, increasing its valuation to $220 million. That went up by around 6x in the ensuing few quarters.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243974" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Obviously, AgentSync is a startup on the move, so TechCrunch got co-founder and <a href="https://twitter.com/nijisabharwal">CEO Niji Sabharwal</a> back on the phone to chat through why his company wanted even more capital.</p>
<h2>Why AgentSync raised again</h2>
<p>Most often when you ask a startup that raised a few times in a year why they added more capital to their accounts, the answer boils down to something along the lines of <em>well, we could</em>. While this rather human answer is understandable, it&#8217;s also not very illustrative.</p>
<p>AgentSync was a bit clearer. After getting the company through its 2022 planning process, Sabharwal said it wanted to invest more in its products, which would reduce its runway from five years to two. Hence, AgentSync decided to take on more capital to add staff.</p>
<p>Per the CEO, AgentSync still had around $28 million in the bank when it raised again. By TechCrunch arithmetic, the company closed out its Series B with around $100 million in cash, though that figure may have dipped under the nine-figure threshold since.</p>
<p>What does investment look like for the company? According to Sabharwal, AgentSync is going to double its sales org in the next year, quadruple its marketing team, and double its product and engineering efforts. That&#8217;s a lot of folks, and having more cash will make such a hiring ramp simpler.</p>
<p>And, let&#8217;s be clear, like other startups out there that raise two or three rounds inside a single year, AgentSync simply <em>could</em> access more capital while multiplying its worth. It&#8217;s hard to say no to that. Underscoring just how hot the market is today for quickly expanding startups, AgentSync raised its new round not off a deck, but a detailed investor update, and got its first term sheet within two days of opening the round, though it didn&#8217;t select that investor, its CEO said.</p>
<p>Valor Equity Partners led the Series B, which included capital from the ubiquitous Tiger Global. Craft Ventures, Atreides Management and Anthemis also chipped in capital to the round.</p>
<h2>What about that valuation, though</h2>
<p>Seeing a new unicorn is akin to waking up in today&#8217;s market. Get out of bed, read Twitter, see new unicorn. You get the idea.</p>
<p>But with AgentSync, we have lots more data than we tend to get from startups busy raising capital, so let&#8217;s chat through some data points.</p>
<p>The following are cribbed from our reporting and a particular piece from Forbes. Citations included, and ARR stands for <em>annual recurring revenue</em>. Note that we have done some extrapolation from various pieces of shared information where reasonable:</p>
<ul>
<li>August 2020: $1.9 million ARR [<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/agentsync-raises-4-4m-for-its-insurtech-compliance-service/">Source</a>]</li>
<li>December 2020: ~$3 million to $4 million ARR, 4x growth since March 2020 [<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/">TechCrunch estimate based on shared metrics</a>]</li>
<li>March 2021: &lt;$10 million ARR, 6x growth in 2020 [<a href="https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/midastouch/#45c2bb1c7c09">Source</a>]</li>
<li>December 2021: ~$10.5 million to $14 million ARR, 3.5x growth year over year [TechCrunch estimate based on prior numbers, shared growth rate]</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of that is messy and approximate, but it gives us an idea of what the company is managing in growth terms. I wonder if our final numbers are actually a bit low, given that with a $1.2 billion valuation, AgentSync would be worth something around a 100x ARR multiple. Which is pretty hot, even for today&#8217;s markets, though certainly not impossible.</p>
<p>Regardless, AgentSync has a few key indicators that investors view as lowering its risk profile. Zero customer churn, for example, which for a company of AgentSync&#8217;s age is impressive. And the unicorn reported 169% net dollar retention, indicating that once it lands a customer, it quickly sells more to that client. This lowers the company&#8217;s costs of acquiring customers compared to their long-term worth, making it more efficient.</p>
<p>And the company is building new products. We&#8217;re best acquainted with AgentSync&#8217;s original business of passing broker license data between parties. But the startup has moved into providing recruiting data regarding brokers themselves for carriers, for example. Per Sabharwal, AgentSync has launched three new products in the last year.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what the company can do with even more capital. Given that AgentSync as a private company is now worth about what neoinsurance providers Root and MetroMile are valued at together on the public markets, investors are certainly betting that insurtech infra bears out to be a better bet than selling coverage itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.grip.security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grip Security</a>, a Tel Aviv-based startup that helps enterprises protect their data in SaaS applications, today announced that it has raised a $25 million Series A funding round led by <a href="https://www.intelcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel Capital</a>. <a href="https://www.ylventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YL Ventures</a>, which led the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/grip-security-raises-6m-to-improve-saas-security/">$6 million seed round</a> earlier this year, also participated in this round.</p>
<p>As Grip CEO and co-founder Lior Yaari told me, while Grip may still be a young company &#8212; and selling into the enterprise tends to be a slow process &#8212; the team was still able to show investors significant growth, especially for a company that was only officially founded in February. He noted, for example, that the number of users that the product covers grew tenfold every quarter. Over the course of the last nine months, Grip also signed up a wide range of customers that includes Fortune 500 enterprises and small startups.</p>
<p>Traditionally, these companies would use a cloud access security broker (CASB) that act as intermediaries between the employee and the service they use. Ideally, this helps a business&#8217;s IT team to know exactly who has access to these tools and how they use these services. But in reality, employees often route around these tools, making data governance hard or even impossible.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243761" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I remember the old days, in our pitch, we explained the problem space and how SaaS is growing &#8212; and it shifted to a point where we only ask: how do you solve it today? Everyone I meet has an answer,&#8221; Yaari said. &#8220;It makes the discussion much easier, because if the answer is, &#8216;I manage an Excel spreadsheet &#8212; and an Excel sheet, the moment something is written, it&#8217;s outdated. Seconds later, someone signed up for a new application and the document is outdated. So either they do that or use legacy technologies to do so, but they are full of false positives, very hard to work with and not actionable enough. And then we show them our dashboard and the discussion goes forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grip promises that within 15 minutes of installing the service, without any agents or proxies, the service can provide businesses with a full SaaS inventory. And while that alone is already extremely useful for its users, the team learned quite a bit from working with its early customers, Yaari said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we interacted with customers and as we saw the problems that they&#8217;re seeing and the challenges that they are facing &#8212; not from the side, but as a partner that helps them solve them &#8212; we expanded our vision into the daily struggles of security teams,&#8221; he explained. Specifically, this means helping businesses with more of the day-to-day access management issues they have when, for example, an employee leaves the company. &#8220;As we look at the next step, we want to build an enforceable, comprehensive access management solution,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A user of a SaaS application today can theoretically go back home, open his private laptop and access the application itself. For years, we&#8217;ve based SaaS security solutions on the network security paradigm, placing a proxy on the organization&#8217;s networks. But when someone goes back home, it doesn&#8217;t cover them again malicious actors that access applications if they stole a password from one of the employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because Grip knows of every application in use by a given company, it believes that it can also now help these companies enforce access based on company policy. The current plan is for Grip to launch this new solution in the coming months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Grip has identified what SaaS security teams were lacking and has provided them with a viable, accessible and impactful solution,” said Sunil Kurkure, managing director at Intel Capital. “With existing products taking months to deploy and interfering with innovation and scale, Grip’s quick and easy deployment process has the potential to change the way SaaS security interacts with business workflows.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MoEngage, a San Francisco and Bangalore-based startup that helps firms understand their customers and improve app engagement, has raised $30 million just four months after closing its previous funding round.</p>
<p>Steadview Capital led the seven-year-old SaaS startup’s Series D round, they said on Tuesday. Existing investors also participated in the round, which takes MoEngage’s all-time raise to about $100 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moengage.com">MoEngage</a> enables its customers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/moengage-lands-25m-for-its-mobile-first-customer-engagement-platform/">gain deeper insights</a> into the way they are engaging with the apps and websites. These insights include customer’s preferences, the way they navigate the app, and the offerings of the app that are attracting users&#8217; attention &#8212; and those that are struggling to do so.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243971" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Marketers use MoEngage to automatically segment their customers by affinities and lifestyle and inform their communication campaigns accordingly.</p>
<p>“We are an enabler of digitization for our customer’s brands. We help them better retain customers and drive more engagement and value,” said Raviteja Dodda, co-founder and chief executive of MoEngage, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>MoEngage, recognized by both Gartner and G2 in recent years, has amassed over 1,000 customers globally, he said. Some of its clients include Flipkart’s Shopsy, Byju’s, Atom Finance, PolicyBazaar, CIMB Bank, Landmark Group, and Domino’s Pizza.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2243975 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/moengage-dashboard.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="564" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/moengage-dashboard.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/moengage-dashboard.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/moengage-dashboard.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/moengage-dashboard.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/moengage-dashboard.jpg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/moengage-dashboard.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“MoEngage has helped us engage our customers contextually based on their shopping habits and behavior. We have seen significant uplifts in customer engagement and lifetime value. We feel confident that with the deep domain experience and algorithms that MoEngage brings to the table, we will be able to drive better experience for our customers,” said Mahadevan Iyer, SVP of Group CRM &amp; Analytics, at Landmark Group in India, in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup saw fast-growth amid the pandemic as more businesses worldwide scrambled to focus on their web and app offerings, said Dodda. Without disclosing a specific figure, MoEngage said its annualized recurring revenue has grown by over 120% in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>“This growth and funding is validation of our vision and product innovation &#8211; particularly, Sherpa, our AI Engine, has been a game changer. We are excited to welcome Steadview Capital and look forward to working with them,” said Dodda.</p>
<p>The startup, which has opened offices in Boston, London, and Berlin among other places in recent quarters, plans to deploy the fresh funds to scale its product offerings and hire more talent, it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Delivering a personalized customer experience across channels has never been more relevant than it is today. We are thrilled to partner with the MoEngage team on their mission and growth journey. MoEngage’s unique insights-led approach to customer engagement and campaigns makes it easier for brands to drive results and build better relationships with their customers&#8221; said Ravi Mehta, Founder and CIO of Steadview Capital, in a statement.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Tesla will replace the Autopilot cameras in the front fenders of some its electric vehicles for free, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/06/tesla-is-replacing-faulty-autpilot-cameras-in-some-model-s-x-3-cars.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><em>CNBC</em></a>. While Tesla has yet to issue a recall, the news organization has seen internal documents distributed to authorized service providers in late November, asking them to replace faulty repeater cameras at no cost to owners. Apparently, the cameras on some Model S, X and 3 vehicles manufactured by the company at its Fremont, California plant have faulty printed circuit boards.</p>
<p>Those cameras capture the car&#8217;s blind spots, and Autopilot wouldn&#8217;t work without them. If they&#8217;re not working as intended, drivers typically only see a block box on their main display and may get alerts that their Autopilot has limited function. <em>CNBC</em> says Tesla may have to replace cameras for at least several hundred vehicles as a result of the faulty PCBs it used.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company launched its first animal-free egg protein in November, called EVERY ClearEgg, making its retail debut via a partnership with cold-pressed juice brand Pressed.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://theeverycompany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The EVERY Co.</a>, a company that has developed a precision fermentation technology to make animal-free proteins, like eggs, is having a good 2021.</p>
<p>First the company, formerly known as Clara Foods, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/will-budweiser-brew-eggs-and-will-post-cereal-make-meat/">secured a deal in April with BioBrew</a>, an investment of AB InBev’s investment arm, ZX Ventures, to brew its animal-free protein at scale. EVERY’s first egg protein will be launching as a co-branded ingredient with its first retail customer later this year.</p>
<p>Then today, it announced an oversubscribed Series C round of $175 million. The investment was co-led by new investor, McWin, and existing investor, Rage Capital. They were joined by other new and existing investors, including Temasek, Wheatsheaf Group and TO Ventures. Prosus Ventures also contributed to the funding, marking its first investment in synthetic biology, according to EVERY.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243695" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latest investment brings EVERY’s total funding to $233 million. We profiled the company back in 2015 when it raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/09/clara-foods-cooks-up-1-7-million-in-funding-to-make-egg-whites-from-yeast-instead-of-chickens/">$1.7 million in seed funding</a>. It then went on to secure another $15 million in Series A funding and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/clara-foods-secures-series-b-financing-led-by-ingredion-and-inks-global-commercial-partnership-300838351.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$40 million in Series B funding</a> in 2019. It <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211005005490/en/Clara-Foods-Rebrands-to-The-EVERY-Company-Launches-the-Worlds-First-Animal-Free-Egg-Protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed its name to The EVERY Co.</a> in October.</p>
<p>At that time, CEO and founder Arturo Elizondo said via a press release that, “Our new branding conveys our vision to fundamentally transform the food system for the 21st century so that every human, everywhere can enjoy the food they know and love without harming our planet or animals in the process.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243705" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243705" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2243705" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Arturo-Elizondo-EVERY-HQ.jpg?w=680" alt="The EVERY Co." width="680" height="395" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Arturo-Elizondo-EVERY-HQ.jpg 7022w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Arturo-Elizondo-EVERY-HQ.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Arturo-Elizondo-EVERY-HQ.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Arturo-Elizondo-EVERY-HQ.jpg?resize=768,446 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Arturo-Elizondo-EVERY-HQ.jpg?resize=680,395 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Arturo-Elizondo-EVERY-HQ.jpg?resize=1536,891 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Arturo-Elizondo-EVERY-HQ.jpg?resize=2048,1188 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Arturo-Elizondo-EVERY-HQ.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243705" class="wp-caption-text">Arturo Elizondo, founder and CEO of The EVERY Co. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> The EVERY Co.</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the name change, the company launched its first animal-free egg protein in November, called EVERY ClearEgg, making its retail debut via a partnership with cold-pressed juice brand Pressed, which is putting EVERY’s product into smoothies.</p>
<p>This is the culmination of seven years of work by the company, Elizondo told TechCrunch. The Series B in 2019 was about proving the technology and now with Series C, it can bring products to market and leverage the capital to drive scale, he added.</p>
<p>Also in the past two years, EVERY went from pre-revenue to revenue, grew from 30 employees to 60 employees, received U.S Food and Drug Administration approval for all of its products and is now selling in the U.S., Europe and Asia. In addition, the company now has two products in commercialization, including a pepsin protein, and one on the way, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new capital will enable the company to scale production, commercialize further products in its pipeline and expand into new food applications for its technology.</p>
<p>“We are now focused on scaling to drive adoption,” Elizondo said. “There has been a lot of press around B2C, but companies like Kellogg’s and General Mills want to catch up and launch these kinds of products, but infrastructure has not caught up. For these technologies to work and enable transition, you have to have the scale to match that. For us, we have started putting the Legos in place.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the egg market is still dominated by, well, eggs — worldwide, <a href="https://ew-nutrition.com/us/how-producers-keep-the-egg-supply-chain-going-amid-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 1.3 trillion eggs are produced annually</a> — something EVERY is working to change. The size of the company’s raise signifies that its technology is working and getting traction.</p>
<p>It joins with others working on similar animal-free egg products, like Simply Eggless and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/eat-just-the-alt-protein-company-formerly-known-as-hampton-creek-has-raised-another-200-million/">Eat Just, which raised $200 million</a> earlier in the summer, and Perfeggt, a Berlin-based foodtech company poised to debut its chicken-less egg product in the first quarter of 2022. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/perfeggt-plant-based-egg-alternative/">secured $2.8 million</a> in November.</p>

<p>Elizondo sees more companies in this area as “a rising tide lifts all boats” rather than competition. Instead, the battle is in awareness and getting the products just right so they can be a 1:1 ratio to real eggs.</p>
<p>“You can’t just make a tasty product because eggs are a functional ingredient in almost everything,” he added. “To have a shot at dominating the market, we have to allow consumers to make the transition and have a 1:1 ratio so we can have the biggest shot at giving the incumbents a run for their money.”</p>
<p>“It’s rare for a company to credibly claim revolutionizing a century-old industry,” said Gabriel Ruimy, managing partner of Rage Capital, in a written statement. “Arturo and the team at EVERY are doing just that.”</p>
<p>“The restaurant industry is one of the early adopters of new food technologies and their introduction to the consumer,” added Henry McGovern, founder of McWin Food Ecosystem Fund and AmRest, which operates over 2,300 restaurants globally. “Given our deep roots in restaurants and as a prolific investor in the leading alternative protein companies, McWin is uniquely equipped to support EVERY’s ambitious plans to bring its products to menus worldwide. Eggs are not only ubiquitous, but they are also incredibly difficult to replace; we see tremendous potential in EVERY’s revolutionary technology.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://hummingbird.co/">Hummingbird</a>, which sells anti-money laundering software to banks and fintechs, announced today that it raised a $30 million Series B led by new investor <a href="https://www.battery.com/">Battery Ventures</a>. Existing investors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://flourishventures.com/">Flourish</a> and <a href="https://homebrew.co/">Homebrew</a> also participated in the round alongside <a href="https://finvc.co/">FinVC</a> and <a href="https://plaid.com/products/auth/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=Search_G_Brand_Exact&amp;utm_content=plaid&amp;utm_term=plaid&amp;utm_creative=481138286147&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA47GNBhDrARIsAKfZ2rAwBrkFyZIsOKoGJ8WdeSzRQ_s6bfArqroLYxe0o47fqhdFsV0A6E8aAj03EALw_wcB">Plaid</a> cofounder William Hockey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round, Hummingbird’s first since its $8.2 million Series A last year, brings its total funds raised to $41.8 million. It plans to use the proceeds to expand its 35-person team, specifically in customer success, engineering, and product design, CEO Joe Robinson told TechCrunch in an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hummingbird’s founding team is composed of fintech veterans, with about half coming from Block (formerly known as Square) and the other half coming from blockchain payments company Circle, Robinson said. Robinson himself ran risk and data science at Circle for about two years, where he realized some of the challenges facing compliance professionals that drive the </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25741292.2020.1725366"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than 1% success rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of global anti-money laundering controls. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243132" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are lots of data sources and risk signals and algorithms to bring in that are great, but it&#8217;s very, very difficult to weave them together for investigations. The work is being conducted with really raw formats across many different systems,” Robinson said. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243619" style="width: 568px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243619" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2243619 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hummingbird-Joe-Robinson-Laundromat-2021.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="558" height="418" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hummingbird-Joe-Robinson-Laundromat-2021.jpg 2652w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hummingbird-Joe-Robinson-Laundromat-2021.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hummingbird-Joe-Robinson-Laundromat-2021.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hummingbird-Joe-Robinson-Laundromat-2021.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hummingbird-Joe-Robinson-Laundromat-2021.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hummingbird-Joe-Robinson-Laundromat-2021.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hummingbird-Joe-Robinson-Laundromat-2021.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hummingbird-Joe-Robinson-Laundromat-2021.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243619" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Hummingbird CEO Joe Robinson. <strong>Image Credits</strong>: Hummingbird </em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial crime investigators typically work on 100 to 200 cases a week, Robinson said. The team set out to build a specialized CRM for compliance and risk teams that would bring together these disparate data sets onto one platform, helping them handle these high-case volumes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hummingbird’s clients today include payments firms like Stripe, crypto exchanges like Coinbase, and banking-as-a-service provider Evolve Bank &amp; Trust, per Robinson, though the company declined to share the total number of clients it serves. The company, which has a presence in seven countries, also works with e-commerce clients like Etsy.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to launch in the U.K. early next year and eventually plans to build out its Europe presence and expand to regions in Asia, Robinson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of its product, the startup is particularly focused on iterating its design in its next phase of growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“​​We think this practice area is one of the most overlooked and unloved spaces for great design thinking, and we want to be the first company to bring that to this space,” Robinson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Battery Ventures’ Michael Brown, who has invested in several fintech companies including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MX Technologies, AuditBoard, and Next Insurance,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led the investment in Hummingbird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hummingbird is the only cloud-based vendor focused on being the end-to-end workflow platform for risk and compliance professionals—the crime fighters in finance,” Brown told TechCrunch in an email. “There are many startups selling narrow products into different areas within the broader fraud/know-your-customer/anti-money laundering space. But none are trying to own the workflow layer and tie all these disparate systems together.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Banking is undergoing a huge transformation and how debt collections operations engage customers is becoming a big issue, especially with things like BNPL schemes. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in the last few years digitalizing financial and other services, but debt collections operations remain very manual and archaic resulting in frustration for customers and lost money for service providers. Banks are having to deal with this change and fintech startups are appearing to deal with it.</p>
<p>Back in May this year, <a href="https://receeve.com/en/">Receeve</a>, a no-code SaaS startup that makes it easier for companies to collect and recover debts (such as overdue claims) increased their seed funding to $13.5M with venture capital funds Seaya Ventures and 14W. Existing backers, Mangrove, Speedinvest, and Seedcamp participated in the expansion round –  bringing re:ceeve’s total war chest to more than $12M.</p>
<p>With re:ceeve, company teams can automate processes across the credit management value chain. Its customers include banks, alternative lenders, utilities and telcos.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243957" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since then the startup has not been resting.</p>
<p>It has now bagged ABN AMRO &#8211; the third-largest bank in the Netherlands &#8211; as a partner and investor, gaining a seed-extension of €4m from the bank’s venture arm. So it&#8217;s now sitting on $16M.</p>
<p>Receeve and ABN AMRO Ventures are also entering into a strategic partnership. This means the banks’ customers who are most vulnerable to debt get more support.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO can now access Receeve’s platform get a “unified view” of the customer on top of their current technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paul Jozefak, receeve’s CEO said: “Both companies share a vision on delivering advanced data and digital solutions to build the best customer experiences. The commitment to innovation is reflected in ABN AMRO Ventures partnering with receeve to help forge the solution roadmap and be the leader in creating a better journey for the most vulnerable customers while at the same time providing tools to its employees to continually improve their experience as well.”</p>
<p>Hugo Bongers, Head of ABN AMRO Ventures adds “receeve’s approach and growth trajectory immediately intrigued us. We look forward to collaborating with the whole team to not only deliver great value to ABN AMRO, but we are excited to partner as investors to fuel growth and expansion and build a market leader across Europe and beyond.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nine months after competitor Proofpoint was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scooped up by Thoma Bravo for $12.3 billion</a>, <a href="https://mimecast.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mimecast</a> is also going the private equity route. Today the security company <a href="https://www.mimecast.com/resources/press-releases/dates/2021/12/mimecast-to-become-private-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Permira would be taking Mimecast private in a $5.8 billion all-cash deal. Mimecast has been public since 2015, and this deal is being made at a price of $80 per share, the parties said.</p>
<p>The news follows a report published earlier today that Thoma Bravo was <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/211207/p9#a211207p9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $35 billion</a> to focus on buy-outs of tech companies, and comes in a year that has been a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-30/private-equity-s-taste-for-tech-sparks-record-80-billion-spree" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very active one for PE firms</a> in the sector.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and people working more remotely and shifting everything online, it has also been a very, very big year for cybersecurity, and so that puts a particular focus on London-founded Mimecast&#8217;s specialty area of e-mail security.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243956" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company, listed on Nasdaq, has more than 39,000 business customers, with some 20,000 of those using its products to secure Microsoft 365 deployments in particular. It has been trading up over this year and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MIME?p=MIME&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last night closed at $75/share</a> with a market cap of just under $5 billion; this deal represents a premium on that.</p>
<p>“We have long admired Mimecast, its management team and its talented employees,” said Permira Partners&#8217; Michail Zekkos and Ryan Lanpher in a joint statement. “Email is the leading vector for cyberattacks, and phishing and impersonation attempts are continuously evolving. This means there has never been more urgency or need for organizations to protect their critical data and infrastructure. With an innovative platform, world-class security controls and scalable model, Mimecast is ideally positioned to help companies both large and small protect their employees from malicious activity. We look forward to leveraging our experience scaling global technology businesses as we partner with Peter and team on their next phase of growth.”</p>
<p>“Today is an exciting milestone for Mimecast as we begin a new chapter for our company,” added Peter Bauer, chairman and chief executive officer of Mimecast, in a statement. “Our team has done an outstanding job growing and expanding our relationships with customers and innovating our platform. Permira has a strong track record of collaboratively supporting companies’ growth ambitions and strategic goals, and we look forward to working together to further strengthen the cybersecurity and resilience of organizations around the world. This is a great outcome for our company and our shareholders.”</p>
<p>The company had been in the midst of a strategic review prior to the deal and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mimecast-explores-options-including-a-possible-sale-11635367602?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors were floated at the end of October</a> that it was looking at raising money or selling itself.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“This transaction follows a strategic process overseen and directed by an independent Special Committee of the Board of Directors that included discussion with a number of strategic and financial parties. We are pleased to deliver significant immediate cash value to our shareholders and believe that this transaction is the best path forward for Mimecast and our stakeholders,&#8221; said Robert Schechter, independent director of Mimecast and chair of the Special Committee, in a statement.</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, which include approval by Mimecast shareholders and regulatory approvals.</p>

<p>Other aggregators targeting China have raked in greater sums. Nebula Brands, a Beijing-based Amazon aggregator, said Tuesday that it has closed a Series B funding round of more than $50 million. The investment was led by the Asian fund of L Catterton, a global private equity firm known for its consumer tech focus.</p>
<p>Financing the latest round also included Nebula&#8217;s Series A investor Matrix Partners and its angel investor Alpha Startup Fund. The company has raised roughly $60 million to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As Amazon grew into a behemoth, many of its third-party Chinese vendors also thrived and became multi-million-dollar businesses. These exporters are now in need of greater capital and talent to sustain growth, and the top-performing ones are given two options: get equity funding to scale further, or sell the business and move on. The latter path is where roll-ups come into play.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese third-party vendor marketplace is experiencing rapid growth, with the ability to quickly scale and provide high quality products efficiently to Amazon customers across the globe,&#8221; Nebula&#8217;s co-founder <span class="xn-person">William Wang</span> said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The model of aggregating Fulfillment by Amazon vendors and strengthening their operations has already proven to be extremely effective in some markets in the west and is set to take-off in China, where Nebula Brands is leading the charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the new proceeds, Nebula is wrestling with a raft of foreign aggregators that have come hunting for Chinese sellers, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/berlin-brands-group-enter-china-roll-up-amazon-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a>, Razor Group and Thrasio. The startup, founded only in May, has already acquired one vendor and it&#8217;s on track to close several more deals by the end of the year, it told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nebula currently operates a team of over 50 employees in China &#8220;with deep knowledge of the market and extensive on-the-ground sourcing, underwriting, and operating experience from previous roles at renowned e-commerce, technology, and financial firms,&#8221; the company said. Its co-founders are Ryan Ren, who was a CEO at a &#8220;listed company,&#8221; William Wang, former head of integrated marketing at Lenovo, and Hardys Wu, former head of supply chain at Wayfair.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was in 2017 that I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/17/rajeeb-deys-new-career-platform-learnerbly-secures-1-6m-led-by-frontline-ventures/">covered</a> the emergence and first funding of <a href="https://www.learnerbly.com/">Learnerbly</a>, a SaaS marketplace for professional development. Quite a lot has happened since then, not the least of which was the COVID-19 pandemic, which has meant pretty much meant all kinds of learning had to transition to virtual, including inside corporates.</p>
<p>The UK startup has now secured a $10 million Series A funding round led by Beringea. Also participating were new investors Digital Horizon Ventures, BY Venture Partners, GO Ventures, and FJ Labs. This was alongside existing investors Frontline Ventures, Triple Point, London Co-Investment Fund and UFI Ventures.</p>
<p>Learnerbly has also secured some angel investors including Zach Coelius (Coelius Capital), Leonard Picardo (second employee at Deliveroo), Neil Ryland (CRO of Peakon), Renaud Visage (Co-Founder and CTO of Eventbrite), and Stephan Thoma (former Global Head of Learning at Google). So far it has secured clients including Hellofresh, King, WeTransfer, Curve, Busuu and GoCardless.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243947" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Learnerbly’s online marketplace offers access to books, podcasts, conferences, courses, coaching, and more from over 250 providers including Blinkist, Masterclass, Pluralsight, and General Assembly and is aimed at engineers, marketers, finance and sales etc.</p>
<p>Founder Rajeeb Dey MBE was previously best known for scaling <a href="https://enternships.com/">Enternships</a> – a portal connecting students and graduates with work placements in start-ups and fast-growth businesses.</p>
<p>He commented: “With the rise of the ‘great resignation’ and employers globally concerned about how they retain, as well as attract top talent in an increasingly competitive market the focus on learning and development has never been greater. Businesses are struggling to navigate the new normal of hybrid and remote working and facilitating the personal and professional growth of employees has become even trickier.”</p>
<p>Maria Wagner, Investment Director at Beringea, commented: “With the hybrid work environment, employers are under pressure to offer new ways of learning for their employees and ensure they are engaged and retained… Learnerbly offers a curated solution that serves both the needs of the employees and of HR departments in this new environment.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The best known players in this field are the likes of Workday Learning, Cornerstone, or a newer player like 360Learning which raised $200m. Others include Degreed and Edcast. While most are focused on the large enterprise market, Learnerbly is aimed at scale-ups and mid-market companies (employees up to 2000 people.) </p>
<p>Dey told me that Learnerbly is particularly aimed at companies with “over-stretched people teams and limited in-house L&amp;D expertise/support.” Hence why it&#8217;s aimed at tech startups a lot of the time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest pain points for any business, but especially SMEs, is managing payroll. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A startup that has built payroll automation software to make the process less painful, Pento, has raised $35 million in a Series B round of funding co-led by Tiger Global Management and Avid Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment marks Tiger Global’s first time investing in London-based Pento. Avid has invested previously, along with other existing backers General Catalyst, Seedcamp and LocalGlobe. It also comes just six months after the startup raised a $15.6 million Series A led by General Catalyst. The company declined to reveal at what valuation either round was raised, saying only that its current valuation is “a meaningful step up” from its Series A. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243800" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Jonas Bøgh Larsen and Emil Hagbarth Rasmussen in 2017, </span><a href="http://pento.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pento</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has now raised $53.4 million since its inception. The startup’s mission is to help free up companies from “onerous outsourcing and outdated software.” Pento says its SaaS offering fully automates the payroll process so that payroll managers and finance teams don’t have to rely on spreadsheets, PDFs, e-mails and manual checks. It claims to reduce the amount of time its customers spend on payroll by up to 80% by giving them “more control and visibility” over their monthly pay run. It does this by automating everything from tax calculations to payments to reporting requirements so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that businesses of any size “can run their payroll in minutes instead of days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be doing something right. CEO and co-founder Bøgh Larsen said that over the past year, Pento has seen its revenue climb “10x.” While we don’t know from what base, the company did say it has seen “consecutive record-breaking months of growth” since its Series A. It’s also added several “major” new customers, including Britain’s Starling Bank, as well as integrations with partners such as Personio, Hibob and BambooHR. Other customers include tech startups Pleo and Cuvva as well as Honest Burgers and Beauty Pie. In general, Pento works with hundreds of SMEs and mid-sized businesses with 30 to 500 employees, and is increasingly serving larger enterprises with around 2,000 employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its SaaS model, the company makes money by charging customers a set monthly fee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it plans to expand internationally in the future, Pento for now is focused on its home market of the U.K. and Europe, where it says that payroll outsourcing is a nearly $6 billion market that is expected to grow at an annual rate of 4.4%. In the U.K. alone, there are an estimated 20,000 small </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and medium-sized</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">businesses and 4,000 mid-market businesses that are potential customers, it says.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">represents an opportunity to transform payroll automation for nearly 10 million employees</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">within the U.K. alone and a $1+ billion annual revenue opportunity,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bøgh Larsen said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243806" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243806" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2243806 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="357" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=1536,806 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=2048,1075 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243806" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pento</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pento plans to use its new capital in part to expand into new European countries and toward product development, service expansion and partner integrations. It also, naturally, plans to do some hiring. It’s already grown its team to 70 employees, up from 20 a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to its SaaS offering, Pento provides infrastructure through its partnerships and integrations with existing accounting software, HR products and pension providers. It has also developed an open payroll API that is currently in beta, with the aim of allowing any business to build custom integrations to automate more of their workflows, such as time-tracking or shift planning. That API will also allow employees to share pay and compensation data with third-party apps and services to validate their income to credit agencies, as well as other financial and HR organizations, the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We built Pento having seen firsthand just how broken the current payroll processes are, and our continued success showcases just how strongly forward-thinking companies are asking for tools to fix this,” said Bøgh Larsen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitors include France&#8217;s PayFit, ADP and legacy services-heavy payroll outsourcing businesses. Pento says that its main differentiator is that it is building a payroll-only product with an integrations-first approach, meaning that &#8212; as opposed to much of its competition &#8212; Pento partners and integrates with other tools/products (such as HR, expenses management and accounting) that customers use instead of building their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That distinction was a big draw for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addie Lerner, founder and managing partner at Avid Ventures, who said her firm has become increasingly excited about the “n of 1” market opportunity for Pento to be a pure-play payroll automation leader in Europe, and beyond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We continue to hear positive feedback from the market on Pento’s strategy of focusing on payroll only rather than payroll plus HR,” she wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longer term, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if Pento can become the infrastructure layer for HR and compensation via its soon-to-be-rolled-out open API, Lerner added, the company would become further embedded into its customers’ payroll and HR workflows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It could then leverage its strategic positioning of managing payroll for its customers and being in the critical flow of payroll payments to monetize a suite of ‘Pento for Employee’ products including financial offerings such as lending, KYC, and more,” she said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.felixcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felix Capital</a>, the London VC firm that has built a portfolio emphasizing investments in startups in the ecosystem that supports the creative class, is bringing on two more partners, Julien Codorniou and Susan Lin, as it continues to expand into a wider range of categories.</p>
<p>Codorniou had been a longtime executive at Meta (formerly Facebook), where he worked across different products for businesses, most significantly as VP of Workplace, the company&#8217;s effort to build a version of Facebook tailored to the working world. Lin is an internal promotion, and in what is perhaps a mark of just how slow change is to come to the halls of power and money in the world of tech, she is actually the first female partner at Felix since the firm was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/03/new-london-vc-firm-felix-capital-launches-with-120m-fund-and-team-of-elite-advisors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded in 2015</a>.</p>
<p>Felix &#8212; co-founded by longtime European investors Frederic Court and Antoine Nussenbaum &#8212; today says it has some $600 million under management with 47 active investments. That <a href="https://www.felixcap.com/portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portfolio</a> includes a range of companies that are, in a straightforward way, bets on some of the bigger tech trends in Europe and further afield: they include businesses crossing the nexus of food and e-commerce such as Deliveroo, HungryPanda, Oatly, AllPlants and Frichti; transport startups Dott and Heetch; travel startup Perfect Stay and recruitment platform Job Today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243896" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But there is also a big emphasis on startups putting out creator or creative products and content; or used by creators to help them work, with the list including companies like Farfetch, Business of Fashion, Moonbug, Mejuri and Goop; as well as Mirakl, SellerX, Sorare, Rally, Creative Fabrica, fraud prevention platform Forter, Juni and more.</p>
<p>Adding in two new partners will be a way of expanding Felix&#8217;s scope further, specifically into more categories to fill out those existing fields.</p>
<p>Codorniou, with his experience in building and evaluating workplace productivity tools &#8212; before Meta, he was at Microsoft as a director in business development &#8212; plans to look at and fund SaaS businesses with a focus around areas like the future of work (a pretty nebulous category these days, given how quickly working practices and work infrastructure have been forced to evolve in the wake of the pandemic). This is an area that Felix has been doubling down on of late, with investments in Mirakl, Job Today and Yoobic all part of a bigger and more generalized thesis around how working and building the infrastructure to work are changing fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent so much time in last five years talking to CIOs and CFOs, learning what they like or don&#8217;t like,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Budgets are moving from IT to HR, and we want to make the best of that convergence. It&#8217;s about building community at work, but I also think front line is the next frontier for automation and more.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tapping another area that loomed large both at Meta and in Europe these days, Cordorniou told TechCrunch he will be looking to back more gaming startups as well, particularly those emerging out of further-flung corners of the European region, and those that are pushing the boundaries of gameplay and monetization models. On the latter point, games have long been early movers and some of the biggest users of virtual currencies; now, with the rise of new kinds of gamification around cryptocurrency, it will be interesting to see how (and if) we see a wave of startups building gameplay that taps into that.</p>
<p>There is a talent connection between the two areas, too, he pointed out. &#8220;Obviously NFT is all the rage in gaming right now,&#8221; Codorniou said. &#8220;What is interesting is that the same people I worked with 10 years ago that used to be in social mobile gaming are now building new companies in the world of play to earn and crypto.&#8221; Sorare and Ledger are two existing investments in the portfolio that point to where and how Codorniou and Felix might back startups in the future.</p>
<p>Codorniou is joining as a partner at Felix, but he&#8217;s had a connection to the firm since day one, as one of its founding advisors &#8212; a formidable group of people, former founders or top executives, who have been leaning into Felix&#8217;s investment strategy as LPs without being full members of the team. (Others include David Marcus, Stephanie Phair, and Henri Moissinac.)</p>
<p>Lin, meanwhile, has been with Felix for three years &#8212; previous investment roles included time at Hg Capital and Bain &#8212; and as a partner she will be focusing on expanding the portfolio in another equally significant direction: by focusing on startups building tools for financial, physical and mental health and productivity. Felix already has a very decent foothold in this department, with investments in Peloton, Unmind, Peanut and Peppy among the startups that are already developing the wider health theme.</p>
<p>“Since first joining Felix almost three years ago, it was clear I was joining a unique team that is both highly collaborative and ambitious, with a distinctive and inspiring vision and mission,&#8221; she said in a statement. &#8220;I have loved every minute of working with our own team, our founders and helping deepen our conviction and investments into newer areas such as consumer fintech and digital health.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Falcon Edge Capital, the New York-headquartered investment firm, has closed the first tranche of its new $10 billion fund and is rebranding as Alpha Wave Global, a source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Once the new fund &#8212; which is called Alpha Wave Ventures II &#8212; has completely closed, Alpha Wave Global&#8217;s AUM will exceed $15 billion, the source said. The firm, which began its life as a public market investor, plans to use the fresh fund to back startups globally, the source said, requesting anonymity as the details are private.</p>
<p>A single fund of $10 billion would be among the largest of its size globally.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243920" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch reported last week that Falcon Edge was in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/falcon-edge-capital-eyes-raising-a-fund-of-over-10-billion/">talks to raise a new fund of $10 billion or more</a>. The firm expects to raise slightly more than $10 billion for the new fund, the source said.</p>
<p>Alpha Wave Global declined to comment.</p>
<p>Founded by Rick Gerson, Navroz D. Udwadia, and Ryan Khoury in 2012, Alpha Wave Global has this year emerged as one of the most aggressive investors globally. It has been very active in a handful of markets including the U.S. and India, the world’s second largest internet geography where Alpha Wave Global has deployed about $2 billion this year and minted at least 5 unicorns including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/indian-fintech-cred-valued-at-4-billion-following-251-million-fundraise/">fintech CRED</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/india-mensa-a-house-of-d2c-brands-becomes-unicorn-in-just-six-months/">house of direct-to-consumer brands Mensa</a>. It&#8217;s currently in advanced stages to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiger-and-falcon-look-to-double-down-on-indian-social-commerce-startup-dealshare/">co-lead a financing round in social commerce DealShare</a>, valuing the Indian firm at over $1.7 billion, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p>
<p>Alpha Wave Global, a Tiger Global grandcub, has borrowed many of the older firm’s strategies. Like Tiger Global, Alpha Wave Global is also very quick and aggressive with its investments. Instead of evaluating a startup in ad hoc, the firm maps the entire space and assesses whether it’s bullish about the category itself, Udwadia said in a virtual conference early this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The firm likes to get aggressive when most other investors are cautious about the market conditions, and slows down its dealmaking when everyone else is writing checks at a frenetic pace, he said. Alpha Wave Global has made over 40 investments in the private market this year, more than those it made in the past four years put together, according to CB Insights.</p>
<p>It has traditionally focused more on backing growth-stage startups, cutting checks in the range of $50 million to $150 million. But in recent years, through its fund called Alpha Wave Incubation, it has aggressively backed startups in seed and Series A financing stages.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Clubbi launched in October 2020 with 24-hour delivery, no minimum order quantity and flexible payment terms. It is currently working with 1,000 grocery stores in Rio de Janeiro.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.clubbi.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clubbi</a>, a Brazilian business-to-business resource for small food retailers, brought in $4.5 million in seed funding to expand across the country.</p>
<p>The remote first company started in 2020 as an online commerce resource for neighborhood markets and grocery stores — most that have never shopped online before — to stock up on products they need, offering competitive pricing and better customer service.</p>
<p>Co-founder João Macedo initially had the vision for Clubbi while working as head of distribution for Red Bull. He saw how fragmented and analog the commerce business was, resulting in difficulty reaching a large retail base. In fact, suppliers still rely on door-to-door sales, he told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243622" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“They depend on intermediaries, and that makes go-to-market more complex and expensive,” he added. “I lived in India, and it was fragmented there also, but B2B marketplaces were doing well there.”</p>
<p>Last year, he joined with Marcos Adler and Alexandre Farber to create a marketplace connecting suppliers, like Kraft Heinz, Adria and Piraquê, with markets.</p>
<p>Clubbi launched in October 2020 with 24-hour delivery, no minimum order quantity and flexible payment terms. It is currently working with 1,000 grocery stores in Rio de Janeiro, up from three at launch, with plans to grow to over 3,000 by mid 2022, Adler said. The company is also growing 40% month over month, gross merchandise value-wise.</p>
<p>“We reach a long tail of customers that are hard to service, are working with less working capital and offer them a single place to buy everything they need and have good delivery lead time to keep inventory fulfilled,” Adler added. “All they have to do is go on the website, place a one-click order and get it the next day on their doorstep.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Valor Capital Group co-led the round with ONEVC and was joined by Better Tomorrow Ventures, Latitud and Canary, which led Clubbi’s $550,000 pre-seed round.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to accelerate growth, technology development, expansion into other Brazilian cities and develop additional supplier partnerships. Clubbi offers about 7,000 to 8,000 SKUs on its marketplace, while the average store will carry 1,000 to 2,000 SKUs, Adler said. The company started with five employees and also plans to hire additional staff to bring its now 40-person employee base to 70 people by the middle of 2022.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company still has a long way to go to get in front of over 200,000 mom-and-pop grocery stores in Brazil, which generate more than $35 billion in combined revenue, Valor Capital Group’s Antoine Colaço said in a written statement.</p>
<p>“These stores still face many challenges when trying to procure goods in an efficient and low-cost manner, and they also lack access to fair financing solutions,” Colaço said. “Clubbi is delivering an integrated and simple way for these stores to receive the best products — at the right prices and payment terms — at their doors. The social and economic development Clubbi generates is huge and the Company&#8217;s early results are very promising and impressive.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.equinix.com/">Equinix</a> announced today that it is acquiring <a href="https://www.mainone.net/">MainOne</a>, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, for $320 million.</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to close Q1 of 2022, subject to the &#8220;satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Equinix&#8217;s acquisition of MainOne follows a series of moves the global digital infrastructure player made last year when it expanded to India through the <a href="https://www.equinix.com/newsroom/press-releases/2020/08/equinix-expands-to-india-with-acquisition-of-gpx-india">acquisition of GPX India</a> for $161 million and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/equinix-is-buying-13-data-centers-from-bell-canada-for-750m/">acquired 13 data centres from Bell Canada</a> for $780 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243905" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a statement, Equinix acknowledged that acquiring MainOne is the first step in its long-term strategy to become an African carrier neutral digital infrastructure company.</p>
<p>&#8220;With more than 200 million people, Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and, along with Ghana, has become an established data center hub. This makes the acquisition a pivotal entry point for Equinix into the continent,&#8221; the company said in the statement.</p>
<p>Funke Opeke started MainOne in 2010 after noticing the poor internet connectivity Nigerians had to deal with upon her return to the West African country from the U.S.</p>
<p>Armed with over $200 million in equity and debt investment, Opeke built MainOne as West Africa&#8217;s first privately owned, open access undersea high capacity cable submarine. It&#8217;s a 7,000-kilometer cable stretching from Portugal to West Africa with landings along Accra in Ghana, Dakar in Senegal, Abidjan in the Ivory Coast and Lagos in Nigeria.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MainOne also has 1,200 kilometers of terrestrial fiber network across southern Nigeria in Lagos, Edo and Ogun states. Connectivity to terrestrial sites extends across 65 PoPs (points of presence) in cities across Portugal, Nigeria, Ghana and the Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>MainOne&#8217;s services are used by over 800 business-to-business customers. They include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecommunications operators, financial service companies and cloud service providers.</p>
<p>Having enabled connectivity for these businesses via three operational data centers, MainOne plans to open an additional facility in Q1 2022, a move that coincides with Equinix&#8217;s acquisition.</p>
<p>MainOne, which has a 500-person team, said its facilities generate approximately $60 million annualized revenue with a purchase multiple of approximately 14x EBITDA.</p>
<p>Upon closing, these facilities will add more than 64,000 gross square feet of space to Equinix, with 570,000 square feet of land for future expansions.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Equinix is buying 13 data centers from Bell Canada for $750M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/equinix-is-buying-13-data-centers-from-bell-canada-for-750m/embed/#?secret=szgBTdW9C2" data-secret="szgBTdW9C2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Globally, Equinix has 237 data centers across 27 countries. It also provides data center and interconnection services for over 10,000 of the world&#8217;s leading businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>“The acquisition of MainOne will represent a critical point of entry for Platform Equinix into the expansive and rapidly growing African market. MainOne’s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa,&#8221; said Charles Meyers, the president and CEO of Equinix in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;MainOne’s infrastructure, customer relationships, partner ecosystem and operating capability will extend the reach of Platform Equinix and bolster opportunities for customers in Africa and throughout the world.”</p>
<p>MainOne CEO Funke Opeke and the company&#8217;s management team will still continue to serve in their respective roles after the acquisition is finalized.</p>
<p>Opeke said the acquisition will accelerate MainOne&#8217;s long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;With similar values and culture to what we have jointly built in twelve years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey. The MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition, and we look forward to building our next chapter together,&#8221; she added.</p>
