										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fpGNFGbEwmQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>It turns out the most important decision made was not the vote to choose (and remove) in the election but Twitter&#8217;s permanent banning of the former President from the social network. Suddenly the temperature cooled, the new administration engaged with the details of vaccine rollout, and the second impeachment trial ended with an expected outcome. Twitter&#8217;s move was bipartisan if the trial was not.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s other big move was the acquisition of Revue, a Substack competitor we&#8217;re moving to in production of the Gillmor Gang newsletter. It features tools to drag and drop articles from Twitter, Feedly, and other newsletters, but crucially the ability to reorganize these chunks as the writing develops. It&#8217;s my bet that the newsletter container will absorb blogs, podcasts, and streaming into a reorganized media platform available to creators small and large.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This kind of organic process development meshes well with the newsletter model. It encourages more timely releases, and an editorial feel that prizes quality over quantity. As newsletters proliferate, an evaluation of time over volume becomes most significant. It&#8217;s less an eyeballs pattern than a prioritization of what is not chosen and then what is, consumed or annotated with social recommendations. As with the Gang&#8217;s Frank Radice Nuzzel newsletter, the focus becomes less flow and more authority or resonance.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>Daily Commentary</strong></h3>
<p>I have made the decision to cover the media exclusively in “The Radice Files” There are plenty of general news aggregators out there, and I for one, am just tired of those stories. I hope you’ll stay with me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead of non-stop Trump, the only political story in the revamped Radice File is about how Fox News cut away from House manager video testimony to a commentary on the futility of covering the violence given the lack of votes for conviction. This shadow dance happens not just on Fox but the other centrist or left networks like CNN and MSNBC. The slant is not what&#8217;s interesting; the networks&#8217; business model and the subtle effect on media programming is.</p>
<p>No wonder that streaming&#8217;s impact is being felt in the latest unicorn from Silicon Valley, Clubhouse. The audio streaming podcast disruptor is marketed as a FOMO inside hallway conversation, with a Twitter social cloud viral onboard mechanism that digs deep into your contact list and never lets go. Big ticket items such as a keynote-like conversation with Elon Musk are overbooked from the first minute. I tried unsuccessfully to join this week&#8217;s follow up with Marc Andreessen and his VC partner Ben Horowitz but it was sold out at 5000 after 30 minutes.</p>
<p>But there is definitely something tugging at me as I get notifications of people joining and creating rooms on various glitzy Valley topics. The live feeling of serendipity and catch it as you can promises the possibility of lightning in a bottle, the sensation of history being made, not just observed. Probably just an illusion, but it&#8217;s reminiscent of the feeling we used to get when putting a record on the turntable and daring the artist(s) to succeed. I still get that every time Miles&#8217; Kind of Blue resumes, the awe with which time is reorganized at the atomic level.</p>
<p>People say a Clubhouse can go easily from 1 to 5 hours. I think RSS was killed by the red unread marks indicator. Size matters? Probably, if my college research suggests. But more important than length is ROI, and that&#8217;s where the Clubhouse effect dovetails with the newsletter moment. The ingredients of both are intuition, choice, the organic breadcrumb trail, and the payload.</p>
<h3><strong>Intuition</strong></h3>
<p>Does this notification fit in with what pattern I&#8217;m trying to discern this moment. I love movies like Citizen Kane and North By Northwest for the mirage that they project of a universe fated by a biologically innate DNA. Sometimes we call it fate, other times dumb luck, but always that dumbest of phrases: It is what it is. Only this time the conceit is: It is what it&#8217;s about to be is. And if something happens, yes, I knew it. Not specifically, but given the mood the planet is in, it figures this could happen.</p>
<p>In a newsletter: the game is not to read everything, but only what and when and in what order. The prize is the analytics, which reward the reader with more stuff, and the publisher with validation of the impact of the combination of choice (citations) and context (writing.) In Clubhouse, it&#8217;s being in the room and what — knowing when to bail? For me it&#8217;s escaping the inevitability of the point being made in a podcast, or the filter of the business model of what I&#8217;m going to do next. If it&#8217;s Sunday, it&#8217;s Meet the Press. Maybe&#8230;</p>
<h3>Choice</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a bunch of choice: Choice of room, people, time invested, moment of throwing good money after bad. Choice of what I&#8217;m playing hookey on — work, cable news, family fun, sleep. Clubhouse lets you publicly eavesdrop, a broadcast @mention that doesn&#8217;t give you the option of lurking. But you can do the closest thing to multitasking: doing the dishes, playing with the dog, monitoring. cable news with the sound off, DJ-ing for a private room, driving, etc. It is the new radio, pandemic be damned. Wherever you go, there you still are.</p>
<p>Newsletters? People, time reading, research replacement, subscription development, form of payment (money, authority, trust), influence or eyeballs. The game is trading current media for future rebundling, where the new publishers, studios, and artists are grown.</p>
<h3><strong>Breadcrumb trail</strong></h3>
<p>These choices create the breadcrumb trail, plowing under the old and furrowing the new. Newsletters are the leading edge of this refactoring, tilling the memes, models, and markets for the trends that become viral. The analytics of opens, email vs. web clicks, and notification triage are implicit for the most part in their signal. Harvesting these breadcrumbs requires the impact of new content created in response to the earlier data. Once you&#8217;ve identified a valuable consumer, your real work has just begun.</p>
<p>First, you look for the signature of exultation, the embedded essence of the experience that a certain combination of intuition and action rewards the detective. For that is what this new media is: an information thriller that taps into deep reading, listening, and sharing. Every catch phrase — round up the usual suspects, or we are not the droids you are looking for — represent uber themes we crave to navigate a terrifying treacherous world. We are the droids we&#8217;re looking for, and these new medias represent possible parallel worlds where we can not just survive but honor values of our choosing.</p>
<p>In the movies, it&#8217;s called the plotline. Clubhouse presumes there&#8217;s a story worth waiting for, the moments where we gain power by sharing and decorating reactions with clues as to what part of the same elephant we are investigating. We know intuitively that we&#8217;re not going to learn business secrets, but there is gold to be retrieved from the participants as they share their sense of humor or lack of it, their rhythm of when they join, raise their hand, are successful at being invited on stage, when they leave, whether they boomerang, and only a little what they actually say. The price for this is your breadcrumbs.</p>
<h3>The Payload</h3>
<p>As much as I&#8217;m intrigued by Clubhouse, I&#8217;ve only actually joined or started a room twice. Once was by accident, as I realized by clicking on a link to see who was there. Me, I found out. Another was a conversation about a Techmeme podcast by the podcaster and Chris Messina of hashtag fame. I never could get into the big A16Z attractions. Like Frank Radice&#8217;s newsletter pivot, I was primarily interested in the atmospherics surrounding Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s media strategy. But that doesn&#8217;t obviate the steady feeling that something substantial is going on here.</p>
<p>Media generally is swallowing its pride in the wake of the political nightmare we&#8217;ve been living through. Notice I say media, not mainstream media or social media. Smarter people than me can debate the distinction, but I think the difference between the two is overstated, and more importantly, not that indicative of what the value of these new media surges will turn out to embody. More and more, the substantial writing that filters in on Twitter, RSS (through Feedly), and aggregators like Nuzzel and Medium is significant in its approach to the central issues we&#8217;re struggling with. That includes traditional players like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Information, and the tech journals, as they combine newsletter techniques with their substantial resources.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re seeing a merger of the medias, with the consensus around value and weight being measured by new metrics. In television, it&#8217;s the NewFronts combining digital and linear TV; in music it&#8217;s at the song level, not the album. Streaming has shaken the old networks to their core, with a horse race between Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu, and ABC, NBC, and the old CBS. M&amp;A has swallowed Fox, Time Warner, FX, and even an old studio, Paramount. And radio? You could say the usual suspects Apple, Google, Amazon, and Spotify, but Clubhouse? Like Zoom, I think so. Twitter and Facebook have bigger fish to fry, but Apple Car and Glasses are the key platforms Clubhouse will play in as we move into the autonomous work from anywhere reality. The payload is value, time management, and notifications at the core of the move to digital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>You’ve landed on the web version of the weekly Human Capital newsletter. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here</a> to get this in your inbox every Friday at 1 p.m.</em></p>
<p>Welcome back to Human Capital. A lot happened this week pertaining to on-demand companies like Uber, Postmates, DoorDash and Instacart, and their respective gig workforces. Meanwhile, New York&#8217;s attorney general hit Amazon with a lawsuit over its warehouse labor practices and Twitter made some new commitments to increase diversity at the leadership level by 2025.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all. Google fired another AI top ethicist, Margaret Mitchell. The company also internally published the results of its investigation into what happened with Dr. Timnit Gebru.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apologies in advance for a slightly lengthier than usual newsletter but it&#8217;s all worth knowing, I promise.</p>
<p><em>Quick note: Human Capital is getting a new name because it seems to be causing some confusion, so don&#8217;t be alarmed when this hits your inbox next week with a different name. Name TBD. </em></p>
<h3><strong>The essential workforce</strong></h3>
<p><b>New bill aims to regulate Amazon warehouses</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California assemblyperson Lorena Gonzalez, who was behind gig worker bill AB 5, </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5bn99/california-bill-aims-to-regulate-amazons-relentless-warehouse-worker-quotas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced new legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would regulate productivity quotas from companies like Amazon, Walmart and others. Called AB 701, the bill aims to better protect warehouse workers by implementing statewide standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While corporations like Amazon are collecting record profits during the pandemic, employees in their warehouses are being expected to do more, go faster and work harder without clear safety standards,” </span><a href="https://a80.asmdc.org/press-releases/assemblywoman-gonzalez-introduces-bill-protect-warehouse-workers-hazardous-working"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assemblywoman Gonzalez said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “It’s unacceptable for one the largest and wealthiest employers in the country to put workers’ bodies and lives at risk just so we can get next-day delivery.”</span></p>
<p><b>NY AG sues Amazon</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Attorney General Leticia James </span><a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/final_amazon_covid_summons_and_complaint_2-16_as_filed.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Amazon for allegedly failing to provide adequate health and safety measures for its workers. As part of the lawsuit, James alleges Amazon retaliated against workers Christian Smalls and Derrick Palmer after they complained to Amazon about the company’s lack of support during the COVID-19 pandemic. James’ suit came after Amazon’s preemptive lawsuit against her office, alleging that workplace safety is not something she has authority over.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/amazon-ny-ag-lawsuit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">James&#8217; statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Amazon and its CEO made billions during this crisis, hardworking employees were forced to endure unsafe conditions and were retaliated against for rightfully voicing these concerns. Since the pandemic began, it is clear that Amazon has valued profit over people and has failed to ensure the health and safety of its workers. The workers who have powered this country and kept it going during the pandemic are the very workers who continue to be treated the worst. As we seek to hold Amazon accountable for its actions, my office remains dedicated to protecting New York workers from exploitation and unfair treatment in all forms.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, of course, Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer are actively seeking to form a union. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/grimkim/status/1361820493079339008?s=12"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reports showed Amazon was altering traffic signals as a way to prevent workers from being able to effectively talk with each other. </span></p>
<p><b>Ex-Postmates VP speaks out about the gig economy</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vikrum Aiyer, the now-former vice president of global public policy and strategic communications at Postmates, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/ex-postmates-vp-of-global-public-policy-on-the-future-of-gig-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">penned a memo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to his former colleagues and other stakeholders in the gig economy outlining what he thinks needs to happen next in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his letter, Aiyer says “it would be a mistake for us to think that mild tweaks to worker classification, or a single state ballot measure, create a durable path forward for meaningfully addressing what Americans truly worry about: the chance to work, take care of their families, and not fret about what comes next.”</span></p>
<p><b>Postmates drivers say they’ve become prey to scammers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new report in The Markup showed scammers sometimes target Postmates workers. In one instance, a scammer stole $346.73 from a worker. You can </span><a href="https://themarkup.org/working-for-an-algorithm/2021/02/18/postmates-drivers-have-become-easy-prey-for-scammers-and-drivers-say-the-companys-not-helping"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read the full story here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In related news, Uber, which owns Postmates, </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/uber-hires-prominent-critic-to-focus-on-treatment-of-drivers?sref=gni836kR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently hired labor researcher and Uber critic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alex Rosenblat to lead the company’s marketplace policy, fairness and research efforts. </span></p>
<p><b>Uber drivers demand PPE and compensation for time spent sanitizing vehicles</b></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Bidar411/status/1362119559403040768"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber drivers shut down Market Street</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outside of Uber’s San Francisco headquarters to demand the company provide them with enough personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also want to be compensated for time spent sanitizing vehicles in order to keep themselves and riders safe. </span></p>
<p><b>Uber lobbies in the EU for Prop 22-like legislation and loses key battle in the U.K.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, over in the EU, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is lobbying for Prop 22-like standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a white paper, Uber proposed a “new standard” for platform work, where it outlines the need to offer some benefits to workers while simultaneously steering away from the possibility of collective bargaining among workers. From TC’s Natasha Lomas:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A universal standard for platform benefits may sound progressive, but the notion of “relevant” benefits for gig workers risks fixing this labor force to a floor far below agreed standards for employment — closing off any chance of a better deal for a class of workers who are subject to persistent, algorithmic management.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>In the UK, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">the Supreme Court ruled</a> Uber drivers are employees and therefore entiteld to minimum wage and holiday pay. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">Also from Lomas</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The case, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/uber-loses-employment-tribunal-in-the-uk/">dates back to 2016</a>, has major ramifications for Uber’s business model (and other gig economy platforms) in the U.K. — and likely regionally, as similar employment rights challenges are ongoing in European courts.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>DoorDash drivers are banding together to decline low-paying orders</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strategy, </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3anwdy/organized-doordash-drivers-declinenow-strategy-is-driving-up-their-pay"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported on Vice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is designed to beef up the base pay for drivers by working together to game the system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Vice:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundamental principles of the official #DECLINENOW movement rely upon all drivers in the movement to exercise their right to use the decline button to decline lowball offers for higher, more feasible ones,” reads a pinned post on the main Facebook group. “Declining lowball offers forces the algorithm to raise the base pay UP on the declined offer for the next driver as the need for DoorDash to service the order increases. In turn, Dashers will see an increase in higher paying offers, many times doing less deliveries for more money and a much higher paying ‘Per mile rate.’”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Turning jobs into gig work</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-17/gig-economy-coming-for-millions-of-u-s-jobs-after-california-s-uber-lyft-vote?sref=gni836kR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg had a really good feature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how the tech industry’s gig economy is impacting workers in other industries. It’s a must-read, but here&#8217;s a snippet:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Companies in a range of industries could use the Prop 22 model to undermine or eliminate employment protections. A week after the election, Shawn Carolan, a partner at early Uber investor <a title="Menlo Ventures Management, L.P." href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/17873Z:US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Menlo Ventures</a>, wrote an <a title="What Proposition 22 Now Makes Possible" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/what-proposition-22-now-makes-possible" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">op-ed</a> heralding the potential to spread Prop 22’s vision of work “from agriculture to zookeeping,” including to “nursing, executive assistance, tutoring, programming, restaurant work and design.”</p></blockquote>
<p><b>President Biden </b><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/17/president-biden-announces-key-nomination-on-jobs-team/"><b>nominates Jennifer Abruzzo</b></a><b> to lead NLRB as general counsel</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abruzzo is currently the special counsel for strategic initiatives for the Communications Workers of America. For those unfamiliar, CWA has been making a name for itself in the tech industry by helping tech companies like Glitch and Alphabet unionize. Her appointment could prove to be quite beneficial for tech workers and gig workers alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, CWA President Chris Shelton said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no one who has a more thorough grasp of the National Labor Relations Board and the purpose of the National Labor Relations Act than Jennifer Abruzzo. She is a brilliant attorney who understands how the actions of the NLRB impact the daily lives of people at their workplaces. President Biden’s selection of Jennifer as the NLRB General Counsel shows that under his watch, issues affecting working people will be handled by people like Jennifer who have dedicated their lives to helping workers &#8212; and not union busters like we saw during the Trump administration. We hope Jennifer’s confirmation process is speedy &#8212; working people need her at the helm of the NLRB now more than ever.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Instacart at odds with workers again</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has reportedly suspended workers’ accounts for cancelling orders. </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8987/instacart-temporary-account-suspension-gig-workers-cancel-order"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Vice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these workers said they had good reason to cancel some of these orders, citing things like fears of safety and someone providing the wrong address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instacart, however, said it’s part of a fraud prevention policy that places accounts on pause if they suspect fraudulent or suspicious activity. </span></p>
<h3>Stay woke</h3>
<p><b>Twitter commits to increasing diversity at leadership level</b></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/d_lux_brand/status/1362514935721250816"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter has committed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Silicon Valley Leadership’s Group 25&#215;25 pledge, which challenges companies to do one of two things:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either make underrepresented employees 25% of its leadership team by 2025</span></li>
<li>Or increase the number of underrepresented people in leadership positions by 25% by 2025</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Twitter’s leadership team is just 6.5% Black, 3.9% Latinx, 2.8% multiracial and less than one percent Indigenous, </span><a href="https://careers.twitter.com/en/tweep-life/diversity.html#item2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to its most recent diversity report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Examining the “pipeline problem”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned last week, I had the pleasure of chatting with Dr. Joy Lisi Rankin, a researcher at AI Now, about her research pertaining to the pipeline problem myth in tech. The story also features some insight from Uber Chief Diversity Officer Bo Young Lee, as well as Paradigm Director Courri Brady.</span></p>

<p>Kelly Ellis, a now-former principal engineer at Mailchimp, left her job earlier this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/meganrosedickey/status/1362159686179454979">alleging she was paid less than her male counterparts</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/justkelly_ok/status/1362533370975019008/photo/1">In an email to employees</a>, a higher-up at Mailchimp said the company &#8220;thoroughly and independently investigated the allegations and found them to be unsubstantiated.&#8221;</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Glassdoor lets you filter ratings by demographics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite efforts from companies to create equitable environments, it’s clear that employees of certain demographics, like Black women, sometimes have very different experiences from their counterparts. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/glassdoor-now-lets-you-filter-company-reviews-by-demographics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glassdoor aims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to better surface those experiences through a new feature that allows folks to filter ratings by demographics.</span></p>

This round makes Promise founder Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins one of a handful of Black women who has raised more than $1 million.</p>
<p><strong>Hey, Google&#8230;WTF?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/google-fires-top-ai-ethics-researcher-margaret-mitchell/">Google fired Margaret Mitchell</a>, the founder and former co-lead of the company&#8217;s ethical AI team. Mitchell announced the news <a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1362885356127801345">via a tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Google confirmed Mitchell&#8217;s firing in a statement to TechCrunch, Google said:</p>
<blockquote><p>After conducting a review of this manager’s conduct, we confirmed that there were multiple violations of our code of conduct, as well as of our security policies, which included the exfiltration of confidential business-sensitive documents and private data of other employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>News of Mitchell&#8217;s firing came shortly after Google internally announced the results of its investigation of Gebru&#8217;s exit, <a href="https://www.axios.com/google-tweaks-diversity-research-policies-following-inquiry-8baa6346-d2a2-456f-9743-7912e4659ca2.html">according to Axios</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</p>
<h2>Can data fix healthcare?</h2>
<p>Not alone, but you might be able to make a lot of progress with the right data in the right hands. And that’s precisely what the startup we’re talking about today is up to.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Exchange caught up with <a href="https://twitter.com/tmyerson">Terry Myerson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lisagurry">Lisa Gurry</a> this week, the CEO and CMO of <a href="https://truveta.com/">Truveta</a>, a young company that wants to collect oodles of data from healthcare providers, anonymize it, aggregate it and make it available to third parties for research.</p>
<p>It’s a big task, but the team behind Truveta has experience with big projects. Myerson is best known for his time one-rung below the top of the Microsoft org chart, where he ran things you might have heard of, like Windows. Gurry was a leader inside that org, most recently working on strategy for the Microsoft Store product.</p>
<p>But now they are at a healthtech data company. How did that come to be? After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/29/terry-myerson-evp-of-windows-and-devices-is-leaving-microsoft-prompting-a-big-ai-azure-and-devices-reorganization/">Myerson left Microsoft</a> he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/ex-windows-evp-terry-myerson-joins-madrona-venture-and-the-carlyle-group/">worked with Madrona</a>, the Seattle-area venture capital firm, and the Carlyle Group, a huge investing group with a taste for private equity. A few years later, several former Microsoft co-workers of Myerson had wound up at Providence, a healthcare giant. They reached out to Myerson around when COVID-19 was first locking down the United States. The former Microsoft exec agreed to take part in a few calls, but didn’t formally join them as he was stuck at home.</p>
<p>During that time he learned that Providence had put together a white paper concerning the idea that Truveta would become, that by collecting data from healthcare providers a dataset of sufficient size and diversity could be compiled to allow research of all sorts to leverage it. Myerson got stuck on the concept, later founding the company. Then he called up some former colleagues, including Gurry, to help him build it.</p>
<p>Truveta has around 50 people today and will scale to around 100 this year, Myerson said.</p>
<p>Questions abound in your head, I’m sure. Things are still early at Truveta, but the <a href="https://truveta.com/blog/creating-truveta-to-save-lives-with-data">company announced last week</a> that it has signed up 14 healthcare providers to help with its data goals. Those firms are also investors in the company (Myerson put in capital in as well).</p>
<p>I was curious about the company’s business plan. Per Myerson, Truveta will charge different rates depending on who wants to access its data. As you can imagine, commercial entities will pay a different price than an independent researcher.</p>
<p>Next for Truveta is getting more data, locking down its internal data schema, collecting feedback from researchers and, later, approaching commercial access.</p>
<p>Healthcare in America is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/12/07/568948782/black-mothers-keep-dying-after-giving-birth-shalon-irvings-story-explains-why">inequitable</a> &#8212; something that the pair of Truveta executives stressed during our call &#8212; thus giving the company a huge market to improve and make less racist and sexist.</p>
<p>It was a bit odd to talk to Myerson and Gurry about their startup. In the past I’d chatted with them about some of Microsoft’s largest platforms. Let’s see how fast they can transform Truveta from an idea I can’t help but dig, to a company that is a viable commercial concern. And then how big they can grow it.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>A lot has happened in the past few days that we couldn’t get to. Adyen’s <a href="https://www.adyen.com/investor-relations/h2-2020">earnings</a>, for example. The European payments platform reported H2 revenues of €379.4 million, up 28% compared to the year ago half-year. And from that it reported EBITDA of €236.8 million. Who said fintech can’t be profitable? (Note: Adyen’s results are required reading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/paying-115b-for-stripe-or-77b-for-coinbase-might-be-quite-rational/">if you care about Stripe’s valuation and future public offering</a>.)</p>
<p>And there were some rounds that also fell through our fingers. Investments like <a href="https://www.cloudtalk.io/">CloudTalk’s</a> recent $7.3 million Series A. The Slovakia-based startup previously raised a $1.6 million seed round in 2019. The startup, as its name suggests, offers cloud telephony services to call centers.</p>
<p>We suspected that CloudTalk probably had a pretty good year in 2020 thanks to global growth in remote work. It did. In an email, CloudTalk said that it has not seen “Zoom-like [growth] figures” but that in 2020 demand for its services “exceeded [its] expectations.” That helps explain its latest round.</p>
<p>The Exchange was also curious if the company had a perspective on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">subscription pricing versus consumption pricing</a>, a rising topic amongst software dorks such as myself (more to come on this next week with notes from Appian, Fastly and others). Per the company, CloudTalk charges “for both seats and for usage,” making it a hybrid company from a pricing perspective. CloudTalk called its pricing setup “a good balance for both parties because customers like to know what they are going to be paying ahead of time.”</p>
<p>It’s a startup to keep in mind. As is <a href="https://zolve.com/">Zolve</a>, a globally themed neobank with a focus on helping expats have a working financial world. I couldn’t get to it, but TechCrunch wrote it up. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/zolve-raises-15-million-for-its-cross-border-neobank-aimed-at-global-citizens/?tpcc=ECTW2020">More here</a>.</p>
<p>And in case you didn’t have time to watch television during work the last few days let’s talk about Robinhood. Which enjoyed a Congressional hearing this week that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/robinhood-goes-to-congress/">was mostly dull</a> apart from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/a-fraction-of-robinhoods-users-are-driving-its-runaway-growth/">some notes on the fintech giant’s business model</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, it was a busy week for crowded startup niches. There was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/ally-io-rasies-50m-series-c-as-the-okr-software-market-stays-explosive/">more money for OKR startups</a>, leading to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/with-software-markets-getting-bigger-will-more-vcs-bet-on-competing-startups/">our question about VCs putting capital into related companies</a> in the future. Public also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/">raised several hundred million dollars</a>. Because why not. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/low-code-focused-outsystems-raises-150m-at-a-9-5b-valuation/">low-code player OutSystems raised $150 million</a> to round out the group. It was one hell of a week.</p>
<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>
<p>I will leave you with a few data points. First, that Clubhouse’s metrics are <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/mobile-minute/clubhouse-social-audio-apps-rise/">finally starting to match the hype around the product</a>. People are showing up in droves, pushing its total download figures <a href="https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1362843741975965697">over the 10 million mark</a>.</p>
<p>And in news that I missed, <a href="https://twitter.com/simonowens/status/1357447879191900160">Substack crossed the 500,000 subscriber mark</a>. That’s impressive!</p>
<p>And to close, a Chicago-based, home-focused insurtech startup called <a href="https://www.kin.com/">Kin</a> crossed the $10 billion “total insured property value” mark <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/kin_insurance_eclipses_10_billion_in_total_insured_property_value/prweb17726313.htm">this week</a>. The Exchange reached out, asking the company about its economics. After all it’s not hard to run up premium volume if you are selling dollars for 50-cent pieces.</p>
<p>Ruth Awad from the company responded that her company’s “ loss rate is 53% and our gross margins are 32%.” Not bad at all. Given how quickly insurtech has gone from experiment to public-success, Kin is a company to keep tabs on.</p>
<p>Wrapping, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3imV0hhAWp4YQGP9gdm8xe?si=r0H--h4lShO6YI0RJNlfDQ">please make sure</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0X3K3claSyeXDyJO6tpRrq?si=NvvU86ChRjiuFIj-9dwfPQ">to support your</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3cCcSqkue17ytuyRyuq96i?si=2r6pjM3vQieRU3XeK8WzXQ">local heavy metal</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1tVdUeleLeYW16TjhzokpX?si=eCqbdL3PTiqsOcie7ENHHQ">band this weekend</a>,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">After garnering an estimated 8 million downloads since its launch</a>, Clubhouse’s popularity continues across the world and even outside of its original tech-focused seed community.</p>
<p>The latest news comes from East Asia, where <a href="https://news.joins.com/article/23996348">Korean media reported this morning</a> that the country’s current prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, has officially joined the social audio app under the username @gyunvely, making him among the most senior political leaders worldwide to join the burgeoning app. His account was created on Valentine’s Day (February 14th) and was “nominated” by a user using the name of TJ Park (Clubhouse does not have verified profiles).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115664" style="width: 623px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115664" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2115664" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png?w=613" alt="" width="613" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png?resize=270,300 270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png?resize=768,852 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png?resize=613,680 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115664" class="wp-caption-text">South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun on Clubhouse this weekend. Screenshot by Danny Crichton.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far, the prime minister has garnered slightly fewer than 500 followers and is following a bit fewer than 200 accounts, perhaps indicating the app’s current reach in one of the world’s most mobile and connected digital economies. His Clubhouse bio reads “노란잠바 그 아저씨” or “That Yellow Jacket Guy,” a reference to the Korean civil defense uniform worn by <a href="https://1boon.kakao.com/subusunews/5e6b4871dc055229a8af34f4">politicians in times of crisis</a> (such as throughout the COVID-19 pandemic) and which currently serves — in cartoon form — as Chung’s profile picture.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115666" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115666" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2115666" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="465" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg?resize=768,525 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg?resize=680,465 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115666" class="wp-caption-text">South Korean politicians often wear yellow civil defense uniforms in times of national crisis. Photo by South Korean Presidential Blue House via Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>According to local media reports, Chung spoke in a Clubhouse room for over an hour with fellow Democratic Party of Korea member Jung Cheong-rae. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/peopleinside2012/posts/5938105316215743">In a public Facebook post yesterday</a>, the prime minister said that “I heard this [app] is ‘hot’ these days so I tried it as a nighttime walk.”</p>
<p>He further said “I was a little startled by the unexpected questions and reactions but the new experience was enjoyable. I think I’ll participate from time to time in the future.” Elaborating, he said “the fact that it’s audio-only and everyone can have a conversation without reserve made me think that it’s a better communication tool than any other social media platforms, especially since currently we’re living in the age of non-face-to-face communication.”</p>
<p>Discussions in the Clubhouse room included questions asking whether it was really him, to more bread-and-butter policy issues like the high price of real estate and physical abuse in the sports world, which has dominated headlines in recent weeks in local media.</p>
<p>While Clubhouse has become something of a fixture for techies and every form of hustle culture connoisseur imaginable, the app has increasingly made forays into politics that are hardly unknown to other social networks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/miami-mayor-woos-techies-what-does-he-need-to-succeed/">Miami’s mayor Francis Suarez has been on Clubhouse</a> to sell his city’s potential for the tech industry. San Francisco district attorney Chesa Boudin <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/culture/article/On-Clubhouse-a-conversation-about-the-future-15886586.php">joined a “debate” on the platform about the future of SF</a>, while NYC mayoral aspirant and all around UBI nerd <a href="https://twitter.com/jonchilou/status/1360795727434293250?s=20">Andrew Yang joined a discussion about</a> … himself. Meanwhile, Bitcoin aficionado and itinerant Tesla leader <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/14/business/elon-musk-vladmir-putin-clubhouse/index.html">Elon Musk has even proposed bringing Vladimir Putin</a> onto Clubhouse for a live fireside chat.</p>
<p>Yet, as the platform expands globally, the challenges to its open and free-wheeling if somewhat moderated conversations are coming under closer scrutiny. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/clubhouse-is-now-blocked-in-china-after-a-brief-uncensored-period/">China has now blocked Clubhouse</a> within its borders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/will-the-clubhouse-model-work-in-china/">after a brief period of uncensored conversation</a>.</p>

<p>Community isn’t a single Slack group or event or newsletter. It’s an aggregation of all of these touch points, and includes both customers, eventual customers and one-time users. Despite this nebulous, disconnected reality, companies are paying more attention to various channels as remote work and digital communication powers our days. <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1361745447216316419">My recent tweet underscored</a> the chord community strikes even in sectors such as edtech, which often have to sell to fragmented customer bases.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&mdash; natasha (@nmasc_) <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1361745447216316419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A conversation that I’ve been having over the last week is that startups are finally investing in community in a meaningful way, dedicating actual budgets to community instead of simply stealing a few dollars away from the sales and marketing team.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregisenberg">As one founder told me</a>, “chief community officer is the new CMO.” That piqued my interest, especially because I had just talked to Commsor founder Mac Reddin about his recent funding, a $16 million Series A led by Felicis and Seven Seven Six Ventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/4-creator-economy-vcs-see-startup-opportunities-in-monetization-discovery-and-much-more/">As the ‘aha’ moment of community continues</a>, Commsor is a solution to help community managers prove that they’re not wasting the budget, and outcomes. Commsor, he says, is the operating system for communities, helping companies distill how their different communities look, and feel, which could eventually trickle down into generating sales leads and revenue. Commsor could pull an insight like, ‘here are three engineers that are using your platform from Google, maybe it’s time to approach Google and ask if they want an enterprise contract.” Finding those sweet spots, and bottoms-up community adopters, is Commsor’s bread and butter.</p>
<p>Commsor, which is still in private beta, says that over the last year there has been a “huge increase” in startups that have a community budget or increase in community budget. To be a startup aiming to disrupt a category that still has a tone of gray in it comes with its own challenges.</p>
<p>Commsor launched C School to help aspiring community managers learn the trade, as well as a fund to back companies in the space. It also posted a memo with signatures from companies like Hopin, Lattice and Notion to show the commitment to defining the community space.</p>
<p>“We are kind of what Customer Success was 10 years ago, or what Revenue Operations was 300 years ago,” Reddin said. “People care about it and there are roles, but there’s still a lot of defining and growth to be done.”</p>

<h2><strong>Will your investor put money into a competitor? </strong></h2>
<p>When an investor backs a startup, they ideally think that the company will be the winner in said category, whether it’s CBD gummies, financial plumbing or peer-to-peer car-sharing. So, if they place a bet in a competing startup the investment could serve as both a negative signal and a reputation hit.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know, via Alex Wilhelm: </strong>As software markets mature, maybe the investing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/with-software-markets-getting-bigger-will-more-vcs-bet-on-competing-startups/">playing field is opening up to investing in competitors</a>? Call it conveniently complementary investments.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/a16z-doesnt-invest-it-manifests/">In this week’s Equity episode</a>, we talked about the complexity of competition within startups, and how one firm’s investments seem to all perfectly and conveniently fit into each other. I’ll make you listen to the episode to figure out who, but here’s a hint: Is there a world where Dispo creators track monetization from Clubhouse through Stir?</p>

<h2><strong>An Olive startup competes with Amazon </strong></h2>
<p>Ambitious early-stage founders often have to answer a common question from investors and journalists: What if Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google built your startup? The idea behind the question is figuring out why a founder is specifically and uniquely qualified to solve a problem, even if a behemoth business throws millions of dollars and a team of engineers at it.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know via Jet co-founder Nate Faust</strong>: He sold his business to Walmart for $3 billion in 2016, and now he’s back to compete with Amazon<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/olive-launch/ "> with a sustainable e-commerce play</a>. Olive consolidates a shopper’s purchases into a single weekly delivery in a reusable package.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Faust acknowledged that Olive runs counter to the “arms race” between Amazon and other e-commerce services working to deliver purchases as quickly as possible. But he said that the startup’s consumer surveys found that shoppers were willing to wait a little longer in order to get the other benefits.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> If you were wondering when it makes sense to compete with Zoom, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/">these four edtech startups</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/google-to-roll-out-slate-of-over-50-updates-for-classroom-meet-and-other-online-education-tools/ "> Google</a> might have some information for you.</p>

<h2><strong>Bust the myth of the pipeline problem </strong></h2>
<p>The lack of diversity in Silicon Valley, from the check-writers to the employees, has often been chalked up to the pipeline problem: the idea that there isn’t enough enough diverse, qualified talent to fill roles. But <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/ ">recent research</a> underscores how aged, and flawed, this mindset might be. Reporter <strong>Megan Rose Dickey </strong>interviewed <strong>Dr. Joy Lisi Rankin</strong>, a research lead for gender, race and power in artificial intelligence at the AI Now Institute.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/ ">Here’s what to know</a>, according to Rankin: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“The pipeline is a way to silo all of that out and say, ‘we just need to get more Black women in tech,’ as opposed to saying, ‘actually, these companies are and have been racist and white supremacist and misogynist, and it’s those institutions and larger societal and global capitalist structures that need to change.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Rankin adds that transparency around hiring and corporate recruiting could help combat biases and signal important information to talent.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/announcing-the-agenda-for-techcrunch-sessions-justice/">TC Sessions: Justice</a> next month, we’ll be talking about how research like this, as well as structures within venture capital, impacts early-stage founders.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Your enjoyment of &#8220;Ted Lasso&#8221; — a sports comedy that debuted on Apple TV+ last year — will probably depend on how you respond to the titular football coach played by Jason Sudeikis.</p>
<p>As we discuss on the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, the show&#8217;s setup is deliberately over-the-top and ridiculous with Rebecca Walton (Hannah Waddingham) taking ownership of the AFC Richmond football (a.k.a. soccer) team after an acrimonious divorce, then recruiting American football coach Ted Lasso as its new manager, despite his complete ignorance of the game.</p>
<p>Anthony and Jordan found Ted to be charming, and they enjoyed the show&#8217;s fish-out-water comedy. Anthony also appreciated some of the more emotional moments later in the season — he&#8217;s an easy crier, and &#8220;Ted Lasso&#8221; definitely made him a little teary-eyed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Darrell, however, had considerably less patience for the character&#8217;s blithe naiveté, comparing it to the similar cluelessness of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/17/original-content-emily-in-paris/">Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Emily in Paris,&#8221;</a> and he gave up on the show quickly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week, we&#8217;ve got a first look at one of TikTok&#8217;s early e-commerce tests, which involves a program for sellers involving product anchors on videos and the option for affiliate sales. We&#8217;re also digging into the new iOS and Android betas, the FTC complaint against math app Prodigy and more.</p>

<h3>TikTok tests a new e-commerce experience in Indonesia</h3>
<p>The Financial Times recently <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/629c1c17-3daa-46af-8177-1814baaa2bed">reported</a> TikTok was preparing to launch a range of new e-commerce experiences in 2021, including the ability for creators to share links to products, support for affiliate sales, and even livestreamed shopping. Now, we&#8217;ve got a first look at some of the live tests around e-commerce that TikTok has in progress.</p>
<p>The company recently launched a &#8220;<a href="https://seller-id.tiktok.com/university/home">Seller University</a>&#8221; website aimed at its Indonesian audience, where it details how brands can advertise their products on video. Here, TikTok explains brands have two ways to advertise, either by making their own videos or by working with affiliates.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you choose to sell through your personal page, you can then display products via livestreaming or short videos, with product anchors embedded in your content. When customers view your content, they can be redirected to the corresponding product detail page by clicking on the product anchor,&#8221; the site explains.</p>
<p>The Seller University also details other information, like how to sign up to be a TikTok seller and what sort of products are prohibited, along with other rules and guidelines.</p>

<p>TikTok Sellers have to provide their contact information, including location, phone, email, shop and warehouse location, and other required documentation to be approved. They can then set up a Seller profile, where they can manage other users associated with their account. Once live as a Seller on the app, they&#8217;ll have a &#8220;TikTok Shop&#8221; on the second tab on their profile, which users can view when they visit the page.</p>
<p>When their videos showing their products are viewed, there are &#8220;product anchors&#8221; embedded in the content. Clicking on these anchors will redirect the viewer to the product detail page where they can transact. In addition, brands can collaborate with TikTok influencers to promote their products through a new &#8220;TikTok Affiliate&#8221; program.</p>

<p>TikTok told TechCrunch the program is a test of its e-commerce solutions in Indonesia, and one of several product tests in the area of e-commerce.</p>
<h3>Consumer advocacy groups file FTC complaint against edtech app Prodigy</h3>
<p>A coalition of 20 consumer advocacy groups, led by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, have filed an FTC complaint against the popular edtech app Prodigy, which offers a math learning app for web and mobile. The app is designed much like modern-day freemium games, with math &#8220;battles&#8221; designed to improve math skills, grades and test scores.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges a variety of abuses, including how it aggressively pushes kids using the free version provided to schools to nag parents for the paid $59 annual subscription, which includes a richer gaming experience.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2115505" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="494" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg 1140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=768,558 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=680,494 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The groups also take issue with the app&#8217;s in-app rewards and badges &#8212; some of which are only available to paid users, including fancier loot boxes &#8212; saying these features cause division between those who pay and those who can&#8217;t. And it alleges that Prodigy&#8217;s claims about educational improvements don&#8217;t hold merit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2115507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="442" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg 1204w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>In response, Prodigy says it takes the concerns seriously, but over 95% of users play the game for free and the business model involving the paid membership is how free access is provided.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without this model, we would be required to put all of our educational content behind a paywall, which contradicts our mission of providing full access to fun and engaging math learning,&#8221; a company spokesperson said. &#8220;The alternative would be to generate revenue via advertising, which is not a model we believe best benefits or protects our users. We never show third-party ads on our platform, nor do we sell or lease any other user information to third parties,&#8221; they noted.</p>
<p>The FTC has stepped up its enforcement over how apps targeting children can behave, with a focus on data collection practices and COPPA violations, which has resulted in fines for apps like TikTok and YouTube. This complaint, however, is not about children&#8217;s privacy, but rather how they&#8217;re being marketed to via edtech.</p>

<p>Robinhood&#8217;s CEO Vlad Tenev <a href="https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/robinhood-gamestop-reddit-hearing-congress/">testified before Congress</a> this week over the GameStop frenzy.

AOC pointed out that Robinhood isn&#8217;t truly free, it&#8217;s just hiding the cost from retail investors by subsidizing free trades with payment for order flow. (A percentage of its revenue Tenev ridiculously claimed he couldn&#8217;t recall, saying only &#8220;it&#8217;s over 50%.&#8221;)</p>

Dispo&#8217;s gimmick is that users have to wait 24 hours to see the photos they snap.</p>

<p>The updated version of <a href="https://www.zillow.com/z/3d-home/">Zillow&#8217;s 3D Home app</a> introduced new technology that combines into one interface 3D Home tours, listing photos and AI-generated floor plans. To create the floor plans and home tour, the app uses computer vision and machine learning on panoramic photos the agent or photographer captured using the app and a 360-degree camera. The app also leverages AI to predict things like room dimensions and square footage. Both the home tour and floor plan can then be automatically uploaded to the lists and added to a website, MLS or shared on email/social media.</p>
<p>Due to the pandemic, <span class="il">Zillow</span> 3D Home tours published on for-sale listings increased 255% during 2020 as customers used it as a safer way to tour properties, the company also noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another week and the biggest story in a sea of big stories continues to center on SPACs, these blank-check companies that raise capital through IPOs expressly to acquire a privately held company and take it public. But some industry watchers as starting to wonder: Is the party just getting started, with more early guests still trickling in? Have we reached the party&#8217;s peak, with the music still thumping? Or did someone just quietly barf in the corner, an indicator it&#8217;s time to wrap things up before something worse happens?</p>
<p>It certainly feels like things are in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-spac-boom-visualized-in-one-chart-11612962000">full swing</a>. Just today, B Capital, the venture firm cofounded by Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1844740/000114036121005525/nt10020541x1_s1.htm">registered plans</a> to raise a $300 million SPAC. Mike Cagney, the fintech entrepreneur who founded SoFI and more recently founded Figure, a fintech company in both the home equity and blockchain space, raised <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/77969/Fintech-SPAC-Figure-Acquisition-I-prices-$250-million-IPO;-led-by-former-So">$250 million</a> for his SPAC. Even Michael Dell has made the leap, with his family office registering plans this afternoon to raise a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-msd-capital-ipo/blank-check-firm-led-by-ex-goldman-banker-aims-for-500-million-ipo-idUSKBN2AJ2LC">$500 million</a> blank-check company.</p>
<p>Altogether, according to Renaissance Capital, 16 blank-check companies raised $3.4 billion this week, and new filers continue to flood into the IPO pipeline, with <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/78016/US-IPO-Weekly-Recap-The-IPO-market-takes-its-annual-February-break-in-a-1-I">45 SPACs</a> submitting initial filings this week (compared with 10 traditional IPO filings). Perhaps it’s no wonder that we’re starting to see headlines like one in Yahoo News just yesterday titled, &#8220;<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/why-some-spac-investors-may-get-burned-192802863.html">Why some SPAC investors may get burned.&#8221;</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Interestingly, such headlines could gum up the SPAC machine. So argues Ivana Naumovska, an assistant professor at INSEAD, in a new Harvard Business Review piece titled, “<a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/the-spac-bubble-is-about-to-burst">The SPAC Bubble is About to Burst</a>.”</p>
<p>Naumovska points to research showing that when more people adopt a practice, it will become increasingly widespread due to growing awareness and legitimacy. Yet when it comes to something that’s more controversial &#8212; which it could be argued that SPACs are &#8212; outsider concern and skepticism also grows as the practice becomes more widely used. Thus are born headlines like that one in Yahoo Finance.</p>
<p>Naumovska has studied this phenomenon before, focusing on earlier reverse mergers that, as she notes, &#8220;surged in the mid-2000s, outnumbering IPOs in some years, and peaked in 2010, before falling off a cliff in 2011.&#8221; She says she and fellow researchers collected a plethora of data on the use of reverse mergers and market responses to them, including how the media evaluated such vehicles. Of the 267 articles published between 2001 and 2012, she says, 6 were positive, 148 were neutral, 113 were negative.</p>
<p>Notably and unsurprisingly, the negative articles grew as the number of reverse merger transactions involving firms with relatively low reputations increased. And as the media picked up on these companies, so did regulators, and with investors, regulators, and the media feeding off one another’s signals, the party came to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, most of the coverage around SPACs right now remains <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/is-anything-too-big-to-be-spacd/">neutral</a>. If business reporters are privately skeptical of SPACs, they are reserving judgment, possibly because save for some highly concerning cases &#8212;  like when the electric truck startup Nikola was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/business/nikola-trevor-milton-resigns.html">accused of fraud</a> &#8212; there isn’t much to criticize yet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to judge many of the SPACs raised over the last six months, as they have yet to announce their targets (SPACS have two years from the time they raise funds to zero in on a target, or else give back their IPO proceeds).</p>
<p>The argument that most investors have for creating a SPAC &#8212; which is that a lot of so-called unicorn companies are ready to be publicly traded &#8212; resonates, too, given how <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2020/02/26/why-more-businesses-are-choosing-to-stay-private/?sh=18f56c706400">bloated</a> the private market has become.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, some of the merger deals that critics have long expected would begin to unravel have not, like Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company that kicked off SPAC mania when it went public in the <a href="https://www.space.com/virgin-galactic-goes-public-nyse-stock-exchange.html">fall of 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Branson founded the company in 2004 in order to fly passengers on suborbital spaceflights, but even after putting off plans yet again to attempt a rocket-powered flight to suborbital space last week, its shares &#8212; which have more than doubled since January&#8211; remain in the figurative stratosphere. (The company, which reported almost no revenue last year, is currently valued at $12 billion.)</p>
<p>Other offerings haven&#8217;t gone quite as smoothly. Clover Health, a health insurance company that, like Virgin Galactic, was taken public via a SPAC organized by famed investor Chamath Palihapitiya, is &#8220;facing a confluence of existential threats&#8221; to its business, as observed in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2021/02/17/billionaire-clover-health-ceo-vivek-garipallis-expletive-ridden-tirade/?sh=56a63464140a">deep dive</a> by Forbes.</p>
<p>Among others poking into its business practices are the The Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the short-seller Hindenburg Research, which has accused it of making misleading claims. (Clover has rebutted the allegations, but Forbes says it is still facing at least three class-action lawsuits over its failure to disclose ahead of its IPO that the DOJ was investigating the company.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get it,&#8221; said skeptic Steve Jurvetson last month in conversation with this editor of the SPAC frenzy. The veteran venture capitalist, who sits on the board of SpaceX, said there are &#8220;some good companies [being taken public]. Don&#8217;t get me wrong; they aren&#8217;t all fraudulent.&#8221; But many are &#8220;early-stage venture companies,&#8221; he noted, &#8220;and they don&#8217;t need to meet the forecasting requirements that the SEC normally requires of an IPO, so [SPAC sponsors are] specifically looking for companies that don&#8217;t have any operating numbers to show [because they] can make any forecasts they want . . .That&#8217;s the whole racket.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Evd4PI0mQn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/a-deep-dive-on-steve-jurvetson-and-maryanna-saenkos-200-million-new-fund/">Steve Jurvetson and Maryanna Saenko on their new fund, SPACs and the great tech exodus</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Steve Jurvetson and Maryanna Saenko on their new fund, SPACs and the great tech exodus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/a-deep-dive-on-steve-jurvetson-and-maryanna-saenkos-200-million-new-fund/embed/#?secret=Evd4PI0mQn" data-secret="Evd4PI0mQn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>If others agree with Jurvetson, they hesitate to say so publicly. For one thing, plenty of VCs would be happy to see their portfolio companies taken public however possible, including via SPAC. Others who haven&#8217;t formed SPACs of their own are reserving the right to consider them down the road.</p>
<p>Ed Sim of Boldstart Ventures in New York is one of few VCs in recent months to say outright, when asked, that his firm isn&#8217;t considering raising a SPAC any time soon. &#8220;<a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/7976041">I have zero interest in that honestly</a>,&#8221; says Sim. &#8220;You can come back to me if you see my name or Boldstart [affiliated] with a SPAC two years from now,&#8221; he adds, laughing.</p>
<p>Many more investors stress that when it comes to SPACs, it&#8217;s all about who is sponsoring what. Among them is Kevin Mayer, the former Disney exec and, briefly, the CEO of the social network TikTok. In a call yesterday, Mayer advanced the idea that there are &#8220;many fewer public companies now than there were 10 years ago, so there is a need for supplying another way to go public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayer has a vested interest in SPACs. Just yesterday, along with former Disney colleague Tom Staggs, he registered plans for a<a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/77960/TMT-focused-SPAC-Forest-Road-Acquisition-II-files-for-a-$300-million-IPO"> second SPAC, </a>after it was announced earlier this month that their <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/forest-road-spac-kevin-mayer-tom-staggs-buys-digital-fitness-group-beachbody-company-1234691065/">first SPAC</a> will be used to take public the digital fitness specialist Beachbody. But Mayer also argues that not every SPAC should be judged by the same yardstick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I think it&#8217;s overdone? Sure, everyone and their brother is now getting to a SPAC, so yeah, that does seem a bit ridiculous. But I think . . . the wheat will be separated from the chaff very, very soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may need to be if SPACs are to endure as a lasting way to pull privately held companies into the public markets.</p>
<p>While the mechanism has won over powerful adherents, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">working against SPACs are numbers that are starting to trickle in and that don&#8217;t look so great.</span></p>
<p>Last week, for example, Bloomberg Law shared its analysis of the companies that went public as a result of a merger with a SPAC dating back to Jan. 1, 2019 (and for which at least one month of post-merger performance data is available). In it, 14 out of 24 reported a depreciation in value as of one month following the completion of the merger, and one-third of the companies reported a year-to-date depreciation in value.</p>
<p>The number of securities lawsuits filed by SPAC stockholders post-merger is also on the rise, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-post-merger-spac-performance-is-mixed">noted the outlet</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Given the astonishing rate at which SPACs are now being formed anyway, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the question of whether the phenomenon is sustainable is one that more people are naturally </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/11/19/a-sober-look-at-spacs/">beginning to ask</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For her part, Professor Naumovska thinks she already knows the answer.</span></p>

<p><strong>The big story: Uber loses UK legal challenge</strong></p>
<p>The United Kingdom&#8217;s Supreme Court has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">reaffirmed earlier rulings</a> that the Uber drivers who brought the case — which dates back to 2016 — are workers, not independent contractors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Drivers are in a position of subordination and dependency in relation to Uber such that they have little or no ability to improve their economic position through professional or entrepreneurial skill,&#8221; the court said in a statement. &#8220;In practice the only way in which they can increase their earnings is by working longer hours while constantly meeting Uber’s measures of performance.”</p>
<p>Uber, while acknowledging the decision, emphasized that it applies to the specific group of drivers who brought the case, many of whom are no longer driving through the app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has fired Margaret Mitchell, the founder and former co-lead of the company&#8217;s ethical AI team. Mitchell announced the news <a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1362885356127801345">via a tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Google confirmed Mitchell&#8217;s firing in a statement to TechCrunch; Google said:</p>
<blockquote><p>After conducting a review of this manager’s conduct, we confirmed that there were multiple violations of our code of conduct, as well as of our security policies, which included the exfiltration of confidential business-sensitive documents and private data of other employees.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In January, Google revoked corporate access from AI ethicist Margaret Mitchell for reportedly using automated scripts to find examples of mistreatment of Dr. Timnit Gebru, <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-is-investigating-the-actions-of-another-top-ai-ethicist-50030739-ea3d-4ea2-b452-c228b4fc9773.html">according to Axios</a>. Gebru says she was fired from Google while Google has maintained that she resigned.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Mitchell <a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1357819673455202304">published</a> the email she said she sent to Google&#8217;s press team the day her corporate email access was cut off. The email spoke about Gebru&#8217;s firing and how it appeared to be &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">fueled by the same underpinnings of racism and sexism that our AI systems, when in the wrong hands, tend to soak up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Mitchell&#8217;s letter, which you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ERi2crDToYhYjEjxRoOzO-uOUeLgdoLPfnx1JOErg2w/edit">read in full here,</a> details the different ideas and structures at play that led to Dr. Gebru&#8217;s departure from Google. Mitchell argues what happened to Gebru &#8220;appears to stem from the same lack of foresight that is at the core of modern technology, and so itself serves as an example of the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mitchell adds:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firing seems to have been fueled by the same underpinnings of racism and sexism that our AI systems, when in the wrong hands, tend to soak up. How Dr. Gebru was fired is not okay, what was said about it is not okay, and the environment leading up to it was &#8212; and is &#8212; not okay. Every moment where </span><a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334352694664957952"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Dean and Megan Kacholia do not take responsibility for their actions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is another moment where the company as a whole stands by silently as if to intentionally send the horrifying message that Dr. Gebru deserves to be treated this way. Treated as if she were inferior to her peers. Caricatured as irrational (and worse). Her research writing publicly defined as below the bar.  Her scholarship publicly declared to be insufficient. For the record: Dr. Gebru has been treated completely inappropriately, with intense disrespect, and she deserves an apology. </span></p></blockquote>
<p>The letter went on to discuss the ethical artificial intelligence approach to developing technology, how Mitchell came to lead and then co-lead the ethical AI team with Gebru and what ultimately happened. Within the next year, Mitchell said she wanted &#8220;those of us in positions of privilege and power&#8221; to come to terms with &#8220;the discomfort of being part of an unjust system that devalued one of the world&#8217;s leading scientists, and keep something like this from ever happening again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mitchell&#8217;s firing comes shortly after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/google-has-a-new-responsible-ai-lead/">Google announced the appointment of Dr. Marian Croak</a> to lead its responsible artificial intelligence division. When we reached out to Google yesterday the company did not have a comment on Mitchell&#8217;s fate.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Google internally announced the results of its investigation of Gebru&#8217;s exit, <a href="https://www.axios.com/google-tweaks-diversity-research-policies-following-inquiry-8baa6346-d2a2-456f-9743-7912e4659ca2.html">according to Axios</a>. The company did not reveal what it found, but said it would implement some new policies to enhance diversity and inclusion at Google.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Mitchell and will update this story if we hear back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since the pandemic began, have you been walking more, or do you know someone who bought a new car? Perhaps you ran your first errand on a rented e-bike or scooter?</p>
<p>Over the last year, I&#8217;ve experimented with different mobility options to see which ones best suit my needs, as have most people I know. It can be challenging to maintain a recommended physical distance on a bus or subway. (After a decade-plus hiatus, I even briefly considered rejoining the ranks of automobile owners!)</p>

<hr />
<p>It took some getting used to, but I now enjoy traveling around San Francisco on a scooter or e-bike. Pre-pandemic, I was leery of riding two-wheeled vehicles in a city with a high rate of injury collisions, but there are fewer cars on the road than there used to be.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has spotlighted many of the weakest points in our transportation system, but some of the rapid shifts in consumer behavior are creating opportunities for tech once considered fanciful, like sidewalk delivery robots and eVTOLs (electric vertical and takeoff vehicles).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility/">Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec reached out to 10 investors</a> to learn more &#8220;about the state of mobility, which trends they’re most excited about and what they’re looking for in their next investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s who she interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clara Brenner, co-founder and managing partner, Urban Innovation Fund</li>
<li>Shawn Carolan, partner, Menlo Ventures</li>
<li>Dave Clark, partner, Expa</li>
<li>Abhijit Ganguly, senior manager, Goodyear Ventures</li>
<li>Rachel Holt, co-founder and general partner, Construct Capital</li>
<li>David Lawee, founder and general partner, CapitalG</li>
<li>Sasha Ostojic, operating partner, Playground Global</li>
<li>Sebastian Peck, managing director, InMotion Ventures</li>
<li>Natalia Quintero and Rachel Haot, Transit Innovation Partnership/Transit Tech Lab</li>
</ul>

<p>Yesterday&#8217;s House Financial Services Committee hearing on the GameStop short squeeze saga was fairly typical: Most lawmakers used their time to grandstand and little new information was revealed.</p>
<p>But Alex Wilhelm found one tidbit: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/a-fraction-of-robinhoods-users-are-driving-its-runaway-growth/">Much of Robinhood&#8217;s revenue is generated from payment for order flow</a> (PFOF). Under the practice, market makers pay the trading platform for executing trades.</p>
<p>To get a sense of how much Robinhood&#8217;s high rollers contribute to the company&#8217;s general health, he calculated its PFOF revenues for the last three months of 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Borrowing a term from the casino trade, these whales generate the bulk of the company’s revenue stream.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Why do SaaS companies with usage-based pricing grow faster?</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1990106" style="width: 797px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1990106" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1990106" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg" alt="A piggy bank streaks down the road to riches on a skateboard and with a rocket strapped to his back." width="787" height="517" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg 787w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1990106" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=John+Lund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Lund <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>HubStop introduced usage-based pricing in 2011 to boost its retention rate, then near 70%.</p>
<p>When it went public three years later, its net revenue retention rate was edging close to 100%, &#8220;all without hurting the company’s ability to acquire new customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Offering new users frictionless onboarding, customer support and free credits is a proven method for making them more active — and loyal.</p>
<p>So, why do <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/why-do-saas-companies-with-usage-based-pricing-grow-faster/">public SaaS firms with usage-based pricing see faster growth</a>?</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they’re better at landing new customers, growing with them and keeping them as customers,&#8221; says Kyle Powar, VP of growth at OpenView.</p>

<p>In October 2018, private-market money valued Coinbase at around $8 billion. As of this week, it&#8217;s valued at $77 billion.</p>
<p>Similarly, Stripe is valued at $115 billion on secondary markets. In the middle of last year, that figure was closer to $36 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would I line up to pay $77 billion for Coinbase?&#8221; asked Alex. &#8220;Probably not, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/paying-115b-for-stripe-or-77b-for-coinbase-might-be-quite-rational/">that doesn’t mean that the public markets won’t.</a>&#8221;</p>

<p>Natasha Mascarenhas reports that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/pandemic-era-growth-and-spacs-are-helping-edtech-startups-graduate-early/">some edtech startups are hitching rides with special purpose acquisition vehicles</a> so they can speed up their journey to the public markets.</p>
<p>To learn more, she interviewed Susan Wolford, chairperson of $200 million SPAC Edify Acquisition, and Nerdy CEO Chuck Cohn. Nerdy, parent company of Varsity Tutors, is going through a reverse merger with TPG Pace Tech Opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s less about going into the public markets and more about that this transaction allows us to take an offensive position and lean into the big opportunities,&#8221; Cohn said.</p>

<p>When I saw that Alex Wilhelm wrote on Tuesday about two more startups that were taking the SPAC route to public markets, I briefly wondered if we&#8217;ve been covering special purpose acquisition companies <em>too</em> frequently.</p>
<p>After I read his first sentence, I realized Alex made exactly the right call because the trend that emerged in 2020 may be turning into a actual wave: This week, pet e-commerce company Rover and fintech startup MoneyLion both announced that they&#8217;re planning SPAC-led debuts.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/investors-spac-push-could-revamp-the-private-market-money-game/">On Monday, Alex covered the news</a> that Lerer Hippeau Acquisition Corp. and Khosla Ventures Acquisition Co. I, II and III. filed S-1 filings last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to wonder if every VC worth a damn in the future will have their own raft of SPAC offerings,&#8221; says Alex.</p>
<p>Wrote Lerer Hippeau Acquisition Corp.:</p>
<blockquote><p>With our portfolio now maturing to the stage at which many are considering the public markets, we view SPACs as a natural next step in the evolution of our platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If we are not careful, every entry of this column could consist of SPAC news,&#8221; writes Alex.</p>

<p>Fifteen U.S.-based institutions of higher learning have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/from-dorm-rooms-to-board-rooms-how-universities-are-promoting-entrepreneurship/">joined forces to create the University Technology Licensing Program LLC (UTLP)</a>.</p>
<p>The program makes it easier for entrepreneurs and investors to find IP that can drive their companies forward, but it&#8217;s also an attempt to repair what one participant calls &#8220;the somewhat broken interface between universities and very large companies in the tech space.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Incredible growth people are independent and creative and are drawn to environments that explicitly value these traits,&#8221; says Jessica Li, a content/growth professional who was previously a VC.</p>
<p>To land top talent, &#8220;demonstrate that you have a team structure in place where a growth marketer could fit in and thrive.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp said earlier this week that it will allow users to review its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-dunks-on-facebook-and-recommends-signal-in-wake-of-u-s-capitol-insurrection-attempt/">planned privacy update</a> at “their own pace” and will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/following-backlash-whatsapp-to-roll-out-in-app-banner-to-better-explain-its-privacy-update/">display a banner to better explain the changes</a> in its terms. But what happens to its users who do not accept the terms by the May 15 deadline?</p>
<p>In an email to one of its merchant partners, reviewed by TechCrunch, Facebook-owned WhatsApp said it will “slowly ask” such users to comply with the new terms “in order to have full functionality of WhatsApp” starting May 15.</p>
<p>If they still don’t accept the terms, “for a short time, these users will be able to receive calls and notifications, but will not be able to read or send messages from the app,” the company added in the note. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that the note accurately characterizes its plan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The &#8220;short time&#8221; will span a few weeks. In the note, WhatsApp linked to a newly <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-happens-when-our-terms-and-privacy-policy-updates-take-effect">created FAQ page</a> that says its policy related to inactive users will apply after May 15.</p>
<p>WhatsApp’s <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-inactive-account-deletion">policy for inactive users</a> states that accounts are “generally deleted after 120 days of inactivity.”</p>
<p>The instant messaging service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/whatsapp-faces-legal-challenge-over-privacy-in-its-biggest-market/">received backlash from some of its users</a> &#8212; including those in India, its biggest market &#8212; last month after an in-app alert said they had until February 8 to agree to the planned privacy terms, which are being made to reflect its recent push into e-commerce, if they wished to continue using the service.</p>
<p>Following backlash, WhatsApp said its planned privacy update had created confusion among some of its users. &#8220;We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There’s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts,&#8221; it wrote in a blog post last month.</p>
<p>Since 2016, WhatsApp&#8217;s privacy policies have granted the service permission to share with Facebook certain metadata such as user phone numbers and device information. The new terms will allow Facebook and WhatsApp to share payment and transaction data in order to help them better target ads as the social juggernaut <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/facebook-adds-carts-to-whatsapp-to-make-shopping-easier/">broadens its e-commerce offerings</a> and looks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/02/facebook-warned-over-privacy-risks-of-merging-messaging-platforms/">merge its messaging platforms</a>.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">used by over 2 billion users</a>, last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">delayed enforcing the new policy by three months</a> and has been explaining its terms to users ever since &#8212; though its <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/giving-more-time-for-our-recent-update">explanations</a> <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/answering-your-questions-about-whatsapps-privacy-policy?lang=en">hadn&#8217;t explicitly</a> addressed what it planned to do with users who didn&#8217;t accept the terms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brex is the latest fintech to apply for a bank charter.</p>
<p>The fast-growing company, which sells a credit card tailored for startups with Emigrant Bank currently acting as the issuer,<a href="https://www.brex.com/posts/brex-ILC-filing-announcement/"> announced Friday</a> that it has submitted an application with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI) to establish Brex Bank.</p>
<p>The industrial bank will be located in Draper, Utah, and be a wholly owned subsidiary of Brex.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has tapped former Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) exec Bruce Wallace to serve as the subsidiary&#8217;s CEO. He served in several roles at SVB, including COO, chief digital officer and head of global services. It also has named Jean Perschon, the former CFO for UBS Bank USA, to be the Brex Bank CFO.</p>
<p>Last May, Brex announced that it had raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/brex-brings-on-150m-in-new-cash-in-case-of-an-extended-recession/">$150 million in a Series C extension</a> from a group of existing investors, including DST Global and Lone Pine Capital.</p>

<p>With that raise, Brex, which was co-founded by Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi, had amassed $465 million in venture capital funding to date.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement today that &#8220;Brex Bank will expand upon its existing suite of financial products and business software, offering credit solutions and FDIC insured deposit products to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).&#8221;</p>
<p>Offering credit products to small businesses has become a popular product offering and source of revenue for tech companies serving entrepreneurs, including Shopify and Square in the commerce arena. Likewise, offering business-focused bank accounts, like <a href="https://www.shopify.com/balance">Shopify Balance</a>, which is currently in development with a plan to launch sometime this year in the U.S.</p>
<p>These financial products can provide additional opportunities for revenue on interest and cost of borrowing for these companies, which might have better insight into the risk profiles of the types of businesses they serve than traditional lenders and FIs.</p>
<p>“Brex and Brex Bank will work in tandem to help SMBs grow to realize their full potential,” said Wallace.</p>
<p>Brex is based in San Francisco and counts Kleiner Perkins Growth, YC Continuity Fund, Greenoaks Capital, Ribbit Capital, IVP and DST Global, as well as Peter Thiel and Affirm CEO Max Levchin, among its investors. It currently has over 400 employees, and though it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/brex-the-credit-card-for-startups-cuts-staff-amid-restructuring/">had significant layoffs mid-year in 2020</a>, it cited restructuring rather than financial difficulty as the cause of that downsize.</p>
<p>Other fintechs that have made moves toward bank charters include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/varo-bank-raises-another-63m-led-by-nba-star-russell-westbrook/">Varo Bank, which this week raised another $63 million</a>, and SoFi, which last October was granted preliminary approval for a national bank charter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2017, Ironclad founder and CEO Jason Boehmig was looking to raise a Series A. As a former lawyer, Boehmig had a specific process for fundraising and an ultimate goal of finding the right investors for his company.</p>
<p>Part of Boehmig&#8217;s process was to ask people in the San Francisco Bay Area about their favorite place to work. Many praised RelateIQ, a company founded by Steve Loughlin who had sold it to Salesforce for $390 million and was brand new to venture at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to meet Steve and had kind of put two and two together,&#8221; said Boehmig. &#8220;I was like, &#8216;There&#8217;s this founder I&#8217;ve been meaning to connect with anyways, just to pick his brain, about how to build a great company, and he also just became an investor.'&#8221;</p>
<p>On this week&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, the duo discussed how the Ironclad pitch excited Loughlin about leading the round. (So excited, in fact, he signed paperwork in the hospital on the same day his child was born.) They also discussed how they&#8217;ve managed to build trust by working through disagreements and the challenges of pricing and packaging enterprise products.</p>
<p>As with every episode of Extra Crunch Live, they also gave feedback on pitch decks submitted by the audience. (If you&#8217;d like to see your deck featured on a future episode, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">send it to us using this form.</a>)</p>

<h2>Episode breakdown:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The pitch — 2:30</li>
<li>How they operate — 23:00</li>
<li>The problem of pricing — 29:00</li>
<li>Pitch deck teardown — 35:00</li>
</ul>
<h2>The pitch</h2>
<p>When Boehmig came in to pitch Accel, Loughlin remembers feeling ambivalent. He had heard about the company and knew a former lawyer was coming in to pitch a legal tech company. He also trusted the reference who had introduced him to Boehmig, and thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, Boehmig dove into the pitch. The company had about a dozen customers that were excited about the product, and a few who were expanding use of the product across the organization, but it wasn&#8217;t until the ultimate vision of Ironclad was teased that Loughlin perked up.</p>
<p>Loughlin realized that the contract can be seen as a core object that could be used to collaborate horizontally across the enterprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was when the lightbulb went off and I realized this is actually much bigger,&#8221; said Loughlin. &#8220;This is not a legal tech company. This is core horizontal enterprise collaboration in one of the areas that has not been solved yet, where there is no great software yet for legal departments to collaborate with their counterparts.&#8221;</p>
<p>He listed all the software that those same counterparts had to let them collaborate: Salesforce, Marketo, Zendesk. Any investor would be excited to hear that a potential portfolio company could match the likes of those behemoths. Loughlin was hooked.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a slide that I&#8217;m guessing Jason didn&#8217;t think much of, as it was just the data around the business, but I got pretty excited about it,&#8221; said Loughlin. &#8220;It said, for every legal user Ironclad added, they added nine other users from departments like sales, marketing, customer service, etc. It was evidence that this theory of collaboration could be true at scale.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin is known for its usually mild winters. But on February 12, a winter storm hit the state &#8212; leading to over a week of freezing temperatures. This has resulted in a statewide disaster with millions of Texas residents losing power or water, or both.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s too early to tell the exact toll this has all taken in loss of life, property damage and economic activity. But it’s clear that this disaster is, and will continue to be, devastating on many levels. Austin-area hospitals even lost water this week, as an indication of how bad things have been.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since last Thursday, my own household lost power and got it back multiple times. On February 17, we lost water, with no idea of when it will be restored. I realize there are many worse off than me, so I’ll spare you the pity party, but it’s definitely been a humbling experience. Boiling snow/ice for toilet water and rationing the little bottled water we had left with fear of frozen/bursting pipes. At least we have been warm the past couple of days, as many still don’t have power.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, over the past few months (and years, really), Austin has been making headlines for other news &#8212; namely the fact that so many tech companies, founders (ahem, Elon) and investors are either moving their headquarters here (Oracle), building significant factories (Tesla) or offices (Apple, Google, Facebook) here, or are thinking about relocating entirely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of state income taxes has been a big draw, as well as the housing/land/office prices that are affordable when compared to those in the Bay Area. This is nothing new, but only accelerated as the pandemic has encouraged/forced more remote work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, some of the very things that have led to the state being more attractive to companies have also contributed to the crisis: Fewer taxes means less money for infrastructure, for one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it goes beyond that. Many other states have had freezing cold temperatures without the loss of power and water that Texas is currently experiencing. As The Washington Post </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/16/ercot-texas-electric-grid-failure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported earlier this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the state’s choice to deregulate electricity led to “a financial structure for power generation that offers no incentives to power plant operators to prepare for winter. In the name of deregulation and free markets, critics say, Texas has created an electric grid that puts an emphasis on cheap prices over reliable service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Elon shared his disappointment on Twitter:</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/ERCOT_ISO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ERCOT_ISO</a> is not earning that R</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s fair to say Texas has attracted widespread criticism of its handling of this new crisis &#8212; both in terms of its lack of preparation and mismanagement (Sen. Cruz, we’re looking at you). But are the events of the past week going to take away some of the shine on Austin as a potential relocation destination for tech and investors? Will this deter people from wanting to move here? Isn’t it also ironic that some folks who didn&#8217;t want to move here due to the scorching summer temperatures are now also slamming the city/state for the impacts of a major winter storm?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I did what many other enterprising tech reporters might do in this situation, and took to Twitter. The results were pretty much as expected &#8212; varied and passionate on either side.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were many tweets from Austinites who defended their city and praised how its residents have come together during crises:</span></i></p>

<p>And now some don&#39;t want to move to Texas because weather?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have lived on all three coasts &#8212; East, West and Gulf. There are pluses and minuses to each.

I am heartbroken at all the suffering people in the city and state are dealing with and for now, just want to see things get back to “normal” as soon as possible so the only crisis we’re dealing with is the COVID-19 pandemic. Never thought we’d look back fondly on those days.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/mars-rover-perseverance-touches-down-tomorrow-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Perseverance</a> Mars rover <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/perseverance-lands-safely-on-mars-and-sends-back-its-first-images-of-the-surface/">landed safely yesterday</a>, but only after a series of complex maneuvers as it descended at high speed through the atmosphere, known by the team as the &#8220;seven minutes of terror.&#8221; NASA has just <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8866/nasas-perseverance-rover-sends-sneak-peek-of-mars-landing/">shared a hair-raising image</a> of the rover as it dangled from its jetpack above the Martian landscape, making that terror a lot easier to understand.</p>
<p>Published with others to the rover&#8217;s Twitter account (as always, in the first person), the image is among the first sent back from the rover; black-and-white shots from its navigation cameras appeared almost instantly after landing, but this is the first time we&#8217;ve seen the rover — or anything, really — from this perspective.</p>
<p>The image was taken by cameras on the descent stage or &#8220;jetpack,&#8221; a rocket-powered descent module that took over once the craft had sufficiently slowed via both atmospheric friction and its parachute. Once the heat shield was jettisoned, Perseverance scanned the landscape for a safe landing location, and once that was found, the jetpack&#8217;s job was to fly it there.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2113235" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113235" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2113235 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg" alt="Perseverance rover and its spacecraft in an exploded view showing its several main components." width="900" height="657" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=768,561 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=680,496 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113235" class="wp-caption-text">The image at the top of the story was taken by the descent stage&#8217;s &#8220;down-look cameras.&#8221; <strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>When it was about 70 feet above the landing spot, the jetpack would have deployed the &#8220;sky crane,&#8221; a set of cables that would lower the rover to the ground from a distance that safely allowed the jetpack to rocket itself off to a crash landing far away.</p>
<p>The image at top was taken just moments before landing — it&#8217;s a bit hard to tell whether those swirls in the Martian soil are hundreds, dozens or just a handful of feet below, but follow-up images made it clear that the rocks you can see are pebbles, not boulders.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115432" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115432" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2115432" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg" alt="Photo of the Mars rover Perseverance's wheel and rocks on the surface." width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2115432" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>The images are a reminder that the processes we see only third-hand as observers of an HQ tracking telemetry data sent millions of miles from Mars are in fact very physical, fast and occasionally brutal things. Seeing such an investment of time and passion dangling from cords above a distant planet after a descent that started at 5 kilometers per second, and required about a hundred different things to go right or else end up just another crater on Mars&#8230; it&#8217;s sobering and inspiring.</p>
<p>That said, that first person perspective may not even be the most impressive shot of the descent. Shortly after releasing that, NASA published an astonishing image from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which managed to capture Perseverance mid-fall under its parachute:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115444" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115444" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2115444" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg" alt="Photo taken from 700km away by the Mars reconnaissance Orbiter of the Perseverance rover descending under its parachute." width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg 2121w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=2048,1155 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2115444" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona</p></div></p>
<p>Keep in mind that MRO was 700 km away, and traveling at over 3 km/second at the time this shot was taken. &#8220;The extreme distance and high speeds of the two spacecraft were challenging conditions that required precise timing and for Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to both pitch upward and roll hard to the left so that Perseverance was viewable by HiRISE at just the right moment,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/hirise-captured-perseverance-during-descent-to-mars">NASA wrote in the description of the photo</a>.</p>
<p>Chances are we&#8217;re going to be treated to a fuller picture of the &#8220;seven minutes of terror&#8221; soon, once NASA collects enough imagery from Perseverance, but for now the images above serve as reminders of the ingenuity and skill of the team there, and perhaps a sense of wonder and awe at the capabilities of science and engineering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tracy Chou&#8217;s resume is impressive. She interned at RocketFuel, Google and Facebook before becoming a software engineer at Quora and Pinterest. She is also a major advocate for diversity within the tech industry, launching <a href="https://projectinclude.org/">Project Include</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>Now, she&#8217;s the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.blockpartyapp.com/">Block Party</a>, a platform aimed at making people feel safer on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to announce that we&#8217;ll be sitting down with Chou at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Justice</a> in early March.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/block-party-launch/">Block Party was born specifically out of Chou&#8217;s experience</a> working at places like Quora — building a block button was one of the first things she built after being harassed on the platform. As an advocate for diversity, and a big name in the tech sphere in general, Chou has had her fair share of experience with online harassment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year has been one of financial hardship for billions, and among the specific hardships is the elementary one of paying for utilities, taxes and other government fees — the systems for which are rarely set up for easy or flexible payment. <a href="https://home.promise-pay.com/">Promise</a> aims to change that by integrating with official payment systems and offering more forgiving terms for fees and debts people can&#8217;t handle all at once, and has raised $20 million to do so.</p>
<p>When every penny is going toward rent and food, it can be hard to muster the cash to pay an irregular bill like water or electricity. They&#8217;re less likely to be shut off on short notice than a mobile plan, so it&#8217;s safer to kick the can down the road&#8230; until a few bills add up and suddenly a family is looking at hundreds of dollars of unpaid bills and no way to split them up or pay over time. Same with tickets and other fees and fines.</p>
<p>The CEO and co-founder of Promise, Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, explained that this (among other places) is where current systems fall down. Unlike buying a TV or piece of furniture, where payment plans may be offered in a single click during online checkout, there frequently is no such option for municipal ticket payment sites or utilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have found that people struggling to pay their bills want to pay and will pay at extremely high rates if you offer them reminders, accessible payment options and flexibility. The systems are the problem — they are not designed for people who don’t always have a surplus of money in their bank accounts,&#8221; she told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;They assume for example that if someone makes their first payment at 10 PM on the 15th, they will have the same amount of money the next month on the 15th at 10 PM,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;These systems do not recognize that most people are struggling with their basic needs. Payments may need to be weekly or split up into multiple payment types.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even those that do offer plans still see many failures to pay, due at least partly to a lack of flexibility on their part, said Ellis-Lamkins — failure to make a payment can lead to the whole plan being cancelled. Furthermore, it may be difficult to get enrolled in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some cities offer payment plans but you have to go in person to sign up, complete a multiple-page form, show proof of income and meet restrictive criteria,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have been able to work with our partners to use self-certification to ease the process as opposed to providing tax returns or other documentation. Currently, we have over a 90% repayment rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Promise acts as a sort of middleman, integrating lightly with the agency or utility, which in turn makes anyone owing money aware of the possibility of the different payment system. It&#8217;s similar to how you might see various payment options, including installments, when making a purchase at an online shop.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115397" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115397" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2115397" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png" alt="Mobile and computer screens showing payment interfaces with optiosn to pay over time." width="1024" height="654" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png 1764w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=1536,980 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2115397" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Promise</p></div></p>
<p>The user enrolls in a payment plan (the service is mobile-friendly because that&#8217;s the only form of internet many people have) and Promise handles that end of it, with reminders, receipts and processing, passing on the money to the agency as it comes in — the company doesn&#8217;t cover the cost up front and collect on its own terms. Essentially it&#8217;s a bolt-on flexible payment mechanism that specializes in government agencies and other public-facing fee collectors.</p>
<p>Promise makes money by subscription fees (i.e. SaaS) and/or through transaction fees, whichever makes more sense for the given customer. As you might imagine, it makes more sense for a utility to pay a couple bucks to be more sure of collecting $500, than to take its chance on getting none of that $500, or having to resort to more heavy-handed and expensive debt collection methods.</p>
<p>Lest you think this is not a big problem (and consequently not a big market), Ellis-Lamkins noted a recent study from the California Water Boards showing there are 1.6 million people with a total of $1 billion in water debt in the state — one in eight households is in arrears to an average of $500.</p>
<p>Those numbers are likely worse than normal, given the immense financial pressure that the pandemic has placed on nearly all households — but like payment plans in other circumstances, households of many incomes and types find their own reason to take advantage of such systems. And pretty much anyone who&#8217;s had to deal with an obtusely designed utility payment site would welcome an alternative.</p>
<p>The new round brings the company&#8217;s total raised to over $30 million, counting $10 million it raised immediately after leaving Y Combinator in 2018. The funding comes from existing investors Kapor Capital, XYZ, Bronze, First Round, YC, Village, and others.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A lot of clients come to us saying they want to be more respected in their space. They know their competitors are trusted and they want the same recognition, if not more.</p>
<p>This feels even more important now after the absolute disaster that was 2020. Consumers and clients alike just want to be able to count on brands and not stress over whether they’re making the right decision.</p>
<p>Marketers seem to know this. When we teamed up with Semrush to <a href="https://blog.frac.tl/2021-data-backed-digital-marketing-predictions">explore keyword search data in 2020 related to marketing goals</a>, brand awareness and authority showed steady upward trends.</p>

<p>If you’re one of these marketers, I have some strategies you can use to improve your brand’s authority this year. It can’t happen overnight, but you can start implementing these strategies now to see results over time.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			I have some strategies you can use to improve your brand’s authority this year.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Strategy #1: Get media coverage</h2>
<p>Media coverage can build the authority of your brand in a few ways.</p>
<p>For one, it’s hard for people to trust you if they don’t know you exist. Of course, you can pay for ads or kill it on social to get your name out there, but media coverage has other benefits, as well.</p>
<p>When reputable publications and websites reference your brand and link to your site, they’re sending a signal that they trust what you have to say. It’s third-party confirmation that you know what you’re talking about and/or have something to offer.</p>
<p>For example, for our client Stoneside, we surveyed folks to see how many <a href="https://www.stoneside.com/resources/articles/plant-love">purchased and cared for houseplants in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The report got coverage on <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/houseplant-popularity-blooms-during-pandemic-5077405">TreeHugger</a> and <a href="https://www.simplemost.com/trendiest-houseplants-2021/">Simplemost</a>, but it also served as great context for other articles, like <a href="https://hellogiggles.com/lifestyle/best-houseplants/">HelloGiggles</a> and <a href="https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/news/article/the-ultimate-guide-to-caring-for-houseplants-in-the-winter">The Weather Network</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, getting media coverage isn’t easy. You need newsworthy content or an expert opinion to contribute, and you need to know how to pitch it to writers.</p>
<h3>Small budget options</h3>
<p>Are there industry blogs you can write a guest post for? Are there peers in your industry who are looking for quotes for their content? Start building connections with other industry experts. Cite their work in your content and build a rapport.</p>
<p>For example, I sometimes work with marketing tool brands like Semrush and BuzzSumo because those brands align well with Fractl, as we all work in the same industry.</p>
<p>You can also sign up for <a href="https://www.helpareporter.com/">HARO</a>, in which journalists post requests to speak to particular types of experts. However, it’s not often you’ll see relevant requests, and even then it’s a toss up whether they’ll reach out to you specifically.</p>
<h3>Larger budget options</h3>
<p>If you can afford it, a combination of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/earn-the-best-backlinks-with-high-quality-content-and-digital-pr/">content marketing and digital PR </a>is the way to go. If you have resources internally — marketing folks who are savvy with data analysis and content creation — you can start by seeing if you have any internal data that would be interesting to a wider audience.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
