										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is launching a new iPad model. This is the most affordable iPad model in the lineup, it’s cheaper than the iPad Air and iPad Pro. Today&#8217;s new iPad replaces the existing $329 iPad in the lineup.</p>
<p>It features Apple’s A13 chip. Apple originally unveiled the A13 for the iPhone 11. As a reminder, the existing iPad uses the A12 Bionic.</p>
<p>When it comes to the camera, you can expect improved auto focus and low-light performance. The front-facing is receiving a huge upgrade as it now has a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera with a 122° view angle.</p>
<p>Apple is also bringing center stage to the iPad. That feature automatically detects what’s happening during a video call and crops the image to that part of the video feed in real time. It’s going to improve your family video-conferencing sessions.</p>
<p>The entry-level iPad is also getting True Tone for the first time. It’s a sort of white-balance adjustment feature for the display. Like the previous version, the new iPad supports the first-generation Apple Pencil with its built-in Lightning connector.</p>
<p>The new iPad will be available next week for $329 with 64GB (instead of 32GB for the previous generation). You can also get a model with cellular connectivity and schools can buy this iPad for $299. This model of iPad comes in silver and Space Gray.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s that time of year again. Summer is winding down, the leaves are starting to change color and Apple’s getting ready to drop a brand new iPhone on the world. Today’s big event arrives less than a year after the last big iPhone event, as Apple seems to be back on schedule, after some early pandemic supply chain issues.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/what-we-expect-from-next-weeks-apple-event/">a handy roundup</a> of all the things we expect to see live on video from Cupertino, based on a slew of rumors and leaks. The big news today is almost certainly the arrival of the iPhone 13. We’re also expecting the new Apple Watch Series 7 to drop, as well as some other key hardware additions, potentially including new AirPods and additional Apple Silicon Mac models.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is set to announce new iPhone models today. The company is holding a (virtual) keynote at <strong>10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris)</strong>. And you’ll be able to watch the event right here as the company is streaming it live.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EvGOlAkLSLw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/what-we-expect-from-next-weeks-apple-event/">Rumor has it</a> that there will be a new generation of iPhone models. Reports suggest that the company is going to call it the iPhone 13 and that there will be four different models just like last year. Today, you can expect to learn more about the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p>
<p>When it comes to new features, it’s safe to say that there will be big camera upgrades. This year, the company seems to be focused on video improvements in particular. The iPhone 13 should also come with a better display and a faster chip.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. Apple is likely to use this opportunity to announce a new Apple Watch model. There will be bigger design changes with the Apple Watch Series 7 with sharp edges.</p>
<p>There could be more product announcements as Apple has been working on the AirPods 3. They will replace or complement the entry-level AirPods 2 in the audio lineup. The AirPods Pro and AirPods Max will remain unchanged for now.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s a small chance that we get to hear more about new Macs with custom designed Apple chips as well as new iPad models…</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can watch the live stream directly on this page, as Apple is streaming its conference on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you have an Apple TV, you can open the TV app and look for the &#8216;Apple Special Event&#8217; section. It lets you stream today’s event and rewatch old ones.</p>
<p>And if you don’t have an Apple TV and don’t want to use YouTube, the company also lets you live stream the event from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/livestream/">Apple Events section</a> on its website. This video feed now works in all major browsers — Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.</p>
<p>We’ll be covering the event and you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/live-from-apples-virtual-2021-iphone-event/">follow our liveblog</a> for live commentary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok announced this morning that it is implementing new tactics to educate its users about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/tech-leaders-discuss-how-social-media-is-broken-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/">negative mental health impacts</a> of social media. As part of these changes, TikTok is rolling out a &#8220;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/well-being-guide/">well-being guide</a>&#8221; in its Safety Center, a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/eating-disorders/">brief primer</a> on eating disorders, expanded search interventions, and opt-in viewing screens on potentially triggering searches.</p>

TikTok wants users to think about why they&#8217;re sharing their experience, if they&#8217;re ready for a wider audience to hear their story if sharing could be harmful to them, and if they&#8217;re prepared to hear others&#8217; stories in response. </span></p>
<p>The platform also added a brief, albeit generic memo about the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/eating-disorders/">impact of eating disorders</a> under the &#8220;topics&#8221; section of the Safety Center, which was developed with the <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631712835680000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_6fZatFLr2KphvOIMd5SIVjFDvQ">National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA)</a>.

<p>Already, TikTok directs users to local resources when they search for words or phrases like #suicide,* but now, the platform will also share content from creators with the intent of helping someone in need. The platform told TechCrunch that it chose this content following consultation with independent experts. Additionally, if someone enters a search phrase that might be alarming (TikTok offered &#8220;scary makeup&#8221; as an example), the content will be blurred out, asking users to opt-in to see the search results.</p>
<p>As TikTok unveils these changes, its competitor Instagram is facing scrutiny after The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">leaked documents</a> that reveal its parent company Facebook&#8217;s own research on the harm Instagram poses for teen girls. Similar to the Gen Z-dominated TikTok, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">more than 40%</a> of Instagram users are 22 or younger, and 22 million teens log into Instagram in the U.S. each day. In one anecdote, a 19-year-old interviewed by The Wall Street Journal said that after searching Instagram for workout ideas, her explore page has been flooded with photos about how to lose weight (Instagram has previously fessed up to <a href="http://bbc.com/news/technology-56750088">errors with its search function</a>, which recommended that users search topics like &#8220;fasting&#8221; and &#8220;appetite suppressants&#8221;). Angela Guarda, director for the eating-disorders program at Johns Hopkins Hospital, told The Wall Street Journal that her patients often say they learned about dangerous weight loss tactics via social media.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question on many people’s minds is if social media is good or bad for people. The research on this is mixed; it can be both,&#8221; Instagram wrote in a <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/using-research-to-improve-your-experience/">blog post today</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As TikTok nods to with its advice on sharing mental health stories, social media can often be a positive resource, allowing people who are dealing with certain challenges to learn from others who have gone through similar experiences. So, despite these platforms&#8217; outsized influence, it&#8217;s also on real people to think twice about what they post and how it might influence others. Even when Facebook experimented with hiding the number of &#8220;likes&#8221; on Instagram, employees said that </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">it didn&#8217;t improve</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> overall user well-being. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">These revelations about the negative impact of social media on mental health and body image aren&#8217;t ground-breaking, but they generate a renewed pressure for these powerful platforms to think about how to support their users (or, at the very least, add some new memos to their security center). </span></p>

The deal is a coup not only for companies that eschew venture capital backing &#8212; Mailchimp is famous for its bootstrapping history &#8212; but also for the city of its founding, Atlanta.</p>
<p>Mailchimp’s mega-exit comes in the same year that fellow Atlanta-based startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">Calendly raised</a> a massive $350 million round that valued the technology company north of $3 billion, per Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>The two companies underscore how possible it is to build large startups in markets outside of the traditional collection of cities most associated with technology entrepreneurship in the United States, like Boston, New York City and San Francisco, to name a few.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>Investors are taking note. CB Insights <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">data through Q2 2021</a> indicates that startups in Atlanta are on a fundraising tear, already surpassing total capital raised in 2020 in just the first half of this year. The city’s venture acceleration is similar to fundraising gains we’ve seen in markets like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/when-vcs-turned-to-zoom-chicago-startups-were-ready-for-their-close-up/">Chicago</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>The Exchange wanted to better understand the Atlanta market, especially regarding how bullish its local inventors are that its current pace of fundraising can continue, and what sort of external interest its startups are enjoying. So, we ran questions by <a href="https://twitter.com/smccormiq">Sean McCormick</a>, the CEO of Atlanta-based <a href="https://singleops.com/">SingleOps</a>, a software startup that raised capital earlier this year; <a href="https://www.atlantaventures.com/studio">Atlanta Ventures’</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/atgimbel">A.T. Gimbel;</a> and <a href="https://www.blhventures.com/">BLH Venture Partners’</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishmistry/">Ashish Mistry</a>. We also heard from <a href="https://twitter.com/pauljnoble">Paul Noble</a>, CEO of <a href="https://verusen.com">Verusen</a>, a supply chain intelligence startup that <a href="https://verusen.com/verusen-secures-8-million-series-a-to-fuel-intelligent-connected-supply-chains/">raised an $8 million Series A round</a> in January.</p>
<p>The picture that forms is one of a city enjoying a rising tide of venture activity, boosted by some local dynamics that may have helped some of its earlier-stage companies scale more cheaply than they might have in other markets. And there’s plenty of optimism to be found concerning the near future. Let’s explore.</p>
<h2>A funding boom</h2>
<p>It’s cliche at this point to note that a particular geography is experiencing record venture capital results; many cities, regions and countries are seeing startup capital inflows accelerate. But there are markets where the gains still stand out despite the generally warm climate for private capital investments into private companies.</p>
<p>Atlanta is one such market. Per CB Insights data, the U.S. city saw $2.17 billion in total investment during 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, Atlanta nearly matched its 2020 tally, with its startups collecting some $2.07 billion in total capital. Another $953 million was invested in the second quarter of the year; keep in mind that venture capital data is laggy, and thus what may appear to be a sharp decline may be ameliorated by later disclosures.</p>
<p>But with around $3 billion invested in the first half of 2021, already around a 50% gain on 2020’s full-year figures, it’s clear the city is seeing an unprecedented wave of venture investment.</p>
<p>Dollar volume is half the venture capital activity matrix, of course. The other key data line for the investment type is deal volume. There Atlanta’s activity is less superlative; Q1 2021 saw Atlanta startups attract 57 total deals, the second-best results that we have data for, narrowly losing to Q3 2017’s 59 deals.</p>
<p>But Q2 2021 saw Atlanta’s known venture deal volume fall to 42, a figure that is a slight miss from 2020’s average deal volume, measured on a quarterly basis. The same caveat regarding delayed data applies here, but perhaps not enough to completely close the gap between what we might have expected from Atlanta startups in terms of Q2 deal volume in the wake of the city’s super-active Q1.</p>
<p>Despite the somewhat slack Q2 2021 deal count in Atlanta, per current data, it’s clear that the city is enjoying record venture capital attention. What’s driving the uptick? Let’s find out.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With all the focus on whether Congress will enact a major infrastructure law to rebuild the United States’ roads, bridges, railways, etc., nobody seems to be paying attention to the elephant in the room: Even if the legislation is passed, where do we begin? You might be surprised to learn that the gig economy has an app for that.</p>
<p>We can and should hire professional consultants and other experts to review our infrastructure systems to see what needs the most immediate attention, but the sheer number of roads, bridges, dams and other critical infrastructure in the U.S. makes the job of prioritizing daunting.</p>
<p>According to the American Society of Civil Engineers’ <a href="https://infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/National_IRC_2021-report.pdf">2021 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure</a>, there are over 4 million miles of public roads, 617,000 bridges, 91,000 dams and 140,000 rail miles in the U.S. These are massive statistics.</p>
<p>So as soon as an infrastructure bill passes, the big questions will be: Where do we begin, and how do we set priorities — expeditiously and at minimum cost, at least for the first step? The next step would be to bring in professional engineers and experts to begin the rebuilding process.</p>
<p>There are some obvious examples of infrastructure systems needing immediate, prioritized attention (see the <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/traffic/deterioration-on-houston-ship-channel-bridge-causes-lane-closures-expect-traffic-delays/285-623729390">Sidney Sherman Bridge</a> in Houston, which had to be shut down a few years ago for a corroded bridge bearing and was recently classified as “structurally deficient”).</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is another massive statistic out there that can help: 216 million. That is the approximate number of U.S. adults that own a smartphone. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/">Pew Research Center</a> recently found that 85% of all U.S. adults own a smartphone, which, needless to say, is the highest it’s ever been. Even enlisting just a small percentage of the 216 million smartphone users out there can help immensely with this task.</p>
<p>Federal, state and local governments can and should consider the awesome (and relatively inexpensive) power of our smartphones and the gig economy. Gig workers can be enlisted to use the smartphones that they already own to provide inspection data and photographs of the key identified roads, bridges, dams and rails in the 50 states. The data and photos they collect can then be instantly transmitted to a national database for review and evaluation by professional engineers and consultants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I know this can be done because my colleagues and I have done this before. We tap into a worldwide network of gig workers (data collectors or data contributors) operating from an open source app and with full transparency.</p>
<p>Our projects have involved contributors photographing and documenting sewer access points, bridges, water access points and other infrastructure systems. We even partnered with a major nonprofit on behalf of USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance to bolster its Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Program by providing rapid WASH needs assessments wherein our contributors can be mobilized on an emergency basis to provide photographs and other data on water access, sanitation and hygiene in Colombia.</p>
<p>Why can’t we do the same for bridges, roads, tunnels and other infrastructure here in the U.S.? This technology needs to be scaled, and we know it can be done.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple — and the solution is in plain sight. Our smartphones and gig workers allow us to set priorities using their photos and input from what their eyes are seeing, and then professional experts can follow up to begin implementation. There are already provisions in the Senate bill that could provide funding for this type of advanced technology research. And there is an ongoing need, even after repairs are done, to monitor the condition of our highways, bridges and tunnels.</p>
<p>Using this gig-worker-enabled smartphone technology will not only help our federal, state and local governments set priorities quickly; it will also allow thousands of everyday Americans to be part of the rebuilding process. This has the added benefit of democratizing the job of fixing our infrastructure and creating a grassroots movement of people using their own smartphones to help rebuild and repair U.S. infrastructure for the current and future generations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has again restarted its account verification process, the company said on Monday evening by way of a <a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1437533358746218496">post</a> to its Twitter Verified account, where it publishes updates about the system&#8217;s status. Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-opens-account-verification-applications-to-the-public-under-new-guidelines/">launching</a> the revamped verification program this spring, Twitter had hit a few snags which have forced it to shut down verifications more than once. The most recent of these pauses was announced on August 13, when the company <a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1426214732403466241">said</a> it need to make improvements to both the application and review process.</p>
<p>Twitter has struggled with account verifications for years. Everyone wanted the coveted blue badge that was previously doled out to public figures and other accounts of high public interest who have confirmed they are who they say they are &#8212; like a government official, journalist, celeb, brand or business, or another notable name.</p>
<p>But while the original system was meant to communicate only account authenticity, many viewed Twitter verification badgeholders as having some sort of elevated status. This issue came to a head when it was discovered in 2017 Twitter had <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/twitter-verifies-charlottesville-rally-boss-jason-kessler-who-called-slain-protesters-death-payback-time">verified</a> the account belonging to Jason Keller, the person who organized the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Shortly thereafter, Twitter officially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/twitter-pauses-account-verifications-after-critics-slam-it-for-verifying-charlottesville-rally-organizer/">paused verifications</a>, but continued to quietly verify certain individuals including candidates running for public office, elected public officials, journalists, and others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155028" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155028" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2155028" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155028" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-opens-account-verification-applications-to-the-public-under-new-guidelines/">rebooted</a> the system in May 2021, saying it had been rebuilt and would now have a dedicated team. It also issued new rules that more explicitly spelled out who could request verification and who could not. But demand for verification was so great that Twitter had to<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-is-pausing-public-verification-process-blue-check-2021-5"> temporarily pause verification</a> only 8 days after it launched so the team could catch up with the number of requests.</p>
<p>After it restarted, Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1426214732403466241">again put the system on pause</a> in August, explaining it needed more time to get things right. It&#8217;s not clear how well verifications were going at this point, as social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1436077615333453825">Matt Navarra pointed out that</a> Twitter had accidentally verified a fake account for Rockstar Games. And earlier this summer, Twitter had<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-suspends-some-fake-accounts-it-verified-by-mistake-2021-07-13/"> admitted</a> that it had permanently suspended <a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1414475519609999366">some fake accounts</a> that it had mistakenly verified, as well.</p>
<p>Now, Twitter says users who are looking to be verified should keep checking their account settings screen for access to the in-app application. It didn&#8217;t detail what, specifically had changed &#8212; but hopefully the system will now remain open for good.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When LinkedIn first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/linkedin-launches-stories-plus-zoom-bluejeans-and-teams-video-integrations-as-part-of-wider-redesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Stories format, and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-adds-creator-mode-video-profiles-and-in-partnership-with-microsoft-new-career-training-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded its tools for creators</a> earlier this year, one noticeable detail was that the Microsoft-owned network for professionals hadn&#8217;t built any kind of obvious monetization into the program &#8212; noticeable, given that creators earn a living on other platforms like Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, and those apps had lured creators, their content, and their audiences in part by paying out.</p>
<p>“As we continue to listen to feedback from our members as we consider future opportunities, we’ll also continue to evolve how we create more value for our creators,” is how LinkedIn explained its holding pattern on payouts to me at the time. But that strategy may have backfired for the company &#8212; or at least may have played a role in what came next: last month, LinkedIn announced it would be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/linkedin-is-scrapping-its-stories-feature-to-work-on-short-form-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scrapping its Stories format</a> and going back to the proverbial drawing board to work on other short-form video content for the platform.</p>
<p>Now comes the latest iteration in that effort. To bring more creators to the platform, the company today <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedins-latest-investment-creators-andrei-santalo/?trackingId=5vS3zafEQ867lzaeBiF2vw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it would be launching a new $25 million creator fund, which initially will be focused around a new Creator Accelerator Program.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s coming on the heels of LinkedIn also continuing to work on one of its other new-content experiments: a Clubhouse-style live conversation platform. As we previously reported, LinkedIn began working on this back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March of this year</a>. Now, we are hearing that the feature will make an appearance as part of a broader events strategy for the company very soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be starting to test audio with a small pilot group in the coming weeks,&#8221; Chris Szeto, senior director of product at LinkedIn, who heads up its audio efforts. &#8220;Given the trends in virtual, hybrid events we are also working on making audio part of our overall event strategy rather than a standalone offering, so that we can give people more choice about how they want to run and engage with their audiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notably, in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedins-latest-investment-creators-andrei-santalo/?trackingId=5vS3zafEQ867lzaeBiF2vw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> announcing the creator fund, LinkedIn also listed a number of creator events coming up. Will the Clubhouse-style feature pop up there? Watch this space. Or maybe&#8230; listen up.</p>
<p>In any case, the creator accelerator that LinkedIn is announcing today could help feed into that wider pool of people that LinkedIn is hoping to cultivate on its platform as a more dynamic and lively set of voices to get more people talking and spending time on LinkedIn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Andrei Santalo, global head of community at LinkedIn, noted in the blog post that the accelerator/incubator will be focused on the whole creator and the many ways that one can engage on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creating content on LinkedIn is about creating opportunity, for yourselves and others,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;How can your words, videos and conversations make 774+ million professionals better at what they do or help them see the world in new ways?&#8221;</p>
<p>The incubator will last for 10 weeks and will take on 100 creators in the U.S. to coach them on building content for LinkedIn. It will also give them chances to network with like-minded individuals (naturally&#8230; it is LinkedIn), as well as a $15,000 grant to do their work. The deadline for applying (which you do <a href="http://linkedin.com/creators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) is October 12.</p>
<p>The idea of starting a fund to incentivize creators to build video for a particular platform is definitely not new &#8212; and that is one reason why it was overdue for LinkedIn to think about its own approach.</p>
<p>Leading social media platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snapchat</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram and Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/youtubes-100-million-shorts-fund-to-challenge-tiktok-goes-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> all have announced hundreds of millions of dollars in payouts in the form of creator funds to bring more original content to their platforms.</p>
<p>You could argue that for mass-market social media sites, it&#8217;s important to pay creators because competition is so fierce among them for consumer attention.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, those platforms have appeal for creators because of the potential audience size. At 774 million users, LinkedIn isn&#8217;t exactly small, but the kind of content that tends to live on there is so different, and maybe drier &#8212; it&#8217;s focused on professional development, work, and &#8220;serious&#8221; topics &#8212; that perhaps it might need the most financial incentive of all to get creators to bite.</p>
<p>LinkedIn&#8217;s bread and butter up to now has been around professional development: people use it to look for work, to get better jobs, to hire people, and to connect with people who might help them get ahead in their professional lives.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s done so in a very prescribed set of formats that do not leave much room for exploring &#8220;authenticity&#8221; &#8212; not in the modern sense of &#8220;authentic self&#8221;, and not in the more old-school sense of just letting down your guard and being yourself. (Even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/linkedin-doubles-down-on-development-with-new-learning-hub-free-courses-and-new-search-fields-for-hybrid-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively newer initiatives like its education focus</a> directly play into this bigger framework.)</p>
<p>With authenticity becoming an increasing priority for people &#8212; and maybe more so as we have started to blur the lines between work and home because of Covid-19 and the changes that it has forced on us &#8212; I can&#8217;t help but wonder whether LinkedIn will use this opportunity to rethink, or at least expand the concept of, what it means to spend time on its platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wall-mounted fitness startup Tonal this morning announced that it’s bringing live courses to it portfolio of strength training workouts. The company did a soft launch of the live offering back in December of last year, though at the time, it wasn’t live, so much as prerecorded &#8212; “live, on tape,” to steal a line from The Larry Sanders Show.</p>
<p>“[Y]our coach works out with you — just like in a live class,” the company wrote. Our Live (Beta) workouts combine the energizing feeling of working out alongside a coach with Tonal’s ability to count your reps and wait for you to complete each set […] It’s all on-demand, so you can work out whenever it fits into your schedule.”</p>
<p>The new offering brings the company’s content selection more in-line with leaders in the home fitness space like Peloton. Certainly live isn’t for everyone, but many users do appreciate the motivation that comes with a fixed schedule, as well as the sense of community one derives from working out with others.</p>
<p>The new offering provides real-time feedback from coaches, coupled with a “social zone” for interacting with fellow Tonal users. The portfolio is also getting four new coaches for live workouts. After a day, live workouts will be archived in Tonal’s on-demand offerings.</p>
<p>“As our community has grown over the past few years, we’ve been encouraged by the organic social engagement, the craving for more interaction with our coaches, and the excitement that comes from reaching new milestones,” founder and CEO Aly Orady said in a release. “Tonal Live will allow us to connect these elements through a studio experience while retaining the foundation of what differentiates our workouts: personalization, guidance, and feedback.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, the San Francisco-based company is among those connected fitness brands that saw a major boost as the pandemic forced many to rethink their workout routines. Tonal has raised $450 million to date, including a $250 million Series E that raised its valuation to $1.6 billion, back in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Redwood Materials, the company started by former Tesla co-founder JB Straubel that aims to create a circular supply chain for batteries, is expanding its business. While it has been known primarily as a recycling firm, Redwood plans to simplify the supply chain by producing critical battery materials right here in the U.S.</p>
<p>To get there, the company is currently scouting a location for a new million-square-foot factory, at a cost of over $1 billion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/a-tesla-co-founder-aims-to-build-an-entire-u-s-battery-industry">Bloomberg reported</a>. That factory would be dedicated to the production of cathodes and anode foils, the two essential building blocks of a lithium-ion battery structure &#8212; up to a projected volume of 100 gigawatt-hour per year&#8217;s worth of materials, enough for one million electric vehicles, by 2025.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IN9RXK2ph0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit/">Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit/embed/#?secret=IN9RXK2ph0" data-secret="IN9RXK2ph0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But that’s not all. By 2030, the company expects to increase its annual battery materials production to 500 GWh, enough to power five million electric vehicles.</p>
<p>These numbers are incredibly ambitious. If Redwood can pull it off, it would be putting itself squarely among the ranks of the largest materials giants in the world, many of which are located in Asia. BloombergNEF estimated that consolidating the cathode supply chain to the United States, and using a certain percentage of recycled materials, could cut emissions from battery-pack production by 41%.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202141" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202141" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2202141" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png 1764w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png?resize=768,375 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png?resize=680,332 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png?resize=1536,751 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202141" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redwood Materials <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Recycling alone won’t take the company to these kinds of production numbers, though Redwood is also planning to expand its recycling operations. Instead, the company said in a statement that it would produce the anodes and cathodes from both recycled batteries and “sustainably mined material.” For now, the company is staying mum on its partners for this new endeavor, but it will likely mean more announcements of partnerships and expansions in the future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is just the latest bold move from the company, which has been making moves to aggressively expand its footprint for months. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/redwood-materials-is-setting-up-shop-near-the-tesla-gigafactory-as-part-of-broader-expansion/">Earlier this summer</a>, Redwood said it would triple the size of its 150,000-square-foot recycling facility in Carson City, Nevada, and it also purchased 100 acres of land near Tesla and Panasonic’s Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada. The news also comes fresh off the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/">$700 million</a> Series C funding round from major investors, including Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Baillie Gifford and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The capital launched Redwood’s valuation to $3.7 billion.</p>

<p>The company has recycling deals with Tesla, Amazon, electric bus maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/recycling-startup-redwood-materials-is-partnering-with-proterra-to-supply-ev-battery-materials-sustainably/">Proterra</a>, and electric bike maker Specialized Bicycle Components. Redwood says it can recover between 95-98% of critical materials from recycled batteries, such as lithium, copper, nickel and cobalt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s biometric scanner for retail, the Amazon One palm reader, is expanding beyond the e-commerce giant&#8217;s own stores. The company <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-one-expands-beyond-retail-with-first-third-party-customer-ticketing-company-axs">announced</a> today it has acquired its initial third-party customer with ticketing company AXS, which will implement the Amazon One system at Denver, Colorado&#8217;s Red Rocks Amphitheatre as an option for contactless entry for event-goers.</p>
<p>This is the first time the Amazon One system will be used outside an Amazon-owned retail store, and the first time it&#8217;s used for entry into an entertainment venue. Amazon says it expects AXS to roll out the system to more venues in the future, but didn&#8217;t offer any specifics as to which ones or when.</p>

<p>At Red Rocks, guests will be able to associate their AXS Mobile ID with Amazon One at dedicated stations before they enter the amphitheatre, or they can enroll at a second station once inside in order to use the reader at future AXS events. The enrollment process takes about a minute and customers can choose to enroll either one or both palms. Once set up, ticketholders can use a dedicated entry line for Amazon One users.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud to work with Amazon to continue shaping the future of ticketing through cutting-edge innovation,&#8221; said Bryan Perez, CEO of AXS, in a statement. &#8220;We are also excited to bring Amazon One to our clients and the industry at a time when there is a need for fast, convenient, and contactless ticketing solutions. At AXS, we are continually deploying new technologies to develop secure and smarter ticketing offerings that improve the fan experience before, during, and after events,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Amazon&#8217;s palm reader was <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/innovation/introducing-amazon-one-a-new-innovation-to-make-everyday-activities-effortless">first introduced amid the pandemic</a> in September 2020, as a way for shoppers to pay at Amazon Go convenience stores using their palm. To use the system, customers would first insert their credit card then hover their palm over the device to associate their unique palm print with their payment mechanism. After setup, customers could enter the store just by holding their palm above the biometric scanner for a second or so. Amazon touted the system as a safer, &#8220;contactless&#8221; means of payment, as customers aren&#8217;t supposed to actually touch the reader. (Hopefully, that&#8217;s the case, considering the pandemic rages on.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the tech side, Amazon One uses computer vision technology to create the palm signatures, it said.</p>
<p>In the months that followed,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/amazon-expands-its-biometric-based-amazon-one-palm-reader-system-to-more-retail-stores/"> Amazon expanded the biometric system</a> to several more stores, including other Amazon Go convenience stores, Amazon Go Grocery stores and its Amazon Books and Amazon 4-star stores. This April, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/amazon-is-bringing-its-amazon-one-palm-scanner-to-select-whole-foods-as-a-payment-option/">brought the system</a> to select Whole Foods locations. To encourage more sign-ups, Amazon even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/">introduced</a> a $10 promotional credit to enroll your palm prints at its supported stores.</p>
<p>When palm prints are linked to Amazon accounts, the company is able to collect data from customers&#8217; offline activity to target ads, offers and recommendations over time. And the data remains with Amazon until a customer explicitly deletes it, or if the customer doesn&#8217;t use the feature for at least two years.</p>
<p>While the system offers an interesting take on contactless payments, Amazon&#8217;s track record in this area has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/">raised</a> privacy concerns. The company had in the past sold <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">biometric facial recognition services</a> to law enforcement in the U.S. Its facial recognition technology <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">was the subject of a data privacy lawsuit</a>. And it was found to be still storing Alexa voice data <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681423/amazon-alexa-echo-chris-coons-data-transcripts-recording-privacy">even after users deleted</a> their audio files.</p>
<p>Amazon has responded by noting its palm print images are encrypted and sent to a secure area built for Amazon One in the cloud where Amazon creates the customers’ palm signatures. It also has noted it allows customers to unenroll from either a device or from its website, one.amazon.com once all transactions have been processed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toyota Motor and Honda are urging legislators to reject a bill that would expand tax incentives for union-made electric vehicles that are built in the United States.</p>
<p>The proposal &#8212; which Toyota blasted as “blatantly biased” and “exorbitant” in a letter to Congress &#8212; would expand the federal tax incentives from $7,500 to as much as $12,500 for union- and domestically manufactured cars. Vehicles with batteries manufactured in the U.S. would be eligible for an additional $500. If the legislation passes, vehicles from automakers like Toyota, Honda and Tesla would be excluded from the expanded credit, while the “Big Three” manufacturers in Detroit would all qualify.</p>
<p>“The current [bill] draft makes the objective of accelerating the deployment of electrified vehicles secondary by discriminating against American autoworkers based on their choice not to unionize,” Toyota said in a letter to lawmakers. “This is unfair, it is wrong, and we ask you to reject this blatantly biased proposal.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The automaker further said that the bill favors the wealthy &#8212; people that may not need public funds to purchase an electric vehicle. There is a means-testing provision in the bill that would limit access to the credit to individuals making an adjusted income of up to $400,000, or households that make up to $800,000. Whether to set an income cap &#8212; and what that income cap should be &#8212; has been a major point of contention between congressional Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>The bill also received criticism from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who said on Twitter that it was “written by Ford/UAW lobbyists, as they make their electric car in Mexico. Not obvious how this serves American taxpayers.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is written by Ford/UAW lobbyists, as they make their electric car in Mexico. Not obvious how this serves American taxpayers. <a href="https://t.co/FUUXARHlby">https://t.co/FUUXARHlby</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This would be the first such increase to the up to $7,500 tax credit for EVs since it was put into effect over a decade ago. The bill would also do away with a stipulation that exempts vehicles made by OEMs that have sold over 200,000 EVs from the credit, meaning that General Motor and Tesla cars would once again be eligible.</p>
<p>The bill did receive praise from GM, Ford Motor and Stellantis, three major automakers with workforces represented by the United Auto Workers union. The UAW also supports the proposal.</p>
<p>It’s being considered Tuesday by the House Ways and Means Committee. The expanded credit is just one part of a massive $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill that’s currently being debated by Congress and that includes a whole slew of socially progressive proposals meant to target education, healthcare and climate change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you&#8217;re hot, you&#8217;re hot. And 1047 Games is making the most of the heat generated by <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/play-now">Splitgate</a>, its first game and now a breakout success. After working on a shoestring for years, the team has since May raised <em>three</em> rounds, the latest for a massive $100 million.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Ian Proulx credited a dedicated community and, as he described it, &#8220;taking a Silicon Valley approach to running a game business.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time 1047 Games was founded, about five years ago, free to play (F2P) PC games were a niche genre. While games like World of Tanks and Warframe were seeing success, and of course many mobile games relying on in-app purchases, Fortnite had yet to show the industry that F2P could be so ludicrously profitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five years ago it was very hit-driven: You spend years developing a product, put all this money into hyping the launch and then hope it&#8217;s a success,&#8221; Proulx explained. &#8220;Our process was, there&#8217;s no way we can take that risk — if we spent our entire budget and got it wrong, we&#8217;re out of business. So we thought, let&#8217;s do a soft launch, put it out there and see what happens, learn, listen, look at the data. Why would I spend money marketing a product that I have no idea about whether it will be a success? If we wanted to spend money, and we didn&#8217;t have a lot, I&#8217;d rather spend it on a product that has great metrics and KPIs.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with it, Splitgate is a multiplayer online competitive shooter with a lot of DNA from the old-school arena shooters like Quake 3, Unreal Tournament and Halo. Those games are frenetic enough, but Splitgate adds the ability to bend space with portals, like the eponymous Portal, adding a truly ridiculous amount of mobility to the action.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201709" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201709" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2201709" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png" alt="Screenshot of the game Splitgate showing a player aiming through a portal" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2201709" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> 1047 Games</p></div></p>
<p>Proulx said investors shut the door on him repeatedly because they didn&#8217;t see Splitgate competing in any of the popular genres, battle royales and hero shooters, for instance. But he felt confident that this update to a familiar formula would be a success partly because the demand was there, just sleeping. &#8220;People grew up playing these games, and the reason [the market] is dead is not because they stopped loving them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No one has moved the needle because there hasn&#8217;t been a lot of innovation, and there hasn&#8217;t been something that&#8217;s accessible to the masses. Quake Arena is great, but it&#8217;s extremely difficult. No 12-year-old Fortnite kid is gonna play it. We really do fill this void.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While gameplay-wise Splitgate is most obviously similar to classic shooters, Proulx said a better comparison would be Rocket League, another huge success story in gaming that took a great concept and provided it as cheaply as possible, making money off cosmetic items and other totally optional perks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can just have fun, turn your brain off and play, but there&#8217;s this limitless skill ceiling,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t spring fully formed from 1047 in 2019, though. The team put out the gaming equivalent of a minimum viable product. &#8220;It was fun, and the basics were there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but we learned there&#8217;s way more to running a business and free-to-play than just having a fun game.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5XKcTM_NM8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The danger for any game is simply that people stop playing, so the team focused on retention and on listening to feedback from the community to make Splitgate a &#8220;forever game&#8221; that can go years, with &#8220;seasons,&#8221; new features and maps, and so on.</p>
<p>The original MVP release saw some traction, around 600,000 downloads in its first month, but the big multiplatform relaunch — still as an &#8220;open beta&#8221; — this summer made a huge splash, pulling in more than 10 <em>million</em> in July.</p>
<p>Suddenly the tables had turned and 1047 was holding, as Proulx put it, &#8220;lightning in a bottle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our first round six months ago was extremely difficult. We talked to every investor on the planet and they all said no,&#8221; he recalled. But the hard work paid off: &#8220;We got lucky and ended up with the perfect partners — I can&#8217;t stress enough how supportive our investors have been.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next round (with Human Capital, just as Splitgate was taking off, went from phone call to funding over a weekend. This third round, with 1047 picking and choosing, was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from &#8220;Insight Partners, Anthos Capital, and earlier seed round investors Galaxy Interactive, VGames, Human Capital, Lakestar, DraperDragon, and Draper University&#8221; (from the press release).</p>
<p>One wonders what a team of fewer than 10 people could possibly do with $100 million ($116 million if you count the two previous rounds). But the bet investors are making is not that 1047 is going to suddenly make Assassin&#8217;s Creed, but rather that they think 10 million (and rising) people playing a unique game is potentially a huge opportunity — <em>if</em> the developers have the chance to follow through. This post-hype period is the valley of death for many games, the developers starved for cash after streamers and curious casuals move on. But the funding means that, for 1047, it&#8217;s license to hire like mad and double down.</p>
<p>&#8220;The scope of what we can do is now through the roof,&#8221; said Proulx. &#8220;There&#8217;s so much we couldn&#8217;t think about because we were a tiny team with a tiny budget, but now everything is on the table. We&#8217;re focusing on the long term — I look at the game as being 25% done. We don&#8217;t need to be Fortnite tomorrow, but now it really is about building the next Riot Games, the next big games business.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Splitgate itself is still on the road to 1.0 and Proulx says the team can now truly focus on making it the game they and the community have been shaping it to be for years. He noted that many players have stuck by the team for years and helped make the game what it is, and that their input is just as important now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We read everything, we&#8217;re listening — keep the feedback coming. We&#8217;re still operating like the indie team that had to stay close with our community. We&#8217;re still in that mindset,&#8221; Proulx said, &#8220;but now we just have a ridiculous amount of money.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a>, the popular auto editing tool, announced the release of Grammarly for Developers today. The company is starting this effort with the Text Editor SDK (software development kit), which enables programmers to embed Grammarly text editing functionality into any web application.</p>
<p>Rob Brazier, head of product and platform at Grammarly, says that the beta release of this SDK gives developers access to the full power of Grammarly automated editing with a couple of lines of code. &#8220;Literally in just a couple lines of HTML, [developers] can add Grammarly&#8217;s assistance to their application, and they get a native Grammarly experiences available to all of their users without the users needing to install or register Grammarly,&#8221; Brazier told me.</p>
<p>Underneath the hood, these developers are getting access to highly sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) technology without requiring any artificial intelligence understanding or experience whatsoever. Instead, developers can take advantage of the work that Grammarly has already done.</p>
<p>While users of the target application don&#8217;t need to be Grammarly customers (and that is in fact the idea), if they do happen to be, they can log into their Grammarly accounts and access all of the functionality that comes with that. &#8220;If their users have a Grammarly subscription, those users can link their Grammarly accounts into the developer&#8217;s application. They can sign in with Grammarly and unlock the additional features of their particular subscriptions [directly] in that application,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Brazier said that because this is a starting point, the company wanted to keep it basic, get feedback on the beta and then add additional capabilities in the future. &#8220;We wanted to start with the simplest possible way of giving access to this capability to the greatest number of users. So that&#8217;s why we started with a pretty simple product. I think it&#8217;ll evolve over time and grow in sophistication, but it is really just a couple lines of code and you&#8217;re up and running,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This is the company&#8217;s first dip into the developer tool space, allowing programmers to access Grammarly functionality and embed it in their applications. This is not unlike the approach Zoom took last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/zoom-introduces-new-sdk-to-help-developers-tap-into-video-services/">when it released an SDK</a> to tap into video services (although Zoom is much further along <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/will-zoom-apps-be-the-next-hot-startup-platform/">on this developer tool journey</a>). As companies like Grammarly and Zoom grow in popularity, it seems the next logical step is to expose the strengths of the platform, in this case text editing, to let developers take advantage of it. In fact, Salesforce was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/22/how-salesforce-paved-the-way-for-the-saas-platform-approach/">the first to implement this idea</a> in 2007 when it launched Force.com.</p>
<p>This approach also will potentially provide another source of revenue for Grammarly beyond the subscription versions of the product, although Brazier says it&#8217;s too early to say what shape that will take. Regardless, today&#8217;s announcement is just the first step in a broader strategy to expose different parts of the platform to developers and enable them to take advantage of all the work Grammarly&#8217;s engineers put into the platform. Interested developers <a href="https://developer.grammarly.com/">can apply</a> to be part of the beta program.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://millions.co">Millions.co</a>, a social commerce platform geared toward professional and semi-professional athletes wanting help to monetize their fanbase by selling merch and/or on-demand video, has grabbed $10 million in funding led by Boston-based Volition Capital.</p>
<p>The round is being loosely pegged as a Series A as the seasoned team behind Millions self-funded the first wave of development to get the platform launched.</p>
<p>The founding team includes CEO Matt Whitteker, a boxing gym owner who co-founded the supply chain data management unicorn Assent Compliance and NoNotes.com; CMO Brandon Austin, co-founder of Go-Fish Cam; and, in advisor roles, Adrian Salamunovic, co-founder of DNA 11 and CanvasPop; Scott Whitteker (Fight for the Cure) and Bruce Buffer (a veteran sports announcer).</p>
<p><a href="https://millions.co">Millions</a> launched its fan engagement social commerce platform in April &#8212; with an initial three products for pro/semi-pro athletes to pitch at their followers: Namely custom merchandize (including a free design service); ask-me-anything personalized videos; and a pay-per-view streaming offering that lets fans pay to tune into a livestream of their favorite sportsperson.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s initial plan had been to build just an e-<span style="font-weight: 400;">commerce and merchandising platform but, having built that component, Salamunovic says the team decided to bundle in video products &#8212; such as personalized videos and &#8220;democratising&#8221; pay-per-view (PPV). </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our biggest advantage and differentiator is that we are strictly focused on the sports world and fan engagement,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The obvious indirect competitors are Twitch (heavily focused on e-sports/gaming), Patreon (focused on creators), Represent.com (focused on merch drops for &#8216;influencers&#8217;), and even OnlyFans (we know who they focus on) but we’re laser-focused on the multibillion-dollar sports market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cameo has a very similar product to our video &#8216;Ask Me Anything&#8217; platform &#8212; but we don’t focus on birthday shout-outs we focus on allowing fans to ask their favorite athletes questions around their training, their success, predictions (we’ve seen a lot of gamblers use our platform to get tips) and less on things like shout-outs,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We love <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/cameo/">Cameo</a>, but we’re really different and focused on sports.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MY6s9teGIf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/cameo/">Cameo raises $50M to deliver personalized messages from celebrities &#038; influencers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cameo raises $50M to deliver personalized messages from celebrities &#038; influencers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/cameo/embed/#?secret=MY6s9teGIf" data-secret="MY6s9teGIf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook are all great social media platforms that allow athletes to engage and interact with their fans but it’s not a great place to monetize your audience,&#8221; Salamunovic also argues. &#8220;We help athletes create a brand, build a merch line, sell video content (personalized videos and watch parties all on a single platform). We’re not trying to replace any of these platforms, we’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complementing them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by allowing the athletes to provide a single link and landing page for deeper interaction and monetization. The fans seem to love it too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>At this stage, Millions only has around 300 athlete profiles live but says it has &#8220;thousands&#8221; who&#8217;ve registered interest across a variety of sports categories.</p>
<p>Its first focus &#8212; including for partnerships with agencies and sports leagues &#8212; has been on &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">combat sports and gyms&#8221;. But the platform has a long list of sports types in the search filter &#8212; from lacrosse to water polo to baseball or gymnastics &#8212; so the ambition is to go after a very broad funnel of pro/semi sportspeople. </span></p>
<p>And for every Michael Jordan or Cristiano Ronaldo &#8212; aka, those top-tier athletes who can command hundreds of millions in sponsorship fees by inking partnerships with top brands to promote their products and who you certainly won&#8217;t find selling hats on Millions &#8212; there are scores of athletes who aren&#8217;t able to cut such sweet deals and who will have far more modest fanbases.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that broad field of players and performers who Millions hopes will flock to its platform &#8212; and take up its dedicated offer of social commerce tools and tech to engage with and monetize their followers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commenting on the funding in a statement, Sean Cantwell, managing partner at Volition Capital, suggested: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Athletes are always looking for ways to connect on a deeper level with fans, generate additional revenue streams and build their personal brands and Millions offers all of this on a single platform. We think that Millions is the future of fan engagement.”</span></p>
<p>To help grease the funnel of sportspeople it needs to drive eyeballs to its platform, Millions is offering athletes a &#8220;signing bonus&#8221; when they join and start selling &#8212; with a variety of tiers of bonus (of up to $5K) per sportsperson.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We initially wanted to stay hyper-focused on combat sports and not try to &#8216;boil the ocean&#8217;. Now we’re releasing new athletes&#8217; profiles daily and introducing new sports like football, volleyball, golf and more,&#8221; notes Salamunovic. &#8220;Really, this platform is designed for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">any athlete</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who wants to reach their fans and create new monetization channels without having to put a ton of effort into things like page design, technology, design or logistics&#8230; we take care of all that so they can focus on engaging with their fans and most importantly on their sport and training.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re looking to build the most important sports tech company in history,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We’re going to be the Etsy ($21 billion market cap) of sports. That’s an ambitious statement but it&#8217;s true; 98% of athletes NEED our product/platform.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Chasing that scale is why Millions is raising now<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> And while the early focus has been on North America &#8212; where about 90% of the onboarded sportspeople hail from currently &#8212; it reckons there&#8217;s &#8220;huge growth potential&#8221; in Europe and Asia so is very much gunning to build a global business.</p>
<p>It says it&#8217;ll be splashing Series A cash on growing its<span style="font-weight: 400;"> product engineering team and recruiting to expand its team generally, as well as spending on marketing to get the word out to athletes and get more signed up to build their own brands and sell direct to fans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe a powerful thing we’re doing, past just the product offering, is enabling athletes to have a team,&#8221; adds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Austin. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Millions, athletes get a marketing team, a personal account manager, and a design team that they can use to build their brand and product line, and to promote to, and further build, their fan base. We allow the athlete to focus on training, playing/fighting, and winning while we help take care of everything else, and coach them on how to brand and market themselves.” </span></p>
<p>Millions&#8217; business model is to take a 20% cut of all sales athletes make via the platform &#8212; with the split remaining the same for merchandise or video sales.</p>
<p>For the former, Millions is using a global network of print-on-demand suppliers to do the fulfilment.</p>
<p>While products the platform can customize for athletes to sell as their own brand merch include t-shirts, caps and hoodies.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Sonos has sold home theater products for a long time, but the company has made the living room even more of a priority in recent years. It started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-27-sonos-beam-review.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">with the Sonos Beam</a>, a smaller and more affordable version of the flagship Playbar soundbar. And 2020’s new flagship, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-010039560.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">the Sonos Arc</a>, was the company’s first soundbar capable of Dolby Atmos playback.</p>
<p>Today, the <a href="https://fave.co/2Q8qqn8" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Beam" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Beam</a> is getting a major upgrade. The new, second-generation Beam goes <a href="https://fave.co/2Q8qqn8" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:on sale today" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">on sale today</a> for $449 and will be available on October 5th. That’s $50 more than before, in line with the other price increases Sonos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-raising-prices-september-12-174153206.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">announced last week</a>. The good news is that the new Beam is more capable than its predecessor in a number of ways. We’ll have to review it before we can really say if it’s worth the extra $50, but there are a number of notable new features here.</p>
<p>The new Beam looks nearly identical to its predecessor, aside from a new perforated polycarbonate grille instead of the cloth front found on the original. It also has the same speaker components inside: a center tweeter, four woofers, and three passive bass radiators. What’s different is that the new processor inside the Beam is 40 percent faster, which opens up a lot of new audio formats.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-09%2F19eb6d30-14dd-11ec-bac3-6ed10307fd94&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=c93fb3944e4b3527e8719b229be3cf831e0c1e59" alt="Sonos Beam (gen 2)" data-uuid="a6ea4fed-59ef-32d4-8695-c67c838ae170" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div>
</figure>
<p>Most notably, the gen-two Beam supports Dolby Atmos, for movies, TV and music (the latter in a limited fashion, for now). Scott Fink, a product manager at Sonos who worked on the new Beam, says that the horsepower from the new CPU let the company increase the speaker arrays — not the specific speaker components, but, as Fink explains, “the set of software that coordinates the playback and interaction of all the speakers together in the soundbar.” The new Beam has five arrays, up from the three in the older model, and Fink said that the extras are dedicated to surround sound and height info.</p>
<p>All told, the Beam supports the same home theater audio formats <a href="https://support.sonos.com/s/article/4945?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0">as the Arc</a>(including Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, Multichannel PCM and more), which costs twice as much as the Beam. In addition to the increased processing power, the new Beam has HDMI eARC to facilitate these new formats. Sonos says the speaker should have improved dialog clarity thanks to the additional audio processing power, something that should make the currently-available speech enhancement feature work better than before.</p>
<p>The hardware also supports additional music formats, as well. The Beam (as well as the Arc) will soon support the Ultra HD and Dolby Atmos formats from Amazon Music. Some Sonos speakers have worked with a handful of HD music services for a while now, but this is the first time that a 3D music format will work with the company’s products. I asked if there were any plans to support Dolby Atmos on Apple Music, and unsurprisingly the company wasn’t willing to say yet. But, there shouldn’t be any technical reason, it’s just a matter of Sonos and Apple working together to get more Apple Music formats supported.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-09%2F5e258d50-14dd-11ec-bbbb-043e27acfed2&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=9333b785a2447bfed0858373f29fb25254a1845d" alt="Sonos Beam (gen 2)" data-uuid="25c287ff-9baa-30f6-a9a4-eb241cd92d3b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div>
</figure>
<p>As with other Sonos products, the new Beam connects to the company’s other speakers for multi-room playback; you can also use other Sonos speakers as surrounds. You can tune the speaker to your room to improve the sound using Trueplay, assuming you have an iOS device. The Beam also has far-field microphones so it can receive voice commands through either Alexa or the Google Assistant, but that’s not required (there’s a mic mute button right on top of the Beam, too). Like some other recent Sonos speakers, the new Beam has NFC to make setup even easier — playing your phone running the Sonos app near it will automatically connect it to your WiFi network.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Based on what Sonos has said so far, the <a href="https://fave.co/2Q8qqn8" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:new Beam" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">new Beam</a> is probably not a crucial upgrade for most, unless you’ve been itching to get Dolby Atmos into your setup without spending a ton of money. But given that the Beam is already the best-selling compact soundbar (according to NPD data), these upgrades should help it keep its lead over the competition — even with that $50 price hike.</p>

At 51 grams, though, it&#8217;s a bit heavier than the social network&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">Ray-Ban Stories</a>. In addition, the glasses also has an indicator light that shows when the 5-megapixel camera is in use.</p>

<p>Xiaomi&#8217;s Smart Glasses are powered by a quad-core ARM processor and run on Android. They also use MicroLED imaging technology, which is known for having a higher brightness and longer lifespan than OLED. The company says the technology has a simpler structure that enabled it to create a compact display with individual pixels sized at 4μm. You won&#8217;t be able to view the images you take in color, though — Xiaomi says it opted to use a monochrome display solution &#8220;to allow sufficient light to pass through complicated optical structures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The grating structure etched onto the inner surface of the lens allows light to be refracted in a unique way, directing it safely into the human eye. The refraction process involves bouncing light beams countless times, allowing the human eye to see a complete image, and greatly increasing usability while wearing. All this is done inside a single lens, instead of using complicated multiples lens systems, mirrors, or half mirrors as some other products do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Its smart glasses won&#8217;t be just a second screen for your phone, according to Xiaomi. It&#8217;s independently capable of many things, such as selecting the most important notifications to show you, including smart home alarms and messages from important contacts. The device&#8217;s navigation capability can display maps and directions in front of your eyes. It can also show you the number of whoever&#8217;s currently calling your phone, and you can take the call using the smart glasses&#8217; built in mic and speakers.</p>
<p>That mic will be able to pick up speech, as well, which Xiaomi&#8217;s proprietary translating algorithm can translate in real time. The glasses&#8217; translation feature also works&#8217; on written text and text on photos captures through its camera. Unfortunately, the company has yet to announce a price or a launch date for the glasses, but we&#8217;ll keep you updated when it does.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[What would you pay for $1 of BNPL GMV?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s a two-Exchange Tuesday, everyone. First up, we&#8217;re talking fintech valuations. Next up, we&#8217;re digging into Atlanta.</p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s news that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/">PayPal intends to buy Japanese startup Paidy</a> marked the second major acquisition of a buy now, pay later (BNPL) company this year. PayPal&#8217;s news followed an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">even larger deal by Square for the Australian BNPL company Afterpay</a>.</p>
<p>The multibillion-dollar exits provided hard market proof that what BNPL startups are building has value beyond simple operating results; major fintech platforms are willing to shell out large sums for their revenues and possible strategic value.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Because both deals happened in 2021, they provide two data points for the value of BNPL companies operating at scale. And because both Square and PayPal provided some information to their investors concerning their transactions, we have a little bit of comparative work to do.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do a little math and figure out how much PayPal and Square investors are paying for transaction volume across both platforms. Then, we&#8217;ll peek at what Affirm is worth along similar lines. We&#8217;ll wrap with a look at Klarna&#8217;s numbers to see if there&#8217;s anything we can dig up there.</p>

This will be fun!</p>
<h2>What would you pay for $1 of BNPL GMV?</h2>
<p>Square&#8217;s Afterpay deal is worth some $29 billion, a huge sum. It isn&#8217;t hard to see why the U.S. consumer- and business-focused fintech is willing to write so large a check &#8212; Afterpay does <em>volume</em>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[EverAfter's customer-facing tool streamlines onboarding and retention and enables B2B clients to embed personalized customer portals within any product.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://everafter.ai/">EverAfter</a> secured $13 million in seed funding to continue developing its no-code customer-facing tool that streamlines onboarding and retention and enables business-to-business clients to embed personalized customer portals within any product.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv-based company was founded in 2020 by Noa Danon and Tal Shemesh. CEO Danon, who comes from a project management background, said they saw a disconnect between the user and product experience.</p>
<p>The company’s name, EverAfter, comes from the concept that in SaaS companies, someone has to be in charge of the “EverAfter,” with customers, even as the relationship changes, Danon told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Via its no-code platform, customer success teams are able to build a website in weeks using drop-and-drag widgets like training materials, timelines, task management and meeting summaries, and then configure what each user sees. Then there is a snippet of code that is embedded into the product.</p>
<p>EverAfter also integrates with existing customer relationship management, project management and service ticket tools, while also updating Salesforce and HubSpot directly through an interface.</p>
<p>“It’s like the customer owns a piece of real estate inside the product,” Danon said.</p>
<p>TLV Partners and Vertex Ventures co-led the round and were joined by angel investors Benny Shneider, Zohar Gilon and Amit Gilon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yanai Oron, general partner at Vertex Ventures, said he is seeing best-in-breed companies try to solve customer churn or improve the relationship process on their own and failing, which speaks to the complexity of the problem.</p>
<p>Startups in this space are coming online and raising money, but with EverAfter, they are differentiating themselves by not only putting a dashboard on their product, but launching with the capabilities to manage thousands of customers using the product, he added.</p>
<p>“I’ve been tracking the customer success space over the past few years, and it is a growing field with the least sophisticated tools,” Oron said. “During COVID, companies realized it was easier to retain customers rather than get new ones. We are all used to more self-service and wanting to get the answer ourselves, and customers are the same. Companies also started to be more at ease in letting customers develop things on their own and leave R&amp;D departments to do other things.”</p>
<p>Clients include Taboola, AppsFlyer and Verbit, with Verbit reporting its company’s customer success managers save 10 hours a week managing ongoing customer communication by using EverAfter, Danon added. This comes as CallMiner reports that <a href="https://pages.callminer.com/US-CallMiner-Churn-Index-2020.html">unplanned customer churn</a> costs companies $35.3 billion in the U.S. alone.</p>
<p>EverAfter offers both customer success and partner management software and clients can choose a high-touch service or kits and templates for self-service.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to focus on integration and expansion into additional use cases. Since being founded, EverAfter has grown to 20 employees and 30 customers. The founders also want to utilize the data they are collecting on what works and doesn’t work for each customer.</p>
<p>“There are so many interesting things that happen between companies and customers, from onboarding to business reviews, and we are going to expand on those,” Danon said. “We want to be the first thing companies put inside their product to figure out the relationship between customers and customer success teams and managers.”</p>
