										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin’s failed lawsuit against NASA over the Human Landing System (HLS) contract, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/federal-judge-quashes-bezos-lawsuit-against-nasa-over-spacex-contract/">thrown out by a judge</a> last week, and the growing progress of the Chinese space program were at the top of mind for NASA officials during a Tuesday briefing updating the public on the agency’s Artemis program.</p>
<p>NASA Administration Bill Nelson had strong words on the lawsuit, saying that the agency lost “nearly seven months in litigation” over HLS, leading to two of the forthcoming missions pushed back by a year or more. Now, Artemis-2 will take place in May 2024, while Artemis-3 – which aims to put the first woman and the first person of color on the moon – will take place no earlier than 2025. (Artemis-1, an uncrewed mission and the first to use NASA’s Space Launch System and Orion capsule, is on track for early 2022.)</p>
<p>The Artemis program is an ambitious series of planned launches by NASA to return humans to the moon since the days of the Apollo program. The HLS will be the final capsule that will transport astronauts to the lunar surface.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231700" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Blue Origin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-goes-toe-to-toe-with-nasa-in-federal-court-over-award-to-spacex/">brought the lawsuit</a> against NASA over the HLS award in August, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/feds-dismantle-blue-origin-and-dynetics-protests-of-nasas-spacex-lunar-lander-award/">unsuccessfully petitioning</a> the Government Accountability Office over the agency’s decision to award the HLS to SpaceX. Blue argued that NASA’s evaluation of proposals was “unlawful and improper” and has stated in other protests that a single contract award was anti-competitive.</p>
<p>However, it’s unclear whether the legal battle with Blue Origin is the sole reason, or even the dominant reason, for why the missions have been delayed. For instance, Nelson also noted that the Trump Administration’s target of 2024 for the third mission “was not grounded in technical feasibility,” and that Congress did not appropriate enough funds to support the development of multiple human landing systems.</p>
<p>The Senate budget committee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/senate-budget-committee-tells-nasa-to-select-two-developers-for-lunar-lander-program/">was very clear</a> that it wants NASA to select two developers for the HLS program, but it only earmarked an additional $100 million for the agency to do so.</p>
<p>“After having taken a look under the hood for the last six months, it’s clear to me that the agency will need to make serious changes for the long-term success of the program,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He also pointed to COVID as another reason for the delay, which has caused supply chain disruptions and impacts to the workforce.</p>
<h2>Nelson: “We are facing a very aggressive and good Chinese space program”</h2>
<p>Nelson also repeatedly brought up China’s rapidly advancing space program, noting that the country is “increasingly capable” of landing taikonauts on the moon. He vowed that NASA would be as aggressive as it could be in a safe and technically feasibly way “to beat our competitors with boots on the moon.”</p>
<p>The Chinese space program has progressed over the past few years at a jaw-dropping pace, quickly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/china-launches-3-astronauts-to-its-new-space-station-core-module/">launching the first core module</a> of an independent space station earlier this year. It was the third of eleven planned launches through 2022 to get the station up and running. China has also landed a rover on Mars – the only other nation besides the U.S. to do so – and plans for a more complex sample return mission from the Red Planet by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Statements that the Chinese space program, which includes the Chinese military, have made give us indications that they are going to be very aggressive,&#8221; Nelson said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disrupting the traditional MBA may be the most tried, tested and tweaked edtech startup pitch out there. And rightfully so: Business school is damn expensive and largely reserved for a select group of people who have the time and money to invest in elite education.</p>
<p>While no single company has perfectly cracked the code yet, <a href="https://www.stoaschool.com/">Stoa School</a> isn’t phased. The Goa-based startup has raised millions to bring an unaccredited, high-quality alternative to higher business education in India amid a broader awakening of the country’s growing startup scene. The startup’s initial raise, a $1.5 million pre-seed party round, includes Udemy and Maven co-founder Gagan Biyani, Better Capital founder Vaibhav Domkundwar, Teachable co-founder Ankur Nagpal, NotBoring Media founder Packy McCormick, Dunce Capital investor John Danner and Zivame co-founder Richa Kar.</p>
<p>“People want to know more about startups and perhaps transition from working at a corporate job,” said co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/kunksed">Raj Kunkolienkar</a>, who estimates that headcount demands for Indian startups have gone up by 40% over the past year. His co-founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/bizaditya">Aditya Kulkarn</a>i, added that the startup is positioning itself “as a way to [fill] startup jobs, because not everyone is accustomed to ‘what is CAC, what is GTM and what is LTV.’</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231608" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The initial insight that eventually led to Stoa&#8217;s formation, per Kulkarni, was the fact that students in India don&#8217;t have many options to pursue a business education — unless they&#8217;re able to get into the Indian School of Business (ISB) or move to the United States. At the same time, Kunkolienkar was running a Lambda School for India, but realizing that &#8220;the financing and collections infrastructure in India isn&#8217;t evolved enough to run ISAs at scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Stoa offers a six-month part-time program, StoaMBA, that combines tech relevant skills with business fundamentals for all participants. The majority of live programming happens on the weekends through cohort–based learning, business case hackathons and basic lectures with asynchronous learning happening throughout the week. On average, students spend 12 hours a week, three weeks a month with the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our idea is to give a sort of complete 360-degree overview of different business areas,&#8221; said Kunkolienkar. He estimates that during the 24 weeks, about 30% of the program is focused on foundational skills such as how to work with data and research better. The remaining time is reserved for deep dives into specific in-demand roles, such as digital marketing roles or product strategy tips.</p>
<p>The startup admits that it&#8217;s not at scale yet to be helping all of India&#8217;s startups fill empty sales roles, so it&#8217;s currently focused on training people to be generalists within the operations and sales world. StoaMBA is currently priced at $3,400, with the majority of students paying upfront. Stoa has partnerships that allow it to offer EMI-based financing options, in which students can pay on a monthly basis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In order to truly become an alternative to the traditional MBA, Stoa will need to focus on quality assurance of curriculum, measurable outcomes and continuous proof that unaccredited curriculum can make a difference in students’ lives.</p>
<h2>Understanding the unaccredited mindset</h2>
<p>Being the first layer between job seekers and their first job in tech may help Stoa avoid competing with bigger players, but this opportunity could be its biggest challenge, too.</p>
<p>Between cohort 1 and 2, only 40 out of 100 people opted into the startup’s career services, 38 of which made the transition into a new role. While the co-founders leaned more on the success of those who opted in versus why 60% didn’t, the imbalance could be illustrative of other market forces. Down the road, the startup is experimenting with creating a different program for those who want to undergo a serious career transition, those who want to learn basics and understand more about tech or those who want to learn single skills to upskill within their current roles.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people who apply to Stoa are looking for clarity,&#8221; said Kulkarni. &#8220;You want a certain change, but the first step toward evaluating that is whether I want to even do the change or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>While anecdotes and happy students can show the value of online learning, every bootcamp eventually gets to a place where they have to prove return of investment in order to scale. Flockjay, a bootcamp startup that helps laid off people and job seekers break into tech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/flockjay-cuts-at-least-half-of-its-workforce-as-it-pivots-away-from-bootcamps-into-b2b-saas/">recently cut half of its own employees</a> amid a broader pivot to a B2B SaaS platform. Lambda School, which has juggled lawsuits, layoffs and fundraises over the past few years, has been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-promised-lucrative-tech-coding-career-low-job-placement-2021-10">scrutinized for shoddy marketing tactics around its job placement rates. </a></p>
<p>The startup also needs to bolster its diversity efforts, especially as a lot of its focus is accessibility. The co-founders currently estimate that 75% of its students are men and 25% are women. Given that female representation in Indian startups is decreasing due to the cost of maternity leave and inherent biases, Stoa has an opportunity to question the status quo — not reinforce it. Its cap table appears to be largely male, so having more female representation behind it could help with strategy. Kulkarni said that Stoa has offered scholarships to women but said &#8220;there&#8217;s definitely something that needs to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, Stoa is yet another example of the growing difference between entrepreneurs who believe the future is unaccredited courses and those that believe accreditation is the only way to win legitimacy within higher education.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a six-month degree, and Indian regulators are never going to accept that kind of degree or diploma,&#8221; said Kunkolienkar. &#8220;There are very specific rules around what is accredited here in India.&#8221; Stoa says it is set on not going the &#8220;degree way&#8221; because it wants to retain control over the brand, the curriculum and the ability to change and iterate fast.</p>
<p>As a result, Stoa’s brand will matter materially to its long-term health. In other words, it may be able to give a stamp of approval to a solid number of folks, but without the sign-off from regulators will hiring managers care about that stamp?</p>
<p>&#8220;India is obviously a society [and] culture that values credentialism a ton, but I think they have a cool opportunity to rebuild what an MBA does, means and delivers for the entire country,&#8221; said Ankur Nagpal, founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/vibe-capital-is-a-new-venture-firm-built-for-scrappy-international-founders/">Vibe Capital</a> and investor in the startup. &#8220;I think they have done brand-building and [developed an] alumni network well enough that it’s become an aspirational brand to those in the know.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Deck and Y Combinator have shown that it is possible to scale signal as a service to a certain extent, since both programs come with hints of prestige and community for those who graduate. While the accelerators are for insiders who may understand the nuances of business, Stoa thinks it can conquer those who want to enter the startup ecosystem, per the co-founders.</p>
<p>But landing a job in tech can sometimes be harder and more complex than starting a company. Stoa’s next, venture-backed steps will hopefully change that by removing traditional gatekeepers and teaching through example.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/project-relate/">looking for help developing</a> an Android app aimed at providing more communication options for people with speech impairments. Project Relate, as the effort and app is now called, will provide voice transcription and synthesis that could make it easier for users to be understood.</p>
<p>The project is descended from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/googles-project-euphonia-wants-to-make-voice-recognition-work-for-people-with-speech-impairments/">Project Euphonia</a>, which we covered back in 2019 when it was first announced and later when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/google-details-ai-work-behind-project-euphonias-more-inclusive-speech-recognition/">published some of its research</a>. The effort was spearheaded by Google research scientist Dimitri Kanevsky, who himself has impaired speech and brought firsthand knowledge to the AI-based solution. Now one of the project&#8217;s main partners and users of the app is Aubrie Lee, who&#8217;s on the marketing team there (she named the app) and due to muscular dystrophy has trouble being understood by both other people and apps. (You can see her in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/EU2oCVlzEZk">here</a> or below.)</p>
<p>The simple fact is that speech recognition engines need lots of recorded speech to learn how to interpret it correctly, and that data is biased in favor of common speech patterns. People with accents aren&#8217;t as well represented in these datasets, so they aren&#8217;t understood as well — and people with speech impairments are even less commonly included, making it practically impossible for them to use common voice-powered devices.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231483" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/speechmatics-pushes-forward-recognition-of-accented-english/">Startups and improvements to the basic tech</a> are improving the understanding of accented language, but it takes a special effort to collect and analyze the highly individualized speech patterns of those with impairments and disabilities. Every voice is different, but uncommon and unique patterns like those resulting from a stroke or injury can be tough for a machine learning system to understand reliably.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XDncA0Wmgu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/speechmatics-pushes-forward-recognition-of-accented-english/">Speechmatics pushes forward recognition of accented English</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Speechmatics pushes forward recognition of accented English&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/speechmatics-pushes-forward-recognition-of-accented-english/embed/#?secret=XDncA0Wmgu" data-secret="XDncA0Wmgu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Project Relate is at its core a better voice transcription tool for those with speech impairments. The &#8220;Listen&#8221; function turns the user&#8217;s speech directly into text, so it can be pasted elsewhere or read by others. &#8220;Repeat&#8221; listens first then repeats what they&#8217;ve said in a voice that&#8217;s hopefully clearer. &#8220;Assistant&#8221; basically forwards their transcribed speech directly to Google Assistant for common tasks like playing music or asking about the weather.</p>
<p>To enable these capabilities, the work at Google has been first to collect as much data as possible, and to that end the researchers note they&#8217;ve built a database of over a million speech samples by volunteers. This was used to train up what might be called the base level of intelligence for the speech-recognition AI. But like any other ML system, the more data — and the more specific that data is to the individual use case — the better.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EU2oCVlzEZk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;We know the community of people with speech impairments is incredibly diverse and how people will interact with Project Relate may be different,&#8221; said Julie Cattiau, Google Research product manager in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;We want to avoid assuming what our target audience needs and the best way to do that is to build our product hand in hand with the people who will be using it. By engaging in testing with an initial group of people, we can better understand how our application will work for people in their daily lives, how accurate it will be, and what areas of improvement there might be, before we expand to a broader audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is recruiting a first round of real-world testers to use the app regularly. The first step will be to record a set of phrases, which will be integrated with the speech model to better cater to their speech patterns. If you think this could be helpful in your everyday life, feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_9fFSD4IAqHaePFebXMBOUML8rEFyZD4DNxG5LaZhpW5QXQ/viewform">sign up as a potential volunteer</a> and maybe you&#8217;ll help make the app better for everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/republic-may-build-a-secondary-exchange-for-digital-securities-fueled-by-150-million-in-new-funding/">Off the heels of a $150 million Series B fundraise</a>, New York-based investing platform Republic has acquired Arora Project, an equity crowdfunding media agency that helps startups create and launch campaigns. Krishan Arora, CEO and Founder at Arora Project, declined to tip TechCrunch the total transaction amount, but said that it was a “large, multi-million dollar deal.”</p>
<p><a href="https://republic.co/">Republic</a>, which is now five years old, is perhaps best known for facilitating crowdfunding campaigns for startups and small businesses under Reg CF, a rule that allows non-accredited investors to participate in private funding rounds. The startup’s reputation grew when the SEC recently raised the cap for how much money can be raised through a Reg CF, from $1.07 million to $5 million per year, ushering in a new wave of startups that can raise meaningful money from their communities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aroraproject.co/">Arora Project</a> is built off of the same tailwinds. The Miami-based startup is a digital media agency, paired with an angel syndicate, that helps companies build campaigns to eventually post on crowdfunding platforms like WeFunder, StartEngine or Republic. It has helped founders raise more than $100 million in capital since being founded in 2016.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231678" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We&#8217;re sort of the management consultants of the space,” said Arora. “Founders come to us, we put them on the right platform, create all the content, run the acquisition of the data analytics, and get them the money they need so they can focus on running the business instead of the fundraise.” The acquisition now means that Arora will be in an exclusive partnership with Republic</p>
<p>Arora Project will first bring marketing chops to the retail, equity crowdfunding investment side of Republic’s business. Down the road, Arora will integrate into Republic’s other sub companies, which include a private capital division, blockchain incubator and fund, and eventually, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/republic-may-build-a-secondary-exchange-for-digital-securities-fueled-by-150-million-in-new-funding/">a compliance-focused marketplace for digital securities. </a></p>
<p>Last week, Indiegogo announced that it will begin more closely screening crowdfunding campaigns on its platform. While Republic focuses more on equity crowdfunding campaigns versus Indiegogo’s specialty of rewards-based and donation-based crowdfunding, the news triggered questions on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/06/all-things-in-moderation-including-moderation/"> the future of moderation</a> within the broader crowdfunding world. Arora Project boasts that it has a “rigorous vetting process” and accepts less than 10% of applications that it receives every month. Republic Chief of staff Kyle McCormick said that the marketplace is &#8220;an entirely different beast&#8221;than Indiegogo.</p>
<p>“Even though we may share users with platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, we’re going after a different part of that user’s wallet — their investable assets on which they hope to make a return. Not checking for fraud (at a bare minimum) would be deeply negligent,” McCormick then said. He admitted that there are still challenges with this model: “How do we deliver quality in a scalable way? How do we support venture-backed companies without mirroring gender and race biases in venture capital? All things we think about everyday.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founder Arora says that quality assurance is certainly one of his goals, in addition to driving overall deal volume and total investment volume on the platform.</p>
<p>Republic has always been a more curated platform due to its focus, but Arora Project and future acquisitions could help it find better ways to answer some of these questions &#8211; either by introducing a new cohort of investors to its platform, or by helping more startups launch campaigns that balance transparency with ambition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fubo.tv">fuboTV</a> is making a significant move in Europe with plans to acquire Molotov, a French startup with a leading television streaming service. fuboTV also operates a TV streaming platform, but it is currently only operating in the U.S., Canada and Spain.</p>
<p>The transaction is a cash-and-stock deal that values Molotov at $190 million (€164.3 million). The deal is pending approvals and closing conditions. fuboTV expects to close the acquisition at some point during the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>If you have been following Molotov for long enough (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/18/how-a-team-of-accomplished-entrepreneurs-plan-to-revolutionize-your-television-experience/">like me</a>), you may remember that telecom company Altice also announced plans to acquire a majority stake in Molotov <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/altice-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-ott-startup-molotov/">back in 2019</a>. But that deal fell through, meaning that Altice never managed to secure control of the French streaming startup. Let’s hope that this time things will work out as planned.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231359" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Molotov started in France with a well-designed over-the-top streaming platform. You can find all major TV channels, stream live content and watch replays for free. There are optional subscriptions to unlock more features, such as cloud recordings and of course premium channels.</p>
<p>At the time, a key feature that differentiated Molotov from other ways to watch TV was that you could sign in with your account and find your content on any platform. Molotov has apps for desktop, mobile, tablet, Apple TV, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV and many smart TVs. Since then, many over-the-top TV services have launched with a focus on an account-based user experience.</p>
<p>Over time, Molotov launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/molotov-starts-its-international-expansion-with-seven-african-countries/">new countries</a> and added more content from various partners. It also operates its own ad-supported streaming service called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/molotov-launches-free-ad-supported-streaming-service-mango/">Mango</a> and has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/molotov-will-provide-infrastructure-service-to-other-ott-platforms/">B2B division</a> to run the OTT platform of other media and telecom companies. Overall, 17 million people have created a Molotov account — most of them are in France.</p>
<h2>An easy market expansion</h2>
<p>As for fuboTV, the company started off as a soccer streaming service. It quickly expanded to focus on sports in general, and then non-sports content. For instance, fuboTV <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/19/fubotv-inks-discovery-deal-adds-13-more-networks-to-its-live-tv-streaming-service/">has inked a deal</a> with Discovery, Inc. and its various channels, such as Discovery Channel, TLC, Investigation Discovery, Animal Planet, OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network and MotorTrend.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>fuboTV also offers cloud DVR features as well as the ability to pause and unpause live streams. You can also restart a show already in progress in case you&#8217;re late.</p>
<p>Molotov’s co-founder and CEO Jean-David Blanc will remain at the helm of the European company. He will also be appointed Chief Strategy Officer. fuboTV already says in its announcement that it plans to expand the team in Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;We are proud of this new step for Molotov. We share with fuboTV the same ambition and the same vision of a live TV streaming platform on both sides of the Atlantic. Our goal is to offer consumers a best-in-class streaming experience with premium television content on a global scale&quot;, Jean-David Blanc said in a statement.</p>
<p>In other words, a deal between fuboTV and Molotov makes sense as both companies operate in the same industry but there’s no geographical overlap. fuboTV will now have two strong customer bases on two continents. And Molotov will act as the European hub for fuboTV when the acquisition goes through.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shin Kim spent nearly two years helping renowned entrepreneur and investor Elad Gil vet deals and dream up new ideas as his chief of staff. In the process, an idea bubbled up that seemed too compelling to let go. Now called <a href="https://www.tryeraser.com/">Eraser</a>, that year-old startup, which is centered around a collaborative digital canvas for white-boarding and note-taking, has raised $4 million in seed funding led by Caffeinated Capital. It has attracted what Kim says is more than 1 million users since its March launch, from &#8220;five-person startups to the largest global tech companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>We talked with Kim last week to learn more about his transition from right-hand man to startup founder, as well as to understand why, in a world that is suddenly rife with tools that help remote teams collaborate more efficiently, he&#8217;s confident there is room for Eraser to grow.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have two computer science degrees, from the University of Chicago and from Berkeley. How did you end up working with Elad Gil?</strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231500" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>SK: [After school], I went into finance and investing in San Francisco [as an associate with JPMorgan, then Oak Hill Capital],  and I met Elad through my brother. He was an investor in my brother&#8217;s startup, <a href="https://www.bitwiseinvestments.com/">Bitwise Asset Management</a>, which is a crypto asset manager [where Kim&#8217;s brother is CTO]. He was looking for a chief of staff as he just had so many things going on, and it was just him at that point with his EA. So I joined to help him with with him companies, doing due diligence, getting the deep into the stories of companies and their financials and their data.</p>
<p>We were also working on incubating some ideas together, and that was the main draw for me &#8212; that in addition to investing, he wanted to find ideas that should exist in the world but don&#8217;t and to build something from the ground up, and Eraser was collaboration in that regard. It was the pandemic. We had worked through a few ideas, and this was the final one that we hit on.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What was the special insight here?</strong></p>
<p>SK: Collaboration in general was really tough during the pandemic, right? Everything was broken, everything was suddenly Zoom-based, and as I talked to a bunch of companies both large and small in Silicon Valley, it seemed like ideation, or getting a project started off the ground, seemed really tough as opposed to executing on existing projects. Especially on a remote basis, this process of brainstorming together and building on top of each other&#8217;s ideas is really tough. That&#8217;s how the genesis of Eraser came to be.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: So this is an all-in-one ideation platform for technical teams. What does that mean, exactly?</strong></p>
<p>SK: To unpack that a bit, by technical teams, we mean engineering teams and data science teams, and by ideation, our platform consists of three functionalities. One is a canvas where you can visually collaborate &#8212; you can create diagrams or system architecture. You can create wireframes to visualize front-end UI mock ups. And you can annotate things, like scribble math equations [with a stylus, using its app in the iPad], like you would on a physical whiteboard.</p>
<p>The second piece is the note editor, where you can turn those figures and diagrams into some kind of documentation or reference document. This is where we serve technical teams better because oftentimes, they&#8217;re using Google Docs as their documentation platform and then copy-pasting images that they drew on some other visualization tool into Google Docs. We have that capability natively inside of Eraser.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And the last piece?</strong></p>
<p>SK: You can post the entire conversation on Eraser or using audio chat. We realized that when users are doing brainstorming remotely, oftentimes Zoom or Google Meet is in the background and they&#8217;re only using audio and really video because they&#8217;ve been working with these people for a long time and don&#8217;t need to see their faces to be brainstorming. It&#8217;s more about the content.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Does Eraser save the audio so if you want to go back and replay that whole meeting, or also search through it, you can do this?</strong></p>
<p>SK: That&#8217;s to come. It&#8217;s definitely on our roadmap. Currently, we only have real-time audio communication.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve already told me you aren&#8217;t sharing customer names yet. What are some of the use cases you&#8217;re seeing?</strong></p>
<p>SK: We see individuals using it for hobby projects. We see educators using it. But our bread-and-butter use case is teams and companies that are using it for work. It&#8217;s very lightweight, compared to some of the other alternatives out there. I think engineers are generally reticent to go into designers tools like Figma, but with Eraser, engineers feel like they can create their own wireframes and create visualizations of what they&#8217;re imagining. That it&#8217;s usable, lightweight and there&#8217;s a lack of a learning curve is a lot of the  feedback that we&#8217;ve been getting, especially compared with other products.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How are you getting the product out in the world?</strong></p>
<p>SK: It&#8217;s definitely word of mouth. Another go-to-market strategy we adopted was to partner with virtual office platforms like <a href="https://www.kumospace.com/">Kumospace</a> and <a href="https://www.gather.town/post/why-the-metaverse-matters">Gather</a> [a &#8220;metaverse&#8221; startup that just last week announced $50 million in Series B funding co-led by Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who pays for that real estate? Are you charging these partners?</strong></p>
<p>SK: No, we&#8217;re not charging our partners. Monetization is something we want to get to later next year, though even then, we wouldn&#8217;t charge our partners. We would charge the end users who wind up saying, &#8216;Hey, I really like this whiteboard and want our entire team using it.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are these partners charging you, or will they receive a cut from these transactions?</strong></p>
<p>SK: That&#8217;s TBD, as well. I think we&#8217;re adding value by providing a whiteboard experience for their end users, which otherwise, they would have to create themselves, which would be a lot of work.</p>
<p><strong>TC: When you do start charging, do you see this being per seat or per session?</strong></p>
<p>SK: It would be a monthly-type deal where, we&#8217;re charging per user per month. It&#8217;s more of a classic subscription.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Microsoft just announced a whole lot of collaboration tools. Obviously this is a crowded industry generally, but out of curiosity, what did you make of the company&#8217;s recent announcements?</strong></p>
<p>SK: Even though Microsoft Loop describes itself as a collaborative canvas, it largely seems to be a next-generation document editor, competing against the likes of Notion and Coda. Eraser&#8217;s main use cases are built around visual collaboration like diagramming and wireframing, so I would argue the product identities between MS Loop and Eraser are dissimilar.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also focused on serving technical teams – engineers, data scientists – and want to build features to serve their needs like programmatically generating diagrams. MS Loop&#8217;s mandate will likely be to serve a broadest possible audience, so it doesn&#8217;t impact our core mission of building an end-to-end ideation platform for technical teams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/unity/">Unity</a> has just announced its intent to acquire <a href="https://www.wetafx.co.nz">Weta Digital</a>, the legendary visual effects company co-founded by Peter Jackson, for a massive $1.625 billion.</p>
<p>Whether or not you recognize the name, you&#8217;ve seen Weta Digital&#8217;s work. From <em>Lord of the Rings</em> to <em>Avatar</em> to <em>Shang-Chi</em>, if its the kind of movie where people say &#8220;you should really see it in theaters,&#8221; there&#8217;s a good chance Weta Digital played a huge role in the VFX.</p>
<p>Leading into this deal, Weta Digital was both a team of artists creating visual effects and a team of engineers developing many of the tools those artists use. It&#8217;s those tools and engineering teams, specifically, that Unity is acquiring; the visual effects artistry team, meanwhile, will be split off into its own new thing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231513" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Weta Digital&#8217;s 275+ engineers will join Unity. The VFX artists will be spun out into a new entity, &#8220;Weta FX&#8221;, which Peter Jackson will continue to own the majority of. The two companies expect to continue working together, with Unity noting that it sees Weta FX being one of their &#8220;largest customers in the Media and Entertainment space&#8221; moving forward.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Unity will be taking over the development of Weta Digital&#8217;s many built-in-house tools — things like City Builder (which procedurally generates the massive 3D cities we see destroyed in movies like <em>King Kong</em>), Manuka (their custom, physics-simulating renderer that helps make everything look oh-so-real in the final version), Gazebo (their faster real time renderer, used by artists to accurately preview scenes before the much more time-consuming final render), and all of the other bespoke tech the team has built for rigging characters, animating and rendering faces, processing motion capture, or simulating hair/fur/smoke/a thousand years of vegetation growth across an abandoned cityscape.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231519" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231519" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2231519" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Citybuilder.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="574" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Citybuilder.jpg 1824w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Citybuilder.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Citybuilder.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Citybuilder.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Citybuilder.jpg?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Citybuilder.jpg?resize=1536,861 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Citybuilder.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231519" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Weta&#8217;s City Builder tool </em><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Unity/Weta Digital</p></div></p>
<p>Why Weta? I hopped on a call with Unity SVP Marc Whitten to get his thoughts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Think back 10 years ago,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;Think about 2D, and just how many photos were being created. There was probably a lot! But project forward ten years&#8230; and it&#8217;s just extraordinarily greater now. I think we&#8217;re in the same place for 3D.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The one difference, though&#8221; he notes, &#8220;is that 10 years ago, I &#8230; kind of thought I could take a photo. I can sort of do something with 2D. But that&#8217;s actually almost not-true — because every time I click the shutter button on my iPhone, it&#8217;s probably running 5 million lines of super advanced code to turn me into [a photographer]. But in 3D, I actually personally can&#8217;t model something today. What we need to do over the next 10 years is take that same approach; to take this incredibly deep technology and make sure that it works effortlessly.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words: Unity sees a growing need to make building in 3D less painful, and that&#8217;s something Weta has spent the last few decades figuring out.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Unity will also acquire the massive catalog of digital assets that Weta Digital has built over the years — a list of creations that is much, much, much too long to list, but think everything from 3D models of cities or cars or people, to the algorithms determining how smoke works as it comes off a fire in the rain, to simulations of how a herd of animals might move together through the trees — all of which, potentially, could find its way into Unity&#8217;s products for creators to build upon. (That won&#8217;t include &#8220;recognizably clear IP,&#8221; Whitten notes, so don&#8217;t expect to be able to drag-and-drop Gollum into your next game.)</p>

At the time, Whitten alluded to that purchase as part of Unity’s larger cloud ambitions &#8211; something this acquisition plays to, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;What [Weta Digital&#8217;s] tools are&#8230; is really this pipeline,&#8221; says Whitten. &#8220;Each individual tool is individually powerful, but in conjunction together across this pipeline they all work really effortlessly. If you make a change in one particular tool, it shows up in the right way when you go to do the lighting, or compositing, in any other particular tool. Groups of people can work really, really easily together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ll do then,&#8221; he continues &#8220;is make sure that these cloud capabilities plug directly in where artists are and where they&#8217;re trying to do their work — inside of Maya, or inside of Houdini, or inside of Unity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe it&#8217;s important to make this pipeline available in the cloud, so that wherever you are, you can just sort of plug into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unity says it expects the deal to close in its 2021 Q4. Weta Digital CEO Prem Akkaraju will stay on as the CEO of the newly formed Weta FX, while CTO Joe Marks will move to Unity as CTO of Weta Digital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpinLaunch, a startup working on a kinetic space launch system, has successfully completed its first prototype flight. It’s a major milestone for the seven-year-old company as it works toward a test of its full-scale system.</p>
<p>The concept behind that system is pretty wild: essentially, SpinLaunch wants to get to orbit by using a large, vacuum-sealed chamber and a hypersonic tether to spin a spacecraft at a high enough velocity – up to 5,000 miles per hour – to escape the atmosphere. That means no rocket, no rocket engines. It’s a markedly different way of thinking about spaceflight, much more akin to a giant rail gun rather than a conventional launch system.</p>
<p>According to SpinLaunch, such a system is now possible thanks to advances in small electronics and high-strength materials like carbon fiber, which can harden both the launch vehicle and small satellites to high-G forces.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231585" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The prototype flight took place on October 22 at Spaceport America in New Mexico. In addition to launching the test vehicle at supersonic speeds using the accelerator, which was around one-third the size of the planned system (but still larger than the Statue of Liberty, SpinLaunch notes on its website), the startup also recovered the vehicle to reuse it for later tests.</p>
<p>SpinLaunch, which was founded in 2014, aims to conduct around 30 suborbital test flights over the next six to eight months, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/spinlaunch-completes-first-test-flight-of-alternative-rocket.html">CNBC reported</a>. The startup has been backed by Airbus Ventures, Kleiner Perkins and GV.</p>
<p>The startup is not disclosing the site for its first orbital launch, but its website notes it will be “a coastal region of the United States.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I think we're now better off than we were before the pandemic. But that was a bit of a wake-up call to us. That wake-up call actually led to a lot of changes."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Airbnb announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/airbnb-boosts-host-protection-adds-wifi-speed-verification/">over 50 new features coming to the platform</a> this morning. The big ones include a new, smarter Translation Engine, a way to know if a rental has solid WiFi, an expanded Ask A Superhost program, more flexibility in search and tools to verify any accessibility features a listing might promise.</p>
<p>The biggest announcement of all, however, comes in the form of AirCover. It&#8217;s a new coverage policy that protects a listing from top to bottom (including most items in the home) from damage and theft. It includes protection for pet damage, deep cleaning and income loss.</p>
<p>This is particularly critical because right now, Airbnb suffers from a high-class problem, according to CEO Brian Chesky. Suddenly, as pandemic restrictions loosen and more people venture out of their homes to travel, supply is not meeting demand.</p>
<p>I sat down with Chesky to discuss growing the supply side of the business, how he&#8217;s felt as a leader of a massive travel company over the past year and the future of Airbnb as a whole.</p>
<p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: The last time that we talked, we discussed what it was like to be CEO during a pandemic. Obviously, you&#8217;re the CEO of a <em>travel</em> company, so that makes it 20 times more difficult. As we&#8217;re moving through this pandemic, it&#8217;s starting to feel like things are kind of swinging in your direction. You had a great Q3 earnings report recently. Interest in travel is up, bookings are up, borders are opening. How safe or secure do you feel Airbnb is right now compared to a year ago?</strong></p>
<p>Brian Chesky: Much more secure. I feel like we&#8217;re on solid ground now. I felt like we spent 10 years building this company that was really a pretty hot company. If you think about it, in the 2000s, Airbnb and Uber were the two companies that were riding a lot of trends and we were very high. I felt like before the pandemic, I thought we were kind of on top of the world. But then the gods struck down on us and we lost 80% of our business in eight weeks. And we had to raise that. Let me just give you a point of reference. We had to raise an emergency round of financing of $2 billion, including a $1 billion loan from Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners. We just did a billion dollars in profit in Q3. So it&#8217;s almost like doing a billion-dollar round without having to give away any equity. I remember Paul Graham used to say the best fundraising round you can do is to be profitable because you never get diluted.</p>
<p>Just to summarize, the brand is as relevant as it ever was. It&#8217;s a noun and a verb all over the world. Travel is coming back. So, I think 80% of our business before the pandemic involved someone either crossing a border or going to a city, which is basically the two types of travel that weren&#8217;t really happening. That&#8217;s coming back. But the reason we&#8217;re doing so well is partly because all these new ways of traveling and living have emerged, which I think are here to stay. People are living on Airbnb on a monthly basis. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going away, because I don&#8217;t think people are going back to the office five days a week. Those things are here to stay. And, we actually have a much better cost structure.</p>
<p>So, for all those reasons, I feel more secure. Maybe the most important final thing I&#8217;ll say is this: Having gone through managing a company in a pandemic where people were predicting our imminent demise, having to rebuild the company from the ground up and take it public on Zoom as a travel company … if I can get through that and we can get through, then I can get through anything. So I think we&#8217;re a lot tougher, a lot sharper. And once you&#8217;re in a foxhole with 1,000 people, you feel like you can do anything. That&#8217;s kind of how we feel now.</p>

			The brand is as relevant as it ever was. It&#8217;s a noun and a verb all over the world.							<cite>Brian Chesky</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p><strong>You said that you believe that work from home or &#8220;work anywhere&#8221; is here to stay. So what does that mean for Airbnb HQ? Are you going to renew the lease, or what exactly does the future of Airbnb as a workforce look like?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great question. We&#8217;ll still have our offices. Not as many. Not as much space. But we&#8217;ll still have our offices. We&#8217;ll still have our main headquarters in San Francisco. We&#8217;re definitely going to adopt a flexible work policy. I don&#8217;t know exactly what it&#8217;s going to be. I think every CEO is trying to imagine how everyone&#8217;s going to work in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microrobots have been a longtime fascination for many in the industry. Such technologies could ultimately provide a slew of applications, including a handful of useful features in healthcare. Things like targeted delivery of medication and microsurgical procedures are frequently mentioned.</p>
<p>Mobility is among the biggest questions that arise from the tech. Specifically, how can roboticists get them to move without batteries and other technologies on board. Magnets are a fairly common suggestion, <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2021/11/finding-inspiration-in-starfish-larva.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but a team at ETH Zurich is exploring an altogether different solution</a>: ultrasound.</p>
<p>The robots, which measure smaller than the diameter of a human hair, were created using photolithography. They’re covered with synthetic versions of the sort of cilia that cover starfish larva. In the biological example, these ultra-fine hair-like structures beat the surrounding water in patterns that create small vortexes, propelling the young echinoderms through the fluid. Effectively, the system either pushes water or pulls it in.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231418" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jn30ct9u1UY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The team says it was able to create similar propulsion in its tiny robots by applying ultrasound waves, allowing them to swim in a straight line. The objects you see around the robot in the photos and video are plastic microbeads added to the water to demonstrate how it moves in circular patterns around the robot.</p>
<p>Drug delivery is the most broadly discussed application here &#8212; specifically, the ability to deliver medication directly to the site of something like a stomach tumor. Doing so could ensure that it’s used more efficiently, while reducing potential side effects.</p>
<p>“But before this vision can be realized, a major challenge remains to be overcome: imaging,” the school writes. “Steering the tiny machines to the right place requires that a sharp image be generated in real time. The researchers have plans to make the microrobots more visible by incorporating contrast agents such as those already used in medical imaging with ultrasound.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The unprecedented rush of venture capital into startups is having an interesting knock-on effect:</p>
<p>&#8220;Venture capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/vcs-are-racing-to-pay-more-to-get-smaller-pieces-of-less-profitable-companies/">investors are racing to pay more to buy smaller pieces of startups</a> that are less profitable than before,&#8221; writes Alex Wilhelm, who studied Silicon Valley Bank&#8217;s State of the Markets Report Q4 2021.</p>

<p>Going for larger rounds with higher multiples means reduced ownership, and it&#8217;s shifting more power to founders as investors are &#8220;paying more and at shorter intervals for less of less profitable startups.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have never used this space to offer advice, but if you believe you have a good idea for a startup — go for it. When venture capitalists say this is a good time to be a founder, you know they <em>absolutely</em> mean it.</p>

<p>Deep tech holds a lot of potential for changing how our world functions, but many applications are still years away from reaching the market.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Anna Heim analyzed pi Ventures’ Deep Tech Shifts 2026 report, which explores 15 deep tech subsectors expected to reach an inflection point in the next five years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;If you invest too early in an innovation, then you will have suboptimal returns,” said founding partner Manish Singhal. “If you invest too late, you may also end up getting suboptimal returns, because it is no longer a cutting-edge thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;If investment and the timing of innovation getting to a resonance point come together, then good things happen.”</p>

<h2>Why QED, hot on Nubank, is bullish about LatAm fintech</h2>

<p>Brazil-based Nubank&#8217;s IPO is generating a lot of interest, so Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm interviewed Lauren Morton, a partner at QED.</p>
<p>Her firm invested in Nubank&#8217;s Series A, B, D and E, but &#8220;since then, the fintech-focused fund has made more investments in the region,&#8221; they report.</p>
<p>In an extended Q&amp;A, Morton shared why QED is bullish on LatAm fintech and offered a few predictions:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the volume and pace we have seen so far this year will continue into 2022, but we’re also realistic enough to know that valuations can’t keep rising indefinitely. There will be a correction at some point, but make no mistake that some big, real businesses will emerge over the next few years regardless of whether money into the region slows down or not.</p></blockquote>

<p>SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 1 is still the world&#8217;s largest tech investment fund, but founder Masayoshi Son committed to an $8.8 billion buyback after it reported its latest quarterly results.</p>
<p>One aggravating factor: Chinese regulators made ride-hailing app Didi, one of the fund&#8217;s chief investments, stop accepting new customers and pull its app, resulting in the company&#8217;s shares plummeting.</p>
<p>The Japanese fund&#8217;s investment in Didi has now lost nearly $5 billion in value since its initial investment, Alex Wilhelm writes.</p>

<p>Training an AI to do something is difficult, and deploying AI solutions across an entire enterprise is an undertaking most companies struggle with.</p>
<p>Because the field is still taking shape, there&#8217;s no single framework for managing such a project, and organizations need best practices like fish need water.</p>
<p>Roey Mechrez, co-founder and CTO of BeyondMinds, outlines the main barriers to enterprise-wide AI adoption, offering detailed suggestions for addressing &#8220;the orchestration problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Mechrez, &#8220;enterprises should take a step back and see the big picture of the AI journey, and start thinking of a systematic way to utilize many AI models in a single, robust framework.&#8221;</p>

<p>The work lives of the users of CentOS 8, the popular free-to-use clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, were upended when Red Hat announced that it would cease supporting release 8 after December 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can’t really blame a profit-centered organization for focusing on its objectives, but a shift in objectives can have significant implications for some users,&#8221; says Joao Correia, a technical evangelist at CloudLinux.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t yet found an alternative, he shares a few open source options companies can use to reduce risks and comply with enterprise security policies.</p>

<p>HashiCorp&#8217;s IPO filing last week gave us a good look at why the software company has managed to grow to where it is now: a strong subscription model driving &#8220;mostly recurring, high-margin revenues that have proven sticky over time,&#8221; Alex Wilhelm writes.</p>
<p>The company reportedly expects to be valued at about $10 billion, but with slowing growth, its per-share IPO pricing and resulting valuation may depend on whether the investors who are along for the ride get queasy during deceleration.</p>

<p>Founders of companies that are eligible for Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) can pay zero federal capital gains tax when they cash out — if they hold those shares for five years.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact that many acquisitions happen before five years leaves some founders and investors short of qualifying for these powerful tax savings,&#8221; but a Section 1045 rollover &#8220;can salvage the opportunity in some cases.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has released the second developer beta of iOS 15.2, which includes support for its new communication safety feature in Messages. The feature was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/new-apple-technology-will-warn-parents-and-children-about-sexually-explicit-photos-in-messages/">announced earlier this year</a>, alongside the company&#8217;s controversial new child sexual abuse (CSAM) detection technology feature, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/">Apple delayed</a> following backlash.</p>
<p>The new Messages feature, meanwhile, is meant to allow parents to play a more active and informed role when it comes to helping their children learn to navigate online communication. Messages will be able to use on-device machine learning to analyze image attachments and determine if a photo being shared is sexually explicit. This technology does not require Apple to access or read the child’s private communications, as all the processing happens on the device. It&#8217;s a Family Sharing feature for parents to opt in.</p>
<p>If a sensitive photo is discovered in a message thread, the image will be blocked and a label will appear below the photo that states, “this may be sensitive” with a link to click to view the photo. If the child chooses to view the photo, another screen appears with more information. Here, a message informs the child that sensitive photos and videos “show the private body parts that you cover with bathing suits” and “it’s not your fault, but sensitive photos and videos can be used to harm you.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231521" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Apple has made some changes to the communications safety feature compared to its initial plans. The company had originally planned to notify parents if their child under the age of 13 viewed an explicit image in Messages. Apple has since removed this feature after receiving criticism that it could pose risks for the children in question.</p>
<p>The communications safety feature is currently available in the beta version of iOS 15.2. It’s currently unknown when Apple plans to officially release the feature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Health tech startup Color has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/color-announces-series-e-financing-at-a-valuation-of-4-6-billion-to-accelerate-expansion-of-accessible-and-equitable-public-health-infrastructure-301419932.html">raised $100 million</a> in Series E funding, bringing the company’s valuation to $4.6 billion. This round means Color has now raised a total of $378 million, with this latest round specifically meant to help the company offer new programs that deliver the last mile of care across healthcare services.</p>
<p>The round was led by Kindred Ventures and by funds managed by T. Rowe Price, along with participation from existing investors including General Catalyst, Viking Global Investors, and Emerson Collective. In January, Color <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/color-raises-167-million-funding-at-1-5-billion-valuation-to-expand-last-mile-of-u-s-health-infrastructure/">raised $167 million</a> in Series D funding, at a valuation of $1.5 billion. This latest round triples that measure of the company&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p>Color’s software and infrastructure provide tools for preventative health and infectious disease management by making healthcare programs more accessible. To date, Color has partnered with almost 1,000 organizations, including public health departments, employers, and universities to help people get faster access to healthcare services. Its partners include Salesforce, the National Institutes of Health, the State of California, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and more. The company currently facilitates over 6,500 COVID-19 testing sites at offices and schools, and it also runs 500 vaccination sites across the country.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231381" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;What we have built will serve as a critical piece of public health infrastructure to deliver access to healthcare services to those who need them most,&#8221; said Color CEO Othman Laraki. &#8220;We have learned that there is an exponential uptick in people&#8217;s ability to use these services as they become simpler and more convenient. Public health should happen where public life happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, Color’s approach is to rethink healthcare delivery in order to make it accessible directly in people’s lives with low transaction costs in a way that’s scalable and doesn&#8217;t require a lot of clinical resourcing.</p>
<p>With this latest round of funding, Color aims to accelerate the expansion of accessible public health infrastructure by helping people get access to screening, diagnostics, and initial treatments for their health needs. Color’s offerings will now include vaccination and preventative health services for schools and employers. It also plans to offer infectious disease management programs in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Color has built a strong, sustainable, and profitable business that can scale alongside the myriad of health challenges the U.S. faces,&#8221; said Color CFO <span class="xn-person">Mike Herring</span>. &#8220;The response from our partners has been incredibly positive, and our remarkable team has delivered at scale with both pace and quality of execution.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Laraki co-founded Color in 2013 based on his own experience. The company tells TechCrunch his grandmother passed away from breast cancer and that his mother is a breast cancer survivor. He himself is a carrier of a BRCA2 mutation, which can increase an individual&#8217;s risk for cancer. Finding out this unique risk was challenging for him and he believed that the entire experience felt like something that could have become a much simpler healthcare transaction. Laraki&#8217;s experience was the catalyst to building Color, which now aims to make healthcare programs more accessible and cost-effective.</p>
<p>The company says its combination of existing offerings and new services expands its efforts to build public health technology and infrastructure for governments, employers, and other institutions that care for large populations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Distributed work is becoming the norm for many tech companies as the pandemic waxes and wanes. But there are plenty of ways to mess it up, especially if you’re attempting a hybrid solution — or if you’re secretly pining for the office.</p>
<p>I recently sat down with two experts on the topic to learn more: Wendy Nice Barnes, chief people officer at Gitlab, and Phil Libin, founder and CEO of startup studio All Turtles and mmhmm.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Our philosophy is we&#8217;re not remote, we&#8217;re distributed intentionally in the same way that the internet is a distributed system.							<cite>Phil Libin</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Barnes joined the long-time distributed WebOps company during the pandemic, after a career working in physical tech offices as a human resources leader.</p>
<p>Libin, after a long Silicon Valley career built around office meetings, has gone through the process of learning to love distributed over the last couple of years. As part of the process, he founded mmhmm, a video conference company (that&#8217;s fully distributed).</p>
<p>I’ve highlighted a few points from the conversation, below, including getting the mentality right, how to handle vacations and a couple tips on fundraising.</p>
<h2>Think &#8220;distributed&#8221;</h2>
<p>&#8220;Of course, some of it is harder. There are obvious disadvantages,&#8221; Libin said, regarding going distributed. &#8220;How about we focus on the amazing superpower advantages, like the fact that 0% of the people in our companies waste any time commuting? Not like the fact that they can live anywhere they want, like the fact that they can be fully productive. There are like massive advantages. Focus on those, and everything becomes much better.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is experimenting with games, initially in partnership with mobile gaming giant Zynga. On Monday, Zynga <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211108005289/en/Zynga-Announces-Disco-Loco-3D-Exclusively-for-TikTok">announced</a> its plans to launch a new HTML5-based game, &#8220;Disco Loco 3D,&#8221; exclusively on the TikTok platform. The casual game is a single-player endless runner where players collect their own dance moves while challenging friends, avoiding obstacles, and collecting medallions as they walk down a catwalk, similar in spirit to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/rollic-zynga-uncosoft/">Zynga&#8217;s</a> &#8220;High Heels.&#8221; While TikTok says the game is meant to test its audience&#8217;s general interest in gaming within its app, the company confirmed that discussions with other game makers are already underway.</p>
<p>HTML5-based mobile gaming has become a popular way to reach a large number of global users, particularly those in emerging markets where consumers may not own high-end phones or be able to afford fast data plans. Google, for example, embraced the format with its launch of the HTML5 gaming platform GameSnacks, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/area-120-is-beginning-to-use-googles-massive-reach-to-scale-html5-gamesnacks-platform/"> this year scaled</a> across Google Chrome&#8217;s new tab page in markets like India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Kenya.</p>
<p>More broadly, however, the tech industry is making the connection between platforms where users go to be entertained or to socialize, and platforms dedicated to gaming. Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/area-120-is-beginning-to-use-googles-massive-reach-to-scale-html5-gamesnacks-platform/">stepped into cloud gaming</a> last year with its launch of Facebook Gaming on the web and Android. And Netflix has just launched its own gaming service to its global users on Android, and today, iOS, saying that the company believes gaming is just another category of entertainment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231321" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Now, it seems TikTok is open to exploring that concept, as well.</p>
<p>TikTok tells TechCrunch the partnership with Zynga will help the company to better understand how its community engages with games. The company today has a captive audience of gaming fans, including both casual and hardcore gamers, it said, but it doesn&#8217;t know if these users would respond to a gaming integration like this.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t TikTok&#8217;s first-ever game, however. The company earlier this year launched its own game &#8220;Garden of Good,&#8221; which was built <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/partners/current-promotions/tiktok">in partnership with nonprofit Feeding America</a> and was focused on charitable fundraising. While that game may have given TikTok some early data on user interest in gaming, the game itself was a different type of experience. In the game, TikTok users would care for their own garden and support friends who were playing the game. And when the garden grew, they could have TikTok make a donation to Feed America using their points.</p>
<p>Zynga&#8217;s integration is a more traditional game, although it&#8217;s not currently monetized, TikTok notes. There are no in-app purchases or revenue share on the game&#8217;s earnings, for example. Instead, the focus, for the time being, is on testing TikTok users&#8217; gaming appetite.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" style="max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@zynga/video/7028312686785989893" data-video-id="7028312686785989893">

</section>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>As for Zynga, the company said it sees TikTok as a platform that will allow it to reach new audiences through the app&#8217;s massive reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zynga has a rich history of creating games that utilize platforms’ unique user experiences to bring fresh and fun concepts that resonate with players wherever and whenever they get their entertainment,&#8221; said Bernard Kim, President of Publishing at Zynga, in a statement.</p>
<p>The game is not currently live on TikTok but will roll out in the coming weeks on both iOS and Android across North American markets.</p>
<p>The partnership with Zynga may be the first to come of TikTok&#8217;s broader investigation into mobile gaming. The company told TechCrunch it&#8217;s in discussions with other gaming partners for similar deals, but can&#8217;t announce details at this time.</p>
<p>The gaming news was announced alongside Zynga&#8217;s Q3 earnings, where<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/08/zyngas-q3-2021-bookings-of-668-are-up-6-from-a-year-ago/"> the company reported revenue</a> of $705 million, up 40% year-over-year, and bookings fo $668 million, up 6% year-over-year. Zynga also said it hired a former Coca-Cola exec, Matthew Wolf, to lead its blockchain gaming business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://originventures.com/">Origin Ventures</a>, the 22-year-old, early-stage, Chicago-based venture firm, just closed its fifth fund with $130 million in capital commitments, which makes the vehicle the firm&#8217;s biggest.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t necessarily aiming to break any records, suggests managing partner Jason Heltzer, who says the firm was initially looking to raise $100 million. Still, institutional demand for a bigger piece of the private-company action is driving a lot of firms to raise ever bigger funds, and Origin wasn&#8217;t immune to the interest, which grew after some recent exits, including the sale of the restaurant reservation platform Tock earlier this year for <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/fwpro/squarespace-acquired-tock-platform">$400 million</a>.</p>
<p>We emailed last night with Heltzer to learn a bit more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231348" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>TC: What was your pitch to LPs in raising this fund?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We really emphasized our thesis, telling investors we were going to continue to focus on the digital native economy and invest in software and marketplace businesses &#8211; both B2B and consumer &#8211; solving the unique needs of millennials and Gen Z. Those generations have had three things from a very early age: the internet, a smart phone, and social media [and] the way they live, work, and play is just different than previous generations, and that breeds opportunity for startups.</p>
<p>Then as these generations inevitably age, they accumulate more consumer buying power and more authority in companies, naturally fueling the growth of our investments. Those generations are now more than 50% of our workforce and already command more purchasing power than other generations.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This fund is quite a bit larger than your fourth fund, which closed with $80 million. Any changes to the team?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>JH: Since our last fund, we&#8217;ve added a managing partner, Alex Meyer, and promoted Scott Stern and Prashant Shukla to partner. We also added two senior associates: Jacquie Marshall Siegmund and Angela Smith. Prashant has relocated from Chicago to Silicon Valley and Scott is relocating from Chicago to the DC Metro area, so we&#8217;ll now have partners in all four time zones in the continental U.S., putting our team no more than a 90-minute flight from an elite team working on a disruptive idea.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What size checks will you be writing, and in terms of ownership, how much of a company do you expect in exchange for your checks?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We’ll write checks from $500,000 up to $6 million to lead seed and Series A financings. The larger fund will allow us to lead larger Series A rounds. And we target meaningful ownership with every first check, which translates to 7% to 12% in each deal in this market.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you still think that Chicago is overlooked by coastal VCs? That&#8217;s been a problem historically.</strong></p>
<p>JH:  No. There are too many successes in Chicago to ignore (Grubhub, Cleversafe, G2, Livongo, Cameo, Tovala, Tock, Groupon, ShipBob, and the list goes on). And most top firms have made at least one investment in the Windy City, if not many. That was before COVID, and now there are fewer barriers.</p>
<p>Chicago also remains the best city for venture returns because the lower cost of doing business, lower valuations, and great outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are you funding now that maybe wasn&#8217;t a theme or an industry &#8212; or not a major one &#8212; three to five years ago?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We’ve been active in the ‘workplace of the future’ for many years, but emerging themes include the creator economy, Web3, and communities.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are valuations in Chicago as crazy as elsewhere?</strong></p>
<p>JH: Valuations are historically high just about everywhere, although in the Bay Area it’s magnified. The gap has narrowed in recent years, but it will remain for several reasons. Most of our investing is in other markets; we’ve invested in 18 other metropolitan areas outside of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you price sensitive? When is a deal too rich for you?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We aim to pay a fair price that is calibrated by the market. The firm has been investing in venture since 1999, and we’ve been through many up and down cycles (yes, there are down cycles in venture). Exits like Grubhub, <a href="https://press.backlotcars.com/news/#:~:text=KAR%20Auction%20Services%2C%20Inc.%2C,in%20North%20America%20and%20Europe">BacklotCars</a>, and <a href="https://chicago.eater.com/2021/3/31/22360963/tock-reservations-sold-squarespace-website-kokonas-alinea-hospitality-restaurants">Tock</a> have also taught us that being in a winner when you have conviction is way more important than typical valuation fluctuations in those early rounds.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How many deals is Origin doing each year?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We expect to invest in 22 to24 companies out of this fund, over a three-year timeframe. To date, we’ve made 14 investments, so we&#8217;re averaging about 8 new investments a year.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Which of your portfolio companies has raised the most money from you?</strong></p>
<p>JH: Our portfolio companies have raised over $450 million  from growth investors in the last 18 months, including Cameo’s $100 million Series C (total raised: $165 million), Fountain’s Series C (total raised: $119 million),and Tovala’s $30 million Series C (total raised: $69 million). These are also our largest active bets as a firm measured by our capital invested.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You can&#8217;t raise more than $370 million on a good idea alone. But you can raise a seed round worth a few million from Aileen Lee with that and a few other critical ingredients.</p>
<p>Guild Education CEO Rachel Carlson did just that. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aileen-lee/">Aileen Lee, founder and managing partner of Cowboy Ventures,</a> led a $2 million seed round in 2015 before <a href="https://www.guildeducation.com/">Guild Education</a> even had a real product.</p>
<p>Carlson and her co-founder, Brittany Stich, had been running educational classes on their own while in school at Stanford and saw a massive, scalable opportunity.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If the market size is big enough, it&#8217;s really important to put it at the beginning of the deck.							<cite>Aileen Lee</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with Guild Education, it&#8217;s an education and upskilling platform that started by focusing on the 99%. Carlson and Stich realized that the vast majority of upskilling platforms focused on the top third of the labor triangle in the U.S., such as helping a developer get a better developer job or helping an executive be a better executive.</p>
<h2>Starting out in a strip mall</h2>
<p>Stich and Carlson rented out space in a strip mall and developed a boot camp model with classes focused on how to find a job or how to better communicate your experience on your resume.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was nervous to be a non-product founder and I was not particularly technical,&#8221; said Carlson. &#8220;In hindsight, it&#8217;s so fun to look back through our deck because we had an idea about the problem to be solved and a lot of ideas about distribution. We were pretty unsure about what the product was going to be, but we were sure we would find our way to the right product if we stayed obsessive about the problem.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are dozens of devices out there that are eager to beat your muscles to within an inch of their tense little lives. They all have one thing in common: They&#8217;re a lot more powerful and have more endurance than the nimble fingers of a massage therapist. A trained and skilled therapist still has the upper hand when it comes to meeting your kneads, however, which is the ability to touch you and figuring out what state your muscles are in.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.thepact.com/">Pact from Impact Biosystems</a>, which today opened for preorders. The Pact system has all the muscle-mashing skills of its many competitors, but if it were yet another Theragun knock-off, you probably wouldn&#8217;t be reading about it here. Instead, the company took a broader look at why hands-on massage therapy is, generally, more satisfying than sacrificing your lot to a jackhammer. The result is the Pact Scan, a second device that seeks to emulate the tender love and care of a therapist by using technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We created a system that is actually measuring your muscles and then reacting in different ways, in real time. Pact Scan is a device that you hold up to your muscles. In under five seconds, it takes a series of scans which then quantifies your muscles. Every level of stiffness has a natural frequency damping ratio. We take those parameters &#8212; we call it &#8216;muscle readiness&#8217; &#8212; which is essentially giving your muscle a score. Are your muscles ready for exertion? Are they warmed up enough?&#8221; explains Bridget Hunter-Jones, the co-founder and CEO of Impact Biosystems.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230893" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Existing muscle recovery solutions are almost exclusively one-size-fits-all types of products,” said Hunter-Jones. &#8220;But, everyone and their recovery is different, so we designed the Pact system with the belief that recovery should be informed and personalized, using data from the body, effectively eliminating the guesswork.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s products are more expensive than its premium competitors &#8212; <a href="https://www.therabody.com/us/en-us/percussive-devices-accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Therabody&#8217;s Theragun starts at $399 for its most-comparable Elite model</a> &#8212; but Impact Biosystems hopes that its data-forward approach will lure in its customers. The company claims that there are no competitors for its offering anywhere, and that the closest comparable products are medical devices costing 10 times more than its product &#8212; and are primarily used for academic and research purposes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230930" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230930" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230930" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg 5184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230930" class="wp-caption-text">Bridget Hunter-Jones is the co-founder and CEO of Impact Biosystems. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Impact Biosystems</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;This will be the first device that will be collecting this data in this particular way. The competing medical devices cost more than $6,000, and they are not using the same kinds of core technologies and algorithms that we use,&#8221; explains Hunter-Jones, &#8220;These devices are used for sarcopenia patients, and to track muscle mass in other contexts. We are emulating how a therapist works. They have the experience from being able to compare your muscles to the muscles of the hundreds of people they have touched in the past, and use this to inform how to treat a particular muscle.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Contrary to what you might expect, the Pact Scan device is not using an electric measurement. Instead, it gently uses a little built-in mallet to tap your muscles, and it measures the response of your muscles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to get it into the hands of folks who are intimidated of the other brands out there. We&#8217;ve spent a lot of time on the brand, making sure it is approachable, comfortable and not hyper-masculine,&#8221; says Hunter-Jones, &#8220;I&#8217;m really excited to start targeting this to casual, occasional athletes, Pilates-goers, yoga instructors, etc. People who don&#8217;t need to be hammering their muscles blindly.&#8221;</p>
<p>For its launch, the company is making two kits available; the Pact Sport Kit at $499, and a Pact Pro Kit, which weighs in at $649, and includes an additional battery handle and a travel case. The company is planning to start shipping its products in May 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/netflix-games-are-coming-to-all-members-on-android-starting-this-week/">launched its debut lineup of mobile games</a> to Android users globally. Today, the games are expanding to users on iOS. The lineup, which includes two &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; games and a few other casual gaming titles, will be delivered to iOS users the same way they are on Android. That is, they&#8217;re not streamed from the cloud, but actually installed to users&#8217; phones or tablets directly from the App Store.</p>
<p>With the Android launch, Netflix introduced a new &#8220;Games&#8221; tab within the app where users could browse the catalog and find a game they wanted to play. But to actually play the game, they would be directed to the Google Play Store to install the game on their device. Upon first launch, users would then sign into the game with their Netflix credentials.</p>
<p>Netflix says it&#8217;s using a similar system with the launch of Netflix games on iPhone and iPad. Except now, users are directed to Apple&#8217;s App Store for the downloads, not Google Play. The games will also require users to authenticate with their Netflix membership information in order to begin playing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231338" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company believes this system is compliant with Apple&#8217;s App Store rules, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/apple-revises-app-store-rules-to-permit-game-streaming-apps-clarify-in-app-purchases-and-more/">which were modified last year</a> to be more permissive around gaming apps.</p>
<p>Though updated in response to address the growing number of cloud gaming services, Apple&#8217;s policy indicates that developers are allowed to offer a centralized app that offers its subscribers access to a gaming catalog, so long as each title within that catalog has its own, dedicated App Store listing. Apple said this would allow it to review each gaming title separately. The system had actually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/gameclub-offers-mobile-gamings-greatest-hits-for-5-per-month/">been pioneered by the subscription-based</a> gaming service GameClub, as a way to offer a broader selection of classic gaming titles that were only playable by its members.</p>
<p>However, there is one difference between the iOS implementation of Netflix games and how the system works on Android.</p>
<p>Netflix users on Android have their own dedicated &#8220;Games&#8221; tab in the app&#8217;s navigation, but iOS users will not. Instead, iPhone members will only see a dedicated games row in the app where they can select any game to download. Meanwhile, iPad members will see the row (pinned to position 6) and will be able to access games from the categories drop-down menu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2231374" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231374" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2231374 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iOS_Collage_1080x1080_UCAN_EN.jpg?w=680" alt="Netflix launches games to iOS users" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iOS_Collage_1080x1080_UCAN_EN.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iOS_Collage_1080x1080_UCAN_EN.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iOS_Collage_1080x1080_UCAN_EN.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iOS_Collage_1080x1080_UCAN_EN.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iOS_Collage_1080x1080_UCAN_EN.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iOS_Collage_1080x1080_UCAN_EN.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iOS_Collage_1080x1080_UCAN_EN.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iOS_Collage_1080x1080_UCAN_EN.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iOS_Collage_1080x1080_UCAN_EN.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iOS_Collage_1080x1080_UCAN_EN.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231374" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>The comapny told TechCrunch that while Apple has been a great partner on Netflix games, it wasn&#8217;t entirely clear to Netflix if a gaming tab would bump up against another App Store policy, which bans apps that offer their own &#8220;app stores.&#8221; Since Netflix believes the tab is not critical to being able to offer the gaming experience to iOS users, it made the decision to launch without it. However, if the company is able to get more clarity around this rule in the future, it may be able to add a Games tab to its iOS app like the one available now on Android.</p>
<p>At launch, the gaming lineup remains the same as it does on Android. This includes two titles from BonusXP, &#8220;Stranger Things: 1984&#8221; and &#8220;Stranger Things 3: The Game;&#8221; as well as two titles from Frosty Pop, &#8220;Teeter&#8221; and &#8220;Shooting Hoops;&#8221; and one title from Rogue Games, &#8220;Card Blast.&#8221; The first two games are spinoffs from the popular Netflix show, &#8220;Stranger Things,&#8221; but the latter three are just casual titles.</p>
<p>Longer-term, Netflix has plans to expand this catalog with other additions and gaming genres. For example, the company in September <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-acquires-its-first-games-studio-oxenfree-developer-night-school/">acquired</a> the independent game developer Night School Studio, best known for narrative-driven titles like &#8220;Oxenfree,&#8221; to further build out its library of Netflix games.</p>
<p>Netflix explained its interest in gaming as just another way to entertain and retain subscribers &#8212; not a way to generate direct revenues from the games themselves. At present, the games are free to download, free from ads, and don&#8217;t include any in-app purchases. The company has said that as its catalog grows, it could apply its same recommendation algorithms to suggest new games to mobile users, instead of just TV shows and movies.</p>
<p>“We view gaming as another content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation, and unscripted TV,” <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">Netflix’s Q2 2021 shareholder letter</a> stated, adding that the company&#8217;s initial focus would be on free games designed for mobile devices. &#8220;Since we are nearly a decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about how our members value games,” Netflix said.</p>

<p>Here are key takeaways from over 16 hours of programming.</p>
<h2>It’s not clean tech 2.0</h2>
<p>Is it another clean tech bubble? While the previous boom and bust arguably led to several successful companies (we might include Tesla), it’s different this time. The difference is that people and governments are pushing corporations and funds toward net-zero, and this movement is not going away.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tony Fadell, father of the iPod and the iPhone, the co-founder of Nest, and now an investor with <a href="http://futureshapellc.com">Future Shape</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsoaHur7E9w">said during the Summit</a>: &#8220;​​Every company has some problem with clean to solve. [ … ] It’s a new industrial revolution, and pretty exciting, frankly.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The opportunity of a lifetime</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/bill-gates-expects-8-to-10-teslas-and-a-google-amazon-and-microsoft.html">As Bill Gates put it during his interview</a> with climate tech journalist Amy Harder, &#8220;There will be 10 Teslas out of this space, and only one of them is well known today.&#8221;</p>
<p>This echoed the statement that &#8220;500 to 1,000 unicorns created by such a complete reconstruction of industries,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/the-enormous-challenges-and-abundant-opportunities-in-climate-tech/">as Sean O’Sullivan</a>, managing partner of <a href="http://www.sosv.com">SOSV</a>, said at TechCrunch Disrupt in September, and the recent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-next-1000-unicorns-will-be-in-climate-tech.html">prediction by Larry Fink</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/">Blackrock</a> that &#8220;the next 1,000 unicorns will be in climate tech&#8221; at the Middle East Green Initiative Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUh1ZvESbEc">&#8220;Valleys of Death&#8221; panel</a>, Arvind Gupta, partner at <a href="http://mayfield.com">Mayfield</a>, who recently published a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/a-roadmap-for-climate-investors/">roadmap for climate investors</a>, explained that &#8220;re-materializing our economy&#8221; was a $100 trillion opportunity. Suzanne Fletcher, general partner at <a href="http://primemoverslab.com">Prime Movers Lab</a>, added that we were in the golden age for breakthrough science, and while &#8220;it’s the second inning for EVs, it is the first for agtech and other sectors, with a lot still untouched and undercapitalized.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dr. Clea Kolster, chief science officer of <a href="http://lowercarboncapital.com">Lowercarbon Capital</a>, said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFBrml7y4VM">carbon-removal panel</a>, that &#8220;Whether we achieve net-zero or not, we need to roll back the CO2 that we’ve emitted. Carbon removal needs to become the size of the oil and gas industry, a trillion-dollar market. Today it’s about a billion dollars.&#8221;</p>
<h2>It’s about people</h2>
<p>Last year, clean tech veteran investor Vinod Khosla wrote that we needed <a href="https://www.khoslaventures.com/a-few-critical-climate-technology-breakthroughs-multiplied-by-instigators-is-desperately-needed">breakthroughs supported by a dozen instigators</a> — we could call them the &#8220;green dozen.&#8221; At the summit, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsYgfSAuuAg">he reiterated this view</a>, highlighting that we need more tech talent and Ph.D.s to pursue those breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Josh Santos, CEO of <a href="http://noya.co">Noya</a>, a startup that retrofits industrial cooling towers to capture CO2, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFBrml7y4VM&amp;t=41s">felt optimistic</a>, saying, “More than ever, there is a surge of interest of people that previously had jobs outside of climate that are looking at moving into climate. We need the federal mandates, but none of it matters if we don’t have people to do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayfield’s Gupta added that his chief worry was about scientists that have brilliant ideas but not the means to follow up. Katie Rae, CEO and managing partner of MIT’s <a href="https://www.engine.xyz">The Engine</a>, added that we must ensure scientists believe they could be entrepreneurs, and investors need to back people who don’t look like the people who have won before. In the same spirit, Alex Greenhalgh, CEO of bio-silk company <a href="https://www.spintex.co.uk">Spintex</a>, encouraged scientists to venture out, saying, &#8220;You can’t see someone wearing your academic paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>To summarize the scale of efforts needed, Bill Gross, the founder of <a href="https://www.idealab.com">Idealab</a>, <a href="https://heliogen.com">Heliogen</a> and <a href="https://www.energyvault.com">Energy Vault</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsBVm1t0NPQ">said</a>, &#8220;We need thousands of shots on goal to do it, and entrepreneurship is the answer.&#8221;</p>
<h2>It needs patient capital</h2>
<p>Climate tech is not a walk in the park and the playbook is yet to be written. Khosla <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsYgfSAuuAg">said</a> that a good analogy was biotech/pharma investing, where it takes 10-15 years from concept to a drug approved on market. &#8220;Climate tech is the same way,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>David Tze, CEO of <a href="https://www.novonutrients.com">Novonutrients</a>, which uses industrial CO2 to produce proteins, detailed the steps and &#8220;valleys of death&#8221; that startups need to cross: &#8220;You need to find investors who are willing to support a multistage, scale-up process as you go from a laboratory benchtop to the floor scale, to field pilot, to demo scale, to small, large and very large commercial scale … and that takes years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott Jacobs, CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://generatecapital.com">Generate</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWkOkmPpt9Y">added</a>, &#8220;It is a real mistake to think that capital is just fuel. Your investors will be involved for a long time and hopefully can provide much more than fuel.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Money wants green</h2>
<p>The climate tech funding stack is still lacking in parts, but things are trending upward, with a new climate tech fund or SPAC seemingly announced every week. In addition, institutional investors are looking for new assets to re-allocate and &#8220;green&#8221; their portfolio.</p>
<p>As Mateo Jaramillo, a former Tesla VP and now CEO of <a href="https://formenergy.com">Form Energy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7oSRkPVr54">explained</a>, &#8220;[Energy storage can be a] new asset class to invest in, like coal or natural gas.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Watch for frontrunners</h2>
<p>Things are already in motion. Matt Peterson, director of the Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbhryfNeAkA">pointed out</a> that Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy, with over 10 GW of capacity, and the totality of Amazon &#8220;looks like the world at large&#8221; with its data centers, warehouses, vehicles, devices, movies and complex supply chain. &#8220;If it works for Amazon, it works for a lot of companies of smaller size,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/about/the-climate-pledge">Amazon Climate Pledge</a> was joined by over 200 corporations, and several tech giants like <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.shopify.com/about/environment">Shopify</a> are standing out with further action toward decarbonization of both direct and indirect emissions.</p>
<p>While &#8220;geography is destiny&#8221; for renewable energy — the amount of sun, wind and rivers a country has can’t be changed — some countries are also worth paying attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Singapore, home of the sovereign fund Temasek, has the unique situation of being a developed nation with very limited natural resources and imports almost all its food and energy. The way it handles this <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/climate-change-wicked-problem/">wicked problem</a> is likely to provide insights to the rest of the world. As a start, it was the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/singapore-issues-first-regulatory-approval-for-lab-grown-meat-to-eat-just.html">first country to allow the sale of cell-cultured meat</a> last December.</li>
<li>Iceland gets most of its electricity from hydroelectric and geothermal power. Already attractive to the power-hungry crypto-mining industry, it could also become the carbon-capture center of the world.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Climate is everywhere</h2>
<p>Every industry wants green solutions. The summit highlighted innovators in some of the key sectors we need to decarbonize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy storage: <a href="https://formenergy.com">Form Energy</a>, <a href="http://redwoodmaterials.com">Redwood Materials</a>, <a href="https://heliogen.com">Heliogen</a> and <a href="https://www.energyvault.com">Energy Vault.</a></li>
<li>Food and agtech: <a href="https://www.upsidefoods.com">Upside Foods</a> for meat, <a href="https://shiokmeats.com">Shiok Meats</a> for seafood and <a href="https://www.pivotbio.com">Pivot Bio</a> for fertilizers.</li>
<li>Industry: <a href="https://www.bostonmetal.com/">Boston Metal</a> for steel, <a href="https://sublime-systems.com/">Sublime Systems</a> for cement, <a href="https://www.spintex.co.uk/">Spintex</a> and <a href="https://unspun.io/">unspun</a> for fashion, and <a href="http://noya.co">Noya</a> and <a href="https://www.novonutrients.com">Novonutrients</a> for carbon capture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Form Energy’s Jaramillo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7oSRkPVr54">said</a> that a running joke these days is: &#8220;Your next job is going to be in climate whether you know it or not.&#8221;</p>
<h2>We need hopeful inspiration</h2>
<p>Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of <a href="https://lanzatech.com">Lanzatech</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0ahxf6I-2E">said,</a> &#8220;We’re going to get this done. We have to get this done!&#8221;</p>
<p>The final thoughts were from sci-fi and climate fiction author Chen Qiufan, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waste-Tide-Chen-Qiufan/dp/0765389312">&#8220;Waste Tide&#8221;</a> and the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/ai-luminary-kai-fu-lee-and-sci-fi-author-chen-qiufan-predict-the-future-in-ai-2041/">&#8220;AI 2041&#8221;</a> (co-authored with investor and AI expert, Kai-Fu Lee): &#8220;There are already so many dystopian ideas. We need to write about a positive and bright future to inspire young generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>In our survey of the SOSV Climate Tech Summit’s attendees, 78.8% reported that they feel optimistic about the future after the summit. Another 15.4% answered &#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; while a mere 5.8% felt we were all doomed.</p>
