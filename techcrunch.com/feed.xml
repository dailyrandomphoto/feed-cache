										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a handful of benefits for the startup ecosystem and to accelerate the growth of digital services in the annual budget Monday as the South Asian nation looks to revive the economy that was severely-hit amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Sitharaman said the nation has earmarked 1,500 crore Indian rupees ($205.3 million) to incentivize the adoption of digital payments. Market leaders Paytm, Google Pay, and PhonePe are locked in an intense battle to drive people in India to pay digitally, but the firms have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">struggled to find a viable business model</a> for their core payments service.</p>
<p>Many firms have urged the government to scrap merchant discount rate (MDR), which prevents firms from charging merchants for processing transactions. (Firms in India have agreed that they won&#8217;t charge individuals for processing their payments, but have suggested that they should be able to charge merchants.) No announcement on this front was made today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The budget also proposed extending social security benefits to gig workers and other platform workers and launch a website to help these workers find employment, said Sitharaman. These workers will be protected by minimum wages, she said in the proposal. Additionally, she said women would be allowed to work in all categories and also during night-shifts with adequate protection. &#8220;At the same time, compliance burden on employers will be reduced with single registration and licensing, and online returns.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the budget, Sitharaman also proposed some tax relief for startup employees when they sell their stakes.</p>
<p>&#8220;During their formative years, startups generally use Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) to attract and retain highly talented employees. ESOP is a significant component of compensation for these employees. Currently, ESOPs are taxable as perquisites at the time of exercise. This leads to cash-flow problem for the employees who do not sell the shares immediately and continue to hold the same for the long-term. In order to give a boost to the start-up ecosystem, I propose to ease the burden of taxation on the employees by deferring the tax payment by five years or till they leave the company or when they sell their shares, whichever is earliest,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The South Asian nation also proposed broadening the definition of small businesses, increasing the threshold for capitalization to 2 crore Indian rupees (about $275,000), up from existing limit of 50 lakh Indian rupees ($68,750). This will allow many more businesses to come under the small business umbrella and avail relevant benefits such as some tax concessions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, considering the fact that in the initial years, a startup may not have adequate profit to avail this deduction, I propose to extend the period of eligibility for claim of deduction from the existing 7 years to 10 years,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The budget also proposed incentives for incorporation of one-person companies, a move that Sitharaman said will help companies &#8220;grow without restriction on paid up capital and turnover, allowing conversion into any other type of company at any time, reducing the residency limit for an Indian citizen to set up a one-person company from 182 days to 120 days, and allow also non-resident Indians to incorporate one-person companies in India.&#8221;</p>
<p>Industry executives in recent weeks said they were also hoping that India will  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/us-says-india-italy-and-turkey-digital-taxes-are-discriminatory-but-wont-take-any-actions-for-now/">address the digital services tax</a> the country began imposing on foreign firms last year. This was not addressed in the new budget.</p>
<p>Sitharaman also said New Delhi will put together a plan aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and attract large investments in the electronics value chain. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Here, I propose a scheme focussed on encouraging manufacture of mobile phones, electronic equipment and semi-conductor packaging. Details would be announced later,&#8221; she said. You can read the fully summary of 2021-22 budget <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1693908">here</a>. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Below you can read our live coverage of the first even appearance by Elen Musk on Silicon Valley’s hottest startup right now, Clubhouse.</p>
<p>In summary, Musk used the session to ‘talk to his base’ on topics ranging from space travel, colonies on Mars and crypto. He managed to bust a few moths about his ‘alternative’ potions on several subjects, and at times managed to sound far more nuanced than his normally meme-propelled Twitter feed, which, it turns out, may just be him simply having fun with his followers, rather than taking serious positions. He almost seemed to be saying ‘I’m not the Messiah, I’m just another naughty boy…’.</p>
<p>In contrast to previous expositions on the viability of living on Mars, Musk didn’t portray a rose-colored vision. He said while worthwhile to keep humankind alive, life would be hard.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said even if aliens existed &#8211; and there was conflicting evidence &#8211; they appeared to have quite basic technology, compared to what they are normally given credit for.</p>
<p><strong>Below is our semi-live blog of the session: </strong></p>
<p>As I type this Elon Musk has joined <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> for his first-ever in-person live session and the boundaries of the app have already been tested. Only 5,000 people are in the room, but this appears to be the limit of the app. As a result, Musk fans have thrown-up live Youtube and other streams of the session, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1355983231988862978?s=21">live-streamed from here</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cba53J1jyPM">here</a>.</p>
<p>I am dusting off my creaky live-blogging skillz to cover the interview&#8230; and will update this post as we go (apologies for the appalling typos in the interim).</p>
<p>Musk initially talked about going to Mars and said it was likely to be “hard” for the early pioneers, but that the endeavor ultimately would be a matter of keeping the “candle of civilization alive in the dark”.</p>
<p>Asked if he believed in aliens, he said there wasn’t a single piece of conclusive evidence for the existence of aliens, although it’s “quite possible” there is such a thing as Alien technology, at least at a “7/11” level, and a joked that the evidence so far suggests they might be at the “500 Megapixel camera” or “at least iPhone 6 level”.</p>
<p>He said his kids were not quite into the idea of going to Mars.</p>
<p>Asked about memes online he quipped: “He who controls the memes controls the universe” and it’s about what “influences the zeitgeist”. Memes are a complex form of communication &#8211; unlike pictures, memes are “10,000 words not 1,000 words”. They are aspirationally funny. “I love memes, they can be very insightful” he said.</p>
<p>Does he try to sound crazy on Twitter? “I started crazy on Twitter,” he joked.</p>
<p>He doesn’t don’t follow them, but he says he has “meme dealers” &#8211; in other words, friends who clearly pick out memes they think he would like.</p>
<p>He talked about his company <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a> and also added that Tesla had one of the strongest AI teams in the world.</p>
<p>With AI, it’s about “how do we stay relevant” and at least “stay ‘along for the ride’ in the good scenario” and couple our minds with AI to harness its power.</p>
<p>“People are already a cyborg.” We already have a tertiary layer in the form of smartphones. The bit-rate of us typing into a phone is 100 bits. So it’s like trying to talk to a tree, for our smartphones. So with a direct neural interface, we increase it by a huge magnitude, and also spend longer time with a higher magnitude of processing because of this.</p>
<p>You can decide if you want to be a robot or a person. But when you wake in the morning you wouldn’t have to be the same ‘mind’ as you were yesterday. It’s analogous to a video game, not unlike the “Altered Carbon” Netflix series.</p>
<p>There are primitive versions of this in the Neuralink idea, with tiny wires going into your brain.</p>
<p>He said they will be releasing new videos in a month or so, such as of a monkey playing videos with their mind. He didn’t appear to comment on the ethics behind this.</p>
<p>The value of the early implant will be enormous and outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>Moderator question: What should we educate a 5-year-old about in this world?</p>
<p>Musk talked about how video games engage children, but explaining “the why” was important. “We are programmed to forget the low “probability of things” if they aren’t relevant.</p>
<p>Such as, taking apart an engine and putting them together. We need tools, so we understand the relevance. It’s better than taking a “course on wrenches”.</p>
<p>He was asked “why are there not more Elon Musks”? “If you need encouraging words, don’t do a startup”.</p>
<p>A friend sent him a slice of cake using bitcoin in 2013. So “I should have bought it 8 years ago”. “At this point Bitcoin is a good thing. I am a supporter. I am late to the party, but I am a supporter.”</p>
<p>He said it was clear Bitcoin was getting broader acceptance by the financial world. “I don’t have a strong opinion on other currencies.”</p>
<p>Dogecoin, he said, was made as joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies, but “fate lives irony”.</p>
<p>“The most entertaining outcome is the most likely.” The most ironic outcome would be Dogecoin becoming the currency of the future.</p>
<p>He said he made a joke about bitcoin and his Twitter account got locked.</p>
<p>TESLA: They want to make 20 million cars and trucks per year as a target.</p>
<p>Autonomous driving could reach the point where you would rely on it for a significant amount of time in the a week. Autonomous cars would take over for roughly a third of the hours in a weeks, so 60 hours instead of 12, eventually.</p>
<p>Making sense of objects with technologies like Lidar would effectively make cars “superhuman”.</p>
<p>POST-PANDEMIC WORKING: Working remotely on Zoom has been tricky for him, he said, but remote working has not been perfect. “Fear is not the mind-killer, context switching the mind-killer” he said, of having to switch between disparate subjects on calls.</p>
<p>Would he start another company? He joked that he pretty much has his hands full with Tesla, Space X, The Boring Company and others to date.</p>
<p>He talked about the huge advances in vaccine technology, such as the MRNA tech which made the Covid-19 vaccine possible. He seems very bullish about the vaccine.</p>
<p>“There is going to be an avalanche of vaccine” coming he said. “I guarantee you ‘it’ will be thrown away this year.” He said the ‘CureVac&#8217; vaccine will be approved soon.</p>
<p>He said “The Tesla machine can make a bazillion doses super fast.”</p>
<p>He made his poison clear on vaccines: “I am not an anti-vaxxer, I am a pro-vaxxer.”</p>
<p>Joining Silicon Valley in the early days he said he had to ask himself “Do I watch the internet being built in front of me or do I get involved?”</p>
<p>He was “too shy” to speak to anyone in the lobby of Netscape.</p>
<p>Then he tried to code. He wrote the first maps and directions on the internet. By hand. The Web site only worked during the night as he was using the server on the computer during the day to code.</p>
<p>Marc Andressen (on the clubhouse session) quipped that we would get a job the next time he hangs out in the lobby.</p>
<p>He’s been watching ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_King">The Last King</a>’</p>
<p>for its historical accuracy and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81002370">Cobra Kai</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)">The Expanse’s</a> plot lines sometimes seem too fantastical to him, he said.</p>
<p>He was recommended ‘Devs’, Mythic Quest and Ravens Baquet by moderators.</p>
<p>Tenet was “pretty good”. Did he understand it? “If you think too hard about it, it’s not going to make complete sense, but it’s a good movie.”</p>
<p>His knowledge of the Hitch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">Hikers guide to the Galaxy</a>, remains impressively intact.</p>
<p>“Vlad The Stock Impaler” was brought into the Clubhouse room to talk about the Game Stop phenomenon. It turned out this was <em>the actual CEO</em> of CEO of the Robinhood stocks trading app.</p>
<p>“Vlad” (or rather Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood) began with an, at times, stumbling attempt to explain what happened last week but was eventually interrogated more thoroughly by Musk.</p>
<p>Musk turned interviewer:</p>
<p>“All right, tell is what really happened. Give us the inside scoop,” he said</p>
<p>“This has been a very surreal weekend and week for me,” said Vlad.</p>
<p>Vlad said “one of the really great things is all the people “coming out of the woodwork” to offer support for the company to offer advice.</p>
<p>He said this was his first time using Clubhouse. He then made a jokey remark about being an adherent to the “simulation hypothesis”.</p>
<p>Musk brought him back: “The people demand an answer and they want to know the truth.”</p>
<p>Vlad said: “So there&#8217;s an introducing broker-dealer called Robin Hood Financial, and that basically is the app that you know and love, it processes trades. You&#8217;re a customer of Robin Hood Financial. Then there&#8217;s a clearing broker-dealer, Robin Hood Securities, that clears and settles the trades. And then we have Robin Hood Crypto, which is our Crypto business… All of these are different entities that are differently operated. So, basically Wednesday of last week. We just had, you know, unprecedented volume, unprecedented load on the system. A lot of these, you know, so-called meme stocks were, you know, going viral on social media, and people were people are joining Robin Hood and there was a lot of net buy activity on them.”</p>
<p>He said Robin Hood became number one on the iOS App Store and pretty close if not number one on Google Play store.</p>
<p>“Thursday morning I’m sleeping. At 3:30am Pacific, our operations team receives a file from the NSCC, which is the National Securities Clearing Corporation. So, basically as a broker as a clearing broker. And this is where Robin Hood securities comes in. We have to put up money to the NSCC based on some factors including things like the volatility of the trading activity into certain securities. And this is is the equities business so it&#8217;s based on, stock trading and not options trading or anything else.</p>
<p>So, they give us a file with the deposit and the request was around $3 billion, which is, you know, about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.”</p>
<p>MUSK: This is not an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula that they use to calculate that”</p>
<p>Vlad: Just to give context, Robin Hood up until that point has raised around $2 billion in total venture capital. Up until now, so it&#8217;s a big number, like $3 billion is a large number, right. So, basically, the details are, we don&#8217;t have the full details, it&#8217;s a little bit of an opaque formula, but there&#8217;s a component called the VAR of it, which is value at risk. And that&#8217;s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things although it&#8217;s not fully transparent. So, there are ways to reverse engineer it, but it&#8217;s not kind of publicly shared.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s a special component, which is discretionary. So that kind of acts as a multiplier, and basically</p>
<p>MUSK: Discretionary meaning like it&#8217;s just their opinion”</p>
<p>VLAD: There&#8217;s definitely more, more than just their opinion.</p>
<p>MUSK: Everyone wants to know did something shady go down here? It seems weird that you get a sudden $3 billion demand, you know, at 3.30am in the morning. Just suddenly out of nowhere.</p>
<p>VLAD: I wouldn&#8217;t impute shadiness to it or anything like that and actually you know the NSPCC was reasonable.</p>
<p>They worked with us to actually lower it. So, it wasn’t unprecedented activity. I don&#8217;t have the full context about, you know, what was going on in the NSCCC make these calculations.</p>
<p>MUSK: Is anyone holding your hostage right now?</p>
<p>Vlad: Thanks for asking. But anyways, so this was obviously nerve-racking, and I actually was asleep at this point, you know, the operations team was fielding this at three o&#8217;clock. And then, you know, we got back, we put our heads together. Our Chief Operating Officer basically said, look, let&#8217;s call up the higher-ups at the NSCC and kind of figure out what&#8217;s going on. Maybe there&#8217;s some way we can work with them. And basically, there was another call. And they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from three…. But still a high number.</p>
<p>Vlad said the team then proposed how to manage the risk through the day “marking these volatiles stocks that were driving the activity, positioning closing only. And then, at about an hour before the market closed market opened. So, at 5.30, or five in the morning, they [the NSCC] came back and they said okay, the deposit [should be] 700 million, which we then deposited and paid promptly. And then, everything was fine.</p>
<p>So, that that essentially explains why we had to mark the symbols ‘position closing only’, and also why, you know, we knew this was a bad outcome for customers… Part of what&#8217;s been really difficult is Robinhood stands for, you know, democratizing access to stocks and, yes, we want, we want to give people access so we had no choice in this case, we had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements. And so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.</p>
<p>MUSK: Who controls the clearinghouse?</p>
<p>Vlad: It&#8217;s a consortium. It&#8217;s not quite a government agency. You know, I, I don&#8217;t really know the details all that. But, you know, and to be fair… there was legitimate turmoil in the markets. These are unprecedented events with these meme stocks, there was a lot of activity. So, there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants, higher requirements, so it&#8217;s not entirely unreasonable.</p>
<p>But we did operational processes to make sure that customers that had positions could sell their open positions because obviously restricting someone…We got a lot of questions about ‘you had to restrict buying, why didn&#8217;t you also restrict selling?’ And the fact of the matter is, people get really pissed-off if they&#8217;re holding stock and they want to sell it and they can’t. So that’s categorically worse. Lots of other brokers, I think, we&#8217;re in the same situation. Robinhood who was in the news, but you just sort of heard this industry-wide, other brokers, were basically restricted in the same exact activity.</p>
<p>MUSK: So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head. Either you put up this money or else. Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river? Or did you have no choice? And if you had no choice that&#8217;s understandable. But then, you know, we’ve got to find out why you have no choice. And who are the people that are saying you have no choice?</p>
<p>VLAD: I think that&#8217;s fair. We have to comply with these requirements, financial institutions have requirements. The formula, behind these requirements… it would obviously be ideal if there was a little bit more transparency so we could plan better around that, but to be fair, we were able to open and serve our customers and 24 hours later, our team raised over a billion dollars in capital so that when we do open tomorrow morning we&#8217;ll be able to, kind of, relax the stringent position limits that we put on these securities on Friday.</p>
<p>MUSK: Will there be any limits?</p>
<p>VLAD: Well I think there&#8217;s always going to be some theoretical limit, we don&#8217;t have infinite capital, right? And on Friday, there were limits. So, there&#8217;s always going to have to be some limit, I think the question is, will the limits be high enough to the point where they won&#8217;t impact 99.9-plus percent of customers. So if someone were to deposit $100 billion and decide to trade in one stock that wouldn&#8217;t be possible.</p>
<p>MUSK: If you had no choice then you had no choice. It’s a ‘gun to the head situation’. That’s understandable.</p>
<p>VLAD: Yeah, these are unprecedented times, and to be fair to those guys they&#8217;ve been reasonable. So, I think the one thing that is maybe not clear to people is Robinhood is a participant in the financial system. So we have to work with all of these counter-parties, so we do get a lot of questions about, you know, ‘why do you work with market makers?’, why you work with clearinghouses. Vertically integrating… I mean it&#8217;s hard enough to build an introducing… clearing broker-dealer… not too many people have done that. But the financial system that allows customers to trade shares is sort of a complex web of multiple parties… Everyone says it could be better. It could be improved. It&#8217;s just the necessity of trading equities in the US, that you have to do all these things.</p>
<p>MUSK: To what degree are you beholden to Citadel?</p>
<p>VLAD: There was a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this and that&#8217;s just false. Market makers execute our trades, they execute trades of every broker-dealer. This was a clearinghouse decision, and it was just based on the capital requirements. So, from our perspective, you know, Citadel and other market makers weren&#8217;t involved in that.</p>
<p>MUSK: But wouldn’t they have a strong say on who got put in charge of that organization, since it&#8217;s an industry consortium, not a government regulatory agency?</p>
<p>VLADL I don&#8217;t have any reason to believe that. I think that&#8217;s just like, you know, then you&#8217;re getting into kind of the conspiracy theories a little bit. So, I just have no reason to believe that that&#8217;s the case, you know.</p>
<p>Musk: Okay. Well, I guess we’ll see what happens with directions. Hopefully, that was insightful or at least a little bit entertaining. “Are you not entertaining?” he said. [Apparently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbBiXPVKuTA">a reference to the movie &#8216;Gladiator&#8217;</a>]</p>
<p>The moderators then thank Musk and Vlad for coming on Clubhouse.</p>
<p>Musk said he didn’t know clubhouse existed uptime a week ago.</p>
<p>The moderators wrapped up the session and closed out by playing “Starman” by David Bowie…</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Speaking is one of the hardest parts of learning a new language, especially if you don’t have someone to practice with regularly. <a href="https://elsaspeak.com/en/">ELSA</a> is an app that helps by using speech recognition technology to correct pronunciation. Based in San Francisco and Ho Chi Minh City, ELSA announced today it has raised a $15 million Series B, led by VI (Vietnam Investments) Group and SIG. Other participants included returning investors Google’s AI-focused fund Gradient Ventures, SOSV and Monk’s Hill Ventures, along with Endeavor Catalyst and Globant Ventures.</p>
<p>The capital will be used to expand ELSA’s operations in Latin America and build a scalable B2B platform, allowing companies and educational organizations to offers the app’s coaching services to employees or students. Founded in 2015, ELSA, which stands for English Language Speech Assistant, now claims more than 13 million users. Its last round of funding was a $7 million Series A announced in 2019.</p>

<p>In addition to Latin America, ELSA will also focus on expanding in Vietnam, India and Japan, where it saw high demand last year. The company recently formed a partnership with IDP and British Council, which owns the widely-used IELTS English language test and now recommends ELSA to for test preparation. ELSA is also working with language schools in Vietnam like IMAP and Speak Up, online learning platform YOLA and corporate clients including Kimberly Clark, Intel and ATAD.</p>
<p>ELSA co-founder and chief executive officer Vu Van told TechCrunch that many users want to improve their English speaking proficiency for job opportunities and to increase their earning potential. In Vietnam, India and Brazil, people with higher English speaking proficiency can earn about two to three times more than their colleagues, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This motivation drives a lot of demand for our English learner community in Vietnam, India and Brazil, especially during COVID-19 when we’ve seen enormous interest from the LatAm region as well,&#8221; Van added.</p>

<p>In Vietnam, where Van is from, English learners spend a lot of their disposable income on online or offline English training. &#8220;However, the majority of English learners still struggle to improve their speaking skill because other people don’t understand them or they’re afraid to speak it,&#8221; she said. ELSA was designed to give them an accessible resource to help improve their pronunciation and confidence when speaking English.</p>
<p>Other apps focused on English pronunciation include FluentU and Say It. Van said one of ELSA’s main advantages is its proprietary voice recognition AI tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;What’s unique about our AI is that we’ve collected the largest amount of accented English voice data from millions of users that we have used to train our AI model over the last few years, which gives us a higher accuracy in recognizing and understanding non-native English speakers around the world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The other existing voice recognition technologies available, by comparison, might understand native speakers well but have a hard time understanding non-native accented English learner communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of providing feedback about individual words, ELSA’s app also corrects individual sounds and gives users detailed information on how to improve their pronunciation, including &#8220;very advanced prosodic speaking features like intonation, rhythm and fluency to help them speak English more naturally, something that our competitors don’t offer,&#8221; Van added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.thanksben.com/">Ben</a>, a London-based employee benefits and rewards platform, has raised $2.5 million in funding. The seed round is led by Cherry Ventures, and Seedcamp.</p>
<p>A number of angel investors with backgrounds in fintech and HR tech also participated. They include Paul Forster (founder of Indeed), Taavet Hinrikus (founder of TransferWise), Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas (previously an exec at GoCardless but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/carlos-gonzalez-cadenas-angel-investor-and-coo-of-gocardless-is-joining-index-as-partner/">now a partner at Index Ventures</a>), Philip Reynolds (VP of Engineering at Workday), and Matt Robinson (founder of Nested).</p>
<p>Part fintech, part HR play, Ben has built an employee benefits platform to enable SMEs to offer much more personalised and flexible benefits to employees. The U.K. startup does this via a SaaS for managing benefits, including a benefits marketplace, combined with per-employee debit cards powered by Mastercard.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea is to give employees more individual choice around which benefits they choose, while making it easy to on-board additional providers. This can be via the marketplace or through whitelisting merchant or merchant categories via the employer issued Mastercards, such as food and drink or travel and mobility, or a specific co-working space etc.</p>
<p>“While most companies offer benefits in order to attract and engage team members, and ultimately drive productivity, most solutions don&#8217;t deliver the desired outcomes,” Ben co-founder and CEO Sebastian Fallert tells me. “To have impact, offerings need to work for the individual employees; after all, a ‘benefit’ that’s relevant for somebody working from home in their mid-40s could be next to useless for a new starter in their 20s”.</p>
<p>Fallert says that providing the required level of personalised benefits has been impossible for most small to medium-sized companies due to the “high cost and complexity” of creating and administering personalised programmes. This has seen only large enterprises able to offer flexible benefit programmes where employees get to pick from a range of options. Ben aims to remedy this.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas, angel investor and COO of GoCardless, is joining Index as partner&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/carlos-gonzalez-cadenas-angel-investor-and-coo-of-gocardless-is-joining-index-as-partner/embed/#?secret=ELME1J10xu" data-secret="ELME1J10xu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“The Ben software platform allows companies to load funds and set individual spend rules on how these can be used,” explains Fallert. “Employees are then able to choose from group benefits, such as private medical insurance, mental wellbeing services, or dental plans, while a real per-employee Mastercard opens the door to pretty much any product or service in a tax-efficient and compliant way”.</p>
<p>The result is a “win-win,” says the Ben CEO. “Employees get tailored benefits, and companies only pay for what’s used, take advantage of tax exemptions and preferred pricing, while streamlining the administration”.</p>
<p>The Ben platform is currently used by smaller and mid-market companies, especially those with a distributed team. “It’s these firms in particular that have to deal with the growing complexity of their programmes to keep up with a more diverse and increasingly remote/distributed workforce,” says Fallert.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ben has three revenue streams: a SaaS fee; interchange revenue every time its cards get used; and, of course, affiliate revenue from its marketplace.</p>
<p>Adds the Ben CEO: “One of our core hypotheses is that there are so many amazing services out there that simply can’t get through to companies as they’re often not relevant for all employees, such as debt consolidation or fertility treatment. With Ben, they get easy distribution on standard commercial terms while companies get to offer an additional benefit without any additional overhead”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite China&#8217;s history of stringent media control, an industry of uninstitutionalized, individual publishers has managed to flourish on social media platforms like Tencent&#8217;s WeChat and ByteDance&#8217;s Toutiao. These self-publishers are called &#8220;We Media&#8221; in the Chinese internet lexicon, denoting the independent power of citizen journalists and content creators.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, self-publishers have always had to tread carefully on what they post or risk being targeted by censors who deem them illegal or inappropriate.</p>
<p>The topics they cover are myriad, ranging from fashion and food to politics and current affairs. WeChat, a major destination for self-publishers, hinted last July it had <a href="https://weibo.com/1930378853/J9Pue3PbJ?from=page_1006061930378853_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment#_rnd1612149124822">20 million &#8220;public accounts&#8221;</a>, platforms for individuals to broadcast content and in businesses&#8217; case, reach customers. In 2020, 360 million users read articles published on WeChat public accounts, WeChat founder Allen Zhang <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1olKm1M-18alaHZVrNeS-A">disclosed</a> recently.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sina Weibo, China&#8217;s answer to Twitter, has long attracted citizen journalists. In the early days of COVID-19, millions of Chinese users rushed to Weibo seeking facts from accounts like that of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52712358">Fang Fang</a>, an author who chronicled her experience in Wuhan.</p>
<p>Now, a new development in China&#8217;s internet regulation is about to further restrict China&#8217;s tens of millions of self-publishers.</p>
<p>Public accounts that &#8220;provide online news service to the public shall obtain the Internet News Information Permit and other relevant media accreditation,&#8221; according to a new <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-01/22/c_1612887880656609.htm">regulation</a> (translation <a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/2021-verified-accounts/">here</a>) published January 22 by the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country&#8217;s internet watchdog.</p>
<p>In the following days, WeChat, Baidu, Sohu and other online information services began notifying publishers of the new rule. &#8220;If your account lacks relevant accreditation, you are advised not to edit, report, publish or comment on news about politics, the economy, military, foreign affairs or other major current events,&#8221; according to the <a href="https://developers.weixin.qq.com/community/minihome/doc/000c00f9524608eddd9bbf1405b400">notice</a> sent by WeChat.</p>
<p>&#8220;The WeChat Public Account Platform always commits to providing a green, healthy online environment to users,&#8221; the message adds.</p>
<p>The requirement of news accreditation will likely be a death knell for independent social media publishers that have taken on journalistic roles, particularly those covering politics. &#8220;It&#8217;s not something you can obtain easily unless you&#8217;re an official news outlet or an organization with unmatched resources and background,&#8221; a WeChat account publisher told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Avoiding sensitive topics, such as U.S.-China relations, is always the norm, but the red line on each platform is slightly different, a self-publisher who focuses on finance said. &#8220;Sometimes you will have to try it yourself,&#8221; the person said.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s control on news reaches into every corner of the internet, and regulations are always playing catchup with the pace at which new media, such as microblogs and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/china-underage-livestreaming-ban/">live streaming</a>, flourishes.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TpkKIKE4df"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/china-underage-livestreaming-ban/">China&#8217;s authorities propose to keep minors out of live streaming</a></p></blockquote>

<p>From <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2017-05/02/c_1120902760.htm">2017</a> to <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2019-01/11/c_1122842142.htm">2018</a>, the cyberspace authority granted news permits to a total of 761 &#8220;internet news services,&#8221; which together operated 743 websites, 563 apps, 119 forums, 23 blogs, 3 microblogs, 2285 public accounts, one instant messenger, and 13 live streaming services. In other words, hard news is off limits for internet services of these categories that operate without a news license. It remains to see how platform operators like WeChat and Sina Weibo work to enforce the rules.</p>
<p>Heightening oversight on online information could have merit when it comes to battling misinformation. The new regulation also calls on operators to set up mechanisms like a creator blacklist to root out fake news. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But the regulation overall could have an adverse impact on freedom of expression in China, the International Federation of Journalists <a href="https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/china-authorities-ban-self-publishing-by-journalists-and-censor-online-content.html">warned</a>.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The vaguely defined new rule comes at a time when &#8216;self-media&#8217; has gained huge popularity in China and journalists have begun using such platforms to publish work which was axed by their organisations,&#8221; the IFJ <a href="https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/china-authorities-ban-self-publishing-by-journalists-and-censor-online-content.html">said</a> in a statement published on January 28.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Access to the internet in Myanmar dropped sharply after the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-politics-idUSKBN2A00VK">military detained leaders of ruling party National League for Democracy</a>, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and declared a state of emergency. The NLD won a wide majority of parliamentary seats in<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/world/asia/myanmar-election-aung-san-suu-kyi-results.html"> November’s general election</a>, which the military alleges was the result of election fraud. In a statement on military-owned television, the army said a year-long state of emergency would be declared in Myanmar and power handed to military chief Min Aung Hlaing.</p>
<p><a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-disrupted-in-myanmar-amid-apparent-military-uprising-JBZrmlB6">According to NetBlocks</a>, a non-governmental organization that monitors digital rights, cybersecurity and internet governance around the world, internet disruptions began around 3AM Monday morning local time, with national connectivity falling to 75% of ordinary levels, and then reaching about 50% around 8AM. Data shows that the cuts affected several network operators, including the state-owned Myanma Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and Telenor. NetBlocks said &#8220;preliminary findings [indicate] a centrally ordered mechanism of disruption targeting cellular and some fixed-line services, progressing over time as operators comply.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aye Min Thant, a former correspondent for Reuters who is now the Tech for Peace program manager at Phandeeyar, a tech accelerator in Yangon, <a href="https://twitter.com/the_ayeminthant/status/1356064981712691200">tweeted</a> that she had been logged out of Signal and Telegram overnight, and can’t log in again because cell service is shut down, preventing her from getting verification codes.</p>
<p>The detainment of Suu Kyi and other National League for Democracy leaders comes days after Myanmar’s military attempted to downplay concerns about a coup by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics/myanmar-military-says-it-will-protect-and-follow-constitution-idUSKBN29Z09L">stating it would protect the country’s constitution</a>, despite its allegations of vote fraud in November’s election.</p>
<p>Myanmar came under direct military rule after a 1962 coup replaced the civilian government. In 1990, free elections were held and the NLD won, but the military refused to give up power, placing Suu Kyi under house arrest. After 2011, a transition to democratic rule gradually began, but the military still controlled much of the government.</p>
<p>The NLD has <a href="https://macmillan.yale.edu/news/mounting-evidence-myanmar-highlights-need-full-cooperation-investigations-3-cs-genocide">also been accused of being complicit</a> in the military’s ethnic cleansing campaign against Rohingya Muslims and disenfranchising opponents.</p>
<p>While Myanmar’s government does not practice direct censorship of internet content, <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/myanmar/freedom-net/2019">Freedom House gave the country a score of only 36 out of 100</a> in 2019, citing manipulation of online content by both the military and NLD, and prosecution that forces individuals to self-censor. In June 2019, the government banned the internet in parts of Rakhine and Chin State, the sites of ongoing fighting between the Myanmar military and Arakan Army. Human rights observers including the <a href="https://time.com/5910040/myanmar-internet-ban-rakhine/">Human Rights Watch</a> have said that the internet ban prevents people in those areas from communicating with their families, getting information about COVID-19 or accessing aid.</p>

<p><b>Alpha Global forms to unite Alphabet workers around the world</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha Global announced its formation earlier this week to unite Alphabet workers around the world, including those from the Alphabet Workers Union in the United States, </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22243138/google-union-alphabet-workers-europe-announce-global-alliance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Verge reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Alpha Global, which is affiliated with the UNI Global Union, aims to create a common worker strategy, support fellow workers and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A just Alphabet has wide-ranging implications for our democracies and societies,” </span><a href="https://uniglobalunion.org/sites/default/files/imce/alphabet_commitment_final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha Global said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “That is why we are joining together to demand fundamental human rights for all workers in Alphabet operations, including the right to form or join a union and the right to bargain collectively.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I should mention that you’ll be able to hear more about Alphabet Workers Union at Alpha Global at TC Sessions: Justice directly from Parul Koul, the executive chair of Alphabet Workers Union. You can </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets"><span style="font-weight: 400;">snag your tickets here for just $5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something </span><a href="https://twitter.com/najjmahal/status/1354103341278765056"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feels off</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the watch band, but I can’t quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it’s the commoditization of Black culture. </span></p>

<p><b>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative launches the Justice Accelerator Fund</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has created a new criminal justice reform group, </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/1/27/22251211/mark-zuckerberg-priscilla-chan-czi-criminal-justice-immigration-overhaul"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recode reported this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With $350 million put toward the new Justice Accelerator Fund over the next five years, the organization will focus on criminal justice advocacy. JAF will be led by Ana Zamora, CZI’s current director of criminal justice.</span></p>
<p><b>NLRB gets a new acting general counsel</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden named Peter Sung Ohr the new acting general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board. As Vice’s Lauren Kaori Gurley noted, Ohr’s appointment has the potential to be very good for gig workers and workers rights, in general.</span></p>

<p><b>ServiceNow launches racial equity fund</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With $100 million set aside for the fund, the enterprise software company’s racial equity fund aims to “drive more sustainable wealth creation by funding homeownership, entrepreneurship, and neighborhood revitalization within Black communities in 10 regions across the United States,” </span><a href="https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/racial-equity-fund.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a press release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a nugget on how it’ll work:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ServiceNow Racial Equity Fund will buy smaller community loans to increase the lending capacity for local banks. By increasing access to capital, the investment will facilitate homeownership and entrepreneurship in Black communities, leading to job creation and wider economic growth. The investment, which is the first of its kind for ServiceNow, will initially focus investments in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York, Orlando, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. – locations where ServiceNow has significant operations and community presence.</span></p></blockquote>

<h2>The big thing</h2>
<p>This week was whatever you wanted it to be. A rising up of the proletariat. A case of weaponized disinformation. A rally for regulation&#8230; or perhaps deregulation of financial markets. Choose your own adventure with the starting point being one flavor of chaos leading into a slightly more populist blend of chaos.</p>
<p>At the end of it, a lot of long-time financiers are confused, a lot of internet users are using rent money to buy stock in Tootsie Roll, a lot of billionaires are finding how intoxicating adopting a &#8220;for-the-little-guy!&#8221; persona on Twitter can be, and here I am staring at the ceiling wondering if there&#8217;s any institution in the world trustworthy enough that the internet can&#8217;t turn it into a lie.</p>
<p>This week, my little diddy is about meme stocks, but more about the idea that once you peel away the need to question why you actually trust something, it can become easier to just blindly place that faith in more untrustworthy places. All the better if those places are adjacent to areas where others place trust.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones had its worst week since October because retail investors, organized in part on Reddit, turned America&#8217;s financial markets into the real front page of the internet. Boring, serious stocks like Facebook and Apple reported their earnings and the markets adjusted accordingly, but in addition to the serious bits of news, the Wall Street page was splashed with break neck gains from &#8220;meme stocks.&#8221; While junk stocks surging is nothing new, the idea that a stock can make outrageous gains based on nothing and then <em>possibly</em> hold that value based on a newly formed shared trust is newer and much more alarming.</p>
<p>The most infamous of these stocks was GameStop. <em>(If you&#8217;re curious about GameStop&#8217;s week, there are at least 5 million stories across the web to grab your attention, here&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">one</a>. Side note: collectively we seem to have longer attention spans post-Trump.)</em></p>
<p>So, Americans already don&#8217;t have too much institutional faith. Looking through some long-standing <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx">Gallup research,</a> compared to the turn of the century, faith in organized religion, the media, most wings of government, big business and banks has decreased quite a bit. The outliers in what Americans do seem to trust more than they did 20 or so years ago are small businesses and the military.</p>
<p>This is all to say that it&#8217;s probably not stellar that people don&#8217;t trust anything, and me thinking that the internet could probably disrupt every trusted institution except the military probably only shows my lack of creative thinking when it comes to how the web could democratize the Defense Department. As you might guess from that statement, I think democratizing access to certain institutions can be bad. I say that with about a thousand asterisks leading to footnotes that you&#8217;ll never find. I also don&#8217;t think the web is done disrupting institutional trust by a long shot, for better or worse.</p>
<p>Democratizing financial systems sounds a lot better from a populist lift, until you realize that the guys users are competing against are playing a different game with other people&#8217;s money. This saga will change plenty of lives but it won&#8217;t end particularly well for a most people exposed to &#8220;infinite upside&#8221; day trading.</p>
<p>Until this week, in my mind Robinhood was only reckless because it was exposing (or &#8220;democratizing access to&#8221; &#8212; their words) consumers to risk in a way that most of them probably weren&#8217;t equipped to handle. Now, I think that they&#8217;re reckless because they didn&#8217;t anticipate that OR how democratized access could lead to so many potential doomsday scenarios and bankrupt Robinhood. They quietly raised a $1 billion liquidity lifeline this week after they had to temporarily shut down meme stock trading, a move that essentially torched their brand and left them the web&#8217;s most hated institution. (Facebook had a quiet week)</p>
<p>This kind of all feeds back into this idea I&#8217;ve been feeding that scale can be very dangerous. Platforms seem to need a certain amount of head count to handle global audiences, and almost all of them are insufficiently staffed. Facebook announced this week in its earnings call that it has nearly 60,000 employees. This is a company that now has its own Supreme Court; that&#8217;s too big. If your institution is going to be massive and centralized, chances are you need a ton of people to moderate it. That&#8217;s something at odds with most existing internet platforms. Realistically, the internet would probably be happier with fewer of these sweeping institutions and more intimate bubbles that are loosely connected. That&#8217;s something that the network effects of the past couple decades have made harder but regulation around data portability could assist with.</p>
<p>Writing this newsletter, something I&#8217;m often reminded is that while it feels like everything is always changing, few things are wholly new. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/25/magazine/jonathan-lebed-s-extracurricular-activities.html">This great NYT profile from 2001 written by Michael Lewis</a> is a great reminder of that, chronicling a 15-year-old who scammed the markets by using a web of dummy accounts and got hounded by the SEC but still walked away with $500k. Great read.</p>
<p>In the end, things will likely quiet down at Robinhood. There&#8217;s also the distinct chance that they don&#8217;t and that those meme traders just ignited a revolution that&#8217;s going to bankrupt the company and torch the globals markets, but you know things will probably go back to normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until next week,<br />
Lucas Matney</p>

I&#8217;ll try to keep these updates GameStop free, but one quick note from the peanut gallery. The SEC isn&#8217;t all that happy about the goings ons in the market this week and they&#8217;re mad, probably mostly at Robinhood. They got pretty terse with their statement. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/sec-issues-statement-on-past-weeks-turbulent-market-activity-prompted-by-reddit-fueled-gamestop-run/"><strong>More</strong></a></p>

I&#8217;m sure any of Facebook&#8217;s executives would&#8217;ve stopped building the platform dead in its tracks in the years after its founding if they knew just how freaking complicated moderation was going to end up being for them, but you could probably have changed their mind back by showing them the market cap.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/facebook-trump-oversight-board-public-comment/"><strong> More</strong></a></p>

After delaying its launch, Apple committed this week to the spring rollout of its &#8220;App Tracking Transparency&#8221; feature that has so much of the adtech world pissed.

Celebrity investing has been popular forever, but it&#8217;s gotten way more common in the venture world in recent years. Reputation transfer teamed with the fact that money is so easy to come by for top founders, means that if you are choosing from some second-tier fund or The Chainsmokers, you might pick The Chainsmokers. On that note, actor Robert Downey Jr. raised a rolling fund to back climate tech startups, we&#8217;ve got all the deets. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/robert-downey-jr-is-launching-a-new-rolling-venture-fund-to-back-sustainability-startups/"><strong>More</strong></a></p>

Ah poor Adam Neumann, poor SoftBank. If only they&#8217;d kept their little &#8220;tech company&#8221; under wraps for another couple years and left that S-1 for a kinder market with less distaste for creative framing. It seems that WeWork is the next target to get SPAC&#8217;d and be brought onto public markets via acquisition.

Big tech is a gentlemen&#8217;s game, generally big tech CEOs play nice with each other in public and save their insults for the political party that just fell out of power. This week, Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg were a little less friendly. Zuckerberg called out Apple by name in their earnings investor call and floated some potential unfair advantages that Apple might have. Them&#8217;s fighting words. Cook was more circumspect as usual and delivered a speech that was at times hilariously direct in the most indirect way possible about how much he hates Facebook. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/"><strong>More</strong></a></p>

<h2>Extra things</h2>
<p><em>Tidbits from our paywalled Extra Crunch content:</em><br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/the-5-biggest-mistakes-i-made-as-a-first-time-startup-founder/"><strong>The 5 biggest mistakes I made as a first-time startup founder</strong></a><br />
&#8220;I and the rest of the leadership team would work 12-hour days, seven days a week. And that trickled down into many other employees doing the same. I didn’t think twice about sending emails, texts or slacks at night and on weekends. As with many startups, monster hours were simply part of the deal.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/fintechs-could-see-100-billion-of-liquidity-in-2021/"><strong>Fintechs could see $100 billion of liquidity in 2021</strong></a><br />
&#8220;For the fourth straight year, the publicly traded fintechs massively outperformed the incumbent financial services providers as well as every mainstream stock index. While the underlying performance of these companies was strong, the pandemic further bolstered results as consumers avoided appearing in-person for both shopping and banking. Instead, they sought — and found — digital alternatives.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/"><strong>Rising African venture investment powers fintech, clean tech bets in 2020</strong></a><br />
&#8220;What is driving generally positive venture capital results for Africa in recent quarters? Giuliani told TechCrunch in a follow-up email that &#8216;investment in Africa is being driven on the one hand by a broadening base for early-stage ecosystem support organizations, including accelerators, seed funds, syndicates and angel investing,” and “consolidation,” which is aiding both “growth-stage deals and a burgeoning M&amp;A market.'&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The new Netflix film &#8220;The White Tiger&#8221; tells the story of Balram, who is born to a poor family in the Indian village of Laxmangarh and escapes by using his intelligence and determination, ultimately becoming a successful entrepreneur in Bangalore.</p>
<p>Viewers knows this from the start, as Balram (played by Adarsh Gourav) narrates his life story in an email, apparently written to explain his success to China&#8217;s visiting head of state. That narration is one of the best things about the movie, providing plenty of black comedy while also allowing Balram to justify his choices in what — by his own admission — is an increasingly disturbing story.</p>
<p>As we explain in the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, &#8220;The White Tiger&#8221; makes a convincing case for the ruthlessness needed to escape from poverty, while also painting a damning portrait of Balram&#8217;s employers, the American-educated Ashok (Rajkummar Rao) and Pinky (Priyanka Chopra Jonas), whose ostensible warmth and compassion only go so far.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If &#8220;The White Tiger&#8221; falls short at all, it&#8217;s in comparison to &#8220;Parasite,&#8221; a film that deals with similar themes in even more ambitious and virtuosic ways. But a movie can fail to reach the heights of &#8220;Parasite&#8221; while still being quite good.</p>
<p>In addition to our review, we also discuss <a href="https://wonderland-at-home.myshopify.com">The Mother Box</a>, a $130 meal kit tied to the March release of Zack Snyder&#8217;s cut of &#8220;Justice League&#8221; on HBO Max.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>What a week. What a <em>month</em>. Are you doing all right? It’s okay if you are tired. We all are. That’s why we have weekends.</p>
<p>Let’s reflect on what happened this week: Individual traders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">outraged</a> more professional investors by doing something hilarious, namely taking a trade that made some sense &#8212; betting that an atrophying physical retailer was going to continue obsolesce &#8212; and inverting it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By going long on GameStop, investors flipped the script on the smart money. Then all heck snapped free, some stocks got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">blocked on trading services</a>, Congress got mad, billionaires started to front on Twitter like they were the Common Man, some cryptos surged, including <em>Dogecoin</em> of all things, and as we headed into the weekend nothing was truly resolved. It was weird.</p>
<p>Let’s talk over the lessons we’ve learned. First, don’t short a stock so heavily that you are at risk of having the trade exposed and inverted to your detriment. Second, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/how-robinhood-and-chime-raised-2b-in-the-last-year/">fintech startups that TechCrunch has covered for years</a> were more brittle than anticipated, either thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">reserve requirements or simple platform risk</a>. And third, things can <em>always</em> get dumber.</p>
<p>Evidence of that final lesson came during the week’s news cycle in which it became known that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/report-wework-could-be-getting-spacd-soon-too/">WeWork might pursue a public listing via a SPAC</a>. So much for this year being more serious and normal than 2020.</p>
<p>But let’s stop recapping and get into our main topic today, namely a chat that I had with the person I actually work for, <a href="https://twitter.com/gurugk">Guru Gowrappan</a>, the CEO of Verizon Media Group (VMG). For those who don’t know, Verizon owns VMG, which in turn owns TechCrunch. VMG is a collection of assets, ranging from Yahoo to media brands to technology products. It does billions in yearly revenue, which should help frame how far above my seat &#8212; an excellent perch inside of TechCrunch, but not one that comes with org-chart stature &#8212; Guru sits.</p>
<p>Very far away.</p>
<p>But we follow each other on Twitter and after Verizon reported earnings this week, inclusive of some honestly pretty good numbers from VMG <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1354053674964807681">that I tweeted about</a>, I got about half an hour of Guru’s time. This meant that I had my boss’s boss’s [etc] boss on the record with zero agenda. How could I say no?</p>
<p>For context, VMG <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/investors/quarterly-reports/4q-2020-earnings-conference-call-webcast">generated</a> $2.3 billion in Q4 revenue, up 11% from the year-ago quarter. Verizon <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/file/52729/download?token=CdDAGqL6">described</a> that as “the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the Yahoo! acquisition.” What drove the result? Per the Verizon earnings call, “strong advertising trends with demand-side platform revenue growing 41% compared to the prior year.”</p>
<p>If you are Guru or, frankly, your humble servant, the growth was welcome after VMG’s revenue had dipped to $1.4 billion in Q2 2020, off 24.5% from its year-ago result.</p>
<p>I had a few questions: Would the recent advertising momentum persist in 2021, something that could impact a host of businesses far beyond the VMG org; how important was it to Verizon that VMG had managed to post year-over-year growth; how he expects to balance commerce revenue and journalism; and what Guru thinks about new media products like the recent rebirth of newsletter tech, something that Substack and Twitter and even Facebook are tinkering with.</p>
<p>Here’s what I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding strong advertising performance in the final months of the year during COVID, Guru said that “the core fundamentals [of] the market dynamics have changed so that they’re more permanent,” adding that consumer behavior is now “more digital, more online” than before.</li>
<li>The VMG CEO declined to share Q1 2021 expectations in detail, but did note that VMG is aiming to “continue [its] momentum.”</li>
<li>Part of that momentum comes from subscription products, which Guru cited as a win: <em>“If you look at one of the trends that happened due to COVID, consumers [are] moving to more trusted content and want to spend more time and money on consuming subscription-based products [&#8230;] TechCrunch/Extra Crunch grew almost 196% year-on-year.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>My read of his answer to where we are today is that it’s not a bad time to be in the online media game, which isn’t something that has been true much in the past few years, looking around the remains of the journalism industry.</li>
<li>Regarding VMG’s home inside of Verizon &#8212; something that I’ve thought about after <a href="https://digiday.com/media/they-wanted-to-unload-it-bad-why-huffpost-made-sense-for-buzzfeed-and-verizon-media-group/">the Buzzfeed-HuffPost deal</a> &#8212; I asked Guru if VMG’s recent financial performance made our company more attractive to Verizon, and if we have proven the bet that we were trying to make. This, by the way, is the sort of question that is pretty easy to write down, but slightly harder to ask when you are talking to someone who could terminate you at will. Anyway, Guru said “completely” in response. The VMG CEO summarized the Verizon CEO as saying that the media business is “core” to Verizon, and that our parent company “will continue to invest in the media business while we continue to deliver on our promise.” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">So sign up for Extra Crunch</a>.</li>
<li>Guru said VMG won’t exchange revenue for credibility when it comes to promoting e-commerce across its platform: “At no point will we trade dollar value in a transaction for trust; there’s no way. [&#8230;] The editorial team keeps me honest,” he said, adding that he stays out of changes that might upset journalistic balance. That was good to hear.</li>
<li>And finally, are there <strong>new media products</strong> that VMG may want to emulate, or buy? Guru was generally bullish on personalization, but declined to dish that VMG is about to buy Substack or anything like that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh and I asked if VMG is going to sell, or otherwise divest, any other media properties in the wake of the HuffPost-BuzzFeed decision. Guru said that the Verizon CEO said that the broader company is “fully committed” to the media business, and that that won’t be “built upon divestment.” Instead, he said, it will be built “upon investing and growing,” adding that there are “no plans to sell any additional properties.” As I like my health insurance, that was nice to hear.</p>
<p>I understand that the above is not a standard sort of Exchange entry, but one thing that I will always try to do is take the conversations that come my way thanks to my job, and bring them to you.</p>
<p>Now, back to venture capital.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>GameStop was your entire Twitter feed this week but there is other stuff you need to know. Alfred, a US-based fintech <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2021/01/171628-u-s-fintech-albert-raises-100-million-through-series-c-funding-round-led-by-general-atlantic/">raised $100 million</a> on Tuesday, to pick an example. The company fuses digital intelligence and humans to help users manage their financial lives. Neat.</p>
<p>And adding to our recent data-focused coverage of 2020 venture data &#8212; including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/">dive into the African VC market</a> &#8212; investing group Work-Bench <a href="https://www.work-bench.com/the-state-of-enterprise-tech-in-nyc-2h-2020-funding-report">put together a look</a> at how NYC’s enterprise tech scene performed in the second half of last year. This is the exact sort of data I would parse for you during a more regular week. But since we had <em>this</em> week, you have to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Sticking to data, <a href="https://www.hallothere.com/">Hallo</a>, a startup that helps companies recruit more diverse candidates, dropped a sheaf of data in its “<a href="https://medium.com/halloapp/startups-raised-over-12-billion-in-q4-2020-only-40-were-led-by-black-founders-694d39ab866c">Black Founder Funding Q4 2020</a>” report. Read it. If you don’t have time, I’ll give you the headline stat that both caught my eye and depressed my heart<em>: “Hallo&#8217;s research found that out of the 1,537 companies analyzed [in Q4 2020], 40 were led by Black founders.” </em></p>
<p>And this week I got to yammer with Microsoft after it <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2021-Q2/press-release-webcast">reported earnings</a>. Saving most of that for a later date, two things were clear: The cloud world still has oodles of growth ahead of it, which is good news for a large chunk of the startup software market. And if you wanted more data on Teams’ growth to better understand why Salesforce bought Slack, wait another quarter.</p>
<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>
<p>Closing out, in August of 2014 I came up with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/14/free-startup-idea-burritocannon/">the idea for a burrito cannon food delivery service</a>. You would push a button in an app, and it would deliver a burrito to your office sans the need for you to make choices. Then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/15/yo-guys-postmates-built-burritocannon-for-me/">Postmates actually built a burrito cannon into its app</a>, which was both hilarious and fun.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2021, and Postmates is now part of Uber. And it is <a href="https://postmates.com/blog/can-jerry-rice-catch-a-100-yard-burrito"><em>back</em> with the return of the burrito cannon</a>:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qs9zZVptIwM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>I did not anticipate that my lazy, stupid idea would help get an NFL star, over a half decade later, to sprint down a field as an industrial-scale potato cannon shot a Mexican delight in his direction. But it’s 2021 and this is where we are.</p>
<p>Evidence, I think, that <em>all</em> my startup ideas are brilliant,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSFbbwG5Peo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Still figuring out what this newsletter is, I’m torn between aggregation and writing. The inputs vary from blog posts, Twitter threads, and the occasional video. Podcasting seems oddly muzzled by the acceleration of streaming. Blog posts are a misnomer; professional blogs represent the bulk of news and media citations, not usually the single voices of RSS yore.</p>
<p>Linear media is bifurcated between quick takes like The Recount and user tweets of streaming cable news. Podcasting meets longer form streaming with live casting on Facebook Live, Twitter (formerly Periscope), YouTube, and nascent LinkedIn live. As I discovered during a Restreamed recording session of the Gang, the Facebook Live version includes realtime captioning.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On this version of the show, recorded four days before the Inauguration of the Biden presidency, a familiar mood radiates from the Zoomcast. Anxiety, tinged with doubt that we will escape the grip of the pandemic any time soon, or the blight of Trump-o-nomics at all. Now, as I post this, there’s a reasonable chance of a renewal of rationality and respect. Then, it was a jump ball at best.</p>
<p>When we record the show, I leave either CNN or MSNBC on the monitor behind me. Given that we configure Zoom in Gallery Mode for the most part, that ups the chance that one of us will notice if some breaking news (haha) appears. It’s mostly for the sense of being plugged in without being overwhelmed by the repetitive analysis that oh, yes we are in deep trouble. Controlled anxiety beats plain old anxiety most of the time. Nonetheless, I still get complaints from viewers to turn it off.</p>
<p>I like the delay of the realtime version to accommodate post production sweetening with music and lower third titles. The interval gives me a chance to come up with a theme for this post to accompany the mixed show, and it allows for some of the buzzy issues to recede in favor of more sticky foreshadowing of the next show. Around this time, we usually come up with a title for the show. You may not find this all that interesting, but it helps me endure my pathetic contributions to the show.</p>
<p>On this session, Frank Radice is heard quoting lines from Firesign Theatre records. In the early days, we used to sit around college dorms and what we thought passed for hippie crash pads, reciting these Firesign catch phrases. In slightly earlier times, we did this with Bill Cosby records, in later years Monty Python routines. Michael Markman had posted to the Gang Telegram feed a Wisconsin Public Radio conversation with the two surviving TFTers Phil Proctor and David Ossman.</p>
<p>Back then, the comedy group had released I Think We’re All Bozos on This Bus, featuring a futuristic ride on a Firesign update of the Disneyland animatronic Presidents attraction. Now, Michael wondered whether Disney would add Trump to the ride when it reopens. It’s a good question. What, whether Disneyland will reopen?</p>
<p>So, newsletters. It seems possible the form is subsuming many of the pieces of blogging, podcasting, streaming, and social networking into a new construct. Where blogs once represented a ticket to parity with the mainstream of journalism, now journalists are acquiring parity with individual voices. Cable news not only feels like podcasting with its oversupply of talking head roundtables, but each anchor has a separate podcast to boot. Just as the record business ate the movies business with Saturday Night Fever, so too are the cable networks eating the broadcast networks as they are in turn eaten by the streamers.</p>
<p>And just as the former president was deplatformed by the social networks, live streamers are replatformed in this newslettered channel-in-your-pocket. Commentary, notification-based two-way feedback, realtime analytics, first party data relationships with creators and subscribers. More creation, less curation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Robinhood, a startup that promises to make finance accessible for all, temporarily limited trading on GameStop, AMC, and other memestocks, many retail investors were pissed that the fintech darling suddenly didn’t live up to its name. The specific reasons may have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">short-term and technical</a>, but the choice looked corrupt to the average person.</p>
<p>Here’s why: The presence of a massive hedge fund as a main Robinhood partner and supporter of the short-sellers is exactly what Robinhood users are rallying against. The obvious conflict shows that “democratizing finance” was always somewhat of an ironic tagline. Retail investors are already pouring into competitor apps like <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/webull-and-public-remove-restrictions-on-memestocks-after-citing-trade-settlement-firm-as-the-cause/ ">Public and Webull</a>, and looking for more shorts to take on.</p>
<p>What can other startups learn? Here are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-gamestop-this-is-2021/">some lessons</a>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First, the push for decentralized systems will become more aggressive, positioning startups in the cryptocurrency and overall DeFi space well. On Thursday, Reddit co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/alexisohanian">Alexis Ohanian</a> spoke to Congresswoman <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> on a Twitch stream about the GameStop saga.</p>
<p>“No one&#8217;s gonna wake up in a week and be like let’s all go back to how it was. The collective public cannot unsee this, and so I think that there’s going to be more and more energy to find decentralized solutions. There is so much energy to rally behind something that isn’t capable of having the game rigged,” Ohanian said. As Bitcoin reaches record highs, the Robinhood meltdown only further adds momentum to the asset.</p>
<p>My second takeaway is that fintech startups in the retail trading space have never been more aware of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/how-trading-apps-are-responding-to-the-gamestop-fustercluck/ "> iron fist of regulatory pressure</a>. While one company may have fallen on the sword this time, it doesn’t mean that other startups are safe and/or able to promise open doors and a free market forever. The big question for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/female-led-startups-dominate-catalyst-funds-inclusive-fintech-2021-cohort/ ">early-stage fintech startups</a> is how to innovate amid a revolution.</p>
<p>That’s all I can make sense out of for now, and <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-gamestop-this-is-2021/ ">there’s more on the pod</a> if you’re interested. What do you think the long-term ramifications of this wild Wall Street week are on startups?

<h2>Climate tech sprouts</h2>
<p>Early-stage financing for climate tech is lackluster, but category startups need aggressive capital in order to grow to the correct scale (and, you know, save the world from eternal doom). Our reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/jshieber">Jonathan Shieber</a> covered a number of stories this week that shed light on how many investors in the ecosystem are waking up to the importance of climate tech.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Robert Downey Jr., launched a new rolling venture fund, powered by AngelList, <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/robert-downey-jr-is-launching-a-new-rolling-venture-fund-to-back-sustainability-startups/ ">to back sustainability startups. </a></p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> Why one venture capitalist thinks <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/spacs-are-the-construct-vcs-need-to-fund-cleantech/ ">SPACs are the way to go for cleantech startups</a>. Also, an early-stage accelerator launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/urban-x-launches-its-latest-cohort-as-the-world-catches-up-to-the-accelerators-climate-thesis/">latest cohort of sustainable startups.</a></p>

<h2>Long live anything other than ‘Zoom School’</h2>
<p>It has been remarkable to witness the boom, and ensuing consolidation, of edtech in less than a year. In yet another busy week for the sector, uplifted by the pandemic’s blunt force of remote learning, we have financings, public market debuts and what more than a dozen of investors are looking for next.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/">13 investors say that lifelong learning is taking edtech mainstream. </a>Consumer edtech has always had an easier time selling, since parents spend more than a stodgy institution ever will. What’s new, though, is that there’s an opportunity to serve with learners beyond the school day. There’s much <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/">more in our investor survey</a>, along with details on what opportunities are fading in the sector, and what is the biggest hurdle for an early-stage edtech startup.</p>
<p><strong>Etc: </strong>A company aiming to be the <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/inspirit-seed/ ">Minecraft of science class</a> just launched with seed financing from a flurry of investors. A company founded in 2011 spent eight years without monetizing, and <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/ ">now is profitable with hundreds of thousands of paid subscribers</a>. Oh, and an unprofitable but growing edtech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/?tpcc=ECTW2020">is going public via SPAC</a>.</p>

<h2>SPAC it up</h2>
<p>SPACs are like weeds: If you pull one out, another one pops right up! 300 of ‘em, to be exact.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>This week, Chamath Palihapitiya announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/unpacking-chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-deals-for-latch-and-sunlight-financial/">two SPAC deals for Latch and Sunlight Financial</a>. My colleague and podcast co-host Alex Wilhelm unpacked the numbers behind these decisions in an Extra Crunch post.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/coinbase-is-going-public-via-direct-listing/ ">Coinbase is going public</a> via direct listing. <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/squarespace-files-privately-to-go-public/ ">Squarespace filed privately </a>to go public. <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/report-wework-could-be-getting-spacd-soon-too/ ">WeWork might be going public</a> through a reverse merger.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone.</p>
<p>And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week, we&#8217;re taking a look at the biggest news in the world of apps, including how the GameStop frenzy impacted trading apps, as well as how Apple&#8217;s privacy changes are taking shape in 2021, and more.</p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>The internet comes for the stock market, via trading apps</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2105946" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2105946" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2105946" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?w=680" alt="illustration of robinhood feather logo spraypainted on a brick wall" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robinhood-brick-wall.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2105946" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Was there really any other app news story this week, beside the GameStop short squeeze? That a group of Reddit users took on the hedge funds was the stuff of legends, even if the reality was that Wall Street likely <a href="https://themargins.substack.com/p/game-stop">got in on both sides</a> of the trade. Whether you found yourself in the camp of admiring the spectacle or watching the train wreck in horror (or both), what we witnessed &#8212; at long last, I suppose &#8212; was the internet coming for the stock market. The GameStop frenzy upended the status quo; it rattled the traditional ways of doing things &#8212; much like what the internet has done to almost everything else it touches &#8212; whether that&#8217;s publishing, media, creation, politics, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is community,&#8221; explained Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, in an interview on AOC&#8217;s Twitch channel on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is something that spans platforms and the internet, especially in the last 10 years &#8212; in particular social media and smartphone ubiquity. All these things have connected us in real-time ways to organize around ideas, around concepts,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;We seek out those communities. We seek out that sense of identity. We seek out that sense of connection. And the internet supercharges it because of scale,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think one of the byproducts of where I think it continues to go is more of a push towards decentralization and more of a push toward individuals being able to take ownership &#8212; even individuals being able to get access &#8212; to do the same things that institutions, historically, had a monopoly on,&#8221; Ohanian noted.</p>
<p>Trading app Robinhood and social app Reddit, home to the WallStreetBets forum driving the GameStop push, immediately benefitted from the community-driven effort to squeeze the hedge funds &#8212; and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-and-reddit-top-the-app-store-as-trading-apps-surge-following-gamestop-mania/"> jumped to the top of the App Store.</a></p>
<p>But Robinhood&#8217;s subsequent failure to be transparent as to why it was forced to stop customers from buying the &#8220;meme&#8221; stocks, like GameStop and others (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-and-reddit-top-the-app-store-as-trading-apps-surge-following-gamestop-mania/">it needed more cash</a>), quickly damaged its reputation. Some investors have now sued for their losses. Others <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-gme-remove-from-app-store/">started petitions</a>. And even more began downranking the app <a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1354803580713111553">with one-star reviews</a>, which Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store">then removed.</a></p>

<p>Other trading apps have gained not only during the frenzy itself, but also after, as Robinhood users looked for alternative platforms after being burned by the free trading app.</p>
<p>As of Friday, Robinhood remained at No. 1 on the App Store, but is now being closely trailed on the Top Free iPhone apps chart by No. 2 Webull, No. 6 Fidelity, No. 7 Cash App, No. 12 TD Ameritrade and No. 15 E*TRADE, among others.</p>

<p>Crypto apps are also topping the charts, as users realize the potential of collective action in markets not yet dominated by the billionaires. Coinbase popped to No. 4, while Binance-run apps were at No. 9 and No. 19, Voyager was No. 23 and Kraken No. 24.</p>
<p>In addition, forums where traders can join communities are also continuing to do well, with Reddit at No. 3, Discord at No. 14 and Telegram at No. 28, as of the time of writing.</p>

<p>Google failed to meet its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/">earlier promised deadline</a> of rolling out privacy labels to its nearly 100-some iOS apps. Its initial estimate followed suggestions (<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90591066/googles-ios-apps-havent-been-updated-in-weeks-apples-privacy-labels-could-be-the-reason-why">aided</a> by Apple&#8217;s typical quiet confirmations to press), that Google had been struggling over how to handle the privacy issues the updates would reveal. This week, Google again said its labels were on the way. But now, it&#8217;s not making any specific promises about when those labels would arrive. Instead, the company <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/preparing-developers-and-advertisers-for-policy-updates/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FATHs+%28Google+Ads+%26+Commerce+Blog%29">just said</a> the labels would roll out as Google updated its iOS apps with new features and bug fixes, rather than rolling out the labels to all its apps at once.</p>

<p>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">announced</a> this week its tracking restrictions for iOS apps are nearing arrival. The changes had initially been pushed back to give developers more time to make updates, but will now arrive in &#8220;early spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once live, the previous opt-out model for sharing your Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) will change to an opt-in model, meaning developers will have to ask users&#8217; permission to track them. Most users will likely say &#8220;no,&#8221; and be annoyed by the request. Users will also be able to adjust IDFA sharing in Settings on a per-app basis, or on all apps at once.</p>

<p>Facebook has already been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-fb-earnings-q4-2020.html">warning investors</a> of the ad revenue hit that will result from these changes, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/facebook-q4-earnings-2">it expects to see</a> in the first quarter earnings. It may also be <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-looks-to-take-its-fight-with-apple-to-court">preparing a lawsuit</a>. Google, meanwhile, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/27/google-apps-to-stop-using-ad-tracker-highlighted-by-ios-14">said</a> it would be adopting Apple&#8217;s SKAdNetwork framework and providing feedback to Apple about its potential improvements.</p>
<p>For years, Apple has been laying the groundwork to establish itself as the company that cares about consumer privacy. And it&#8217;s certainly true that no other large tech company has yet to give users this much power to fight back against being tracked around the web and inside apps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2006406" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg 2792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1155 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>But this is not a case of Apple being the &#8220;good guy&#8221; while everyone else is &#8220;bad&#8221; &#8212;  because the multi-billion-dollar ad industry is not that simple. With a change to its software, Apple has effectively carved out a seat at the table for its own benefit.</p>
<p>What many don&#8217;t realize is that Apple watches what its users do across its own platform, inside a number of its first-party apps &#8212; including in Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple Books, Apple News and the App Store. It then uses that first-party data to personalize the ads it displays in Apple News, Stocks and the App Store.</p>
<p>So while other businesses are tracking users around the web and apps to gain data that lets them better personalize ads at scale, Apple only tracks users inside its own apps and services. (But there sure are a lot of them! And Apple keeps launching new ones, too.)</p>
<p>With the new limits that impact the effectiveness of ads <em>outside</em> of Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, advertisers who need to reach a potential customer &#8212; say, with an app recommendation &#8212; will need to throw more money into <em>Apple-delivered advertising</em> instead. This is because Apple&#8217;s ads will be capable of making those <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074">more targeted, personalized</a> and, therefore, more effective recommendations.</p>
<p>Apple says it will play by the same rules that it&#8217;s asking other developers to abide by. Meaning, if its apps want to track you, they&#8217;ll ask. But most of its apps do not &#8220;track&#8221; using IDFA. Meanwhile, if users want to turn off personalized ads using Apple&#8217;s <em>first</em>-party data, that&#8217;s a different setting. (Settings &#8211;&gt; Privacy &#8211;&gt; scroll to bottom &#8211;&gt; Apple Advertising &#8211;&gt; toggle off Personalized Ads). And no, you won&#8217;t be shown a pop-up asking you if that&#8217;s a setting you want on or off.</p>

With now over 180 investors and a pandemic coming to an end &#8212; perhaps &#8212; with the vaccine rollout, Clubhouse will soon have to prove it has value in a reopened world where there&#8217;s more to do, including, once again, networking events and <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/clubhouse-app-people-who-miss-conferences/">conferences</a>. It will also eventually have to contend with what sort of app it becomes when it finally opens up to the public. So far, its private, insiders-only atmosphere has given it something of a protected status. Though conversations have turned toxic at times, only a few users ever heard them &#8212; and there&#8217;s no transcript. When the world piles in, however, Clubhouse could not only lose its exclusive appeal but also become host to conversations that do real harm.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India plans to introduce a law to ban private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in the country and provide a framework for the creation of an official digital currency during the current budget session of parliament.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://loksabhadocs.nic.in/bull2mk/2021/29012021.pdf">agenda</a> (PDF) published on the lower house website, the legislation seeks to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India,&#8221; but allow “for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology [blockchain] of cryptocurrency and its uses.”</p>
<p>The law also seeks to “create a facilitative framework for creation of the official digital currency” that will be issued by the nation’s central bank, Reserve Bank of India, the agenda said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2018, an Indian government panel recommended banning all private cryptocurrencies and proposed up to 10 years of jail time for offenders. The panel also suggested the government to explore a digital version of the fiat currency and ways to implement it.</p>
<p>At the time, RBI said the move was necessary to curb “ring-fencing” of the country’s financial system. It had also argued that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cannot be treated as currencies as they are not made of metal or exist in physical form, nor were they stamped by the government. The 2018 notice from the central bank sent a panic to several local startups and companies offering services to trade in cryptocurrency. Nearly all of them have either since closed shop, or pivoted to serve other markets.</p>
<p>This proposal was challenged by several exchanges and traders, who filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court. The nation’s apex court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/india-lifts-ban-on-cryptocurrency-trading/">ruled in their favor last year</a>. This ruling was seen as &#8220;historic&#8221; but it did not impact the earlier circular on the policy level.</p>
<p>“Since the government is considering introducing the bill during this session of Parliament, we are sure the government will definitely listen to all the stakeholders before taking any decision,” said Sumit Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of CoinDCX,a cryptocurrency exchange in India.</p>
<p>“We are talking to other stakeholders and will definitely initiate deeper dialogue with the government and showcase how we can actually create a healthy ecosystem in unison,” he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Dublin is a really vibrant startup ecosystem," said Michelle Dervan of Rethink Education Management. "Young population. Lots of government supports to encourage entrepreneurship."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ireland&#8217;s technology scene has come in leaps and bounds in the last decade, with a growing VC scene, plenty of startups and tech giants attracted by the nation&#8217;s favorable tax incentives and talent pool.</p>
<p>Google, Facebook, Slack, Microsoft and Dropbox each have a European headquarters sited in Dublin. As the EU&#8217;s only remaining English-language speaking hub, Ireland is attracting more diversity in its founders than ever before, plus the tech diaspora is returning to its roots as the ecosystem matures.</p>
<p>We surveyed five local VCs to find out if they had any wisdom to share with TechCrunch readers who are considering hiring, investing or founding a company in Ireland this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>VCs in Ireland don’t stray far from home, but there are plenty of great deals to be had there anyway. A small domestic market means Irish startups think internationally from launch, and there are high-quality seed opportunities. Top-tier American VCs like Sequoia are placing bets on Irish companies, sometimes even at a pre-seed stage.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has not really impacted many investment strategies — aside from the switch to Zoom calls instead of meet-and-greets — but it has made hiring more challenging, given the competitiveness of the local labor market. Still, top engineering talent is cheaper there than in the U.S., which means entrepreneurs can create great companies with less overhead.</p>

<h2>Andrew O&#8217;Neill, principal, Act Venture Capital</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We are seeing high-quality seed opportunities that are leading with exciting developer-first/bottoms-up go-to-market strategies in both security and enterprise software. The shift left in security is very well-publicized, but we feel the cultural element of developers truly caring about security and implementing it at design phase is still only beginning … and it&#8217;s hugely exciting.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s a B2B SaaS design tool, in the world of Figma, Sketch and Invision App … and has some very interesting angels. It is only just complete and not announced yet … and we have not talked to any PR agencies yet, but would be happy to pitch an exclusive to you ;)</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
As a domestic market, Ireland is very small … so by its very nature, we do not see the same level of great B2C as the U.K. The expertise … and second, third-time consumer-tech founders are not as common, but there are still of course huge opportunities in the consumer space and companies like Buymie are proving it can be done in Ireland.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Like every investment: The people that truly understand the pain point, have passion around the product, have the patience and grit to keep going, and finally the potential for this company to become a category creator.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
No competition means no market … however there are high volumes of startups empowering remote working, productivity tools and HR tech focused around company culture metrics etc. … but that said, there is a wave of change happening around the future of work that no one has a crystal ball on, and new category winners will still emerge.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Very focused on Ireland and more than 50% … we can invest in Series A and B across Europe, but we invest at seed exclusively in Ireland.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Enterprise software startups have always been well-positioned for success within Ireland, and that has only increased with the secondary effects now appearing from the result of great talent coming out of large MNCs driven by 20+ years of FDI. Act has invested in over 120 companies and over half is in enterprise software. We are excited about seeing a new emerging amount of repeat founders in our portfolio (and Ireland) like Barry Lunn in Provizio, and Cathal McGloin in ServisBOT.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
When we looked at all the data in Ireland recently, there has been a 115% increase from €401 million to €860 million invested per annum over the last four years. So the market size has doubled and we are seeing some very exciting seed companies, which bides very well for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Personally, I do expect to see even more great startups coming out of the south like Cork and Limerick and the west in Galway, but I don&#8217;t foresee startup hubs significantly losing people due to the pandemic and remote work.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? </strong><br />
It&#8217;s obvious that there are now serious questions around the level of future of business travel, given how people have been forced to rethink and adapt how they do business. This industry shift alone will create both big winners and losers long term.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Not hugely, given the long-term timeframe we consider when investing. The bigger question around changing consumer behaviors, the acceleration of e-commerce adoption and digital transformation is something we are of course taking into account. Our advice is always bespoke and contextual to the individual startup, and only given when asked.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, our portfolio has proven itself to be quite robust through COVID and companies like SilverCloud Health, Toothpic and Buymie are experiencing great tailwinds due to the current pandemic environment.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Personally, seeing some incredibly talented founders with deep expertise at seed stage that are repeat founders. They know exactly what they want and need to do to go bigger this time around, and we believe they can get there much quicker than before.</p>

<h2>Isabelle O&#8217;Keeffe, principal, Sure Valley Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
AI/ML, cybersecurity, immersive technologies and gaming infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Getvisbility and Volograms.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Companies that are really creating defensibility using the technology. Companies creating new markets.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Ride-sharing, on-demand delivery, payments and challenger banks.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We invest more than 50% in our local ecosystem versus other startup hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
The industries that will continue to thrive include: financial services, property and construction, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing and Big Tech. We&#8217;re very excited about some of our portfolio companies including VividQ, Admix, Buymie, Nova Leah and WarDucks.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Dublin and Ireland have a growing and prosperous tech ecosystem and there are plenty of great investment opportunities there.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Yes I would agree that we will see some of this happening. However, I do think that once there is a vaccine that we will see the return of cities and people will naturally be attracted back there.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
We have seen limited impact of COVID on some of segments that we invest into. The opportunities exist for companies operating in the future or work including remote working, e-commerce, on-demand grocery delivery, cybersecurity, gaming and immersive technologies.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID has not really impacted our investment strategy bar the fact that we have had to get comfortable with a lot of the process being conducted via Zoom. We have not shifted away from certain sectors or industries as we have tended to invest into areas that are relatively unaffected. The biggest worries for founders in our portfolio are around raising their next round of funding, hitting key milestones, achieving a repeatable go-to-market strategy and hiring great talent.</p>
<p>My advice to startups in my portfolio now is to keep a very close eye on burn, ensure that if they are going out to fundraise that they realize it can take at least two months longer than they originally anticipated and to continue to be working on the product and technology at times when sales have slowed down as when they emerge from this period they will be in a much stronger position with their products and technology and the sales will follow.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes we have &#8220;green shoots&#8217; regarding momentum in Buymie, which is an &#8220;on-demand grocery delivery&#8221; company who have seen a surge in demand for the service due to the pandemic. Getvisibility, which is a cybersecurity company, has also seen a surge in interest from companies in the financial services, and pharmaceutical and defense industries as they adapt to their employees working from home and where there are greater risks of cyberattacks.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
I think the moment for everyone recently has been the announcement that we could be closer to a vaccine than we originally thought and that we may be able to resume normal life next year.</p>

<h2>Nicola McClafferty, partner, Draper Esprit</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Future of work/consumerization of enterprise, machine-learning applications.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Sweepr — automation of customer care for connected homes.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
True AI, digital health.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Global ambition.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
E-scooters.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
~20%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Software application, AI, machine learning, life sciences. key companies, WorkVivo, Manna Aero, Open, Sweepr, Roomex and Evervault.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Unfortunately seed stage is dramatically underserved by local players. Hiring can be challenging given competitiveness of labor market with large tech MNCs. However deep entrepreneurship culture, global thinking from day one, incredibly strong pool of technical talent from Irish universities. It&#8217;s also a key destination of other European founders. Brexit opens even more opportunity for this.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Startup economy will likely become a bit more distributed around the country but this will be a positive. Cities like Dublin, Cork and Galway will however remain strong hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Travel tech extremely challenged but the best companies will survive and huge winners will emerge in the COVID recovery when travel returns. Big opportunity to accelerate enterprise SaaS adoption and automation as budgets have shifted dramatically to digital infrastructure and cost-cutting and productivity becomes key focus.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Strategy remains largely intact with some further reserves used to support companies. For those businesses very directly impacted (e.g., travel) — concern is visibility and timing of recovery that is largely out of founder control. Other concerns include cash runway in times of uncertainty — how will the market view performance for future fundraise; in big enterprise how to adapt your sales model for a remote world.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Most definitely. As tech businesses most have been very adaptable and are responding to customer needs as they change. After a slow Q2 many businesses rebounded very well in Q3 and have returned to strong growth. Early churn has been flushed out already.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Announcement of the vaccine! Path to recovery is nearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Michelle Dervan, partner, Rethink Education Management, LLC</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
I am deeply specialized in education technology investing. Interested in seeing tailored Zoom alternatives for the classroom, tech-enabled vocational training programs, corporate learning solutions for the distributed workforce.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Crehana, an online skills training platform serving Latin America.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Upskilling and reskilling programs for displaced workers.<br />
Shorter, cheaper training programs and credentialing for middle-skills jobs.<br />
Software to help high school students prep for college and career.<br />
Effective remediation programs that can help students catch up on lost learning during COVID.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Outliers in terms of evidence of product market fit, proof of efficacy, impact baked into the business model, team with unique understanding of the problem and ability to execute against it.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
K-12 supplemental apps, games, content.<br />
Tech bootcamps.<br />
Corporate LMS.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
80% U.S.-focused, 20% outside of the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Ireland has traditionally had a very strong e-learning/edtech startup sector. Exciting growth companies include LearnIpon, Learnosity, Alison, Touch Press. Early-stage companies include Avail Support, Zhrum, Robotify.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Dublin is a really vibrant startup ecosystem. Young population. Lots of government supports to encourage entrepreneurship. Excellent experienced talent pool coming out of multinationals and existing startups. English speaking. Great connectivity to rest of Europe/U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I recently relocated to Dublin after 10 years in NYC. There has been a mass exodus from cities like NYC and SF during the pandemic as the economics of living there plus the space constraints, etc. no longer make sense in a prolonged period of WFH and while most amenities are closed. Dublin is also a high-cost location so will likely also see some exodus although I think to a lesser extent.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? </strong><strong>What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
The COVID environment has caused a mass acceleration in the adoption of education technology across all age groups from K-12, higher education to corporate and workforce learning. This was already a secular trend albeit at a much slower pace of adoption. I believe that the prolonged period of reliance on a tech-enabled learning experience and the potential need to revert to this in the future will have a lasting effect on how we teach and learn.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our investment strategy has not been impacted by COVID. We are seeing a greater degree of opportunity and interest in our sector. The biggest concerns for founders are unpredictability in the sales funnel, potential delays to purchasing decisions and resultant cashflow implications. Even for companies that have been net beneficiaries of the COVID environment, it has injected a very high degree of unpredictability and that is very stressful for founders.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, as mentioned above.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Biden&#8217;s election and the list of people that he is evaluating for Education Secretary and for his cabinet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Will Prendergast, partner, Frontline Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We take an opportunistic approach to investing at Frontline and are open to any number of different trends within the B2B space. Generally, we are excited to back founders working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complexity in the software/product development stack: As more and more businesses become software businesses and software products become more complex there will be a layer of tools that abstract away that complexity and provide connections between them. Software using other software will be an exciting space in the decade to come, facilitated by many API-first companies.</li>
<li>Embedded finance: We are excited by fintechs that are helping non-financial institutions leverage their customer base to provide financial products. Open banking is an enormous enabler of embedded finance.</li>
<li>Process augmentation rather than process automation: There are a number of key skill gaps emerging in many different sectors right now and software is emerging as the bridge for companies to handle the shortfall. These are products that help highly skilled workers maximize their productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the current environment, we are also highly interested in startups that are broadly targeting the key trends below brought on by COVID-19:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hospitals and clinics seek to increase efficiency and reach patients remotely.</li>
<li>Banks cautious as financial crime grows.</li>
<li>Remote employee management tools for HR and finance teams.</li>
<li>Debt collection automation due to SME liquidations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
We recently invested in a German business that aims to become the Moody’s of financial crime.<br />
Since 2008, large banks have become less willing to transact with regional retail banks. They were unfairly deemed &#8220;too risky&#8221; in their portfolio. This company aims to create a fundamental shift in the industry — from old school box ticking compliance to data-driven ways of determining the risk. We are very excited to increase fairness and transparency between banks, which will inevitably create more value to the end consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
B2B payments are undergoing a renaissance at the moment with companies like Bill.com dominating in the public markets. As fintech creeps into more aspects of the product stack, payments is just the first part to produce huge winners. Solving the nuts and bolts of business finance is still a hugely overlooked opportunity for both large and small companies.<br />
We’d also love to see more companies dedicated to reducing the CFO burden at SME and enterprise level. From real-time payroll to treasury and employee pension management, so much of a CFO’s work is manual and time consuming.<br />
We have supported companies that make a significant dent in the specific parts of the funnel (for example, Payslip — a global payroll automation platform), but we feel like there is more room for end-to-end automation in this realm.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We’re looking for challengers who seek out other strong minds; whether you’re a first-time founder building something that matters, or a seasoned entrepreneur that knows how hard it is to “make it.” In all of our investments, we prize self-awareness above all else in our founders; key to building great teams and scaling a global business. Ambition does not require experience. We’re looking to invest in pioneers across Europe from the world of tech, computer science and engineering, due to our own deep knowledge of technology. In return, we use our personal experience in building and scaling business across both sides of the Atlantic to help founders get off the ground — and go global.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Products that are being built specifically with the conditions created by COVID-19 today may find themselves in a wildly different environment in 18 months. We’re looking to speak to founders who see how things are now and have a strong opinion on how they’re going to affect things in the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We support founders with global ambition across both sides of the Atlantic. Frontline Seed is a pan-European early-stage fund investing all across Europe. Frontline X is a growth-stage fund, for fast and frictionless U.S.-Europe expansion.<br />
When we first started Frontline, the vast majority of our investments came out of Ireland. Since 2012 we have expanded our scope, and for the last few years have been very much pan-European and now invest across Ireland, the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Southern Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
U.S. tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Zendesk Hubspot (among many others) have a &#8220;pied-à-terre&#8221; in Ireland.<br />
In most cases, top-class engineering talent is sourced more cheaply there than in the U.S., creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. They upskill great engineers, who then go on to create great companies.<br />
We’ve seen startup developer tools thrive in Ireland as a result; an example of which is Tines.io. This Accel-and-Index-backed company was built by the world-renowned security team in Dublin.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Ireland is a hidden gem — we’ve had the privilege of reaping the rewards. However, I suspect that the likes of Tines.io, Intercom and Stripe are stirring investor curiosity.<br />
We’re already seeing top-tier U.S. VCs like Sequoia placing bets in Irish companies at a pre-seed stage, for example Evervault, one of our portfolio companies.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
As a global fund, part of our core belief is that great companies and exceptional founders can come from anywhere in the world. COVID-19 has had a significant and eroding effect on traditional “tech hub” models and we have seen founders of all walks of life realize that companies can not only run, but thrive in a remote world.<br />
That said, we also believe that geography will continue to matter. Where you set up your HQ in Europe as a growth-stage B2B SaaS business expanding from the U.S. (for example) will continue to matter in a post-COVID world — because legal entities will continue to matter.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The closure of retail stores = tremendous growth in e-commerce. Companies big and small are vamping up their back and front ends, and attempting to get more visibility on their supply chain for better customer service.</li>
<li>Payments transition online = more financial crime. Banks need tools that help them detect fraud.</li>
<li>Consumers are tight on cash = HR departments want to provide more salary liquidity and help employees save for their pensions to create better financial wellness.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID-19 has not changed our investment strategy but it will have lasting impact on the way businesses are run and built. That said, the pandemic has given us a new filter: &#8220;How successful can this product/business model be in a post-COVID world?&#8221;<br />
At the moment, our founders are most worried by engagement (maintaining company culture) and talent (team expansion, senior leadership recruitment).<br />
Every company is different and we shy away from blanket statements, but what we do advise is that founders spend time to identify what working format works best for their company and that they listen carefully to their employees. How can you continue to grow your business, whilst maintaining and nurturing an inclusive and engaged company culture?<br />
Also — while you can, shore up your balance sheet. Believe it or not, VC funding was at an all-time high in Europe last quarter. Go fundraise to extend your runway as much as possible. No one really knows what the next 12 months is really going to hold.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Three companies in our portfolio stand out as pandemic green shoots:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workvivo is designed to promote team culture and communication digitally. They have successfully raised a Series A midpandemic with U.S. investor Tiger Global to cope with demand from large customers.</li>
<li>Qualio is another portfolio company selling quality management software into life sciences and pharmaceutical companies. They blew out their Q2 targets and raised an $11 million Series A.</li>
<li>Signal AI: Media monitoring is an attractive proposition to PR and comms teams in turbulent times. Signal AI has recently partnered with Deloitte to produce COVID-19 curated reports on how the pandemic has and is continuing to affect supply chains, business, society and travel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Seeing how well the many teams in our portfolio focused on employee health, well-being and safety and how hard they have all worked to keep their companies going strong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.science-inc.com/">Science Inc</a>, the 10-year-old, L.A.-based incubator and venture firm, rolled out a blank-check company onto the Nasdaq, raising $310.5 million for what firm founders Peter Pham and Mike Jones say will be used to take public a company in the mobile, entertainment or direct-to-consumer service space.</p>
<p>If they have one of their own portfolio companies in mind to take public, they wouldn&#8217;t say in conversation yesterday. Yet Science would have some interesting candidates from which to choose if so. It helped incubate the <a href="https://dot.la/playvs-raises-10-5m-making-esports-varsity-sports-2649035403.html">amateur esports platform</a> PlayVS after Pham met its founder, Delane Parnell, on a dance floor at a South by Southwest festival. It&#8217;s also an investor in Bird, the micro-mobility company that is reportedly working with Credit Suisse to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-16/scooter-startup-bird-is-said-to-discuss-going-public-via-spac">strike a deal</a> with a blank-check company. And it helped create and grow Liquid Death, a company with a tongue-in-cheek marketing strategy that&#8217;s selling mountain water in aluminum cans &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/the-joke-is-on-consumers-as-liquid-death-raises-23-million-more/">a lot of it</a>, says Pham.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not so silly. Water is the top-selling packaged drink in the U.S. and has been since 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, we spent much of our time with the duo talking about how to create a powerful consumer brand in 2021, no matter the category. You can <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/7569451">listen</a> to that full conversation, or check out excerpts of much of our chat below, edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have this new blank-check company. You&#8217;re about to start talking with potential targets. Will you consider a company that you&#8217;ve incubated or else funded at Science?</strong></p>
<p>MJ: No. So the SPAC is an independent entity. We think that there&#8217;s a universe of well over 100 companies that would fit the credentials of what we&#8217;re looking for within the stack. Some of those companies, we may or may not have investment exposure [to them], but the process of analysis is independent of the Science portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So you wouldn&#8217;t rule it out.</strong></p>
<p>MJ: We have independent directors. So there&#8217;s a different process that would go through if we were looking at a company in the portfolio. But right now we&#8217;re just aggregating the right universe of potential targets. And then we&#8217;ll go through a formal process on it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are the metrics you want to see? You are specialists, including in direct-to-consumer companies. Do the companies that you&#8217;re targeting have to be profitable?</strong></p>
<p>MJ: When we look at the different, potential companies that we&#8217;re interested in, we&#8217;re not saying that they have to have some specific level of profitability or specific level of revenue . . . We don&#8217;t expose the the core metrics and revenue drivers that we think make for successful companies within sectors. But we&#8217;re a super data-focused team. We&#8217;re very much on the forefront of next-generation Gen Z and millennial-oriented marketing. And there are very specific things we look for that we think may build breakout brands.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Both of you know the social media space. There are new social media plays that are gaining a lot of attention, such as Clubhouse. Back to your core business at Science, are there any investments in those areas in that area that you&#8217;re looking at?</strong></p>
<p>PP: A decade ago is when YouTube became a platform for marketing. Then six of seven years ago, Instagram [became a platform for marketing]. And then Snapchat came along, and then all of a sudden Instagram stories [emerged], and then TikTok and now another platform, which is Clubhouse. There&#8217;s always something new coming around the corner.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t take your eye off of Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, but Clubhouse is real. It&#8217;s almost radio, but it&#8217;s participatory. If you go to South by Southwest, it&#8217;s almost like SWSX panels around the clock. There&#8217;s this really interesting dynamic where you could be in crowd, raise your hand, and if they pull you up on stage, now you&#8217;re part of the panel. That&#8217;s why a lot of people are there &#8212; for the chance of getting discovered [and] the chance of letting their voice be heard by a larger audience.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What makes you think its growth is sustainable?</strong></p>
<p>PP: The moment marketers join a platform [you know]. When real marketers, people who are selling classes on how to make money, how to have real estate, how to make money [selling] real estate, that type of marketing &#8212; when [they show up], it&#8217;s an arbitrage. It&#8217;s basically very smart people who make a lot of money realizing for that every minute they spend doing this, it&#8217;s more valuable in terms of ROI, customer acquisition cost, and revenue, than spending time on this other thing that everyone else is on.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do your portfolio companies use these platforms in 2021? You are investors in Liquid Death. You helped incubate MeUndies, a subscription underwear company that raised saw <a href="https://labusinessjournal.com/news/2020/nov/30/meundies-secures-40-million-investment-provenance/">$40 million</a> late last year. You were involved in the early days of Dollar Shave Club. How do you break through the noise with things like water, underwear and razors?</strong></p>
<p>PP: Platforms are always just a springboard. You can&#8217;t rely on these places long term because the rules of the game change, the feed changes. Ten years ago, when we launched Dollar Shave Club, we had on the homepage an autoplay of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI">YouTube video</a> that was just about driving customers to buy something. At the time, no one thought about posting YouTube videos to get somebody to buy something. MeUndies [used] Instagram. Who would imagine subscription underwear? But every month, there&#8217;s a holiday &#8212; Christmas, New Year&#8217;s, Valentine&#8217;s Day, St. Patrick&#8217;s Day. What if there was something interesting and fun that you could wear?</p>
<p>With Liquid Death, it&#8217;s still very much [focused on] Instagram and now probably TikTok. But in all cases, the brand has to be worthy for somebody to talk about what&#8217;s interesting about it and even to defend it.</p>
<p>Mike underplays our data side, but we measure incessantly everything that&#8217;s happening in terms of the each one of our businesses, including their social reach, their engagements, business retention, how often customers are coming back, how much revenue we&#8217;re generating from each individual, what each piece of marketing is worth. All of these tie into this complex engine that [helps us determine], is there a business behind this thing? Can it grow on its own without a reliance on Facebook? With most companies, if you don&#8217;t understand how to build your own community, your own brand, and your own audience, ultimately the winner on the back end is Google or Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you build that community right now?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve handed out 4,000 cans personally. In the early days of Liquid Death, I just remember handing it to a bunch of teenagers, and six out of 10 would take a photo and Snap it to their friend. It was just this instant moment I kept seeing over and over, and I just knew, this is gonna work. If you noticed in March and April and May how boring your Instagram feed was, [it was] because everyone was staying home and there was nothing to do. But we [had this insight to] give somebody a piece of content.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Liquid Death is now available in some stores, including 7-Elevens. Are people buying the water online? What percentage of them buy it through a subscription?</strong></p>
<p>PP: One third of our customers who buy online [at the site] buy merchandise. They&#8217;re buying $24 hats, $45 hoodies &#8212; we&#8217;re selling out merch constantly. It&#8217;s the brand, it&#8217;s a lifestyle. Mike Cessario, the CEO, says he&#8217;s building something that&#8217;s like your favorite band. The product lets you be a fan of the thing [including] because it&#8217;s not a piece of plastic that&#8217;s going to go the ocean [like other water bottles]. It&#8217;s not sugar. It&#8217;s not alcohol that might result in a drunk driving incident.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s flair. It&#8217;s a reason to say hi to somebody. It&#8217;s an icebreaker. It&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s irreverent. It&#8217;s dumb. It&#8217;s funny. It&#8217;s everything to everybody, but something worthy to talk about, something to look at.</p>
<p>The trajectory we&#8217;re on is hard to measure, You have to see it, and when you see it over and over, it&#8217;s obvious.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robinhood has <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/">detailed</a> its latest step in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-gamestop-this-is-2021/">complex quagmire of market manipulation</a> that is this week&#8217;s GameStop hedge fund Reddit army debacle. Users will for the present be limited to holding a single share of GameStop and dozens of other stocks.</p>
<p>Several stocks were limited to five shares, and options contracts are likewise limited on many of the most-traded stocks this week, such as AMC and Blackberry. Positions exceeding these amounts will not be automatically sold, but they will apply if the user goes under them and tries to buy again. Fractional shares are also prohibited.</p>
<p>Any other specifics about positions, expiring options contracts and so on can be found in the announcement and related FAQs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Robinhood has said that it has halted and now limited trading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">because of &#8220;financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits&#8221;</a> — essentially, the volume and value of the trading going on was beyond its ability to legally or realistically cover. Trading of certain stocks was halted or restricted earlier this week, but the new post details exactly which stocks are affected and how.</p>

<p>The company had to hastily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-raises-1b-after-trading-halts-to-keep-its-platform-running/">raise funds totaling over a billion dollars</a> from its existing investors after reportedly maxing out half a billion in credit lines.</p>
<p>With widespread outrage at the handling of the situation and the U.S. government taking notice, it&#8217;s unlikely Robinhood&#8217;s troubles (not to mention other trading apps and platforms) are anywhere near over. With new developments appearing seemingly every few hours, it&#8217;s hard to know how this particular story will develop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Edtech is so widespread, we already need more consumer-friendly nomenclature to describe the products, services and tools it encompasses.</p>
<p>I know someone who reads stories to their grandchildren on two continents via Zoom each weekend. Is that &#8220;edtech?&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly, many Netflix subscribers sought out online chess instructors after watching &#8220;The Queen&#8217;s Gambit,&#8221; but I doubt if they all ran searches for &#8220;remote learning&#8221; first.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Edtech needs to reach beyond underfunded public school systems to become more sustainable, which is why more investors and founders are focusing on lifelong learning.</p>
<p>Besides serving traditional students with field trips and art classes, a maturing sector is now branching out to offer software tutors, cooking classes and singing lessons.</p>
<p>For our latest investor survey, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/">Natasha Mascarenhas polled 13 edtech VCs</a> to learn more about how &#8220;employer-led up-skilling and a renewed interest in self-improvement&#8221; is expanding the sector&#8217;s TAM.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s who she spoke to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deborah Quazzo</strong>, managing partner, GSV Ventures</li>
<li><strong>Ashley Bittner</strong>, founding partner, Firework Ventures (a future of work fund with portfolio companies LearnIn and TransfrVR)</li>
<li><strong>Jomayra Herrera</strong>, principal, Cowboy Ventures (a generalist fund with portfolio companies Hone and Guild Education)</li>
<li><strong>John Danner</strong>, managing partner, Dunce Capital (an edtech and future of work fund with portfolio companies Lambda School and Outschool)</li>
<li><strong>Mercedes Bent and Bradley Twohig</strong>, partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners (a multistage generalist fund with investments including Forage, Clever and Outschool)</li>
<li><strong>Ian Chiu</strong>, managing director, Owl Ventures (a large edtech-focused fund backing highly valued companies including Byju’s, Newsela and Masterclass)</li>
<li><strong>Jan Lynn-Matern</strong>, founder and partner, Emerge Education (a leading edtech seed fund in Europe with portfolio companies like Aula, Unibuddy and BibliU)</li>
<li><strong>Benoit Wirz</strong>, partner, Brighteye Ventures (an active edtech-focused venture capital fund in Europe that backs YouSchool, Lightneer and Aula)</li>
<li><strong>Charles Birnbaum</strong>, partner, Bessemer Venture Partners (a generalist fund with portfolio companies including Guild Education and Brightwheel)</li>
<li><strong>Daniel Pianko</strong>, co-founder and managing director, University Ventures (a higher ed and future of work fund that is backing Imbellus and Admithub)</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca Kaden</strong>, managing partner, Union Square Ventures (a generalist fund with portfolio companies including TopHat, Quizlet, Duolingo)</li>
<li><strong>Andreata Muforo</strong>, partner, TLCom Capital (a generalist fund backing uLesson)</li>

<p>After falling into yesterday&#8217;s wild news cycle, Alex Wilhelm returned to The Exchange this morning with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/">a close look at venture capital activity across Africa</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comparing aggregate 2020 figures to 2019 results, it appears that last year was a somewhat robust year for African startups, albeit one with fewer large rounds,&#8221; he found.</p>
<p>For more context, he interviewed Dario Giuliani, the director of research firm Briter Bridges, which focuses on emerging markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America.</p>

<p>New cybersecurity ecosystems are popping up in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>Some of of that growth has been fueled by an exodus from the Bay Area, but many early-stage security startups already have deep roots in East Coast cities like Boston and New York.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom and Europe, government innovation programs have helped entrepreneurs close higher numbers of Series A and B rounds.</p>
<p>Investor interest and expertise is migrating out of Silicon Valley: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/chasing-the-cybersecurity-investment-opportunity/">This post</a> will help you understand where it&#8217;s going.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s smartphones are unfathomably feature-rich and durable, so it&#8217;s logical that sales have slowed.</p>
<p>A phone purchased 18 months ago is probably &#8220;good enough&#8221; for many consumers, especially in times of economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Then again, of the record $111.4 billion in revenue Apple earned last quarter, $65.68 billion came from phone sales, largely driven by the release of the iPhone 12.</p>
<p>Even though &#8220;Apple’s success this quarter was kind of a perfect storm,&#8221;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/chasing-the-cybersecurity-investment-opportunity/"> writes Hardware Editor Brian Heater</a>, &#8220;it’s safe to project a rebound for the industry at large in 2021.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finmark co-founder and CEO Rami Essaid <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/the-5-biggest-mistakes-i-made-as-a-first-time-startup-founder/">wrote a post for Extra Crunch</a> that candidly describes the traps he laid for himself that made him a less-effective entrepreneur.</p>
<p>As someone who&#8217;s worked closely with founders at several startups, each of the points he raised resonated deeply with me.</p>
<p>In my experience, many founders have a hard time delegating, which can quickly create cultural and operational problems. Rami&#8217;s experience bears this out:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I became a human GPS: People could follow my directions, but they struggled to find the way themselves. Independent thinking suffered.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Since the pandemic disrupted the social rhythms of work and school, many of us have compensated by changing our relationship to digital media.</p>
<p>For instance, I purchased a new sofa and thicker living room curtains several months ago when I realized we have no idea when movie theaters will reopen.</p>
<p>Last year, podcast sponsors spent almost $800 million to reach listeners, but ad revenue is estimated to surpass $1 billion this year. Clearly, I&#8217;m not the only person who used a discount code to buy a new product in 2020.</p>
<p>At this point, I can scarcely keep track of the multiple streaming platforms I&#8217;m subscribed to, but a new voice-activated remote control that comes with my basic cable plan makes it easier to browse my options.</p>
<p>Media reporter Anthony Ha <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/9-vcs-say-interactivity-regulation-and-independent-creators-will-reshape-digital-media-in-2021/">spoke to10 VCs who invest in media startups</a> to learn more about where they see digital media heading in the months ahead. For starters, how much longer can we expect traditional advertising models to persist?</p>
<p>And in a world with hundreds of channels, how are creators supposed to compete for our attention? What sort of discovery tools can we expect to help us navigate between a police procedural set in a Scandinavian village and a 90s sitcom reboot?</p>
<p>Here’s who Anthony interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daniel Gulati</strong>, founding partner, Forecast Fund</li>
<li><strong>Alex Gurevich</strong>, managing director, Javelin Venture Partners</li>
<li><strong>Matthew Hartman</strong>, partner, Betaworks Ventures</li>
<li><strong>Jerry Lu</strong>, senior associate, Maveron</li>
<li><strong>Jana Messerschmidt</strong>, partner, Lightspeed Venture Partners</li>
<li><strong>Michael Palank</strong>, general partner, MaC Venture Capital (with additional commentary from MaC’s Marlon Nichols)</li>
<li><strong>Pär-Jörgen Pärson</strong>, general partner, Northzone</li>
<li><strong>M.G. Siegler</strong>, general partner, GV</li>
<li><strong>Laurel Touby</strong>, managing director, Supernode Ventures</li>
<li><strong>Hans Tung</strong>, managing partner, GGV Capital</li>
</ul>

<p>Data analytics platform Databricks is reportedly raising new capital that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/does-a-27-or-29-billion-valuation-make-sense-for-databricks/">could value the company between $27 billion and $29 billion</a>.</p>
<p>By the end of Q3 2020, Databricks had surpassed a $350 million run rate — a $150 million YoY increase, reports Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>At the time, he described the company as &#8220;an obvious IPO candidate&#8221; with &#8220;broad private-market options.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which begs the question: &#8220;Can we come up with a set of numbers that help make sense of Databricks at $27 billion?&#8221;</p>

<p>On January 25, Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya tweeted that he was making two blank-check deals.</p>
<p>Enterprise SaaS company Latch makes keyless entry systems; Sunlight Financial helps consumers finance residential solar power installations.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are nearly 300 SPACs in the market today looking for deals,&#8221; noted Alex Wilhelm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/unpacking-chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-deals-for-latch-and-sunlight-financial/">who unpacked both transactions</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s no escaping SPACs for a bit, so if you are tired of watching blind pools rip private companies into the public markets, you are not going to have a very good next few months.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Roblox eyes what could be a historic debut on public markets in the coming months, investors who have </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">valued the company at $29.5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are certainly eyeing the gaming company&#8217;s dedicated and youthful user base &#8212; but it&#8217;s the 7 million active creators and developers on the Roblox platform that they are likely most impressed by. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2015, Roblox has been running an accelerator program focused on enabling the next generation of game developers to be successful on its platform. Over the years, the program has expanded from one annual class to now three, each with around 40 developers participating. That means more than 100 developers per year are working directly with Roblox to gain mentorship, education and funding opportunities to get their games off the ground.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the company’s efforts on this front have grown more formalized, Roblox in 2018 hired former Accelerator alumni Christian Hunter, a Roblox gamer since age 10 and game developer since 13, to run the program full time. Having been through the experience himself, Hunter brought to the program an understanding of how the Accelerator could improve, based on a developer’s own perspective. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the COVID-19 pandemic threw into disarray the company’s plans to run the program. Instead of being able to invite developers to spend three months participating in classes hosted at Roblox’s San Mateo office, the company had to revamp the program for remote participation. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Roblox raises at $29.5 billion valuation, readies for direct listing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/embed/#?secret=bkjbsXR6M8" data-secret="bkjbsXR6M8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turned out, developers who were used to playing and building games taking place in virtual worlds quickly adjusted to the new online experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before COVID, everyone was together. It was easier to talk to people. [Developers] could just walk up to someone that was on our product or engineering team if they were running into issues,” explains Roblox Senior Product Manager Rebecca Crose. “But obviously, with COVID-19, we had to switch and think differently.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remote program, though differently structured, offered several benefits. Developers could join the program’s Discord server to talk to both current participants and previous classes, and reach out and ask questions. They could also participate in the Roblox company Slack to ask the team questions, and there were more playtests being scheduled to gain reactions and feedback from Roblox employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, to get to know one another when they couldn’t meet in person, developers would have game nights where they’d play each other’s games or others that were popular on Roblox, and bond within the virtual environment instead of in face-to-face meetings and classes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual Accelerator content, however, remained fairly consistent during the remote experience. Participants had weekly standups, talks on topics like game design and production, and weekly feedback sessions where they asked Roblox engineers questions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But by its nature, a remote Accelerator broadened who could attend. Instead of limiting the program to only those who could travel to San Mateo and stay for three months, the program was opened up to a more global and diverse audience. This drove increased demand, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 program saw Roblox receiving the largest number of applications ever &#8212; five times the usual number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the class included participants from five countries: The Philippines, South Korea, Sweden, Canada and the U.S. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developers at IndieBox Studios saw the program as a chance to double down on their game development side hustles. The young friends spread across the U.K. and Kentucky spent their time during the accelerator scaling up their photorealistic title called </span><a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4011063766/Tank-Warfare"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tank Warfare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve actually never once met in real life, like, we&#8217;ve been friends for going on, what, nine years now,&#8221; Michael Southern tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We met on Roblox.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IndieBox is representative of many of Roblox&#8217;s early developer teams &#8212; younger gamers that have spent more than a decade learning the ins and outs of the evolving Roblox gaming platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We all joined Roblox way back in 2008,&#8221; IndieBox&#8217;s Frank Garrison says. &#8220;But we only started developing on the platform in 2019. And for us, the decision to choose Roblox was more down to like, well it&#8217;s what we know, why not give it a bash?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demographics of the accelerator have been shifting in other ways as the developer base grows more diverse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would say, in the beginning, it was mostly young males. But as we’ve watched the program evolve, we’ve been getting so many new interesting teams,” notes Program Manager Christian Hunter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 program had more women participants than ever, for example, with 12 in a class of 50. And one team was all women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The age of participants, who are typically in the 18 to 22-year-old range, also evolved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen a lot more older folks,” Hunter says. “With [the COVID-19 pandemic], we actually saw our first 50-year-old in the program. We’ve never had anyone older than, I’d say, 24. And in 2020, we had 12 individuals over the age of 30,” he notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the teams were also a combination of a kid and a parent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shannon Clemens learned about the Roblox platform from her son Nathan, learning to code and bringing her husband Jeff in to form a studio called Simple Games. Nathan&#8217;s two sisters help the studio part time, as well as his friend Adrian Holgate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Seeing [my son&#8217;s] experience on Roblox getting involved with the platform, I thought it would be neat to learn how to make our own games,&#8221; Shannon Clemens told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their title </span><a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5665787539/Perks-Gods-Of-Glory"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gods of Glory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has received more than 13.5 million visits from Roblox players since launching in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our whole family is kind of creatively bent towards having fun with games and coming up with things like that,&#8221; Jeff Clemens tells us. &#8220;Why would we not try this? So, that&#8217;s when we applied to the program and said, &#8216;well, we&#8217;ll try and see if we get accepted,&#8217; and we did and it&#8217;s been awesome.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the changes facilitated by a remote environment, Roblox notes there were other perks enabled by remote learning. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one thing, the developers didn’t have to wake up so early to benefit from the experience.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With it being remote, the developers were working </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">their</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hours,” says Crose. “As a developer, we tend to work later and stay up at night. Having them come in at 9 AM sharp was very difficult. It was hard for them because they’re just like&#8230;a zombie. So we definitely saw that by letting them work their own hours, [there is] less burnout and they increase their productivity,” she says. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the COVID-19 crisis may eventually end as the world gets vaccinated, the learnings from the Accelerator and the remote advantages it offers will continue. Developers from the program hope that the growth seen on gaming platforms like Roblox continues as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The pandemic has been great for most game studios,&#8221; developer Gustav Linde tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Obviously, it&#8217;s a very weird time, but the timing was good for us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gang Stockholm, a Swedish game development studio co-founded by Linde, has been building experiences &#8212; largely branded ones for clients, exclusively on the Roblox platform. The team of 12 has used the accelerator to slow down development deadlines and dig into some unique areas of the platform as well as focus wholly on their upcoming title, Bloxymon, which they plan to release this year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you look at Steam and the App Store and Google Play, those markets are extremely crowded, and Roblox is a very exciting platform for developers right now,” said Linde. &#8220;Roblox is also getting a lot of attention and a lot of big brands are interested in entering the platform.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roblox says that going forward, future Accelerator programs will feature a remote element inspired by the COVID experience. The company plans to continue to make its program globally available, with the limitation for now, of English-speaking participants. But it’s looking to expand to reach non-English speakers with future programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fall 2020 Accelerator class graduated in December 2020, and the next spring class will start in February 2021. Roblox says they are already in the process of recruiting for their summer 2021 class, which will again have some 40 participants. Roblox will again aim to continue diversifying the group of creators.</span></p>
