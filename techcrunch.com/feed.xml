										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">My mom cuts to the chase when she is describing my beat to others. In her words, I cover companies like Uber before they become companies like Uber. And honestly? I can’t exactly disagree with the description. The best feeling in tech journalism is telling a story about a startup before it becomes a household name. As an early-stage reporter, I honestly bet a lot on the potential of a savvy edtech founder or creative marketplace play. And when I’m doing my job right, I point to the unique insight that will make the startup successful or challenged in the future.</p>
<p>On that note, one of my favorite renewed series at TechCrunch is an EC-1 (Extra Crunch subscription required), a story series that goes through the nitty-gritty of a startup’s story, from its original days to its pivots along the way. I’ve spent the past few months on one of these projects &#8212; and mine is coming out next week! In the meantime, you’ve read packages about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/">StockX</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/">Tonal</a>, and our latest just came out: the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/">Klaviyo EC-1</a>:</p>

<p>Enjoy this long-form read and big thanks to<a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton"> Danny Crichton</a>, my Equity co-host and managing editor here at TechCrunch, who has been managing and editing all of these projects.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter we’ll get into All Raise data, the new Miami and a new lineup you don’t want to miss. Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> for updates throughout the week.</p>
<h2><strong>All (aren’t) Raise(d)</strong></h2>
<p>All Raise, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing the footprint of women founders and funders, has released its annual report for 2020. <a href="https://allraise.org/assets/all-raise-annual-report-2020.pdf">The whole thing</a> is honestly worth a read, but we especially paid attention to how funding has dropped for female founders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round sizes for women + non-binary founders were up to 49% lower than males</li>
<li>85% of venture funding goes to all-male teams</li>
<li>64% of VC firms still don&#8217;t have a single female partner</li>
<li>Black + Latinx female founders receive only 0.64% of VC funding, a slight uptick from the year prior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> On Equity, we talked about how these abysmal metrics were both a predicted but still surprising effect of Zoom investing. This disconnect is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/precursor-ventures-charles-hudson-on-the-conversation-no-one-has-during-an-upmarket/">the conversation no one has during an upmarket</a> &#8212; and metrics are one way we can benchmark progress.</p>

<h2><strong>Internet is the new Miami </strong></h2>
<p>To quote Winnie CEO and co-founder Sara Mauskopf, “Internet is the new Miami.” The networks made online &#8212; either through the rise of meme culture or Substack spice &#8212; can be a competitive advantage in the world of investment, as two new funds this week showed us.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know: Ryan Hoover and Vedika Jain announced Weekend Fund 3, which will include a <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1387034859495956480">$1 million community raise. </a>And Chief Meme Officer Turner Novak finally debuted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/banana-capitals-fund-1-turner-novak/">Banana Capital’s debut fund launched with $9.99 million in funding. </a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ITwUuiaaBX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/banana-capitals-fund-1-turner-novak/">Banana Capital&#8217;s debut fund is for internet-first founders</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Banana Capital&#8217;s debut fund is for internet-first founders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/banana-capitals-fund-1-turner-novak/embed/#?secret=ITwUuiaaBX" data-secret="ITwUuiaaBX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Novak explained how being internet-first impacts his investments:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“It just kind of happens where [my investments] are people who understand the culture of the internet, to understand memes and understand wit and humor and appreciate that a little bit more,” he said. “Those are probably the people that are more naturally intuitive investments, so it definitely does skew that direction.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>While Novak didn’t share explicit targets or mandates around investment in diverse founders, he pointed to his track record at Gelt VC, in which 41% of capital went to woman CEOs. To date, 65% of Banana Capital’s portfolio founding teams include non-white founders and 50% of the teams include more than one gender.</p>
<ul>
<li>And in the little-known capital lender space, Shopify is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/how-shopify-aims-to-level-the-playing-field-with-its-machine-learning-driven-model-of-lending/ ">using machine learning to lend money</a> to startups. Shopify Capital has a nice strategic ring to it, no?</li>

<h2>And finally</h2>
<p>India is in crisis. It is devastating and heartbreaking to watch this unfold and impact our family and friends and colleagues and people. My colleague Manish Singh, who is based there, wrote up the different ways<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/"> you can donate to help out.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9AImmd2iXQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/">India&#8217;s entrepreneurs and investors are mobilizing to help the nation fight COVID-19 — and you can too</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;India&#8217;s entrepreneurs and investors are mobilizing to help the nation fight COVID-19 — and you can too&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/embed/#?secret=9AImmd2iXQ" data-secret="9AImmd2iXQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I’ll end by quoting Singh:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>With several major industries, including film and sports, going about their lives pretending there is no crisis, entrepreneurs and startups have emerged as a rare beam of hope in recent days, springing to action to help the nation navigate its darkest hours.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s a refreshing change from last year, when thousands of Indian startups themselves were struggling to survive. And while some startups are still severely disrupted, offering a helping hand to the nation has become the priority for most.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Until next week,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sat down with Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska for the first high-level bilateral summit of the new administration, it was not a typical diplomatic meeting. Instead of a polite but restrained diplomatic exchange, the two sides traded pointed barbs for almost two hours. “There is growing consensus that the era of engagement with China has come to an unceremonious close,” <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/competition-with-china-without-catastrophe">wrote</a> Sullivan and Kurt Campbell, the Administration&#8217;s Asia czar also in attendance, back in 2019. How apt that they were present for that moment’s arrival.</p>
<p>A little more than one hundred days into the Biden Administration, there is no shortage of views on how it should handle this new era of Sino-American relations. From a blue-ribbon panel assembled by former Google Chairman Eric Schmidt to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/01/28/china-foreign-policy-long-telegram-anonymous-463120">Politico essay from an anonymous former Trump Administration official</a> that consciously echoes (in both its name and its author’s anonymity) George Kennan’s famous “<a href="https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/116178.pdf">Long Telegram</a>” laying out the theory of Cold War containment, to countless think tank reports, it seems everyone is having their say.</p>
<p>What is largely uncontroversial though is that technology is at the center of U.S.-China relations, and any competition with China will be won or lost in the digital and cyber spheres. “Part of the goal of the Alaska meeting was to convince the Chinese that the Biden administration is determined to compete with Beijing across the board to offer competitive technology,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/20/us/politics/china-russia-biden.html">wrote</a> David Sanger in the <i>New York Times </i>shortly afterward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But what, exactly, does a tech-centered China strategy look like? And what would it take for one to succeed?</p>
<h2>Tech has brought Republicans and Democrats uneasily together</h2>
<p>One encouraging sign is that China has emerged as one of the few issues on which even Democrats agree that President Trump had some valid points. “Trump really was the spark that reframed the entire debate around U.S.-China relations in DC,” says Jordan Schneider, a China analyst at the <a href="https://rhg.com/">Rhodium Group</a> and the host of the <a href="https://chinatalk.substack.com/">ChinaTalk podcast and newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>While many in the foreign policy community favored some degree of cooperation with China before the Trump presidency, now competition – if not outright rivalry – is widely assumed. “Democrats, even those who served in the Obama Administration, have become much more hawkish,” says Erik Brattberg of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Trump has caused “the Overton Window on China [to become] a lot narrower than it was before,” adds Schneider.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146531" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146531" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146531" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146531" class="wp-caption-text">The US delegation led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken face their Chinese counterparts at the opening session of US-China talks at the Captain Cook Hotel in Anchorage, Alaska on March 18, 2021.

<p>As the U.S.-China rivalry has evolved, it has become more and more centered around competing philosophies on the use of technology. “At their core, democracies are open systems that believe in the free flow of information, whereas for autocrats, information is something to be weaponized and stifled in the service of the regime,” says Lindsay Gorman, Fellow for Emerging Technologies at the German Marshall Fund. “So it’s not too surprising that technology, so much of which is about how we store and process and leverage information, has become such a focus of the U.S.-China relationship and of the [broader] democratic-autocratic competition around the world.”</p>
<p>Tech touches everything now – and the stakes could not be higher. “Tech and the business models around tech are really ‘embedded ideology,’&#8217; says Tyson Barker of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “So what tech is and how it is used is a form of governance.”</p>
<p>What does that mean in practice? When Chinese firms expand around the world, Barker tells me, they bring their norms with them. So when Huawei builds a 5G network in Latin America, or Alipay is adopted for digital payments in Central Europe, or Xiaomi takes more market share in Southeast Asia, they are helping digitize those economies on Chinese terms using Chinese norms (as opposed to American ones). The implication is clear: whoever defines the future of technology will determine the rest of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>That shifting balance has focused minds in Washington. “I think there is a strong bipartisan consensus that technology is at the core of U.S.-China competition,” says Brattberg. But, adds Gorman, “there’s less agreement on what the prescription should be.” While the Democratic experts now ascendant in Washington agree with Trump’s diagnosis of the China challenge, they believe in a vastly different approach from their Trump Administration predecessors.</p>
<p>Out, for instance, are restrictions on Chinese firms just for being Chinese. “That was one of the problems with Trump,” says Walter Kerr, a former U.S. diplomat who publishes the <i>China Journal Review</i>. “Trump cast broad strokes, targeting firms whether it was merited or not. Sticking it to the Chinese is not a good policy.”</p>
<p>Instead the focus is on inward investment – and outward cooperation.</p>
<h2>Foreign policy is domestic policy</h2>
<p>Democrats are first shoring up America domestically – in short, be strong at home to be strong abroad. “There’s no longer a bright line between foreign and domestic policy,” President Biden said in his first major foreign policy speech. “Every action we take in our conduct abroad, we must take with American working families in mind. Advancing a foreign policy for the middle class demands urgent focus on our domestic economic renewal.”</p>
<p>This is a particular passion of Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security advisor, who immersed himself in domestic policy while he was Hillary Clinton’s chief policy aide during her 2016 presidential campaign. &#8220;We&#8217;ve reached a point where foreign policy is domestic policy, and domestic policy is foreign policy,” he <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/biden-transition-updates/2020/12/30/951280373/why-bidens-national-security-adviser-plans-to-focus-on-the-u-s-middle-class">told</a> NPR during the transition.</p>

<p>This is increasingly important for technology, as concern grows that America is lagging behind on research and development. “We’re realizing that we’ve underinvested in the government grants and research and development projects that American companies [need] to become highly innovative in fields like quantum computing, AI, biotechnology, etc,” says Kerr.</p>
<p>“Rebuilding” or “sustaining” America’s “technological leadership” is a major theme of the Longer Telegram and is the very operating premise of the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20463382-final-memo-china-strategy-group-axios-1">report</a> of the China Strategy Group assembled by Eric Schmidt, former executive chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and the first chair of the Department of Defense’s Innovation Advisory Board. Those priorities have only become more important during the pandemic. It’s a question of “how do we orient the research system to fill in the industrial gaps that have been made very clear by the COVID crisis?” says Schneider of Rhodium.</p>
<p>While it hasn’t gone so far as to adopt a national industrial strategy, the Administration’s most ambitious officials are looking to prod along tech research in critical sectors. To that end, the National Security Council, which Sullivan runs, is reshaping itself around technology issues; Biden appointed the first deputy national security advisor focusing on technology issues as well as a high-profile senior director for technology. Their goal: to harness the same energy that drove the development of Silicon Valley during the Cold War into out-competing China.</p>
<p>That said, the ingredients to American (and Western) innovation aren’t exactly a secret: investment in education, research, and talent. “The West still has [most of] the universities, R&amp;D and leading companies,” says Brattberg. “There’s still a lot of competitiveness and leverage.” Unsurprisingly, investing to retain that edge is a key theme of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/31/upshot/whats-in-bidens-infrastructure-plan.html">Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan</a>, which includes funds for basic research, supply chain support, broadband connectivity, and support for the semiconductor industry.</p>

<p>As almost anyone in Silicon Valley will tell you, a functioning and welcoming immigration system is a crucial ingredient, too. “The U.S. is at its best when it welcomes talent from around the world and gives people the tools to succeed and thrive here,” says Gorman. Whether the Biden Administration can strike a deal with Senate Republicans on comprehensive immigration reform – or even funding basic research – remains an open question, though. And even if it can succeed, American ingenuity is no longer sufficient on its own.</p>
<h2>Team America</h2>
<p>Whether it’s for talent or partnerships, the U.S.-China tech competition will be won overseas. Allies are “the most salient and straightforward way Biden can bring leverage to the table compared to Trump,” says Schneider.</p>
<p>Biden, Blinken, and other senior administration officials have loudly and repeatedly pronounced their preferences to work with democratic partners on international challenges, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. It is no accident that Blinken and Sullivan’s meeting in Anchorage was preceded by a trip to Japan and South Korea, two of America’s closest allies in the region, and that Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was the first foreign leader to visit Biden at the White House. “If you add the U.S. to the EU, Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea, you tilt the balance of economic heft and technological prowess back toward us,” he adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146533" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146533" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146533" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg 6901w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146533" class="wp-caption-text">U.S. President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan hold a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 16, 2021.

<p>The ground for Blinken and company is increasingly fertile. Chinese diplomats have been <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7e508af8-0b35-4610-b52d-8c9e3e888a91">aggressive</a>, if not downright condescending, to countries they perceive have slighted China. <a href="https://www.codastory.com/newsletters/china-influence-monitor-april-1/">In one recent example</a>, the Chinese embassy in Dublin sent a series of tweets targeting an Irish-British journalist couple who had been forced to relocate to Taiwan as a result of a harassment campaign over their critical coverage of China’s Uyghur policy in Xinjiang. This so-called ‘wolf warrior’ diplomacy (a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Warrior">a jingoist action film</a>) is prompting a <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/04/06/china-image-problem-wolf-warrior-international/">backlash</a>, and helping convince many policy elites in countries who had hoped to sit out a U.S.-China conflict that perhaps Washignton’s China skeptics have a point.</p>
<p>This perhaps explains the proliferating alpha-numeric soup of coalitions and alliances being floated to secure a free and democratic internet for the future. There’s the D10, a secure supply chain network floated by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which adds Australia, India, and South Korea to the existing G7 countries (U.S., U.K., Canada, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan). Schmidt’s report calls for a T-12 (the D10 minus Italy plus Finland, Sweden, and Israel). Others look to expand existing technology-related groupings like the Five Eyes signals intelligence alliance of the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, or harness burgeoning non-technical ones like the Quad. Gorman points to the significance of the news that the Quad itself – Australia, India, Japan, and the US – announced the creation of a working group on emerging technology at its first-ever (virtual) leaders summit in March.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, has <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/8/9/895e0a40-65ee-43cc-8629-450555faefe7/AC6A0E54DB992E1612161C48BB34FC57.democracy-technology-partnership-act-two-pager-explainer.pdf">proposed</a> a technology partnership to be run out of the State Department to coordinate with allies – including a $5 billion fund for research – with the explicit purpose of countering China.</p>
<h2>International tech standards are increasingly not set by the West</h2>
<p>Even if it can shephard its allies, the U.S. still faces stiff international headwinds. The Trump Administration&#8217;s decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal negotiated by the Obama Administration with ten other Pacific Rim countries with the intent of setting trade standards in the Asia-Pacific, was taken as a sign that perhaps the U.S. pivot to Asia was less ambitious than advertised. The pact, rebranded as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), has continued without the U.S.  – and now even China has expressed interest in joining.</p>
<p>Trump’s disdain for working within multilateral forums has also meant that Washington has essentially ceded the field of global technical standard-setting. Beijing has taken advantage, aggressively working the UN system so that Chinese officials now lead four of the 15 specialized UN agencies, including the two most focused on regulating technology: the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which helps set global technical standards, and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which is responsible for protecting intellectual property rights around the world.</p>
<p>China is also backing Russian efforts to rewrite internet governance. With Chinese support, Russia won a UN General Assembly vote in 2019 to start drafting a new cybercrime treaty. Their goal is to replace the U.S-backed 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which was  created by democracies through the Council of Europe, with a treaty that one critic <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/new-un-cybercrime-treaty-way-forward-supporters-open-free-and-secure-internet">said</a> would include provisions “likely to provide cover to authoritarian governments to persecute their political opponents.” Russia and China also unsuccessfully <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/how-russia-and-china-are-attempting-to-rewrite-cyberworld-order/2021/03/30/16030226-9190-11eb-a74e-1f4cf89fd948_story.html">tried</a> to use the (now Chinese-led) ITU to replace the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a private body of experts that governs internet domain names.</p>
<p>These efforts are all part of China Standards 2035, an explicit plan to internationalize standards to Chinese preferences in areas like 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT). As Emily de La Bruyère and Nathan Picarsic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/11/chinas-next-plan-to-dominate-international-tech-standards/">wrote on TechCrunch last year</a>, “Beijing has spent the past two decades establishing influential footholds in multilateral bodies and targeted industrial areas. Now, it is using those footholds to set their rules – with them, to define the infrastructure of the future world.”</p>

<h2>Hawks, doves, and U.S. divisions</h2>
<p>Even within the new consensus on China, there are fissures on how to handle China itself.</p>
<p>On the hawkish side, the Schmidt Report concedes that “some degree of technological bifurcation is in U.S. interests.” But calibrating just how much is a difficult question. “It’s already a reality,” says Barker of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “The question is: how deep does the split have to be?”</p>
<p>Few argue for complete decoupling, Brattberg, the Carnegie scholar who has <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/06/10/forget-g-7-build-d-10-pub-82062">written</a> extensively on tech diplomacy, says. After all, many are loath to concede completely separate ‘free’ and ‘authoritarian’ internets. There are other implications as well: a “bipolar, bifurcated internet … would have some very serious adverse implications in terms of cost [and] a slowdown in innovation,” one former UK intelligence official <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/28/how-huawei-is-dividing-western-nations/">told me</a> last year.</p>
<p>The key is to pinpoint which specific technologies are essential to produce domestically. “To the extent we [decouple from China], we have to do it in a smart way,” says Gorman. “There’s a risk of going too far and hurting potential innovation in the U.S. So the debate going forward is going to be: How do you address true national security vulnerabilities without emulating an authoritarian approach that might say ‘just ban everything from a certain country.’”</p>
<p>And even if we can form a consensus at home, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/28/how-huawei-is-dividing-western-nations/">America’s allies are no less divided</a> as I wrote last year with regards to Huawei. While the debate over the Chinese company’s role in 5G has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/30/huaweis-terrible-week/">evolved</a>, with both France and the U.K. (in a reversal) moving to phase out its kit, the debate over what role China should play economically and technologically in Europe is still very much alive.</p>

<p>The U.K. government is clear-eyed; in its <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975077/Global_Britain_in_a_Competitive_Age-_the_Integrated_Review_of_Security__Defence__Development_and_Foreign_Policy.pdf">Integrated Review</a> of foreign and defense policy published in March, it acknowledged that China’s “growing international assertiveness … will pose an increasing risk to UK interests” and set an explicit goal for itself to be a third “science and tech superpower.” France, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/franco-german-divergences-indo-pacific-risk-strategic-dilution">laid</a> out an Indo-Pacific strategy backing the principle of a free and open Pacific, an explicit challenge to Chinese preferences.</p>
<p>But many are still equivocal. As Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2020-06-04/lee-hsien-loong-endangered-asian-century">wrote</a> last year in <i>Foreign Affairs, </i>“Asian countries do not want to be forced to choose between the two.” Berlin made clear in its Indo-Pacific strategy last year that it was also reticent to make an outright choice. New Zealand, conscious of its important trade with China, <a href="https://twitter.com/stephendziedzic/status/1383940496779743240">is reluctant</a> to expand the use of Five Eyes beyond intelligence sharing. Meanwhile, Italy endorsed China’s infrastructure-focused Belt and Road Initiative in 2019 and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-italy/italy-says-china-a-key-strategic-partner-despite-u-s-concerns-idUSKBN25L1LR">called</a> the country a “strategic partner” last year. And the European Union moved forward on a trade deal with China late last year despite very public lobbying against it from the United States.</p>
<h2>A world of tradeoffs</h2>
<p>The challenge for the Biden Administration will be to assemble practical coalitions without asking allies and partners to make impossible choices. They will succeed if they can reframe the question. “In Europe, they don&#8217;t like ‘decoupling’ but they do like ‘diversification’,” says Brattberg. They also don’t like the idea of joining a U.S.-led alliance. Instead, he says, Washington should frame cooperation as “coalitions among like-minded democrtaic partners.”</p>
<p>For that to work, the U.S. will have to work out the bilateral issues it has with its allies first. “We need to be much more savvy on engaging directly with the EU on resolving issues like data transfers, digital taxation, and data privacy,” he said. “Digital sovereignty shouldn’t come at the expense of partnership with like-minded partners.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146534" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146534" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146534" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146534" class="wp-caption-text">Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel gives a speech during the press conference at the end of the meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (not pictured) of at The Great Hall Of The People on September 06, 2019 in Beijing, China.

<p>Nimbleness will be key – multiple experts told me it will be far better to create ad hoc coalitions on particular issues than to create a single fixed democratic tech alliance. This would have the benefit of keeping groupings tight without excluding countries with key expertise in particular areas (think Sweden and 5G or Taiwan and semiconductors). Washington should also take a collegiate approach, recognizing and respecting that its allies will not always be in lock-step on every aspect of the relations with China. In other words, the U.S. shouldn’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good, as agreement most of the time on most issues is probably sufficient to create the momentum Washington needs.</p>
<p>The U.S. can still compete globally and widen the circle of like-minded countries, Gorman, the scholar at GMF, tells me, but it has to invest in them if they are going to build out their tech sectors in a way that is aligned with democratic values and standards. “It’s really about providing an attractive counteroffer,” she said.</p>
<p>Even if the United States retains its technological edge for the near future, Americans should start adjusting to a future where Silicon Valley&#8217;s dominance is no longer inevitable. Chinese technologists are pulling ahead in areas like 5G while Chinese firms are competing on price (mobile phones) and increasingly on quality (e-commerce) and innovation (see: TikTok). China also exerts enormous clout through its control of supply chains and <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/03/31/governments-have-identified-commodities-essential-to-economic-and-military-security">rare earth metals</a> as well as its vast customer base.</p>
<p>Perhaps China’s greatest leverage point is its looming presence over Taiwan. As long as Taiwan remains one of the leading manufacturers of semiconductors (chip giant TSMC <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/05206915-fd73-4a3a-92a5-6760ce965bd9">manufactures</a> 90% of the world’s most advanced chips), the world’s technology industry will be vulnerable to the precarity of cross-Strait relations.</p>
<p>Will technology become just another chip in the geopolitical game the U.S. and China are playing, then? The Biden Administration is more prepared than its predecessor to weigh the tradeoffs, Barker of the German Council on Foreign Relation retells me. But it’s unclear how Washington, so early in this administration, will prioritize technology issues if faced with the prospects of Chinese cooperation on other priorities.</p>
<p>After all, at any given moment, the U.S. (and its allies) must weigh a host of priorities vis-à-vis China. And for all of the downsides to its bellicosity, the Trump Administration&#8217;s fixation on a handful of issues gave it leverage: it was willing to ignore Uyghurs and other human rights abuses in order to get a trade deal (even if it was deeply flawed).</p>
<p>The Biden Administration, on the other hand, has not yet articulated any priorities at all. If the rhetoric from Washington can be believed, the White House thinks it can make progress on climate, Taiwan, trade, human rights, and any number of other areas, all at once. This on its own creates a vulnerability. As historian Niall Ferguson reminded us in a recent Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-21/niall-ferguson-a-taiwan-crisis-may-end-the-american-empire">column</a>, then National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger was outmaneuvered when he went to China in 1971 with a multi-issue agenda and China singularly focused on Taiwan.</p>
<p>Beijing’s diplomats, despite their wolf-warrior missteps, are still savvy negotiators. If they are allowed to do so, they will once again try to play different parts of the Administration against each other, conditioning progress on climate, for example, on a softening over geopolitics, as the Brookings scholar Thomas Wright has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/risk-john-kerry-following-his-own-china-policy/617459/">warned</a>. In that light, it simply strains credulity that an ‘all of the above’ approach will work, especially when Biden’s wish list keeps the issues Trump cared about, like trade, 5G, and Taiwan, and adds those he ignored, like human rights, democracy, and climate change.</p>
<p>This is where America’s alliances may prove to be Biden’s hidden ace. If Biden can forge a common-enough front with a wide-enough spectrum of allies, the U.S. will be better able to withstand Chinese pressure to trade progress on one issue against another. Instead, forcing China to negotiate with the U.S. and its allies on an issue-by-issue basis may put Washington in a better position to succeed.</p>
<p>Of all the issues in America’s China portfolio, though, the tech race provides one extra advantage: for all the talk of industrial strategy, alliances, and diplomatic maneuvers, Washington is not the only or even primary actor involved. The Biden Administration can help set the rules, invest in basic research, and defend American interests abroad, but American innovation depends on its innovators – and there are still bountiful numbers of them tinkering away.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups constantly talk about being mission-oriented, but it’s hard to take most of those messages seriously when the mission is optimizing cash flow for tax efficiency. However, a new generation of startups is emerging that are taking on some of the largest global challenges and bringing the same entrepreneurial grit, operational excellence, and technical brilliance to bear on actual missions — ones that may well save thousands of lives.</p>
<p>ClimateTech has been a huge beneficiary of this trend in general, but one small specialty has caught my eye: disaster response. It’s a category for software services that’s percolated for years with startups here and there, but now a new crop of founders is taking on the challenges of this space with renewed urgency and vigor.</p>
<p>As the elevator pitch would have it, disaster response is hitting hockey stick growth. 2020 was a brutal year, and in more ways than just the global COVID-19 pandemic. The year also experienced a record number of hurricanes, among the worst wildfire seasons in the Western United States, and several megastorms all across the world. Climate change, urbanization, population growth, and poor response practices have combined to create some of the most dangerous conditions humanity has ever collectively faced.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I wanted to get a sense of what the disaster response market has in store this decade, so over the past few weeks, I have interviewed more than 30 startup founders, investors, government officials, utility execs and more to understand this new landscape and what’s changed. In this four-part series on the future of technology and disaster response, to be published this weekend and next, we’ll look at the sales cycle in this market, how data is finally starting to flow into disaster response, how utilities and particularly telcos are dealing with internet access issues, and how communities are redefining disaster management going forward.</p>
<p>Before we get into all the tech developments in disaster response and resilience though, it’s important to ask a basic question: if you build it, will they come? The resounding answer from founders, investors, and government procurement officials was simple: no.</p>
<p>In fact, in all my conversations for this series, the hell of the emergency management sales cycle came up repeatedly, with more than one individual describing it as possibly the toughest sale that any company could make in the entire world. That view might be surprising in a market that easily runs into the tens of billions of dollars if the budgets for procurement are aggregated across local, state, federal, and international governments. Yet, as we will see, the unique dynamics of this market make almost any traditional sales approach useless.</p>
<p>Despite that pessimism though, that doesn’t mean sales are impossible, and a new crop of startups are piercing the barriers of entry in this market. We’ll look at the sales and product strategies that startups are increasingly relying on today to break through.</p>
<h2 id="The sale from hell">The sale from hell</h2>
<p>Few will be surprised that government sales are hard. Generations of govtech startup founders have learned that slow sales cycles, byzantine procurement processes, cumbersome verification and security requirements, and a general lassitude among contract officers makes for a tough battlefield to close on revenue. Many government agencies now have programs to specifically onboard startups, having discovered just how hard it is for new innovations to run through their gauntlet.</p>
<p>Emergency management sales share all the same problems as other govtech startups, but then they deal with about a half dozen more problems that make the sales cycle go from exhausting to infernal hell.</p>
<p>The first and most painful is the dramatic seasonality of the sales in the emergency space. Many agencies that operate on seasonal disasters — think hurricanes, wildfires, winter storms, and more — often go through an “action” period where they respond to these disasters, and then transition into a “planning” period where they assess their performance, determine what changes are needed for next season, and consider what tools might be added or removed to increase the effectiveness of their responders.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/cornea-eyes-in-on-fighting-wildfires-using-better-data/">Cornea</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go/">Perimeter</a>, two startups in the wildfire response space that I profiled recently. Both of the teams described how they needed to think in terms of fire seasons when it came to product iteration and sales. “We took two fire seasons to beta test our technology … to solve the right problem the right way,” Bailey Farren, CEO and co-founder of Perimeter, said. “We actually changed our focus on beta testing during the [2019 California] Kincaid fire.”</p>
<p>In this way, disaster tech could be compared to edtech, where school technology purchases are often synchronized with the academic calendar. Miss the June through August window in the U.S. education system, and a startup is looking at another year before it will get another chance at the classroom.</p>
<p>Edtech might once have been a tougher sale to make in order to thread that three-month needle, but disaster response is getting more difficult every year. Climate change is exacerbating the length, severity, and damage caused by all types of disasters, which means that responding agencies that might have had six months or more out-of-season to plan in the past are sometimes working all year long just to respond to emergencies. That gives little time to think about what new solutions an agency needs to purchase.</p>
<p>Worse, unlike the standardized academic calendar, disasters are much less predictable these days as well. Flood and wildfire seasons, for instance, used to be relatively concentrated in certain periods of the year. Now, such emergencies can emerge practically year-round. That means that procurement processes can both start and freeze on a moment’s notice as an agency has to respond to its mission.</p>
<p>Seasonality doesn’t just apply to the sales cycle though — it also applies to the budgets of these agencies. While they are transpiring, disasters dominate the eye of the minds for citizens and politicians, but then we forget all about them until the next catastrophe. Unlike the annual consistency of other government tech spending, disaster tech funding often comes in waves.</p>
<p>One senior federal emergency management official, who asked not to be named since he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly, explained that consistent budgets and the ability to spend them quickly is quite limited during “blue sky days” (i.e. periods without a disaster), and agencies like his have to rely on piecing together supplementary disaster funds when Congress or state legislatures authorize additional financing. The best agencies have technological roadmaps on hand so that when extra funding comes in, they can use it immediately to realize their plans, but not all agencies have the technical planning resources to be that prepared.</p>
<p>Amir Elichai, the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://carbyne911.com">Carbyne</a>, a cloud-native platform for call handling in 911 centers, said that this wave of interest crested yet again with the COVID-19 pandemic last year, triggering huge increases in attention and funding around emergency response capabilities. “COVID put a mirror in front of government faces and showed them that ‘we’re not ready’,” he said.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, next-generation 911 services (typically dubbed NG911), which have been advocated for years by the industry and first responders, is looking at a major financing boost. President Biden’s proposed infrastructure bill <a href="https://urgentcomm.com/2021/03/17/house-proposes-15-billion-for-ng911-funding-in-new-infrastructure-bill/">would add $15 billion to upgrade 911 capabilities in the United States</a> — funding that has been requested for much of the last decade. Just last year, <a href="https://urgentcomm.com/2020/07/03/house-approves-12-billion-for-ng911-funding-in-infrastructure-package-but-bill-unlikely-to-pass-senate/">a $12 billion variant of that bill failed in the Senate after passing the U.S. House of Representatives</a>.</p>
<p>Sales are all about providing proverbial painkillers versus vitamins to customers, and one would expect that disaster response agencies looking to upgrade their systems would be very much on the painkiller side. After all, the fear and crisis surrounding these agencies and their work would seem to bring visceral attention to their needs.</p>
<p>Yet, that fear actually has the opposite effect in many cases, driving attention away from systematic technology upgrades in favor of immediate acute solutions. One govtech VC, who asked not to be named to speak candidly about the procurement process his companies go through, said that “we don’t want to paint the picture that the world is a scary and dangerous place.” Instead, “the trick is to be … focused on the safety side rather than the danger.” Safety is a much more prevalent and consistent need than sporadically responding to emergencies.</p>
<p>When a wave of funding finally gets approved though, agencies often have to scramble to figure out what to prioritize now that the appropriated manna has finally dropped from the legislative heaven. Even when startups provide the right solutions, scrying which problems are going to get funded in a particular cycle requires acute attention to every customer.</p>
<p>Josh Mendelsohn, the managing partner at startup studio and venture fund <a href="https://www.hangar.is">Hangar</a>, said that “the customers have no shortage of needs that they are happy to talk about … the hardest part is how you narrow the funnel — what are the problems that are most meritorious?” That merit can, unfortunately, evolve very rapidly as mission requirements change.</p>
<p>Let’s say all the stars line up though — the agencies have time to buy, they have a need, and a startup has the solution that they want. The final challenge that’s probably the toughest to overcome is simply the lack of trust that new startups have with agencies.</p>
<p>In talking to emergency response officials the past few weeks, reliability unsurprisingly came up again and again. Responding to disasters is mission-critical work, and nothing can break in the field or in the operations center. Frontline responders still use paper and pens in lieu of tablets or mobile phones since they know that paper is going to work every single time and not run out of battery juice. The move fast and break things ethos of Silicon Valley is fundamentally incompatible with this market.</p>
<p>Seasonality, on-and-off funding, lack of attention, procurement scrambling, and acute reliability requirements combine to make emergency management sales among the hardest possible for a startup. That doesn’t even get into all the typical govtech challenges like integrating with legacy systems, the massive fragmentation of thousands of emergency response agencies littered across the United States and globally, and the fact that in many agencies, people aren’t that interested in change in the first place. As one individual in the space described how governments approach emergency technology, “a lot of departments are looking at it as maybe I can hit retirement before I have to deal with it.”</p>
<h2 id="The strategies for breaking out of limbo">The strategies for breaking out of limbo</h2>
<p>So the sales cycle is hell. Why, then, are VCs dropping money in the sector? After all, we’ve seen emergency response data platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/rapidsos-raises-85m-for-its-emergency-response-data-platform/">RapidSOS raise $85 million just a few months ago</a>, about the same time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/carbyne-raises-25m-for-a-next-generation-platform-to-improve-emergency-911-responses/">Carbyne raised $25 million</a>. There are quite a few more startups at the earliest phases that have raised pre-seed and seed investment as well.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;RapidSOS raises $85M for a big data platform aimed at emergency responders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/rapidsos-raises-85m-for-its-emergency-response-data-platform/embed/#?secret=5edu1wQy7e" data-secret="5edu1wQy7e" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The key argument that nearly everyone in this sector agreed on is that founders (and their investors) have to throw away their private-sector sales playbooks and rebuild their approach from the bottom up to sell specifically to these agencies. That means devising entirely different strategies and tactics to secure revenue performance.</p>
<p>The first and most important approach is, in some respects, to not even start with a company at all, but rather to start learning what people in this field actually do. As the sales cycle perhaps indicates, disaster response is unlike any other work. The chaos, the rapidly changing environment, the multi-disciplinary teams and cross-agency work that has to take place for a response to be effective have few parallels to professional office work. Empathy is key here: the responder that uses paper might have nearly lost their life in the field when their device failed. A 911 center operator may have listened to someone perish in real-time as they scrambled to find the right information from a software database.</p>
<p>In short, it’s all about customer discovery and development. That’s not so different from the enterprise world, but patience radiated out of many of my conversations with industry participants. It just takes more time — sometimes multiple seasons — to figure out precisely what to build and how to sell it effectively. If an enterprise SaaS product can iterate to market-fit in six months, it might take two to three years in the government sector to reach an equivalent point.</p>
<p>Michael Martin of RapidSOS said “There is no shortcut to doing customer discovery work in public service.” He noted that “I do think there is a real challenge between the arrogance of the Silicon Valley tech community and the reality of these challenges“ in public safety, a gap that has to be closed if a startup wants to find success. Meanwhile, Bryce Stirton, president and co-founder of public-safety company Responder Corp, said that “The end user is the best way to look at all the challenges … what are all the boxes the end user has to check to use a new technology?”</p>
<p>Mendelsohn of Hangar said that founders need to answer some tough questions in that process. “Ultimately, what are your entry points,” he asked. “Cornea has had to go through that customer discovery process … it all feels necessary, but what are the right things that require the least amount of behavior change to have impact immediately?”</p>
<p>Indeed, that process is appreciated on the other side as well. The federal emergency management official said, “everyone has a solution, but no one asked me about my problem.” Getting the product right and having it match the unique work that takes place in this market is key.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have a great product though — how do you get it through the perilous challenges of the procurement process? Here, answers differed widely, and they offer multiple strategies on how to approach the problem.</p>
<p>Martin of RapidSOS said that “government does not have a good model for procuring new services to solve problems.” So, the company chose to make its services free for government. “In three years, we went from no agencies using our stuff to all agencies using our stuff, and that was based on not making it a procurement problem,” he said. The company’s business model is based on having paid corporate partners who want to integrate their data into 911 centers for safety purposes.</p>
<p>That’s a similar model used by <a href="https://mdally.com">MD Ally</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/md-ally-connects-telehealth-alternatives-right-into-911-calls/">received a $3.5 million seed check from General Catalyst this past week</a>. The company adds telehealth referral services into 911 dispatch systems, and CEO and founder Shanel Fields emphasized that she saw an opportunity to create a revenue engine from the physician and mental health provider side of her market while avoiding government procurement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yWp4rUGpeP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/md-ally-connects-telehealth-alternatives-right-into-911-calls/">MD Ally connects telehealth alternatives right into 911 calls</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MD Ally connects telehealth alternatives right into 911 calls&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/md-ally-connects-telehealth-alternatives-right-into-911-calls/embed/#?secret=yWp4rUGpeP" data-secret="yWp4rUGpeP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Outside of what might be dubbed “Robinhood for government” (aka, just offering a service for free), another approach is to link up with more well-known and trusted brand names to offer a product that has the innovation of a startup but the reliability of an established player. Stirton of Responder said “we learned in [this market] that it takes more than just capital to get companies started in this space.” What he found worked was building private-sector partnerships to bring a joint offering to governments. For instance, he noted cloud providers Amazon Web Services and Verizon have good reputations with governments and can get startups over procurement hurdles (TechCrunch is owned by Verizon Media, which is owned by Verizon).</p>
<p>Elichai of Carbyne notes that much of his sales is done through integration partners, referencing <a href="https://www.centralsquare.com">CenterSquare</a> as one example. For 911 services, “The U.S. market is obviously the most fragmented” and so partners allow the company to avoid selling to thousands of different agencies. “We are usually not selling direct to governments,” he said.</p>
<p>Partners can also help deal with the problem of localism in emergency procurement: many government agencies don’t know precisely what to buy, so they simply buy software that is offered by companies in their own backyard. Partners can offer a local presence while also allowing a startup to have a nimble national footprint.</p>
<p>Another angle on partners is building out a roster of experienced but retired government executives who can give credibility to a startup through their presence and networks. Even more than in enterprise, government officials, particularly in emergency management, have to work and trust one another given the closely-coupled work that they perform. Hearing a positive recommendation from a close contact down the street can readily change the tenor of a sales conversation.</p>
<p>Finally, as much as emergency management software is geared for governments, private sector companies increasingly have to consider much of the same tooling to protect their operations. Many companies have distributed workforces, field teams, and physical assets they need to protect, and often have to respond to disasters in much the same way that governments do. For some startups, it’s possible to bootstrap in the private sector early on while continuing to assiduously develop public sector relationships.</p>
<p>In short, a long-term customer development program coupled with quality partnerships and joint offerings while not forgetting the private sector offers the best path for startups to break through into these agencies.</p>
<p>The good news is that the hard work can be rewarded. Not only are there serious dollars that flow through these agencies, but the agencies themselves know that they need better technology. Tom Harbour, who is chief fire officer at Cornea and formerly national director of fire management at the U.S. Forest Service, notes that “These are billions of dollars we spend … and we know we can be more efficient.” Government doesn’t always make it easy to create efficiency, but for the founders willing to go the distance, they can build impactful, profitable, and mission-driven companies.</p>

<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>

And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week we&#8217;re looking at the launch of Apple&#8217;s ATT, the Facebook and Spotify team-up and the latest from the EU&#8217;s antitrust investigation against Apple.</p>
<p><em><strong>This Week in Apps will soon be a newsletter! Sign up here:<a href="http://techcrunch.com/newsletters"> techcrunch.com/newsletters</a></strong></em></p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>Here Comes ATT</h3>
<p>Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">public debut of App Tracking Transparency</a>, or ATT, is the news of the week and possibly of the year. Through a small pop-up message asking users if the app can track them, Apple has disrupted a multibillion-dollar adtech industry, altered the course of tech giants like Facebook and drawn possible <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">lawsuits</a> and antitrust <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/26/german-advertisers-file-antitrust-complaint-over-apples-app-tracking-transparency?utm_medium=rss">complaints</a>, all in the name of protecting consumer privacy. Apple does believe in privacy and user control &#8212; you can tell that from the way the company has built its technology to do things like on-device processing or permissions toggles that let people decide what their apps can and cannot do.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="o4wmAxOCnW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature has arrived — here&#8217;s what you need to know</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But Apple will also benefit from this particular privacy reform, too. Its own first-party apps can collect data and share it with other first-party apps. That means what you do in apps like the App Store, Apple News, Stocks and others can be used to personalize Apple&#8217;s own ads. And the company is prepared to capitalize on this opportunity too, with the addition of a new ad slot on the App Store (in <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/26/german-advertisers-file-antitrust-complaint-over-apples-app-tracking-transparency?utm_medium=rss">the Suggested section</a> on the Search tab.) If it wants to roll out more ads over time to other businesses &#8212; perhaps, those podcasts it got newly interested in after Spotify did? Or in its streaming TV service or fitness solution? Perhaps the ads it sells in Apple News? &#8212; then it would have access to valuable data it could use. Oh and the next time you open the App Store or Apple News, you won&#8217;t be bothered with one of those pesky warnings! Nope &#8212; that&#8217;s only for <em>third</em>-parties, a <em>very</em> important distinction! If you want to turn off Apple&#8217;s own ability to track you across its growing number of apps, that&#8217;s at the VERY bottom of iOS&#8217;s Privacy Settings.</p>

<p>The feature is available to both free and paying Spotify users and will allow them each to hear the full song or podcast episode being shared. However, free users will then be moved into &#8220;shuffle&#8221; mode if they continue to listen after the song plays.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about this integration is that it&#8217;s not actually streaming Spotify through Facebook. The miniplayer activates and controls the launch and playback in the Spotify app — which is how the playback is able to continue even as the user scrolls on Facebook or if they minimize the Facebook app altogether. This gives the appearance of Facebook doing the streaming. (Songs on social! Cue Myspace vibes!)</p>
<p>Spotify says users can&#8217;t upgrade to Spotify Premium from the miniplayer directly, so there&#8217;s no rev share there. It&#8217;s also paying the royalties on streams, as usual. But it&#8217;s getting massive distribution through Facebook, driving signups and repeat usage, while Facebook gets a way to keep users on its app longer. Win-win. Not coincidentally, both companies now share a common enemy with Apple, whose <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22254815/facebook-apple-privacy-ios-14-lawsuit">privacy-focused changes</a> are impacting Facebook’s ad business and whose investments in Apple Music and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">Podcasts</a> are a threat to Spotify.</p>

The European Commission last year opened its antitrust investigation into Apple&#8217;s business, which is also now under fire in the U.S. for similar matters.</p>
<p>On Friday, the European regulators stated that Apple has &#8220;abused its dominant position&#8221; in the distribution of music streaming services on the App Store, and called it a &#8220;monopoly.&#8221; The EU doesn&#8217;t think Apple should be able to force developers to use its own in-app purchase mechanism nor should it be able to restrict them from telling users where else they can pay &#8212; like the developer&#8217;s own website, for example.</p>

<p>Apple is correct in pointing out that Spotify has built a massive business &#8212; which to be fair, was built both on and off the App Store. But it&#8217;s claiming a pretty big hand in that. The EU&#8217;s belief, meanwhile, is that Spotify might have been even more successful if Apple hadn&#8217;t imposed the restrictions it did, and that other smaller, streaming competitors are being harmed, too, but don&#8217;t have the power to speak up.</p>

<p><b>Clubhouse partners with the NFL for draft week programming</b>. This is the first sports partnership for the audio app and saw the NFL creating a series of draft-themed rooms throughout the week.</p>

<p><strong>A popular Android app for writing JavaScript code, DroidScript, had its Google advertising suspended and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/27/droidscript_google_ban/">was then removed from the Google Play Store</a> for ad fraud</strong>. The founder of the nonprofit DroidScript.org behind the app asked Google for an explanation and got no response, <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/androidscript/c/Mbh5TZ6YYnA">he said</a>. The app was used by over 100K developers, students and professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers said that hundreds of preinstalled apps on Android devices<a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/04/27/google-promised-its-contact-tracing-app-was-completely-private-but-it-wasnt"> would have access to</a> a log on users&#8217; phones where the sensitive contract tracing information was stored</strong>. Google didn&#8217;t offer a reward payout for the finding, saying that system logs haven&#8217;t been readable by unprivileged apps since the early days of Android.</p>

<p>The makers of a popular email app Edison Mail have now launched another email app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onmail-fast-simple-email/id1531381193">OnMail</a>. This new iOS app is designed to solve more difficult email problems, like handling overloaded inboxes and mail that spies on you. The app will automatically block tracking pixels (read receipts), suggest emails to unsubscribe from, index your entire history for faster searches, stop ad targeting, and more. Like Basecamp&#8217;s Hey, users can also decide who can or cannot enter their inbox, too. And when you want to see your promotions, they&#8217;re provided in a visual feed that&#8217;s more engaging.</p>
<p>The service, which is also available on the web, works with OnMail email addresses, as well as other accounts like those from Microsoft, Google and others. It will later introduce an Android app, calendar support, Yahoo and Microsoft Exchange support, and two-factor. The company says your name and email is never shared, but it does use anonymized data as part of its <a href="https://trends.edison.tech/">Edison Trends (digital commerce) research</a> &#8212; users are opted in, but an opt out is available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s an old saw from Mark Twain about how truth is stranger than fiction, and I think it&#8217;s fair to say we&#8217;ve lived through a very strange reality this past year. With all the chaos and change, we&#8217;re led to a foundational question: what&#8217;s the purpose of speculative fiction and its adjacent genres of science fiction and fantasy when so much of our world seems to already embody the fantastical worlds these works depict?</p>
<p>So I got our occasional fictional columnist <a href="https://www.eliotpeper.com">Eliot Peper</a> and <a href="https://www.eliotpeper.com/p/blog-page.html">the author of Veil, the three part Analog Series and other speculative fiction novels</a> on the Gmail for an epistolary conversation on digesting 2020, the meaning of speculative fiction, and the future of art.</p>
<p><em>This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Danny Crichton</strong>: I&#8217;m curious about the future of speculative fiction. We just went through a devastating year with the pandemic and a number of major climate disorders – the types of events that are among the fodder for this genre. How do you keep speculating when reality always seems to catch up with the amygdala of our imaginations?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot Peper</strong>: Current events are a painful reminder that unlike fiction, reality needn&#8217;t be plausible. The world is complex and even the wisest of us understand only a tiny sliver of what&#8217;s really going on. Nobody knows what comes next. So while it may feel like we&#8217;re living in a science fiction novel, that&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve <i>always been </i>living in a science fiction novel. Or maybe speculative fiction is more real than so-called realist fiction because the only certainty is that tomorrow will be different from today and from what we expect. Depicting a world without fundamental change has become fantastical.</p>
<p>As a writer of speculative fiction, I&#8217;m an enthusiastic reader of history. And in reading about the past to slake my curiosity and imagine possible futures, I&#8217;ve learned that the present is exceedingly contingent, fascinating, and fleeting. For me, speculative fiction is less about prediction than it is about riffing on how the world is changing like a jazz musician might improvise over a standard. Accuracy only happens by mistake. The most interesting rendition wins because it makes people think, dream, <i>feel</i>. And thanks to technological leverage, to a greater and greater extent people are inventing the future – for better and for worse.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m not worried about reality catching up with speculative fiction because speculative fiction is rooted in the human experience of reality. Every black swan event is simply new material.</p>
<p><strong>Crichton</strong>: So this gets at a challenge that I think blurs the line between realist and speculative fiction and makes these works so hard to categorize. To me, the reality of the pandemic isn&#8217;t the black swan that a novel virus could take hold across the planet (after all, pandemics are actually quite common in history), but rather the black swan of the completely shambolic response that we witnessed, one that was not at all well-coordinated.</p>
<p>If I were designing a speculative fiction scenario, I don&#8217;t think I could come up with &#8220;we develop a cure extremely rapidly thanks to the progress of medical science, but the general day-to-day response of people is to massively inflate the death totals through their own actions.&#8221; When I think speculative, I think spectacular — something exceptional, but this particular black swan shows the power of the mundane actions of our lives to influence the course of events.</p>
<p><strong>Peper</strong>: Speculative fiction is all about asking &#8220;what if?&#8221; What if a lone astronaut got stranded on Mars? What if genetic engineers resurrected dinosaurs and stuck them in an amusement park? What if we are all living in a simulation? The question that sparked my latest novel, <i>Veil</i>, is &#8220;what if a billionaire hijacked the climate with geoengineering?&#8221; These questions are hooks. They capture the imagination and pique curiosity. That&#8217;s all well and good, but it&#8217;s only a starting point.</p>
<p>To pay off a speculative setup, you need to keep the dominos falling as second-, third-, and fourth-order effects ripple out through the story. Momentum builds. Progressive complications tighten the ratchet. Unexpected reversals fling the reader forward. If an earthquake flattens San Francisco in your story, it&#8217;s easy to imagine potential physical consequences: the Bay Bridge collapsing, BART flooding, the power going out, gas leaks, fires, etc. It&#8217;s less obvious but at least as important to imagine the potential social consequences: Do people risk their lives to rescue their neighbors or fight over limited emergency supplies? How do the governor and the president respond given their particular personalities, incentives, and constituencies? How might such an event rework the social fabric of the Bay Area? (Also, crucially, <i>where is Dwayne Johnson?</i>) How people respond to events is integral to how events play out.</p>
<p>Published in April 2020, Lawrence Wright&#8217;s <i>The End of October</i> does an eerily good job extrapolating the messy, cascading social and political reactions to a global pandemic. Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s <i>Galápagos</i> depicts an apocalyptic scenario driven by such mundane, shambolic human shortsightedness that it feels nearly absurd enough to be realistic. While some science fiction overindexes technological change, Ada Palmer&#8217;s brilliant <em>Terra Ignota</em> series imagines the cultural, political, and sociological aspects of a fictional future with extraordinary rigor. So often, human behavior is the X-factor that transforms and amplifies the impacts of the original scenario, shaping a new world in the process.</p>
<p>This hints at a deeper question though: What is fiction for?</p>
<p>When I write fiction, I am not trying to accurately depict or anticipate reality. I&#8217;m trying to create an experience, to take the reader on a journey that is compelling, surprising, and fulfilling. Even though part of the fun might be extrapolating a scenario rooted in a particularly intriguing facet of the real world, success isn&#8217;t getting things right. Success is a reader turning pages deep into the night to find out what happens next in a story they can&#8217;t put down and won&#8217;t soon forget.</p>
<p>Neil Gaiman likes to say that fairy tales are more than true – not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten. When it comes to speculative fiction, I love stories that reveal a deep emotional truth or illuminate an underlying force shaping the course of history even if they are wildly but entertainingly wrong about literal details. That doesn&#8217;t mean that striving for technical accuracy is bad, just that it isn&#8217;t always the point. The point might instead be to make you think, to make you feel, to make you imagine how the world might be different.</p>
<p><strong>Crichton</strong>: So on that last point, I&#8217;m curious how you think about imagination and its power for change. Obviously, art has had a sustained and powerful impact on the imagination of people throughout history, and there are often artistic antecedents to large societal, cultural, and political changes. Part of its power historically though, at least from my perspective, was its rarity and its ability to surprise.</p>
<p>Today, we are just subsumed in imaginative worlds, from video games to movies to streaming television shows to books and graphic novels and on and on. If you read time-use studies, Americans are awash in imaginative contexts for potentially a majority of their waking hours. I feel like I&#8217;ve been increasingly seeing this gap between the extreme breadth of imagination available in our art, but the extreme narrowness for change in our daily lives. Is that a threat to the ability of art to provoke change? Is speculation still an activity that can lead to action?</p>
<p><strong>Peper</strong>: Speculation is part of what it means to be human. Before we make a choice, we imagine the possible consequences. We simulate potential futures in daydreams before committing to them in reality. Our mental projections are often wrong, but they are also often useful. For better and for worse, thought experiment is foundational to our internal lives. This individual dynamic scales to the human collective: Imagining a better future is the first step toward building one.</p>
<p>Art is a vehicle for imagination. A filmmaker codifies their vision in a movie that others can watch and, in watching, exercise their respective imaginations – sometimes even sparking new creative endeavors that spin off into yet more projects that together form what we call culture. Technology has made more movies, books, songs, poems, photos, paintings, comics, podcasts, and games available and accessible to more people than ever before. Imagined worlds are an integral part of the real world as we experience it, layering meaning and possibility onto actual events. We are all interpreting reality for each other all the time, transforming it in the process. The increasing density and intensity of that process is the result of a growing population that is knitting itself together ever more tightly along ever more dimensions.</p>
<p>But technology hasn&#8217;t just made new artistic mediums possible and changed the ways in which people make, discover, and experience art. Technology amplifies the impact of human choices. Hippocrates couldn&#8217;t have invented an mRNA vaccine, Genghis Khan couldn&#8217;t have pressed a button to initiate a nuclear apocalypse, and Odysseus had to build his Trojan Horse out of wood instead of code.</p>
<p>Our tools give us superpowers our ancestors never imagined and the consequences of our decisions scale accordingly. Because technical ingenuity is morally neutral, technological development ratchets up the stakes for timeless questions of human agency – what does it mean to live a good life, to contribute to the greater good, to be a good ancestor? This is the moral geography to which artists offer diverse, imperfect, contradictory, and occasionally invaluable maps. So in a certain sense, the more technology empowers us, the more we need art.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech companies in Silicon Valley, the geography, have had an incredible year. But one indicator points to longer-term changes. The internal rate of return (IRR) for companies in other startup hub cities has been even better. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/internal-rates-of-return-in-emerging-us-tech-hubs-are-starting-to-overtake-silicon-valley/">big new analysis by AngelList</a> showed aggregate IRR of 19.4% per year on syndicated deals elsewhere versus 17.5% locally. A separate measure, of total value of paid-in investment, revealed 1.67x returns for other hubs versus 1.60x in the main Silicon Valley and Bay Area tech cities.</p>

<hr />
<p>The data is based on a sample of 2,500 companies that have used AngelList to syndicate deals from 2013 through 2020. Which is just one snapshot, but a relevant one given how hard it can be to produce accurate early-stage startup market analysis at this scale. I believe we&#8217;ll see more and more data confirming the trends in the coming years, especially as more of the startup world acclimates to remote-first and distributed offices. You can increasingly do a startup from anywhere and make it a success. Not that Silicon Valley is lacking optimism, as you&#8217;ll see in a number of the other stories in the roundup below!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>With the Coinbase direct listing behind us and the Robinhood IPO ahead, it’s a heady time for consumer-focused trading apps.</p>
<p>Mix in the impending SPAC-led debut of eToro, general bullishness in the cryptocurrency space, record highs for some equities markets, and recent rounds from Public.com, M1 Finance and U.K.-based Freetrade, and you could be excused for expecting the boom in consumer asset trading to keep going up and to the right.</p>
<p>But will it? There are data in both directions.</p>

<h2>2021 should be a banner year for biotech startups that make smart choices early</h2>

<p>Last year was a record 12 months for venture-backed biotech and pharma companies, with deal activity rising to $28.5 billion from $17.8 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>As vaccines roll out, drug development pipelines return to normal, and next-generation therapies continue to hold investor interest, 2021 is on pace to be another blockbuster year.</p>
<p>But founder missteps early in the fundraising journey can result in severe consequences.</p>
<p>In this exciting moment, when younger founders will likely receive more attention, capital and control than ever, it’s crucial to avoid certain pitfalls.</p>

<p>The fundamental thing to remember about the SPAC process is that the result is a publicly traded company open to the regulatory environment of the SEC and the scrutiny of public shareholders.</p>
<p>In today’s fast-paced IPO world, going public can seem like simply a marker of success, a box to check.</p>
<p>But are you ready to be a public company?</p>

<p>Those of us who read a lot of tech and business publications have heard for years about the cybersecurity skills gap. Studies often claim that millions of jobs are going unfilled because there aren’t enough qualified candidates available for hire.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t buy it.</p>
<p>The basic laws of supply and demand mean there will always be people in the workforce willing to move into well-paid security jobs. The problem is not that these folks don’t exist. It’s that CIOs or CISOs typically look right past them if their resumes don’t have a very specific list of qualifications.</p>
<p>In many cases, hiring managers expect applicants to be fully trained on all the technologies their organization currently uses. That not only makes it harder to find qualified candidates, but it also reduces the diversity of experience within security teams — which, ultimately, may weaken the company’s security capabilities and its talent pool.</p>

<p>We do not know how to value Honest Company.</p>
<p>It’s outside our normal remit, but that the company is getting out the door at what appears to be a workable price gain to its final private round implies that investors earlier in its cap table are set to do just fine in its debut. Snowflake it is not, but at its current IPO price interval, it is hard to not call Honest a success of sorts — though we also anticipate that its investors had higher hopes.</p>
<p>Returning to our question, do we expect the company to reprice higher? No, but if it did, The Exchange crew would not fall over in shock.</p>

<p>Brex, a fintech company that provides corporate cards and spend-management software to businesses, announced Monday that it closed a $425 million Series D round of capital at a valuation of around $7.4 billion.</p>
<p>The new capital came less than a year after Brex raised $150 million at a $2.9 billion pre-money valuation.</p>
<p>So, how did the company manage to so rapidly boost its valuation and raise its largest round to date?</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Brex CEO Henrique Dubugras after his company’s news broke. We dug into the how and why of its new investment and riffed on what going remote-first has done for the company, as well as its ability to attract culture-aligned and more diverse talent.</p>

<p>There’s a disconnect between reality and the added value investors are promising entrepreneurs. Three in five founders who were promised added value by their VCs felt duped by their negative experience.</p>
<p>While this feels like a letdown by investors, in reality, it shows fault on both sides. Due diligence isn’t a one-way street, and founders must do their homework to make sure they’re not jumping into deals with VCs who are only paying lip service to their value-add.</p>
<p>Looking into an investor’s past, reputation and connections isn’t about finding the perfect VC, it’s about knowing what shaking certain hands will entail — and either being ready for it or walking away.</p>

<h2>What can the OKR software sector tell us about startup growth more generally?</h2>
<p>In the never-ending stream of venture capital funding rounds, from time to time, a group of startups working on the same problem will raise money nearly in unison. So it was with OKR-focused startups toward the start of 2020.</p>
<p>How were so many OKR-focused tech upstarts able to raise capital at the same time? And was there really space in the market for so many different startups building software to help other companies manage their goal-setting? OKRs, or “objectives and key results,” a corporate planning method, are no longer a niche concept. But surely, over time, there would be M&amp;A in the group, right?</p>

<p>Tech innovation is becoming more widely distributed across the United States.</p>
<p>Among the five startups launched in 2020 that raised the most financing, four were based outside the Bay Area. The number of syndicated deals on AngelList in emerging markets from Austin to Seattle to Pittsburgh has increased 144% over the last five years.</p>
<p>And the number of startups in these emerging markets is growing fast &#8212; and increasingly getting a bigger piece of the VC pie.</p>

<p>Almost two centuries ago, gold prospectors in California set off one of the greatest rushes for wealth in history. Proponents of socially conscious investing claim fund managers will start a similar stampede when they discover that environmental, social and governance (ESG) insights can yield treasure in the form of alternative data that promise big payoffs — if only they knew how to mine it.</p>
<p>ESG data is everywhere. Learning how to understand it promises big payoffs.</p>

<p>The IPO parade continued t<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">his week as India-based food-delivery unicorn Zomato filed to go public. </span></p>
<p>The Zomato IPO is incredibly important. As our own Manish Singh reported when the company’s numbers became public, a “successful listing [could be] poised to encourage nearly a dozen other unicorn Indian startups to accelerate their efforts to tap the public markets.”</p>
<p>So, Zomato’s debut is not only notable because its impending listing gives us a look into its economics, but because it could lead to a liquidity rush in the country if its flotation goes well.</p>

<p>With the United States moving all-in on massive infrastructure investment, much of the discussion has focused on jobs and building new green industries for the 21st century.</p>
<p>While the Biden administration’s plan will certainly expand the workforce, it also provides a massive opportunity for the adoption of automation technologies within the construction industry.</p>
<p>Despite the common narrative of automating away human jobs, the two are not nearly as much in conflict, especially with new investments creating space for new roles and work.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the greatest problems facing the construction industry remains a lack of labor, making automation a necessity for moving forward with these ambitious projects.</p>

<p>Our health status should be as accessible as our checking account balance.</p>

<p>The red-hot market for special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, has “screeched to a halt.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the SPAC market grew in the past six months, it seemed that everyone was getting into the game. But shareholder lawsuits, huge value fluctuations and warnings from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have all thrown the brakes on the SPAC market, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>So what do privately held tech companies that are considering going public need to know about the SPAC process and market?</p>

<p>Once the uncool sibling of a flourishing fintech sector, insurtech is now one of the hottest areas of a buoyant venture market. Zego’s $150 million round at unicorn valuation in March, a rumored giant incoming round for WeFox, and a slew of IPOs and SPACs in the U.S. are all testament to this.</p>
<p>It’s not difficult to see why. The insurance market is enormous, but the sector has suffered from notoriously poor customer experience, and major incumbents have been slow to adapt. Fintech has set a precedent for the explosive growth that can be achieved with superior customer experience underpinned by modern technology. And the pandemic has cast the spotlight on high-potential categories, including health, mobility and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>This has begun to brew a perfect storm of conditions for big European insurtech exits.</p>

<p>The recent movement toward data transparency is bringing about a new era of innovation and startups.</p>
<p>Those who follow the space closely may have noticed that there are twin struggles taking place: a push for more transparency on provider and payer data, including anonymous patient data, and another for strict privacy protection for personal patient data.</p>
<p>What’s the main difference, and how can startups solve these problems?</p>

		Debbie Zelten (SAFe(R) 4 Agilist, SAFe Scrum Master, CSM, LSSGB, PMI-ACP) is the director of application development and business intelligence at <a href="https://synoptek.com/">Synoptek</a>. She has over 20 years of experience in implementing software and data analytics solutions for companies of all sizes. 	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With an increasing number of enterprise systems, growing teams, a rising proliferation of the web and multiple digital initiatives, companies of all sizes are creating loads of data every day. This data contains excellent business insights and immense opportunities, but it has become impossible for companies to derive actionable insights from this data consistently due to its sheer volume.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/global-analytics-as-a-service-market-size-and-forecast-to-2025/">Verified Market Research</a>, the analytics-as-a-service (AaaS) market is expected to grow to $101.29 billion by 2026. Organizations that have not started on their analytics journey or are spending scarce data engineer resources to resolve issues with analytics implementations are not identifying actionable data insights. Through AaaS, managed services providers (MSPs) can help organizations get started on their analytics journey immediately without extravagant capital investment.</p>
<p>MSPs can take ownership of the company&#8217;s immediate data analytics needs, resolve ongoing challenges and integrate new data sources to manage dashboard visualizations, reporting and predictive modeling — enabling companies to make data-driven decisions every day.</p>
<p>AaaS could come bundled with multiple business-intelligence-related services. Primarily, the service includes (1) services for data warehouses; (2) services for visualizations and reports; and (3) services for predictive analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). When a company partners with an MSP for analytics as a service, organizations are able to tap into business intelligence easily, instantly and at a lower cost of ownership than doing it in-house. This empowers the enterprise to focus on delivering better customer experiences, be unencumbered with decision-making and build data-driven strategies.</p>

	</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s world, where customers value experiences over transactions, AaaS helps businesses dig deeper into their psyche and tap insights to build long-term winning strategies. It also enables enterprises to forecast and predict business trends by looking at their data and allows employees at every level to make informed decisions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">European Commission has filed preliminary charges against Apple</a>, focusing on complaints by Spotify that Apple&#8217;s App Store policies — particularly its requirements around in-app purchase — are anti-competitive.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commission takes issue with the mandatory use of Apple’s own in-app purchase mechanism imposed on music streaming app developers to distribute their apps via Apple’s App Store,” it wrote. “The Commission is also concerned that Apple applies certain restrictions on app developers preventing them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative, cheaper purchasing possibilities.”</p>
<p>Apple has 12 weeks to respond to the charges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A U.K. company behind digital addressing system What3Words has sent a legal threat to a security researcher for offering to share an open-source software project with other researchers, which What3Words claims violate its copyright.</p>
<p>Aaron Toponce, a systems administrator at XMission, received a letter on Thursday from a law firm representing What3Words, requesting that he delete tweets related to the open-source alternative, WhatFreeWords. The letter also demands that he disclose to the law firm the identity of the person or people with whom he had shared a copy of the software, agree that he would not make any further copies of the software and to delete any copies of the software he had in his possession.</p>
<p>The letter gave him until May 7 to agree, after which What3Words would &#8220;waive any entitlement it may have to pursue related claims against you,&#8221; a thinly-veiled threat of legal action.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a battle worth fighting,&#8221; he said <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronToponce/status/1387933438305394690?s=20">in a tweet</a>. Toponce told TechCrunch that he has complied with the demands, fearing legal repercussions if he didn&#8217;t. He has also asked the law firm twice for links to the tweets they want deleting but has not heard back. &#8220;Depending on the tweet, I may or may not comply. Depends on its content,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>U.K.-based What3Words divides the entire world into three-meter squares and labels each with a unique three-word phrase. The idea is that sharing three words is easier to share on the phone in an emergency than having to find and read out their precise geographic coordinates.</p>
<p>But security researcher Andrew Tierney <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56901363">recently discovered</a> that What3Words would sometimes have two similarly-named squares less than a mile apart, potentially causing confusion about a person&#8217;s true whereabouts. In a later write-up, Tierney said What3Words was <a href="https://cybergibbons.com/security-2/why-what3words-is-not-suitable-for-safety-critical-applications/">not adequate</a> for use in safety-critical cases.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the only downside. Critics have <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/03/why-bother-with-what-three-words/ ">long argued</a> that What3Words&#8217; proprietary geocoding technology, which it bills as &#8220;life-saving,&#8221; makes it harder to examine it for problems or security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Extra Crunch members get unlimited access to 12M stock images for $99 per year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/extra-crunch-members-get-unlimited-access-to-12m-stock-images-for-99-per-year/embed/#?secret=6HwlbIsMT7" data-secret="6HwlbIsMT7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Concerns about its lack of openness in part led to the creation of the WhatFreeWords. A copy of <a href="https://justpaste.it/39hat">the project&#8217;s website</a>, which does not contain the code itself, said the open-source alternative was developed by reverse-engineering What3Words. &#8220;Once we found out how it worked, we coded implementations for it for JavaScript and Go,&#8221; the website said. &#8220;To ensure that we did not violate the What3Words company&#8217;s copyright, we did not include any of their code, and we only included the bare minimum data required for interoperability.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the project&#8217;s website was nevertheless subjected to a <a href="https://ivan.sanchezortega.es/w3w-bullying/2019-09-19/SCIP%20-%20Ecommerce%20Takedown%20Notice%20-%20W3W%2019%20Sept%202019.pdf">copyright takedown request</a> filed by What3Words&#8217; counsel. Even <a href="https://www.owenboswarva.com/misc/W3W_Twitter_20191007.pdf">tweets</a> that pointed to cached or backup copies of the code were removed by Twitter at the lawyers&#8217; requests.</p>
<p>Toponce — a security researcher on the side — contributed to Tierney&#8217;s research, who was <a href="https://twitter.com/cybergibbons/status/1387164574294712321">tweeting out</a> his findings as he went. Toponce said that he offered to share a copy of the WhatFreeWords code with other researchers to help Tierney with his ongoing research into What3Words. Toponce told TechCrunch that receiving the legal threat may have been a combination of offering to share the code and also finding problems with What3Words.</p>
<p>In its letter to Toponce, What3Words argues that WhatFreeWords contains its intellectual property and that the company &#8220;cannot permit the dissemination&#8221; of the software.</p>
<p>Regardless, several websites still retain copies of the code and are easily searchable through Google, and TechCrunch has seen several tweets linking to the WhatFreeWords code since Toponce went public with the legal threat. Tierney, who did not use WhatFreeWords as part of his research, said <a href="https://twitter.com/cybergibbons/status/1388187147560161282">in a tweet</a> that What3Words&#8217; reaction was &#8220;totally unreasonable given the ease with which you can find versions online.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, What3Words chief executive Chris Sheldrick said: &#8220;The specific incident we’ve taken action against stems from an unauthorized version of our software which was offered for distribution. This includes a set of non-trivial, proprietary binary data resources. As stated in our letter, we aren’t requesting that criticism of us or our software is taken offline.”</p>
<p>When reached, a What3Words spokesperson was unable to immediately point to a case where a judicial court has asserted that WhatFreeWords has violated its copyright.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What moves the needle for digital lenders is serving loans to their respective customers. But where does this money come from? <span style="font-weight: 400;">The pool is usually equity or debt. While some lenders use the former, it can be seen as folly because, over time, the founders tend to lose ownership of their businesses after giving out too much equity to raise capital for loans. Hence the reason why most lending companies secure debt facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch has recently reported on two prominent digital lenders (also digital banks in their own rights) gaining steam in Africa &#8212; Carbon and FairMoney</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Carbon <a href="https://ventureburn.com/2019/03/onefi-5m-debt-facility/">secured $5 million</a> in debt financing and the following year, FairMoney <a href="https://orbitt.capital/africa-deal-tracker-june-2020/">did the same</a> but raised a higher sum,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $13 million. </span></p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.lendable.io/">Lendable</a>, the UK-based firm responsible for supplying both lenders with debt finance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company with offices in Nairobi, New York, and Singapore advances loans to fintechs across eight markets in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching in 2014, the company has disbursed over $125 million to these fintechs &#8212; SME lenders, payment platforms, asset lenders, marketplaces, and consumer lenders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a phone conversation with TechCrunch, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-eyob-5a54588">Samuel Eyob</a>, a principal at the firm, said the company is raising almost $180 million to continue its investment efforts across the three continents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to raise more than $180 million and we have investors that have committed cash to us,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Right now, we&#8217;re already investing out of that amount because we&#8217;ve already closed on a bunch of it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the goal is to invest that amount over this year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lendable </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-goldfarb-17211728">Daniel Goldfarb</a> and <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/dylan-fried-024b825b">Dylan Friend</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on an insight that they had while Daniel was a partner at Greenstart, a venture capital firm focused on data, finance and energy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That insight was that the poorest people in the world pay the most for goods and services, so if capital markets could provide a path to ownership, that could help individuals build assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the pair set out to solve this by providing capital to fintechs catering to the needs of these people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eyob, a first-generation American from Ethiopia, knows what a lack of access to fair finance does to people and countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the millions of people and businesses not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> served by banks and MFIs, Eyob joined the team to drive financial inclusion in these markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Over a billion people still lack access to financial services and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">indicate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the financing gap for micro and small businesses is trillions of dollars and growing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is a massive opportunity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, whilst we started in Africa, the lack of access to fair financing solutions is a problem across all emerging markets, which we want to address,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2014, Lendable started as a SaaS platform to democratize access to African capital markets by providing risk and analytics software</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We hoped to do this by bringing the securitization market from the Global North into Africa,&#8221; Eyob added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company built an analytics platform to analyze loans and used machine learning to predict loan portfolio cashflows</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to that, they created an automated investment platform helping ventures to raise nondilutive (not equity) capital to help scale their businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sufficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proving out its tech, the firm made a pivot. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Eyob, the previous model wasn&#8217;t experiencing enough growth and was incurring unsustainable costs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the company began raising capital based on its own analytics in 2016. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had only raised $600,000 and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on East African startups with SME financing and Pay-Go solar home models</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That number has since increased to over $125 million across Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why do these companies actually need debt financing? Here&#8217;s a clearer picture of the instance used at the beginning of this piece.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine a VC-backed startup whose ultimate goal is to help scale up female-founded SMEs with one-year loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The startup could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use its equity to provide the capital for all the one-year loans. The payoff from the loans, after one year, would be the interest due to them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, it could put that capital into hiring developers, build a go-to-market strategy, hire a CTO, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which would likely have payoffs that are up to a 100x </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the interest they would have made on the single SME loan that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is tied</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up for an entire year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, debt would be an ideal source of nondilutive capital for the startup as they wouldn’t have to tie up equity for one year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Therefore, debt would</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be a much cheaper source of capital to scale up their operations, especially if it has scaled up to having tens of thousands of one-year loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If it were equity, they would have to raise an endless amount with constant dilution as they scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its five years of official operations, Lendable has given debt facilities to more than 20 startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the stage at which Lendable gives money differs, it is particular about startups that are post Series A. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from Carbon and FairMoney, some startups to have raised debt from Lendable include Tugende, Uploan, KoinWorks, Planet42, <a href="https://medium.com/lendable/terrapay-raises-usd-20-million-from-lendable-to-further-expand-its-digital-payment-network-7883e131829a">TerraPay</a>, Watu Credit, Trella, <a href="https://medium.com/lendable/amartha-secures-debt-financing-of-up-to-usd-50-million-from-lendable-to-finance-women-led-3973340fd01a">Amartha</a>, Payjoy, Solar Panda, Cars45 and</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/mfs-africa-leads-2-3m-seed-round-in-ugandan-fintech-startup-numida/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MFS Africa</span></a>. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Eyob said, Lendable has reached 1.2 million end borrowers through its partners and helped finance up to 290,000 SMEs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the $125 million disbursed so far as debt, Eyob said the company has a default rate of about 0.01%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason behind this low number, Eyob reckons, is because Lendable ensures to be in constant conversation with the companies offering help, advice or connections when necessary</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We view lending as a partnership and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when both parties act in good faith, there are ways to solve problems,&#8221; Eyob said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debt facilities start at $2 million but can go up to over $15 million, Eyob said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while the global standard at which lenders pay back their debt investments is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 4 to 6 years, Lendable expects the companies it gives cash to do so in 3 to 4 years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eyob pushes that founders in emerging markets should be willing to take more debt financing to scale their startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, startups tend to be high on giving out equity instead of weighing options on effectively using</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> debt in critical points when scaling</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help attract the best talent or expand into new markets. Still, debt proves essential when scaling up capital-intensive operations like working capital or pre-funding activities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More often than not, debt and equity are complementary to one another, and Lendable is hoping to use the new funds it&#8217;s raising to push that notion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like everywhere else in the world, debt and equity are tools that should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support one another, supporting the venture&#8217;s ultimate mission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have lasting relationships with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VC teams across emerging markets that we work with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support one another’s partner investees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following a controversial ban on political discussions earlier this week, Basecamp employees are heading for the exits. The company employs around 60 people, and roughly a third of the company appears to have <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1388212468510380034?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">accepted buyouts</a> to leave, many citing new company policies.</p>
<p>On Monday, <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5">Basecamp CEO Jason Fried anounced in a blog post</a> that employees would no longer be allowed to openly share their &#8220;societal and political discussions&#8221; at work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every discussion remotely related to politics, advocacy or society at large quickly spins away from pleasant,&#8221; Fried wrote. &#8220;You shouldn’t have to wonder if staying out of it means you’re complicit, or wading into it means you’re a target.&#8221;</p>
<p>Basecamp&#8217;s departures are significant. According to<a href="https://twitter.com/fmanjoo/status/1388198102293569541/photo/2"> Twitter posts</a>, Basecamp&#8217;s head of design, head of marketing and head of customer support will all depart. The company&#8217;s iOS team also appears to have quit en masse and many departing employees have been with the company for years.</p>

<p>The no-politics rule at Basecamp follows a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/brian-armstrongs-new-problem-60-plus/">similar stance that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong staked out late last year</a>. Armstrong also denounced debates around &#8220;causes or political candidates&#8221; arguing that such discussions distracted from the company&#8217;s core work. About 60 members of Coinbase&#8217;s 1,200 person staff took buyouts in light of the internal policy change — a ratio that makes the exodus at Basecamp look even more dramatic.</p>
<p>Like Coinbase, Basecamp was immediately criticized for muzzling its employees over important issues, many of which disproportionately impact marginalized employees.</p>
<p>Drawing the line on &#8220;political&#8221; topics becomes murky very quickly for any non-white or LGBTQ employees, for whom many issues that might be seen as political in nature in some circles — the Black Lives Matter movement, for instance — are inextricably and deeply personal. It&#8217;s not a coincidence these grand stands against divisive &#8220;politics&#8221; at work issue down from white male tech executives.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re in doubt as to whether your choice of forum or topic for a discussion is appropriate, please ask before posting,&#8221; <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/basecamp-s-new-etiquette-regarding-societal-politics-at-work-b44bef69">Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson wrote in his own blog post</a>, echoing Fried.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/-what-really-happened-at-basecamp">Platformer</a>, Fried&#8217;s missive didn&#8217;t tell the whole story. Basecamp employees instead said the tension arose from internal conversations about the company itself and its commitment to DEI work, not free-floating arguments about political candidates. Fried&#8217;s blog post does mention one particular source of tension in a roundabout way, referencing an employee-led DEI initiative that would be disbanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;We make project management, team communication, and email software,&#8221; Fried wrote. &#8220;We are not a social impact company.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Many fintech startups have tried to become a market-maker between investors and investment opportunities. However, the challenge with this two-sided market is: How do you get the investors to show up? It’s hard enough to get retail investors, but family offices and other large check writers are even more challenging to lure.</p>
<p>I’ve been meeting lately with an increasing number of family offices interested in investing directly into companies in lieu of via funds. As a result, I’ve started investigating some of the online platforms that enable direct investing. For instance, those focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary investments in private companies</strong>: <a href="http://angel.co/">AngelList</a>, <a href="https://en.home.angelsquare.co/">AngelSquare</a>, <a href="https://www.clearlist.com/">ClearList</a>, <a href="https://www.iangels.com/">iAngels</a>, <a href="https://fundersclub.com/">FundersClub</a>, <a href="https://future.africa/">Future Africa</a>, <a href="http://gust.com">Gust</a>, <a href="https://www.interprivate.com/">Interprivate</a>, <a href="https://istox.com/">iSTOX</a>, <a href="https://letsventure.com/">LetsVenture</a>, <a href="https://www.manhattanstreetcapital.com/">Manhattan Street Capital</a>, MicroVentures, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/nasdaq-private-market">Nasdaq Private Markets</a>, <a href="http://ourcrowd.com/">OurCrowd</a>, <a href="https://www.proteuscapital.us/">Proteus</a>, <a href="http://republic.co/">Republic</a>*, <a href="http://sharenett.com/">Sharenett</a>, <a href="http://seedinvest.com/">SeedInvest</a>, <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/">Seedrs</a>, <a href="https://www.zanbato.com/">Zanbato</a> and <a href="http://trident.co/">Trident</a>.</li>

<p>Tim Friedman, the founder of <a href="https://www.pestack.com/">PE Stack</a>, observes that the interest in direct access to alternatives has been so strong that “platforms like Delio have emerged, which provide technology to allow institutions that already have relationships with buy- and sell-sides to quickly launch robust private investment platforms. Delio built an ESG-focused direct private investment platform for Barclays’ wealth management division, for example.”</p>
<p>Note that I&#8217;m specifically excluding from this analysis firms that help investors access investment funds, for instance: <a href="https://www.caisgroup.com/">CAIS</a>, <a href="https://www.context365.com/">Context365</a>, <a href="https://www.icapitalnetwork.com/">iCapital Network</a>, <a href="http://ourcrowd.com">OurCrowd</a>, <a href="https://www.palico.com/">Palico</a>, <a href="https://www.primealpha.com/">PrimeAlpha</a> and <a href="https://thetrustedinsight.com/">Trusted Insight</a>. Investors there are outsourcing the decision-making about individual investments to the general partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a steady stream of studio acquisitions in late 2019 and early 2020, Facebook has been a little quieter in recent months when its came to bulking up its VR content arm.</p>
<p>Today, the social media giant breaks that stream, announcing their acquisition of <a href="https://www.downpourinteractive.com/">Downpour Interactive</a>, the developer of the popular VR first-person shooter Onward. The title, which is available on the company&#8217;s Rift and Quest platforms, as well as through Valve&#8217;s Steam store, has been among virtual reality&#8217;s top sellers in recent years.</p>
<p>Facebook says that the title will continue to be available on non-Facebook VR hardware going forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting deal, particularly after the company&#8217;s recent attempt to create an ambitious first-person shooter of its own, partnering with Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment and dumping millions into a Medal of Honor VR title that was tepidly received among reviewers after its release this past December.</p>
<p>Facebook didn&#8217;t share terms of the Downpour deal, though they noted that the entire team will be joining Oculus Studios. In a blog post detailing the deal, Mike Verdu, Facebook&#8217;s VP of AR/VR Content, called Onward a &#8220;multiplayer masterpiece.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If there has ever been a golden age for fintech, it surely must be now. As of Q1 2021, the number of fintech startups in the U.S. crossed 10,000 for the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/893954/number-fintech-startups-by-region/#:~:text=As%20of%20February%202021%2C%20there,in%20the%20Asia%20Pacific%20region.">first time ever</a> — well more than double that if you include EMEA and APAC. There are now three fintech companies worth more than $100 billion (Paypal, Square and Shopify) with another three in the $50 billion-$100 billion club (Stripe, Adyen and Coinbase).</p>
<p>Yet, as fintech companies have begun to go public, there has been a fair amount of uncertainty as to how these companies will be valued on the public markets. This is a result of fintechs being relatively new to the IPO scene compared to their consumer internet or enterprise software counterparts. In addition, fintechs employ a wide variety of business models: Some are transactional, others are recurring or have hybrid business models.</p>
<p>In addition, fintechs now have a multitude of options in terms of how they choose to go public. They can take the traditional IPO route, pursue a direct listing or merge with a SPAC. Given the multitude of variables at play, valuing these companies and then predicting public market performance is anything but straightforward.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It is important to note that fintech is a complex category with many different types of players, and not all fintech is created equal.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>The fintech gold rush has arrived</h2>
<p>For much of the past two decades, fintech as a category has been very quiet on the public markets. But that began to change considerably by the mid-2010s. Fintech had clearly arrived by 2015, with both Square and Shopify going public that year. Last year was a record one with eight fintech IPOs, and there has been no slowdown in 2021 — the first four months have already produced seven IPOs. By our estimates, there are more than 15 additional fintech companies that could IPO this year. The current record will almost certainly be shattered well before the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jay-Z&#8217;s <a href="https://www.rocnation.com">Roc Nation</a> announced in 2017 that it was <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7710322/jay-z-roc-nation-arrive-start-up-platform">forming a venture investment arm</a> called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/arrivevc/">Arrive</a>. And the firm has been busy since then — co-founder and president Neil Sirni said Arrive has made 29 investments thus far.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sirni hasn&#8217;t really said much about those investments publicly, or about the broader strategy. So he reached out to me a few months ago, suggesting that he was ready to provide more details about Arrive.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re now three years, 29 investments in and expanding &#8212; so it felt like the right time to start opening up a bit,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the course of a few back-and-forth emails, we discussed how Arrive fits into the larger aims of Roc Nation, how Sirni (a former Goldman Sachs executive) makes investment decisions and where he&#8217;s focusing next. (Spoiler: Southeast Asia is a big part of that answer.)</p>
<p>He was also eager to provide testimonials from Arrive&#8217;s portfolio companies — for example, Outlier.org founder Aaron Rasmussen said that &#8220;when Arrive commits to your mission, they commit,&#8221; while Helm co-founder and CEO Giri Sreenivas said that the firm &#8220;brings something that I don’t see in traditional institutional investors &#8212; legitimate operational expertise around brand and marketing.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can read our email Q&amp;A, lightly edited for length and style, below.</p>
<p><strong>What is Arrive and how does it fit into the larger Roc Nation umbrella?</strong></p>
<p>Arrive is Roc Nation’s venture platform. Roc Nation is a full-service music and sports management, music publishing and entertainment company founded by Jay-Z. Roc Nation and its affiliated companies have built a diversified business that employs several hundred people. These businesses include artist and athlete representation, a portfolio of spirit brands, an apparel line, a philanthropy division that manages four charitable organizations, a content streaming service, a digital team that oversees social media accounts with over 1.4 billion followers, a sales and marketing division that works on countless partnerships with Fortune 500 companies, communications, video production and live event production, among others.</p>
<p>The Roc Nation infrastructure can add value to many different types of businesses across various stages, which is why we created Arrive. For consumer-facing businesses, Arrive leverages the Roc Nation infrastructure to help companies with branding, creative, marketing, communications and other services. For enterprise, we use our broad network of B2B relationships to help with business development.</p>
<p>Being a strategic venture investor on the cap table of a portfolio company is not only about the investment but also how much human capital a fund can deploy to drive long-term, real and unique value for entrepreneurs and their businesses. So, we’re leveraging the broader Roc Nation platform to help portfolio companies and, in turn, receiving access to great entrepreneurs.</p>

<p><strong>What kinds of investments do you normally make — types of companies, size of investment, etc.?</strong></p>
<p>We’re relatively sector and stage agnostic. We have dedicated capital in an early-stage fund that tends to focus on Series A to Series C, but we’ve also started SPV growth and pre-IPO investments as we lay the foundation for a dedicated growth vehicle later this year.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make investment decisions? Is Jay-Z involved in the process?</strong></p>
<p>We gravitate toward companies that we can provide meaningful assistance to but that are outside of Roc Nation’s core industries of music and traditional sports. Thanks to our platform, that is an extremely broad opportunity set. To date, we’ve made 29 investments under the Arrive umbrella in everything from fintech, insurtech, edtech, health &amp; wellness, social and gaming. Geographically, we’re investing roughly 80% in North America, primarily the U.S., and 20% across Southeast Asia, namely, Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam. As a strategic investor, we never lead deals and always co-invest.</p>
<p>Our long-term focus is on driving real and unique value for our portfolio companies. If we remain hyper-focused on this mission, we believe we have the opportunity to build an enduring brand as a top-tier strategic investor.</p>
<p>Jay-Z approves every Arrive opportunity; he, Juan Perez and Desiree Perez are overwhelmingly supportive of Arrive and what we’re collectively trying to accomplish.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your biggest success story so far?</strong></p>
<p>I’m very proud of being co-founder of Arrive and what it took to get here. In the grand scheme of things, we’re just getting started, but I’ve been an entrepreneur — after leaving a large public company — for over 10 years now. It’s been a roller coaster with many sacrifices, but I can understand and relate to our founders and their journey, which makes this experience even more rewarding. The founders of Roc Nation have built their businesses brick by brick as well, so the entire organization is united by this entrepreneurial mindset. I still consider myself a founder and operator first, whose business happens to be making investments.</p>

<p><strong>Given that Arrive has been around for a few years, what made you feel like this is the time to start talking more openly about the fund?</strong></p>
<p>When Arrive launched a few years ago, I hated the idea of talking about what we’re going to do. Instead, we wanted to quietly actually go do it; learn, improve, build and, in the process, demonstrate that we’re not, and never will be, tourists in the venture ecosystem. We’re now three years, 29 investments in and expanding &#8212; so it felt like the right time to start opening up a bit.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s an example of an investment where working with Arrive/Roc Nation led to gains beyond the financial investment?</strong></p>
<p>Arrive functions like many other investors in that we spend time understanding a company’s vision and then try to provide them meaningful levers to pull to help drive their success. Our toolkit is unique thanks to the Roc Nation platform and network. We’ve found that both our portfolio companies and their other investors, typically traditional venture funds, find those levers complementary and additive to the cap table.</p>
<p>Arrive typically works with portfolio companies across three main areas. The first is creative and brand marketing. The second is business development and partnerships. The third is communications.</p>
<p>Communications efforts are generally focused on driving short-term or immediate awareness. Many of our portfolio companies receive broader press coverage when we invest in them. That initial attention typically dies down within a week or two, although those news stories remain as searchable assets that the company might not otherwise have. While this can be of some value, especially for consumer businesses, we believe it’s at the bottom of the list compared to the long-term benefits that can be derived from Roc Nation’s underlying infrastructure in brand marketing and business development.</p>
<p>In terms of creative and brand marketing, we’ve likely saved our earlier-stage portfolio, in aggregate, over a million dollars by providing brand and agency work at no cost. Examples of this include campaign ideation, graphic design, video production, hosting live events and product integrations, among other activities.</p>
<p>For business development and partnerships support, we have leveraged our network to help portfolio companies launch their own internal philanthropic platforms, leveraged our B2B relationships to introduce new partners and customers, brought in other strategic investors in a targeted way, helped companies navigate endorsement deals and recruited non-technical executive talent to join their companies.</p>
<p>We don’t pretend to be a magic bullet, no investor can be, but we’re focused on continuously improving and building on the services that we provide to our portfolio companies. The founder journey is never a straight line and we pride ourselves on being willing to do whatever we can on their behalf. Stephen Francis, SVP at Arrive, and I are accessible to our portfolio companies any day and time.</p>

<p><strong>Do you see these investments as primarily strategic for Roc Nation, or are you focused on financial returns?</strong></p>
<p>‘Strategic’ investor, in the context of Arrive, refers to the strategic value that we bring to the cap table of a portfolio company. We leverage that strategic value to get into deals and form relationships with entrepreneurs in whom we have high conviction. Our ultimate goal is financial return and Arrive’s investments are not meant to be strategic in nature for Roc Nation as an operating company. Instead, an investment from Arrive is meant to be strategic for the portfolio company.</p>
<p><strong>You said you&#8217;re stage agnostic with capital devoted to different stages. Can you say anything more about what the breakdown is in terms of early-stage versus later-growth deals, and how that might change with the new growth fund?</strong></p>
<p>Of our 29 investments, I would classify 25 as early-stage and four as growth. In regards to percentage of capital, the four growth investments account for a little over 35% of total capital deployed. When we do have a dedicated growth fund, I expect the volume of growth investments to pick up to roughly three-six per year.</p>
<p><strong> What are your priorities for 2021?</strong></p>
<p>At a high level our priorities are to build out a larger team to ensure that we’re staying very engaged with the portfolio as we scale and to continue being aggressive in deploying more capital to back great companies.</p>
<p>On a more granular level I’m looking forward to physically getting back to Southeast Asia, namely Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam, on a regular basis. We’re really bullish on the region and believe it’s only a matter of time before more venture funds deploy significant capital there. We started to invest a lot of time there in 2019 as part of our plan to deploy roughly 30% of our early-stage fund in the region. That expansion has been hindered by COVID-19. However, I’ll make quarterly trips once travel normalizes. There is nothing like in-person interaction to build relationships and trust, especially internationally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch recently caught up with recent Y Combinator graduate <a href="https://www.uiflow.com/">Uiflow</a>, a startup that is building a no-code enterprise app creation service.</p>
<p>If you are thinking <em>wait, don&#8217;t a number of companies already do that?</em>, the answer is yes. But what <a href="https://www.quickbase.com/">Quickbase</a>, <a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/">Smartsheet</a> and others are working on isn&#8217;t quite the same thing, at least from the startup&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p>Uiflow, a Bay Area-based concern that has been alive for far less than a year, has built an app creation tool that works with whatever backend a large company currently employs, and helps its development team build apps collaboratively. As the startup explained in <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uiflow-studio">a public posting</a>, customer developers can import Figma files while their engineers can use existing UI libraries, and product managers can quickly vet an app&#8217;s logic.</p>
<p>The service is akin to a &#8220;cross between Unity and Figma,&#8221; Uiflow <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/uiflow">says</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what its own user interface looks like, per a screenshot the company provided to TechCrunch after an interview:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2146281" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-42.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-42.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-42.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-42.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-42.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-42.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-42.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-42.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-42.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Per Y Combinator, the company has closed a pre-seed round of more than $500,000. The company told TechCrunch that it has been talking to investors lately &#8212; as essentially every Y Combinator-backed startup does after their public unveiling &#8212;  but appears to be holding off raising more capital until it fully launches self-service of its product; the company may also accelerate its hiring efforts once its self-serve GTM motion is more broadly available.</p>
<p>The startup told TechCrunch that after its Product Hunt <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uiflow-studio">launch</a> it picked up around 1,200 signups. It&#8217;s vetting the group and letting in some as pilot customers. Those customers currently pay the company, so it has revenue, although the startup is more product-focused at the moment than centered around boosting its short-term revenues.</p>
<p>Uiflow thinks that its target customers are companies with 250 or more workers, the scale at which a company begins to start thinking about its own UI elements. However, Uiflow is talking to companies with 100 to 1,000 customers, it said.</p>
<p>The five-person team is building a service in a market that is more than active at the moment. As TechCrunch has explored, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/">private-market investors are bullish on the no-code space</a>, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic bolstered the pace at which companies large and small moved toward digital solutions. No-code and low-code services came into greater demand as accelerating digital transformation efforts met the market&#8217;s general dearth of available developer talent.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has covered the no-code space <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/creatio-raises-68m-as-the-low-code-space-keeps-attracting-huge-checks/">extensively in recent quarters</a>, given both rising market demand for its products and what seemed to be growing investor demand for shares in startups pursuing the model. All that&#8217;s to say that there&#8217;s a reasonable chance that we&#8217;ll hear from Uiflow soon regarding a fresh capital raise. Let&#8217;s see how long that takes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here&#8217;s a photo of the Uiflow team. In 2021-style, it&#8217;s a Zoom shot:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is known for its pitch-offs. We&#8217;ve had them in cities all over the world, and heard from hundreds of startups who have shared the story of their company on our stages.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to be bringing the pitch-off to Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>Anyone in the audience on an episode of Extra Crunch Live can virtually &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to be selected to pitch in front of the audience and get feedback from our all-star guests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On ECL, pitch-off startups will have two minutes to tell us about their company. This is the equivalent of an elevator pitch — imagine running into a VC or potential customer at a tech conference like Disrupt or bumping into them at a park. As such, no visual aids are allowed, including decks, videos, demoes, etc.</p>
<p>Essentially, what can you convey with your words, in a short time frame, to get people to both understand your startup and be excited about it?</p>
<p>This is a critical skill, and we&#8217;re creating the space for founders to practice and improve.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m amped to have Firstmark&#8217;s Rick Heitzmann and Orchard founder Court Cunningham as guests on Extra Crunch Live on May 5. This founder/investor duo know exactly what it takes to deliver a great pitch. Do you have what it takes? <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-firstmark-capital-and-orchard">You can register here for free!</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eight months after former TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer quit in the midst of a full-court press from the Trump administration against the Chinese-owned social media giant, TikTok finally has a new permanent leader.</p>
<p>ByteDance&#8217;s recently hired CFO Shouzi Chew will be assuming the role as TikTok CEO while still holding the CFO role at its parent organization, the company <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-names-ceo-and-coo">announced</a> Friday morning. It&#8217;s a bold move, likely signaling that the company believes that the worst of its tussles with the U.S. executive branch are over as President Biden has seemed uninterested in picking up former President Trump&#8217;s pet project.</p>
<p>Vanessa Pappas, who was serving as interim CEO, will take the role of COO going forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The leadership team of Shou and Vanessa sets the stage for sustained growth,&#8221; ByteDance CEO Yiming Zhang said in a press release. &#8220;Shou brings deep knowledge of the company and industry, having led a team that was among our earliest investors, and having worked in the technology sector for a decade. He will add depth to the team, focusing on areas including corporate governance and long-term business initiatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prior to joining ByteDance earlier this year, Chew was an executive at Xiaomi, with stints at DST and Goldman Sachs earlier in his career.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Anyone who has played a video game with voice chat in the past decade knows that there is some risk involved. You might be greeted by friendly teammates, but you may also hear some of the most toxic language you&#8217;ve ever heard in your life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en">Riot Games</a>, the game developer behind ultra popular titles like League of Legends and Valorant, is thinking hard about this. And taking action.</p>
<p>The developer is today announcing changes to its privacy notice that allow for it to capture and evaluate voice comms when a report is submitted around disruptive behavior. The changes to the policy are Riot-wide, meaning that all players across all games will need to accept those changes. However, the only game that is scheduled to utilize these new abilities is Valorant, as it is the most voice chat-heavy game from Riot.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The plan here is to store relevant audio data in the account&#8217;s registered region and evaluate it to see if the behavior agreement was violated. This process is triggered by a report being submitted, and is not an always-on system. If a violation has occurred, the data will be made available to the player in violation and will ultimately be deleted once there is no further need for it following reviews. If no violation is detected, the data will be deleted.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, let me just say that this is a big fucking deal. Publishers and developers have long known that toxicity in gaming is not only a terrible user experience, but it&#8217;s actively preventing large swaths of potential gamers from dedicating themselves to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Players are experiencing a lot of pain in voice comms and that pain takes the form of all kinds of different disruption in behavior and it can be pretty harmful,&#8221; said Head of Players Dynamics Weszt Hart. &#8220;We recognize that, and we have made a promise to players that we will do everything that we could in this space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Voice chat often makes games much richer and more fun. Particularly during the pandemic, people are craving more human connection. But in a tense environment like competitive games, that connection can turn sour.</p>
<p>As a gamer myself, I can safely say that some of the most hurtful experiences of my life have been while playing video games with strangers.</p>
<p>To be clear, Riot isn&#8217;t getting specific with how exactly this voice chat moderation will work. The first step is the update to its privacy notice, which gives players a heads up and gives the company the right to start evaluating voice comms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly difficult to police voice comms. Not only do you need to be transparent with users and update any legal documents (which is arguably the easiest step, and the one Riot is taking today), but you must develop the right technology to do this, all while protecting player privacy.</p>
<p>I spoke with Hart and Data Protection Officer and CISO Chris Hymes about the changes. The duo said that the actual system for detecting behavior violations within voice comms is still under development. It may focus on automated voice-to-text transcription, and go through the same system as text chat moderation, or it may rely more heavily on machine learning to actually detect an infringement via voice alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at the technologies and we&#8217;re trying to land on the one that we want to launch with,&#8221; said Hart. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been putting a lot of time and effort into space and we have a pretty good idea of the direction that we&#8217;re going to take. But what we want to do is to have some audio to work with, to better understand if any other approaches that we&#8217;re looking at are going to be the best. To do this, we need to be able to process something real, and not just make a good guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>To get to that answer as quickly as possible, he added, the first step of updating the privacy notice had to go into effect.</p>
<p>Hart and Hymes also said that some layer of human moderation will be involved to ensure that whatever system is being developed is working properly and can ultimately be rolled out to other languages and other titles, as the system is initially being developed for Valorant in North America.</p>

<p>Advances in machine learning and natural language processing are making that development easier than it was 10, or even two, years ago. But even in a world where a machine learning algorithm could accurately detect hate speech, with all its nuances, there is yet another hurdle.</p>
<p>Gamers, even from one title to the next, have their own language. There is a whole lexicon of words and terms used by gamers that aren&#8217;t used in every day life. This adds yet another complication to the process of developing this system.</p>
<p>Still, this is a critical step in ensuring that Riot Games titles, and hopefully other titles as well, become an inclusive environment where anyone who wants to game feels safe and able to do so.</p>
<p>And Riot is careful to understand that developing games is a holistic endeavor. Everything from game design to anti-cheating measures to behavior guidelines and moderation have an effect on the overall experience of the player.</p>
<p>Alongside this announcement, the company is also introducing an update to its terms of service with an updated global refund policy and new language around anti-cheat software for current and future Riot titles.</p>
