										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If that headline sounded judgmental, I apologize.</p>
<p>We just wrapped up a three-day virtual event that included discussions and interviews with some of the most notable people in technology, media, government and venture capital.</p>
<p>Even in person, there’s no way to absorb Disrupt in its entirety.</p>

<p>Normally, I would use this space to spotlight an article we published in the last few days, but our content management system runneth over. Many reporters filed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/events/">stories</a> recapping the interviews and panels they conducted at Disrupt, and there will be more to come in the next few days.</p>
<p>As you review the summaries below, please note that there’s a video at the bottom of every Disrupt story that includes the panel and interview.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading, and congratulations to the entire TechCrunch team for a job very well done!</p>

<p>Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn has appeared at TechCrunch Disrupt before, but this year was his first time representing a public company.</p>
<p>A few months ago, reporter Natasha Mascarenhas described Duolingo’s debut as the “bellwether edtech IPO of the year,” so she was well-equipped with questions about the company’s plans for boosting revenue. For example, is premium content in the cards?</p>
<p>“If we wanted to make more money in the short-term, we could probably start paywalling things, but I think that would stifle our growth,” von Ahn says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“If we start charging for some aspects of language learning, eventually we’re just gonna charge for everything.”</p>
<p>Here’s a recap, along with a video that captures the entire interview.</p>

<p>The amount of plastic pouring into our oceans is set to triple by 2040, and most un-recycled plastic in the world is generated by consumer packaged goods.</p>
<p>As people look to minimize the waste they produce, startups are coming up with novel solutions to help people and companies meet sustainability goals.</p>

<p>Connie Loizos asked Erin Schneider, regional director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s San Francisco office, about crypto lending and the potential for new regulations covering SPAC companies and NFTs, but Schneider was clear from the outset that she was limited in what she could say.</p>
<p>“She did, however, share insight into her personal thinking about a range of these issues, which, given her position, seems very much worth knowing,” writes Connie.</p>

<p>The U.S. healthcare system is a contentious topic, an uncomfortable truth that became evident when Darrell Etherington moderated a conversation with Cityblock Health president and co-founder Toyin Ajayi, Forward CEO and founder Adrian Aoun, and Carbon Health‘s Eren Bali.</p>
<p>“We keep saying that these companies are kind of consumer-centric,” Aoun says.</p>
<p>“But in many ways I think one of the things that you realize is that when you get in bed with the insurance companies, which, whether it’s a Carbon or a Cityblock, at the end of the day, [if] you get in bed with the insurance companies, unfortunately, your incentive is basically not to go build a good consumer product.”</p>
<p>Said Darrell: “Let’s just say this conversation got heated — fast.”</p>

<p>Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck told Senior Editor Devin Coldewey that his own ambition to explore and learn from space goes back to his youth.</p>
<p>“I always felt that, if I could have the opportunity to go out into those stars and explore and perhaps ask or answer, one of the biggest questions in mankind’s history — ‘Are we the only life in the universe or not?’ — I would take that chance,” Beck says.</p>

<p>Where will today’s technologies lead us over the next 20 years, and what will an AI-infused world look like across the globe?</p>
<p>Sinovation founder and AI thought leader Kai-Fu Lee and breakout sci-fi author Chen Qiufan (aka Stanley Chen) make an educated guess in “AI 2041: Ten Visions for Our Future,” a set of stories and essays that explore AI’s potential and pitfalls.</p>
<p>After reading the book, Senior Editor Devin Coldewey talked with Lee and Chen about how the collaboration came about, how their points of view coincided and differed, and why they think the future will be how they describe it.</p>

<p>Peloton CEO John Foley discussed broader safety issues with the category, noting that the unfortunate circumstances behind a recent recall forced the company to take a closer look at product safety, as well as whether the company will maintain its pandemic-boosted growth as cities reopen.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing a lot more people get excited about Peloton and say, ‘I’m not going back to the gym, the gym was a failed model. It was a failed contract between the member and the business, and actually, I didn’t go to the gym. It wasn’t convenient, I didn’t want to go drive somewhere and shower outside my home and take that extra time away from my family,’” the CEO says.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm has spilled much ink about the Toast IPO in recent weeks, but he kept at it Thursday, comparing the debut of the Boston-based software-and-payments company to Remitly’s Wednesday evening flotation.</p>
<p>Seattle-based fintech Remitly, like Toast, priced above its proposed range.</p>
<p>“At $43 per share, Remitly is valued less like a fintech company with gross margins in the 50% to 60% range and more like a middle-tier public SaaS firm, flush with recurring revenues and net-dollar retention north of 100%,” Alex writes.</p>
<p>“The lesson from today’s public markets appears to be that revenue growth matters more than near-term margins for fintech companies, allowing them to secure valuations that far surpass their final private marks.”</p>

<p>“When we first shared LatAm’s digital acceleration story in last year’s Latin America Digital Transformation Report, we believed we were at the peak of digital growth catalyzed by the pandemic,” Julio Vasconcellos, the managing partner of Latin America-focused VC fund Atlantico, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“But with 2021 came all the second- and third-order effects of the crisis, further accelerating a continentwide tech expansion to a pace beyond any projections.”</p>
<p>Vasconcellos breaks down the details from this year’s report. Just one eye-popping stat: Eight new unicorns have already been minted in the region this year, nearly hitting the 2020 rate by midyear.</p>

<p>Design software startup Canva has experienced “staggering growth,” Managing Editor Jordan Crook writes in a recap of her conversation with Canva CEO Melanie Perkins.</p>
<p>With a fresh $200 million and a $40 billion valuation, could Canva utilize acquisitions to continue that explosive growth?</p>
<p>“As a company with huge goals — to empower anyone in the world to design, and as a result of that, to become one of the most valuable companies in the world — anyone who helps Canva ‘leapfrog’ toward those goals is particularly interesting as an acquisition target,” Jordan wrote of her chat with the CEO.</p>

<p>Ingrid Lunden began with a simple question when she sat down with Calendly founder and CEO Tope Awotona: If the product works well, how do you take it to the next level — and frankly, why should you?</p>
<p>Calendly raised $350 million at a $3 billion valuation earlier this year, but little has changed despite the infusion of cash.</p>
<p>“The question I had at the time [of that funding round] was, will the company take it as a distraction and become enamored with the publicity that comes with that? Or will we stay focused and continue to work really hard for our customers and partners and ourselves?” Awotona says.</p>
<p>“Nine months later, it’s very clear that we’ve done the latter. Our culture and values have more or less remained the same.”</p>

<p>Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield and Salesforce COO Bret Taylor discussed their $28 billion merger, how they’re integrating the two companies, and the ongoing competition it faces from Microsoft Teams, which has grown faster than Slack, and which Butterfield once said was “unhealthily obsessed with killing Slack.”</p>
<p>“Over the last year, maybe even 18 months, I think Microsoft’s preoccupation with Slack has shifted somewhat to a preoccupation with killing Zoom, because Teams turns out to not really [be] so much of a direct competitor,” Butterfield says.</p>

<p>In an interview with Security Editor Zack Whittaker, Twitter CISO Rinki Sethi talked about the modern role of a chief information security officer and how the next generation of CISOs can stay ahead.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to be the security idealist and say you need to invest in security before the product or business features, but I think there’s a really strong balance,” Sethi says. “If you think about building security right from the beginning, I think you do have a really strong competitive advantage.”</p>

<p>It took a global pandemic for BioNTech to become a household name: The technology it had been plugging away at meant it “happened to be positioned extremely well to use its mRNA technology to address the novel coronavirus, in part because it already had a partnership in place with Pfizer to develop a flu inoculation.”</p>
<p>BioNTech co-founder and CEO Uğur Şahin spoke with News Editor Darrell Etherington about the company’s start and its “broader vision,” which extends beyond the use of mRNA.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, BioNTech’s mission is to make treatments that are optimized not only to specific patient needs, but also to time and place,” Etherington writes in a recap for Extra Crunch. “All the treatments in the company’s pipeline are about refining the approach to addressing disease, making the process much more like a metaphorical scalpel than a bludgeon.”</p>
<p>“We can develop classical pharmaceuticals like a vaccine [in the case of COVID], but on the other side, also really continue to follow our vision,” Şahin says.</p>

<p>Many celebrities have turned their personal interests into thriving commercial concerns: Ryan Reynolds owns Aviation Gin, Jessica Alba founded nontoxic goods startup The Honest Company, and George Clooney will earn as much as $1 billion for selling his tequila company.</p>
<p>This year, actor Seth Rogen co-founded Houseplant, which sells pottery, cannabis and related accessories.</p>
<p>“We’ve sold house goods in all 50 states at this point,” Rogen explained. “That’s us, developing a relationship and trust with customers in places where weed is not legal yet.”</p>
<p>In a conversation with Managing Editor Matt Burns, Rogen, CEO Mike Mohr and chief commercial officer Haneen Davies discussed some of the challenges of brand-building within the confines of a strict regulatory environment.</p>
<p>“I think the merger of house and plant is what’s going to help us establish a brand name that goes beyond the limiting restrictions you have to abide by to communicate cannabis,” Davies says.</p>

<p>No one roots for a global pandemic, but WarnerMedia launched HBO Max just as cities and states across the U.S. restricted in-person gatherings as COVID-19 spread.</p>
<p>In many ways, the service seemed well-positioned, even in a crowded sector. HBO Max brought decades of critically acclaimed series, coupled with pricey acquisitions like the “Friends” and “South Park” back catalogs.</p>
<p>COO Andy Forssell joined TechCrunch Disrupt to discuss the fascinating 17.5 months of the service’s life so far:</p>
<p>“The early impacts were all negative, though, I think we, along with everyone in the industry, learned to roll with them,” he says. “Everybody had to work from home. That was tough, though I think we made the transition better than everyone thought. We were at launch mode at that point.”</p>

<p>Most people know Ryan Reynolds from his movies, but he also owns a majority stake in Mint Mobile, a mobile virtual network operator, which has grown more than 50,000% in the past three years. And he also invested in Aviation Gin before selling it for a staggering $600 million last year.</p>
<p>He’s also a founder of Maximum Effort, the marketing firm that promotes the “Deadpool” franchise, Aviation Gin, Mint Mobile, and that viral Match.com ad featuring Satan and the year 2020 as a match made in hell.</p>
<p>He spoke to Jordan Crook about how startups can adapt his concept of “fast-vertising” to use real-time cultural moments as a springboard for building their own brand buzz, among other things.</p>
<p>“When we lead with creative and we have an idea or are inspired by something, we get quite aggressive with our excitement and try to make something infectious around it,” Reynolds says.</p>

<p>Since first announcing it was planting a stake in the ground in the region in early 2019, SoftBank has plugged more than $5 billion into Latin America and expects that number to top $8 billion by year’s end.</p>
<p>Its capital contributions are meaningful. In 2019, startups across Latin America raised $5.3 billion in funding, according to CB Insights. In 2020, they raised roughly the same amount.</p>
<p>This year, the pace of dealmaking has shifted into overdrive, with $9.3 billion being invested in Latin American startups in the first six months of the year. SoftBank Group CEO Marcelo Claure believes that by 2023, close to $30 billion will be invested in the region annually.</p>
<p>“Finally, the world has realized that Latin America has size,” Claure, a native of Bolivia, said this week at TechCrunch Disrupt.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim have spent a lot of time unpacking this year’s staggering venture capital numbers, but they ended the week with a look at the value of startups eschewing VC.</p>
<p>“After all, not all successful startups are in a good position to IPO, and we are facing an IPO traffic jam that even SPACs are failing to solve,” they write.</p>
<p>“But funded unicorns can’t escape it: They need to provide liquidity to their investors, and it’s too late for them to pursue a different route. Their bootstrapped counterparts, in contrast, have options.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to gender equality in the business world, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1191968-but-knowing-that-things-could-be-worse-should-not-stop">hit the nail on the head</a>: “Knowing that things could be worse should not stop us from trying to make them better.”</p>
<p>While access to opportunities, funding and support has improved for women in the startup space over the last couple of decades, there is still a long way to go. In fact, women early-stage entrepreneurs receive an average of<a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet"> $1 million</a> less in funding than men do, despite performing better on average. Leaders across the board openly advocate for female-founded businesses receiving more venture capital and entrepreneurship support, but few are taking decisive actions to close this glaring gender gap.</p>
<p>The problem lies not in the fact that women don’t want to build million-dollar businesses, but in the disconnect between our dreams and the industry support we receive — or lack thereof. As the world embraces a new way of working and strategizes for a post-pandemic world, it’s vital to investigate new ways of supporting women’s entrepreneurship. Here are the key questions that we need to ask — and how we can go about resolving them.</p>
<h2>What are the systemic difficulties that women face today?</h2>
<p>Few business leaders will openly state that they have little interest in a more gender-equal world. However, the gap between intention and outcome illustrates that nowhere near enough decisive action has been taken to make this the case.</p>
<p>Women founders face obstacles across the board. Even in my industry of environmentally and socially conscious brands, women leaders are worse off than their male counterparts: <a href="https://veganwomensummit.com/founder-survey">This 2020 Vegan Women Summit founder survey</a> found that 45% of respondents have faced bias while fundraising and 75% say they have dealt with gender bias specifically. Women have historically been <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/male-and-female-entrepreneurs-get-asked-different-questions-by-vcs-and-it-affects-how-much-funding-they-get">asked different questions by VCs</a> than their male counterparts, and, as a result, are seen as less ambitious and less focused on potential gains.</p>
<p>Even before decision-makers have met women job applicants, their subconscious bias is already coming into play. In <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/03/research-to-reduce-gender-bias-anonymize-job-applications">this study</a>, acceptance rates of women candidates rose from 18% to 30% by obscuring the gender in the application.</p>
<p>Women working in technology often face assumptions and questions about their family life, marital status and children, which leaders and VCs may consider to be obstacles to their progress within a company or a limit to their potential as a founder.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Combating these inequities requires a concerted effort from VCs and company leaders to invite more women into decision-making positions.</p>
<p>One way to do this would be to apply for <a href="https://bcorporation.net/">B Corporation certification</a>, making it essential for the company to work toward reducing inequality in its workforce. Another would be to introduce diversity quotas for women in leadership positions — an approach that has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-29/california-diversity-law-shows-quotas-work?sref=VLsP8x9g">seen success</a> since its legal implementation in California.</p>
<h2>How can we better support women to grow their companies?</h2>
<p>Women are consistently losing out when it comes to accelerator backing and VC support. In Chile, where I founded my company, 77% of women entrepreneurs use their own savings as financing, while only <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6817977057054642176/">14%</a> have obtained co-financing from state or private programs.</p>
<p>In my experience, while many groups attempt to improve the inclusion and representation of women, the majority of them fail to move beyond conversation and superficial resolutions.</p>
<p>For example, a commonly cited solution for more women founders in tech is to encourage more women to study STEM subjects. This is a start, but it seems that the issue requires more than simply adding women to the funnel. Instead, we need to better understand what’s holding women back from growing their businesses to their full potential.</p>
<p>Women lose out time and time again when it comes to startup funding. We need to better support women through the entire startup lifecycle, from seed to IPO, especially when it comes to raising external capital.</p>
<p>One initiative that’s doing important work in this area is Start-Up Chile’s <a href="https://www.startupchile.org/attention-female-entrepreneurs-start-up-chile-is-opening-the-application-process-for-the-s-factory/">The S Factory</a>, a pre-acceleration program specifically for female entrepreneurs that provides selected startups with mentoring, pitch training and workshops, along with a cash injection of $15,000. These types of initiatives should be expanded from seed to provide support for Series A, B and C rounds through IPO.</p>
<p>Given that women often <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90277129/the-hidden-networking-gap-between-men-and-women">lack access</a> to the same networking and mentoring opportunities that men are privy to in the tech world, organizations like <a href="https://thenextwomen.com/">TheNextWomen</a>, a global network of women-founded companies and female investors, are essential. TheNextWomen helps female founders benefit from a community of like-minded entrepreneurs and investors through knowledge-driven programs and inspirational events. <a href="https://womentechfounders.com/">Women Tech Founders</a> also champions the value of female-only networks, aiming to connect, inspire and advance women in tech through events and online resources.</p>
<p>These communities can be fundamental for women entrepreneurs and other women tech leaders seeking to build a support system around them and gain the skills necessary to grow their businesses.</p>
<h2>How do we fix funding?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethedwards/2021/02/24/check-your-stats-the-lack-of-diversity-in-venture-capital-is-worse-than-it-looks/?sh=2a2411db185d">lack of diversity</a> at VC funds is stark and remains an overwhelmingly contributing factor to the disproportionately <a href="https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/Q1_2020_PitchBook_NVCA_Venture_Monitor.pdf">low amount of VC funding</a> that women receive — a number that is <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vc-funding-female-founders-drops-low">not improving</a>. In fact, in the U.S., only <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/jh572x5wd4r0/7qRourAWPj0U9R7MN5nWgy/711a6d8344bcd4fbe0f1a6dcf766a3c0/WVC_Report_-_The_Untapped_Potential_of_Women-Led_Funds.pdf">4.9%</a> of VC partners are female, and in Europe, the picture isn’t much better: <a href="https://www.diversity.vc/diversity-in-vc-report/">83%</a> of U.K. firms have no women on their investment committees. It’s no surprise then that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/34bdff48-f6cb-11e8-af46-2022a0b02a6c">93%</a> of tech investment in Europe goes to companies with no female founders.</p>
<p>To fix funding, we need investors with a gender-neutral lens, evidenced by metrics that measure their progress on diversity and inclusion. On average, startups founded or co-founded by women generate 10% more in cumulative revenue over five years — yet they receive <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet">less than half</a> the average investment of men. These statistics will be key in demonstrating that investing in women is not taking a risk — in fact, it’s quite the opposite.</p>
<p>What’s more, female-focused investors are emerging as a way to lift women-founded companies and level the playing field. For example, the Female Founders Fund <a href="https://www.inc.com/christine-lagorio-chafkin/female-founders-fund-anu-duggal-melinda-french-gates.html">recently closed its third fund valued at $57 million</a>, making it the biggest seed fund for women in the world.</p>
<p>In Asia, many investors are also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-12/wealthy-families-lead-charge-into-gender-lens-investing-in-asia?srnd=premium-asia">seeing the value in backing women-led companies</a> — and reaping the rewards. Over 90% of SoGal Ventures’ portfolio companies have female co-founders, and the fund has generated an internal rate of return of over 80% over the last four years. Initiatives like these can help level the playing field for women and provide them with the opportunities to fulfill their potential.</p>
<p>When it comes to fixing the gender divide in the startup world, there’s no silver bullet. Closing the gap requires a concerted effort from all sides of the industry, from founders to investors.</p>
<p>Only by leaving behind inclusivity lip service and taking decisive actions to bring women into funds and encourage them as founders will we start to achieve gender equity in the startup world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to online calendars and calendar apps, services like Google Calendar and Outlook from Microsoft rule the roost with hundreds of millions of users globally. Now another company is hoping to ruffle some feathers with its own move into the space. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Yahoo is working on called <a href="https://day.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Day</a>, a new standalone calendar app. Sources tell us the company has recruited Jeremy Le Van &#8212; who had co-founded another calendaring app, Sunrise, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/04/microsoft-sunrise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually sold it to Microsoft for over $100 million</a> to make it the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/13/microsoft-updates-outlook-for-ios-with-sunrise-inspired-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backbone</a> of Microsoft&#8217;s own very popular calendar platform in Outlook &#8212; to help design it.</p>
<p>Many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/31/sunrise-was-the-best-calendar-app-ever-and-now-i-feel-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lamented</a> the sunset of Sunrise; now it looks like they might now have a shot at getting Sunrise 2.0, so to speak.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: Yahoo happens to be owned by the same company as TechCrunch.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We are exploring different ways to better serve consumers and that includes new ideas around mobile-first time management, calendar and events,&#8221; a Yahoo spokesperson said in response to our question.</p>
<p>The service is currently in an invite-only closed alpha as it gears up for a bigger launch (you can also sign up on the site).</p>
<p>Calendars serve as the backbone for how many of us organize our days, whether it&#8217;s for work or leisure. And arguably, the more our activities, and the planning of them, move to digital platforms, the more powerful calendars can become, too.</p>
<p>This means that for platforms, having a calendar feature or app as part of a bigger service is a good way of keeping users engaged on the wider platform, and it&#8217;s a way for the platform to glean more knowledge about user behavior. Google&#8217;s Calendar, for example, is very tightly, and often automatically, integrated with its wider suite of productivity and information services, giving the company one more spoke in its wheel to keep users sticking around.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And it&#8217;s not only Yahoo that might be interested in doing more here. Facebook <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/7/26/17615946/facebook-acquisition-redkix-workplace-email-messaging-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired Redkix</a> in 2018 allegedly to bring more calendar and other productivity tools to Workplace. In the end, Workplace integrates with existing offerings from third parties, and so it doesn&#8217;t have its own standalone calendar app. Facebook also doesn&#8217;t have a standalone calendar feature in the main consumer app, either. But with people planning so much else on Facebook&#8217;s properties (not just through Events on Facebook, but across Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger), it seems that it&#8217;s an area it could feasibly still expand into at some point.</p>
<p>Yahoo itself, in fact, already has a pared-down <a href="https://calendar.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9sb2dpbi55YWhvby5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHE7T5C_0tisZ4OSdCAyCAuBBAuyLNRCM8lQlhSuyRFcsFDxqxcIdIWMTwepdDz9_A_FfWV8L7gkyCPeRrY8RygnEcR2I_eTprXTijTRGkPLlNmrw1TZX-KFjSki8vL8DJb8FsAChWqmDOU9Zx0h6sfYQwcawPwSGpEXMdmFmTzR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calendar widget</a> that you can access through Yahoo Mail. It&#8217;s not clear how popular it is, especially since it&#8217;s very easy these days to integrate one&#8217;s email to most other calendar apps.</p>
<p>The question, then, will be how Day might hope to differentiate itself, and how it will hope to compete.</p>
<p>From what we understand, in contrast to how Google, Microsoft or even Yahoo itself currently integrate calendar features into their wider productivity suites, this isn&#8217;t the approach that Yahoo is taking with Day.</p>
<p>The app is being built by people in its Mail team, but it&#8217;s being treated &#8220;like a startup&#8221; in the operation, we&#8217;ve heard, and has been given license to develop it independently: it has no special Yahoo branding, nor with any Yahoo integrations whatsoever. The plan is to keep it separate, not unlike the many calendar apps &#8212; like Sunrise once was &#8212; that exist in app stores, and make it something that can integrate with whatever other email or other tools that a person users. Over time there also may be efforts to use Mail &#8212; which still has around 200 million users &#8212; to help market Day.</p>
<p>The move underscores how Yahoo &#8212; which has effectively lost out to Google in areas like search, email, video and advertising &#8212; believes that with the right approach, there is still room for more innovation in this crowded market, even as it has a number of misses in its history of trying to do just that in other areas, <a href="https://www.uctoday.com/collaboration/rip-yahoo-together-chat-tool-gone-for-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like messaging</a>.</p>
<p>But as we noted in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/how-calendly-is-building-a-platform-by-turning-scheduling-into-a-center-stage-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent story about Calendly</a> &#8212; a $3 billion startup that&#8217;s proven to be a big hit with people who need to schedule meetings &#8212; calendar apps can be challenging for another reason. They are well-used, yes, but also somewhat under the radar: calendars are never the destination for a person, just a place to mark when, how, and with whom you will get there. Can there be more ways of enhancing that basic functionality?</p>
<p>Yahoo seems to believe there are, and that people will want to use an app that does so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year has been one of the busiest yet in terms of new commercial launch companies coming online, with companies like Astra and Firefly Aerospace actually getting rockets up and running (if not flying as designed quite yet), and with landmark human spaceflight missions from Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic and SpaceX. And with more constellations in operation, built out of satellites equipped with sensors capable of providing new and more detailed data for commercial use back on Earth, the timing is right for startups everywhere to leverage a new data Gold Rush to build businesses based on in-space resources that just weren’t available before.</p>
<p>Joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a> happening December 14-15 is <strong>Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners</strong>, who focuses largely on frontier technology and specifically on the commercialization of space, drones, autonomous vehicles and the future of agriculture and food technology.</p>
<p>Hatch brings a lot of expertise to the table. She studied aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan before earning her Master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics engineering from Stanford. She then continued on to Boeing, then SpaceX, where she worked with the government on integrating its payloads with the Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to hear from her at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a>. Grab your tickets to join us and save $100!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FCC has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-commits-over-12b-first-emergency-connectivity-funding-wave">sent out the first checks from its Emergency Connectivity Fund</a>, an effort to help close the &#8220;homework gap&#8221; at schools by covering the cost of computers and internet services. Thousands of school districts, in every state plus D.C., Guam and Puerto Rico, will split this first $1.2 billion distribution, and there&#8217;s still <em>lots</em> more to come.</p>
<p>The problem they are looking to mitigate is the large number of students who, in an age when studying, homework and now even classes are all done online, lack a device or adequate internet connection to participate. This exacerbates an existing inequality, for these students often lack access to other resources and end up falling behind through no fault of their own.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/fcc-begins-rollout-of-10b-in-connectivity-aid-through-emergency-funds/">The ECF was conceived to combat this</a>, and funded earlier this year as part of the big pandemic recovery bill. It&#8217;s a $7 billion program in total, but the money is being distributed over time as schools and libraries make their formal requests, saying they need to cover the cost of this many tablets, or wireless hotspots, or broadband connections. The FCC seems to be picking up the bill as long as the request is reasonable and the paperwork is in order.</p>
<p>&#8220;From small rural libraries like the Sesser Public Library in Sesser, Illinois, to large school districts like Baltimore City Public Schools, this first wave of funding will provide more than 3 million connected devices for remote learning and will make a major dent in closing one of the cruelest parts of the digital divide,&#8221; said acting FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel in the news release.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kXRbnq4PAw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/fcc-begins-rollout-of-10b-in-connectivity-aid-through-emergency-funds/">FCC begins rollout of $10B in connectivity aid through emergency funds</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;FCC begins rollout of $10B in connectivity aid through emergency funds&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/fcc-begins-rollout-of-10b-in-connectivity-aid-through-emergency-funds/embed/#?secret=kXRbnq4PAw" data-secret="kXRbnq4PAw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not evenly divided, but distributed according to the applications received. The biggest state recipient is New York with $243 million ($192 million of which goes to NYC), followed by Texas with $97 million, and California with $71 million. Several states got far less (Wyoming and South Dakota took in less than $100,000 each), but this could very easily be a question of those districts just choosing to get their paperwork in for the second fund disbursement.</p>
<p>To that end, September 28 marks a new application period, for equipment and services used from this last July to next June — though the FCC noted it is still processing applications from the first batch, so if your district hasn&#8217;t heard back on that, don&#8217;t worry. And if they haven&#8217;t applied yet, best get started!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can check out the full recipient list, broken down by district and amount, in the spreadsheet linked <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-commits-over-12b-first-emergency-connectivity-funding-wave">here</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Starting in 2030, California will require all light-duty autonomous vehicles that operate in the state to emit zero emissions. Signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/09/23/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-9-23-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>SB 500</ins></a> represents the latest effort by the state to limit the sale of new internal combustion vehicles with an eye towards reducing greenhouse emissions. In 2020, Newsom signed an executive order that effectively <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gaspowered-cars-by-2035-180313529.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><ins>banned the sale of new gasoline and diesel-powered</ins></a> vehicles by 2035. That same year, the state’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-push-for-zeroemissions-heavy-trucks-032143253.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><ins>Air Resources Board</ins></a> mandated that all new trucks sold in California emit zero emissions by 2045.</p>
<p>“We’re grateful for California’s leadership in ensuring this will be the industry standard,” said Prashanthi Raman, head of global government affairs at Cruise, in a statement to Engadget. “The AV industry is primed to lead the way in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in cities, and it’s why we’ve operated an all-electric, zero-emissions fleet from the start.” Cruise backed SB 500 through its involvement with the <a href="https://www.emissionzero.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><ins>Emission Zero Coalition</ins></a>, a group that also includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nuro-california-dmv-deployment-permit-214528906.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><ins>autonomous delivery startup Nuro</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1"><ins>Environmental Protection Agency</ins></a>, the transportation sector has been the single largest source of greenhouse emissions in the US since 2019, with light-duty vehicles accounting for more than half of that output. However, autonomous cars currently represent only a tiny fraction of the nearly 15 million vehicles on California roads. Moreover, both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-cruise-california-passengers-fully-driverless-rides-161005084.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1"><ins>Cruise</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-san-francisco-trusted-tester-170602490.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1"><ins>Waymo</ins></a>, two of the most prominent companies testing fully autonomous taxi services in the state, utilize fleets made almost exclusively of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-gm-ev-only-assembly-plant-detroit.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="30" data-v9y="1"><ins>electric</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-19-google-waymo-chrysler-self-driving-minivan.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="31" data-v9y="1"><ins>hybrid</ins></a> vehicles. This latest move from California then is about preventing autonomous vehicles from becoming major polluters in the future, particularly if driverless taxi services become popular among commuters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Is it just us or has everyone’s calendar hit warp factor 9? We can’t believe there are only 34 days left before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=1weeklefttosave&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weeklefttosave&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> kicks into high gear on October 27. If you don’t have your pass yet, the clock on early-bird savings is winding down fast. Time to bump that quick task to the top of your to-do list, folks.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=1weeklefttosave&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weeklefttosave&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your early-bird pass</a> to TC Sessions SaaS 2021 — and save yourself $100 — before the price <strong>expires on October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Prepare for a full day focused on SaaS and its rapidly expanding ecosystem. We’re talking emerging trends, tips and advice that you can implement in your own startup — now, when you need it most — and world-class networking opportunities.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">the event agenda</a> and start strategizing your day. We’re still adding more presentations, breakouts and interviews with the industry’s top minds, makers and investors. Stay current — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#333d7903-8740-45ee-a389-8e0332035e57">sign up for updates here</a>.</p>
<p>Data is the lifeblood of, well, just about everything but especially SaaS. You’ll find plenty of discussions on how to use, wrangle and share an exponential deluge of information — without getting mired. Take a peek at these three data-driven panels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data, Data Everywhere:</strong> As companies struggle to manage and share increasingly large amounts of data, it’s no wonder that Databricks, whose primary product is a data lake, was valued at a whopping $28 billion for its most recent funding round. We’re going to talk to CEO Ali Ghodsi about why his startup is so hot and what comes next.</li>
<li><strong>Data Warehouse — The Foundation of the Modern Data Stack:</strong> The modern data stack is changing rapidly, with new technology emerging every day. Increasingly, though, architectures are being built around the data warehouse. In this panel discussion, Chandra Gangireddy (Allbirds), Ben Gotfredson (Snowflake), Adam Gross (formerly of Heroku) and Soumyadeb Mitra (RudderStack) will discuss why this new architecture has emerged, what specific technologies are driving the trend and what the data stack of the future looks like.</li>
<li><strong>How Startups are Turning Data into Software Gold:</strong> The era of big data is behind us. Today’s leading SaaS startups are working with data, instead of merely fighting to help customers collect information. We’ll talk with leaders from three data-focused startups: Jenn Knight (AgentSync), Barr Moses (Monte Carlo) and Dan Wright (DataRobot). They’ll discuss how they’re forging new markets to get insight on the way today’s SaaS companies leverage data to build new companies, attack new problems and, of course, scale like mad.</li>

It may have a significantly longer flight time along with not just one, but two cameras, including a telephoto model and one with a larger Four Thirds sensor. If accurate, the Mavic 3 would be highly desirable for cinematographers and aerial photographers when it arrives, reportedly later this year.</p>

<div><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A Four Thirds sensor would be a huge boon for aerial shooters, allowing for extra detail and a more cinematic look in general. Currently, shooting in that format requires a large, relatively expensive drone and in many cases, a separate camera like DJI&#8217;s </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1186060-REG/dji_x5l_camera_and_3_axis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="35" data-v9y="1">Zenmuse</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> line or </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-mirrorless-camera-lumix-bgh1-163525921.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="36" data-v9y="1">Panasonic&#8217;s BGH1</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. At the same time, a second telephoto camera would make it more versatile.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It will also offer direct USB-C charging so you don&#8217;t need to remove the battery. All of that will boost the weight a bit, up from 907g on the Mavic 2 Pro to 920g for the Mavic 3 Pro. Despite that bump from the extra camera and other new features, the Mavic 3 will be able to fly for 46 minutes, way up from the 31 minutes available on the Mavic 2.</p>
<p>The Mavic 3 will apparently come in two flavors, a Pro and a Cine model, with the latter offering a built-in SSD and a &#8220;1Gbps Lightspeed Data Cable&#8221; option for faster transfers. It will also offer a new version of DJI&#8217;s display-equipped Smart Controller allowing for video transmission over 15km, up from 10km on the Mavic 2 Pro.</p>
<p>The Mavic 3 Pro will cost $1,600, both sources say, which is the same price as the current Mavic 2 Pro. Prices for the Cine model are less clear, but could run around $1,000 more — still a relative deal for such a high tech camera drone. Both are expected to arrive on November 15th.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">boom in venture capital fundraising</a> that the technology startup market has enjoyed since the back half of 2020 has been eye-popping. Record sums have been disbursed around the world as more firms entered the fray to invest in startups, and the late-stage capital flowed like water.</p>
<p>But while the venture capital game seemed to turbocharge in recent quarters, there’s noise coming from the other side of the spectrum: bootstrapping.</p>

<hr />
<p>Mailchimp’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/">$12 billion exit to Intuit</a>, announced mere weeks ago, helped set a high-water mark for bootstrapping, proving that it is possible to build large, valuable technology companies both without huge venture capital investment and in locations outside traditional startup hubs. Mailchimp, based in Atlanta, is just one of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/atlantas-sundry-startups-join-in-global-vc-funding-boom/">host of startup companies building in the city</a>, The Exchange recently reported.</p>
<p>Today’s startups have more fundraising options than ever, providing a number of pathways to scale. These include services like Pipe, which allows startups to sell future revenues in a competitive marketplace, and the myriad venture-debt players that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/as-venture-capital-rebounds-whats-going-on-with-venture-debt/">TechCrunch has covered extensively</a>.</p>
<p>For startups busy funding their growth with revenue, there’s even more good news. Earlier this year, Calendly, another Atlanta-based company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">raised its first material external capital</a> &#8212; at a valuation of just over $3 billion, showing that bootstrapping early doesn’t mean that equity capital sources are closed forever. A number of other companies have followed suit in recent months.</p>
<p>We’re curious if a changing capital landscape, and a startup market made more viable for bootstrapping thanks to business concepts like product-led growth, will shake up the demographics of startup founders, perhaps making their ranks a bit more diverse. Let’s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping today</h2>
<p>Go back in time to the dot-com boom, and it was normal for startups to spend early capital on physical hardware. Servers weren’t something you could just call up Amazon and rent by the minute, which meant buying your own and paying co-location fees. That took capital.</p>
<p>And, as has been discussed ad nauseam, it was harder to build digital companies a few decades back. There weren’t infinite APIs for companies to hook into to solve complex technical issues, and there were both fewer folks trained to build new tools and fewer potential customers.</p>
<p>In today’s startup market, much technical risk has been settled, often lowering building costs for startups at the same time. The well-worn riff that it’s easier than ever to start a company today could be wed to the concept that it’s perhaps cheaper, too. That should bode well for bootstrapping.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union has warned it may take action over Russia&#8217;s involvement in &#8220;malicious cyber activities&#8221; against several EU member states.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Ghostwriter&#8221; campaign targeted “numerous members of Parliaments, government officials, politicians, and members of the press and civil society in the EU”, according to <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/09/24/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-on-respect-for-the-eu-s-democratic-processes/">a press release from the European Council</a> on Friday, and was carried out &#8220;by accessing computer systems and personal accounts and stealing data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement by the European executive, comprised of the bloc&#8217;s heads of state, said the EU was considering &#8220;taking further steps,&#8221; but did not elaborate what actions it would take.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s declaration is about strongly denouncing malicious cyber activities, designated as Ghostwriter that some member states have observed and associated with the Russian state,&#8221; Nabila Massrali, a spokesperson for the European Council, told TechCrunch. &#8220;These activities are unacceptable and all involved must put them to an end immediately. Such activities seek to threaten our integrity and security, democratic values and principles and attempt to undermine our democratic institutions and processes. We urge the Russian Federation to adhere to the norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace.&#8221;</p>
<p>No specific incidents were mentioned in the press release. But the spokesperson added that the warning comes in light of the upcoming German elections on September 26.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Germany said the Russia-linked Ghostwriter campaign had been “combining conventional cyberattacks with disinformation and influence operations” in an attempt to spread disinformation before the upcoming election. At the time, the German government said it had &#8220;reliable information&#8221; that recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cyberattacks/">cyberattacks</a> — which involved hackers use <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a> emails in an attempt to get hold of personal login details of federal and state lawmakers — could be attributed to actors in Russia, &#8220;specifically to the Russian military intelligence service GRU.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ghostwriter has been ongoing since 2017, according to a 2020 report by FireEye, and has been involved in anti-NATO disinformation campaigns, cyber espionage and politically damaging hack-and-leak operations throughout Europe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a follow-up report released in April this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fireeye/">FireEye</a> linked the Ghostwriter campaign to UNC1151, a threat actor that is believed to be backed by the Kremlin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Since, Prevailion, a cybersecurity startup that specializes in compromise breach monitoring and cyber adversary intelligence, found that the infrastructure associated with UNC1151 is three-times larger than was was previously documented, and its malicious cyber activities are broader and more aggressive than was originally suspected.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Karim Hijazi, chief executive of Prevailion, said earlier this month that UNC1151 is &#8220;positioned for a much wider operation, both in Europe and potentially beyond.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As developers unlock new AI tools, the risk for perpetuating harmful biases becomes increasingly high — especially on the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/ai-is-struggling-to-adjust-to-2020/">year like 2020</a>, which reimagined many of our social and cultural norms upon which AI algorithms have long been trained.</p>
<p>A handful of foundational models are emerging that rely upon a magnitude of training data that makes them inherently powerful, but it’s not without risk of harmful biases — and we need to collectively acknowledge that fact.</p>
<p>Recognition in itself is easy. Understanding is much harder, as is mitigation against future risks. Which is to say that we must first take steps to ensure that we understand the roots of these biases in an effort to better understand the risks involved with developing AI models.</p>
<h2>The sneaky origins of bias</h2>
<p>Today’s AI models are often pre-trained and open source, which allows researchers and companies alike to implement AI quickly and tailor it to their specific needs.</p>
<p>While this approach makes AI more commercially available, there’s a real downside — namely, that a handful of models now underpin the majority of AI applications across industries and continents. These systems are burdened by undetected or unknown biases, meaning developers who adapt them for their applications are working from a fragile foundation.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf">study</a> by Stanford’s Center for Research on Foundation Models, any biases within these foundational models or the data upon which they’re built are inherited by those using them, creating potential for amplification.</p>
<p>For example, YFCC100M is a publicly available data set from Flickr that is commonly used to train models. When you examine the images of people within this data set, you’ll see that the distribution of images around the world is <a href="http://projects.dfki.uni-kl.de/yfcc100m/browse?q=person&amp;adj=&amp;m=b">heavily skewed toward the U.S.</a>, meaning there’s a lack of representation of people from other regions and cultures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These types of skews in training data result in AI models that have under- or overrepresentation biases in their output — i.e., an output that is more dominant for white or Western cultures. When multiple data sets are combined to create large sets of training data, there is a lack of transparency, and it can become increasingly difficult to know if you have a balanced mix of people, regions and cultures. It’s no surprise that the resulting AI models are published with egregious biases contained therein.</p>
<p>Further, when foundational AI models are published, there is typically little to no information provided around their limitations. Uncovering potential issues is left to the end user to test — a step that is often overlooked. Without transparency and a complete understanding of a particular data set, it’s challenging to detect the limitations of an AI model, such as lower performance for women, children or developing nations.</p>
<p>At Getty Images, we evaluate whether bias is present in our computer vision models with a series of tests that include images of real, lived experiences, including people with varying levels of abilities, gender fluidity and health conditions. While we can’t catch all biases, we recognize the importance of visualizing an inclusive world and feel it’s important to understand the ones that may exist and confront them when we can.</p>
<h2>Leveraging metadata to mitigate biases</h2>
<p>So, how do we do this? When working with AI at Getty Images, we start by reviewing the breakdown of people across a training data set, including age, gender and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we’re able to do this because we require a model release for the creative content that we license. This allows us to include self-identified information in our metadata (i.e., a set of data that describes other data), which enables our AI team to automatically search across millions of images and quickly identify skews in the data. Open source data sets are often limited by a lack of metadata, a problem that is exacerbated when combining data sets from multiple sources to create a larger pool.</p>
<p>But let’s be realistic: Not all AI teams have access to expansive metadata, and ours isn’t perfect either. An inherent tradeoff exists &#8212; larger training data that leads to more powerful models at the expense of understanding skews and biases in that data.</p>
<p>As an AI industry, it’s crucial that we find a way to overcome this tradeoff given that industries and people globally depend upon it. The key is increasing our focus on data-centric AI models, <a href="https://eval.how/dcai2021/index.html">a movement beginning to take stronger hold</a>.</p>
<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>Confronting biases in AI is no small feat and will take collaboration across the tech industry in the coming years. However, there are precautionary steps that practitioners can take now to make small but notable changes.</p>
<p>For example, when foundational models are published, we could release the corresponding <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf">data sheet</a> describing the underlying training data, providing descriptive statistics of what is in the data set. Doing so would provide subsequent users with a sense of a model’s strengths and limitations, empowering them to make informed decisions. The impact could be huge.</p>
<p>The aforementioned <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf">study</a> on foundational models poses the question, “What is the right set of statistics over the data to provide adequate documentation, without being too costly or difficult to obtain?” For visual data specifically, researchers would ideally provide the distributions of age, gender, race, religion, region, abilities, sexual orientation, health conditions and more. But, this metadata is costly and difficult to obtain on large data sets from multiple sources.</p>
<p>A complementary approach would be for AI developers to have access to a running list of known biases and common limitations for foundational models. This could include developing a database of easily accessible tests for biases that AI researchers could regularly contribute to, especially given how people use these models.</p>
<p>For example, Twitter recently facilitated a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/could-bug-bounties-help-find-biased-algorithms-this-competition-put-the-idea-to-the-test/">competition</a> that challenged AI experts to expose biases in their algorithms (Remember when I said that recognition and awareness are key toward mitigation?). We need more of this, everywhere. Practicing crowdsourcing like this on a regular basis could help reduce the burden on individual practitioners.</p>
<p>We don’t have all of the answers yet, but as an industry, we need to take a hard look at the data we are using as the solution to more powerful models. Doing so comes at a cost –- amplifying biases — and we need to accept the role we play within the solution. We need to look for ways to more deeply understand the training data we are using, especially when AI systems are used to represent or interact with real people.</p>
<p>This shift in thinking will help companies of all types and sizes quickly spot skews and counteract them in the development stage, dampening the biases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K. published its first-ever <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uk-announces-a-national-strategy-to-level-up-ai/">national AI strategy</a> this week. The decade-long commitment by the government to levelling up domestic artificial intelligence capabilities &#8212; by directing resource and attention toward skills, talent, compute power and data access &#8212; has been broadly welcomed by the country&#8217;s tech ecosystem, as you&#8217;d expect.</p>
<p>But there is a question mark over how serious government is about turning the U.K. into a &#8220;global AI superpower&#8221; given the lack of a funding announcement to accompany the publication.</p>
<p>A better hint is likely to come shortly, with the spending review tabled for October 27 &#8212; which will set out public spending plans for the next three years.</p>
<p>Ahead of that, TechCrunch spoke to Marc Warner, CEO of U.K. AI startup Faculty, who said government needs to show it&#8217;s serious about providing long-term support to develop the U.K.&#8217;s capabilities and global competitiveness with an appropriate level of funding &#8212; while welcoming the &#8220;genuine ambition&#8221; he believes the government is showing to support AI.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK announces a national strategy to &#8216;level up&#8217; AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uk-announces-a-national-strategy-to-level-up-ai/embed/#?secret=bXaPc09RiS" data-secret="bXaPc09RiS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Warner&#8217;s startup, which closed a $42 million growth round of funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/flush-with-42m-hot-ai-startup-faculty-plans-to-hoover-up-more-phds-and-steer-clear-of-politics/">earlier this year</a>, has started its own internal education program to attract PhDs into the company and turn out future data scientists. While Warner himself is also a member of the U.K.&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/ai-council">AI Council</a>, an expert advisory group that provides advice to government and which was consulted on the strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is a really pretty good strategy,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a genuine ambition in it which is relatively rare for government and they recognize some of the most important things that we need to fix.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The problem &#8212; and it&#8217;s a huge problem &#8212; is that there are currently no numbers attached to this.</p>
<p>&#8220;So while in principle there&#8217;s lots of great stuff in there, in practice it&#8217;s totally critical that it&#8217;s actually backed by the funding that it needs &#8212; and has the commitment of the wider gov to the high-quality execution that doing some of these things are going to require.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warner warned of the risk of the promising potential of a &#8220;pretty serious strategy&#8221; fading away if it&#8217;s not matched with an appropriate &#8212; dare we say it, &#8220;world beating&#8221; &#8212; level of funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a question for the spending review but it seems to me very easy now that having done &#8212; what looks like a really pretty serious strategy &#8212; then&#8230; it fades into a much more generic strategy off the back of not really willing to make the funding commitments, not really willing to push through on the execution side and actually make these things happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked what level of funding he&#8217;d like to see government putting behind the strategy to deliver on its long-term ambitions, Warner said the U.K. needs to aim high &#8212; and do so on a global stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can look around the world and look at the commitments that other countries are making to their AI strategies which are in the hundred of millions to low billions,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;And if we are serious about being globally competitive &#8212; which the strategy is, and I think we should be &#8212; then we&#8217;re talking at least matching the funding of other countries, if not exceeding it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately it comes down to where does this rank in their priority list and if they want to deliver on an ambitious strategy it&#8217;s got to be high,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2>Access to talent</h2>
<p>Discussing the broad detail of what the strategy says is needed for the U.K. to up its AI game, Warner highlighted talent as a key component.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a technical field like AI talent is a huge deal. There&#8217;s a global competition for that talent. And it seems like the government is taking that seriously and hopefully going to take actions to make sure the U.K. has all the talent it needs for this kind of stuff &#8212; from a skills perspective and training up people but also from a visa perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From our perspective it&#8217;s just wonderful to be able to access some of the most talented people from across the world to come and work on important problems and so the easier that it can be made for those people &#8212; or for organizations, whether it&#8217;s universities or charities or companies like us or even government departments to start to be able to hire those people it&#8217;s just a massive step forward,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice that they&#8217;re taking computing and data seriously,&#8221; he went on, discussing other elements of the strategy. &#8220;Obviously those are the two fuels for the set of techniques of machine learning that are sort of the foundation of modern AI. And having the government think about how we can make that more accessible is clearly a great thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the fact that they&#8217;re thinking about the long-term risks of AI is novel and basically important,&#8221; he also said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I think they&#8217;re relatively honest that our adoption is weaker than we&#8217;d like, as a country, as a set of businesses. And hopefully recognizing that and thinking seriously about how we might go about fixing it &#8212; so, all in all, from a strategy perspective it&#8217;s actually very good.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strategy also talks about the need to establish “clear rules, applied ethical principles and a pro-innovation regulatory environment” for AI. But the U.K. is already lagging on that front &#8212; with the European Union proposing an AI Regulation earlier this year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/embed/#?secret=QAtzLkmb6h" data-secret="QAtzLkmb6h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Asked for his views on AI regulation Warner advocated for domain-specific rules.</p>
<h2>Domain specific AI rules</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We think it would be a big mistake to regulate at the level of just artificial intelligence. Because that&#8217;s sort of equivalent to regulating steel where you don&#8217;t know whether the steel is going to be used in girders or in a knife or a gun,&#8221; he suggested. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Either you pick the kind of legislation that we have around girders and it becomes incredibly lax around the people who are using the steel to make guns or you pick the kind of legislation that we have around guns and it becomes almost impossible to make the girders.</p>
<p>&#8220;So while it&#8217;s totally critical that we regulate AI effectively that is almost certainly done in a domain-specific fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave the example of AIs used in health contexts, such as for diagnosis, as a domain that would naturally require tighter regulation &#8212; whereas a use-case like e-commerce would likely not need such guardrails, he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the government recognizes this in the strategy,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It does talk about making sure the regulation is really thoughtfully attuned to the domain. And that just seems very sensible to me.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We think it&#8217;s extremely important that AI is done well and safely and for the benefit of society.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s proposed risk-based framework for regulating applications of AI does have a focus on certain domains and use cases &#8212; which are classified as higher or lower risk, with regulatory requirements varying accordingly. But <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Warner said he hasn&#8217;t yet studied the EU proposal in enough detail to have a view on their approach.  </span></p>
<p>TechCrunch also asked the Faculty CEO for his views on the U.K. government&#8217;s simultaneous push to &#8220;reform&#8221; the current data protection framework &#8212; which includes consulting on changes that could weaken protections for people&#8217;s information.</p>
<p>Critics of the reform plan suggest it risks a race to the bottom on privacy standards.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;My view would be that it&#8217;s absolutely critical that uses of AI are both legal and legitimate,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;As in, if people knew what was being done with their data they would be completely comfortable with what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Data legitimacy</h2>
<p>Faculty&#8217;s AI business was in existence (albeit under a different name) before the U.K.&#8217;s version of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was transposed into national law &#8212; although the prior regime was broadly similar. So existing rules don&#8217;t appear to have harmed its prospects as a high value and growing U.K. AI business.</p>
<p>Given that, might the government&#8217;s appetite to reduce the level of data protection that U.K. citizens enjoy &#8212; with the claim that doing so would somehow be &#8220;good for innovation&#8221; &#8212; actually be rather counterproductive for AI businesses which need the trust of users to flourish? (Plus, of course, if any U.K. AI businesses want to do business in the European Union they would need to comply with the GDPR.)</p>
<p>&#8220;GDPR is not perfect,&#8221; argued Warner. &#8220;If you speak to anyone I think that&#8217;s widely recognized &#8212; so I don&#8217;t think that the way it&#8217;s being framed as a choice between one or other, I think we can do better than both and I think that&#8217;s what we should aim for.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there are lots of ways that we can &#8212; over time &#8212; be better at regulating these things. So that we maintain the absolute best in class for legitimacy around the use of these technologies which is obviously totally critical for companies like us that want to do business in a way that&#8217;s widely accepted and even encouraged in society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically I don&#8217;t think we should compromise but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a choice between just following GDPR or not. It&#8217;s more complicated than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting there have been a number of high-profile data scandals emanating from the U.K. in recent years.</p>
<p>And Faculty &#8212; in its pre-rebranding guise as <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/were-there-any-links-between-cambridge-analytica-russia-and-brexit-">ASI Data Science</a> &#8212; was intimately involved in controversial use of data for targeting ads at voters during the U.K.&#8217;s Brexit vote, for example.</p>
<p>Although it has since said it will never do political work again.</p>
<h2>Political campaigning</h2>
<p>ASI Data Science&#8217;s corporate rebranding followed revelations around the data-mining activities of the now defunct and disgraced data company, Cambridge Analytica &#8212; which broke into a global scandal in 2018, and led to parliamentarians around the world asking awkward questions about the role of data and predictive modelling to try to sway voters.</p>
<p>The U.K.&#8217;s information commissioner even called for an &#8220;ethical pause&#8221; on the use of data and AI tools for political add targeting, warning that trust in democracy was being undermined by big data techniques opaquely targeting voters with custom political messaging.</p>
<p>During the Brexit referendum, Warner worked with the U.K. government&#8217;s former special advisor, Dominic Cummings, who was a director for the Vote Leave campaign. And Cummings has written extensively that data scientists played a crucial role in winning the Brexit vote &#8212; writing, for instance, in a <a href="https://dominiccummings.com/2016/10/29/on-the-referendum-20-the-campaign-physics-and-data-science-vote-leaves-voter-intention-collection-system-vics-now-available-for-all/">2016 blog post</a> on how data science and AI was used in the referendum, that:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of our central ideas was that the campaign had to do things in the field of data that have never been done before. This included a) integrating data from social media, online advertising, websites, apps, canvassing, direct mail, polls, online fundraising, activist feedback, and some new things we tried such as a new way to do polling&#8230; and b) having experts in physics and machine learning do proper data science in the way only they can – i.e. far beyond the normal skills applied in political campaigns. We were the first campaign in the UK to put almost all our money into digital communication then have it partly controlled by people whose normal work was subjects like quantum information (combined with political input from Paul Stephenson and Henry de Zoete, and digital specialists AIQ). We could only do this properly if we had proper canvassing software. We built it partly in-house and partly using an external engineer who we sat in our office for months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given this infamous episode in his company&#8217;s history, we asked Warner if he would be supportive of AI rules that limit how the technology can be used for political campaigning?</p>
<p>The U.K. government has not made such a proposal but it is eyeing changing in election law &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/uk-eyeing-disclosure-labels-for-online-political-campaigning/">disclosure labels</a> for online political campaigning.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Faculty as an organization is not interested in politics anymore &#8212; it&#8217;s not something we&#8217;re thinking about,&#8221; was Warner&#8217;s response on this. </span></p>
<p>Pushed again on whether he would support limits on AI in the political campaigning domain, he added: &#8220;From Faculty&#8217;s perspective we don&#8217;t do politics anymore. I think it&#8217;s up to the government what they think it&#8217;s best around that area.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Noops is going after the $50 billion snack foods market and plans to take on yogurt next.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just two months after securing <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/noops-is-flippin-snacks-with-brand-launch-and-closes-on-a-2-million-pre-seed-investment-round-301095789.html">$2 million in pre-seed funding</a>, plant-based pudding startup <a href="https://eatnoops.com/">Noops</a> is announcing an additional $2 million round led by Lerer Hippeau.</p>
<p>The Long Island-based company was founded in 2019 by Hungryroot co-founder Gregory Harry Struck after he adopted a plant-based diet while battling cancer.</p>
<p>“It was born out of a need when a lot of things were eliminated for me,” Struck told TechCrunch. “During this period of change, I thought about consumption and how it affects our well-being and health system.”</p>
<p>Struck recalls a time in the grocery store looking in the dairy case for yogurt, catching a glimpse of pudding and wondering why this product had never been reimagined, nutrition-wise. He went home, turned his house into a commercial kitchen and began experimenting with recipes, sometimes using his three young children as taste-testers.</p>
<p>When Struck found a recipe that worked, he started handing the pudding out to friends and family and ultimately started Noops. The company’s first product is an oat milk-based line that is organic, free of dairy and gluten, contains prebiotics, plant protein and fiber, and has no added sugar. The pudding comes in traditional flavors like chocolate, caramel, mocha and vanilla.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Immi takes in $3.8M to cook up plant-based instant ramen&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/immi-takes-in-3-8m-to-cook-up-plant-based-instant-ramen/embed/#?secret=fltHbpxlnM" data-secret="fltHbpxlnM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Joining Lerer Hippeau in the investment are Siddhi Capital, Idea Farm Ventures, Simple Food Ventures, Animal Capital and American Pie executive Alan Mitzner. The latest round gives the company a total of $5 million raised to date, Struck said.</p>
<p>“This, for us, is very significant in terms of having a partner like Lerer Hippeau believe in us that we can be the next-generation,” he added. “And for us, we know exactly where we are going and can see the future and be a part of it.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment Larry Appel, former CEO of The Fresh Market, and Benjamin McKean, CEO of Hungryroot, will join the company’s advisory board.</p>
<p>Andrea Hippeau, partner at Lerer Hippeau, agreed, saying that it was Struck himself, and his background, that led to the firm’s belief that he could make an impact on the plant-based food category and build a strong company. The plant-based foods market was valued at $29.4 billion in 2020, <a href="https://plantbasednews.org/news/economics/plant-based-market-skyrocket/">according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report</a>, and is poised to <a href="https://plantbasednews.org/news/plant-based-food-market-worth-74-billion-by-2027/">grow to $74 billion by 2027</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As investors in the space, Hippeau said the firm is looking at this category as “the next generation of consumables that will be hitting every category.” And, while the food type has reached a number of categories, like meat and seafood, there is not much in the space of pudding, nor have incumbents come out with better-for-you options, Hippeau said.</p>
<p>In fact, of the $348 billion in annual sales generated by the top 25 food and beverage incumbents in the U.S., some $50 billion of the sales can be attributable to snack brands, like Jell-O, which contain animal byproducts and have remained unchanged since launching in 1897, Struck said.</p>
<p>“Grocers are looking for the plant-based alternatives,” Hippeau said. “Noops is making a pudding with the same flavors people like and nutritional to take yogurt on head-on. Gregory and his team understood this and had those connections already established when they came to us.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new funding will go to grow Noops’ distribution channels and network as it services retailers and direct-to-consumers, develop additional partnerships, make some key hires in finance and sales, bring on a second manufacturing partner as it aims to triple production and create more flavors and products, including a breakfast line that will develop a yogurt alternative.</p>
<p>Noops officially launched in Q1 of 2021 and is now available in more than 750 locations of retailers, including Sprouts Farmers Market and Wegmans Foods Markets. In addition, since its pre-launch in 2020, the company has doubled its projected numbers. It intends to launch in Fresh Thyme this year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is working on a number of new devices including an Echo with a 15-inch wall-mounted display, a soundbar, new Echo Auto technology and wearables. Some may appear fairly soon at the company&#8217;s September 28th <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fall-hardware-event-september-28-181440028.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">hardware event</a>, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/amazon-working-on-large-wall-echo-sound-bar-and-new-auto-device" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> report.</p>
<p>The splashiest-looking product would be an Alexa-enabled Echo with a display size around 15-inches. Codenamed Hoya, it could not only be placed on a stand like a regular Echo device, but mounted on a wall as well. It would serve as a smart-home center to control lights, cameras, locks and other devices, while showing weather, timers, appointments, photos and more. It&#8217;s specifically designed to work in the kitchen, displaying recipes and YouTube cooking videos, while letting you stream Netflix and other apps.</p>
<p>The company may also announce its own soundbar, codenamed Harmony, to accompany a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-branded-tv-us-051047163.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">rumored lineup</a> of Amazon-branded TVs. Unlike third-party Alexa-enabled soundbars, it would have a front-facing camera and support video calls from TVs, much like Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-facebook-portal-tv-review.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Portal TV</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s reportedly developing a new version of Echo Auto (codenamed Marion). The updated version will supposedly have a new design and allow for device charging via inductive technology. Amazon currently has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-alexa-built-in-120032156.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">partnership with Ford</a> to put Alexa in 700,000 vehicles, but it&#8217;s apparently looking to team up with other automakers, too.</p>
<p>Other items in the works include new Echo speakers for 2022 and wearables for kids and seniors (the latter with fall detection). It&#8217;s also reportedly building dedicated processors to improve artificial intelligence along with new technology to help its Fire TV, Echo and other devices work better together.</p>
<p>The company has some other, somewhat more unusual products in the works as well, according to the report. It has been working on a home robot codenamed Vesta that would use the Alexa interface and also an Alexa-powered karaoke microphone — though team working on that project was reportedly disbanded.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Avenue is building a command center for operations teams.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://avenue.so/">Avenue</a> launched Friday to give operations their own tools to monitor teams, and is building a “command center” for this area of business that is often forgotten, co-founder and CEO Justin Bleuel told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In addition to the launch the company is announcing $4 million in seed funding, led by Accel, with participation from Flexport and a group of individual investors from companies like Coinbase, Uber, Stripe and Thumbtack.</p>
<p>Bleuel and his co-founder, Jeff Barg, grew up building iOS apps together and then went their separate ways, Bleuel to Uber and Barg to Amazon. While at Uber, Bleuel was working on observability — passive or proactive monitoring — building a lot of the tools in-house to monitor the marketplace for data like rider experience.</p>
<p>Both saw an opening to build these tools themselves for operations teams, and Avenue was born. The technology enables business teams to set up alerts to observe when there is a problem with data, act on it correctly and improve how the overall team functions, think “Datadog or PagerDuty for operations teams,” Bleuel said.</p>
<p>“Data is now all centralized in data warehouses, so you can build on top of them in a way you could not before, like Fivetran, and activate off of it,” he added. “You used to have to build one-to-one alerts for each tool, but now we can actively direct them from the warehouse.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207682" style="width: 1209px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207682" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207682 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png" alt="" width="1199" height="773" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png 1199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1199px) 100vw, 1199px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207682" class="wp-caption-text">Avenue dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Avenue</p></div></p>
<p>The company, founded in 2020, came out of the Y Combinator winter 2021 cohort, and one of its early customers is food pickup service Snackpass, which is using Avenue to monitor uptime and receive notifications when restaurant partners, for example, have an ordering tablet battery die or lose Wi-Fi. Snackpass is able to contact the location and help them figure out why they went offline. As a result, the company was able to cut the percentage of offline stores in half, Bleuel said.</p>
<p>Avenue’s customer sweet spot is marketplace companies or warehouses for monitoring stock. However, the co-founders are also seeing their technology being used by other companies, like furniture delivery companies, to monitor for reliability or know their inventory levels. Customers are also packaging up reports and sharing them with other internal teams on how to improve operations.</p>
<p>The company intends to use the funding to build on its small team of three, especially in engineering to be able to go to market with new products, Barg said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Avenue is working with more than 50 companies and since April has sent out over 200,000 alerts. The company’s model bills customers per alert per month, and the team is looking at a freemium model as well as enterprise levels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amit Kumar, partner at Accel, said via email the firm is “very thesis-driven,” one of them being the modern data stack. Accel made early investments into companies like Airbyte, Monte Carlo and Privacer, and saw opportunity for new downstream applications based on the innovation, of which Avenue stood out.</p>
<p>The combination of Bleuel and Barg was “particularly compelling because of their fluency with the problem space” due to their backgrounds at Uber and Amazon and experiencing firsthand how “poorly served” operations teams are and how that can affect the overall business.</p>
<p>He believes the current approach of ops teams in the market today relies heavily on dashboarding, periodic sweeps and color-coded Excel sheets — a process that is “often inaccurate and disorganized.” At the same time, product engineers were flush with well-established tools around observability and incident response.</p>
<p>“Given the rise of &#8216;atoms&#8217; startups powered by a cohort of ex-Uber and ex-Amazon operators, Justin and Jeff were uniquely positioned to find early design partners and customers among their peer networks,” Kumar added. “As ops teams become both increasingly commonplace and essential to business outcomes, I expect their processes to mature and benefit from similar tooling. This is the thesis behind Avenue, and early traction indicates that next-gen leading ops-heavy companies agree.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s central bank said on Friday that all cryptocurrency-related transactions are illegal in the country and they must be banned, citing concerns around national security and &#8220;safety of people&#8217;s assets.&#8221; The world&#8217;s most populated nation also said that foreign exchanges are banned from providing services to users in the country.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, 10 Chinese government agencies vowed to work closely to maintain a &#8220;high pressure&#8221; crackdown on trading of cryptocurrencies in the nation. The People&#8217;s Bank of China separately ordered internet, financial and payment companies from facilitating cryptocurrency trading on their platforms.</p>
<p>The central bank said cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Tether, cannot be circulated in the market as they are not fiat currency. The surge in usage of cryptocurrencies has disrupted &#8220;economic and financial order,&#8221; and prompted a proliferation of &#8220;money laundering, illegal fund-raising, fraud, pyramid schemes and other illegal and criminal activities,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Offenders, the central bank warned, will be &#8220;investigated for criminal liability in accordance with the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chinese government will &#8220;resolutely clamp down on virtual currency speculation, and related financial activities and misbehaviour in order to safeguard people&#8217;s properties and maintain economic, financial and social order,&#8221; the People&#8217;s Bank of China said in a statement.</p>
<p>The move has already started to cause panic among some crypto traders, sending the price of bitcoin and several other currencies down. Bitcoin was down 5.5% at the time of publication.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>China, home to some of the world&#8217;s largest crypto mining services, is also going after those businesses. The National Development and Reform Commission said it was launching a nationwide cleanup of cryptocurrency mining &#8212; a task it said was &#8220;imperative.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not the first time China has declared a crackdown on cryptocurrency-related activities, but until now so many government agencies had not collaborated on such efforts.</p>
<p>Regulators in China have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/china-considers-ban-crypto-mining/">weighing a ban on crypto mining</a> for several years. But in recent quarters, several local firms have started to embrace crypto. Chinese app maker Meitu <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/07/china-meitu-crypto-investment/">bought Bitcoin and Ether worth $40 million</a> in March.</p>
<p>Some are optimistic. Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia Pacific business with crypto exchange Luno in Singapore, said in a tweet that, &#8220;China has banned crypto more times than one can count.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has launched Prime Video Channels in India, allowing its customers to subscribe to eight streaming services including Discovery+ and Mubi from one hub (Prime Video website or app), the latest in a series of efforts by the U.S. giant to win customers in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>The new offering makes it easier for users to log in and pay for additional streaming services, the company said. To make things more enticing, Amazon said the services are available at discounted prices for the first year. Discovery+ costs $4 per year, Mubi $27, Hoichoi $8.2, DocuBay $6.8, ErosNow $4, Lionsgate Play $9.5, manoramaMax $9.5 and ShortsTV $4.</p>
<p>The company, which is currently at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/amazon-starts-probe-over-bribe-to-govt-officials-by-its-lawyers-in-india-report-says/">centre of several controversies in India</a>, did not share how much of the revenue it is taking from the streaming services and the duration of the partnerships, which are not exclusive. India is the twelfth market where Amazon has launched Prime Video Channels.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KGv3MFsMnM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/">Amazon launches free video streaming service in India</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon launches free video streaming service in India&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/embed/#?secret=KGv3MFsMnM" data-secret="KGv3MFsMnM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Friday’s launch is likely to prove more beneficial to the third-party streaming partners. All the partner services are currently struggling to make inroads in the country. Discovery+ app had fewer than 4 million monthly active users in India last month, for instance. Every other app had fewer than 1 million monthly active users; some didn&#8217;t even have 200,000, according to mobile insight firm App Annie (the data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch).</p>
<p>“With the launch of Prime Video Channels, we now take the next big step in our journey to entertain India by creating a video entertainment marketplace – first of its kind in India – which will not only delight our customers by giving them even more entertainment choices, but also benefit the OTT Channel partners who collaborate with us to leverage Prime Video’s distribution, reach and tech infrastructure,” said Gaurav Gandhi, country manager of Amazon Prime Video India, in a statement.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Prime Video, which has amassed more than 55 million monthly active users in India, competes with Netflix, Disney’s Hotstar and Times Internet’s MX Player in the country. Both Hotstar and MX Player have established larger reach than Prime Video in India, and Netflix has courted most elite customers in the country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The e-commerce group, on its part, has attempted to push for more reach by securing some rights to cricket matches &#8212; though the vast majority of those rights are still owned by Hotstar &#8212; and has also launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/">free, ad-supported streaming service</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups have spent the last decade trying to offer every variation of Airbnb that they can imagine. But <a href="https://www.stayukio.com/">Ukio</a> thinks it has found a way through the ever-growing tangle of housing rental competitors — and regulators — right as remote work becomes the norm.</p>
<p>It offers rentals of one month or longer, featuring a turnkey premium experience in prime city locations in partnership with local property owners. The initial results are promising.</p>
<p>The Barcelona, Spain-based company was founded early last year and has grown to more than 100 apartments between that city and Madrid while maintaining a 95% occupancy rate.</p>
<p>Today it is announcing a large-sized seed round of $9 million from top European investors, with plans to scale to more than 700 apartments across six continental capitals in 2022. Lisbon is the next city on the list, followed by London and Berlin.</p>
<p>Ukio&#8217;s guests so far are split nearly evenly between two use cases, according to co-founder and CEO Stanley Fourteau*. One half is composed of new long-term residents who have landed local jobs and will eventually move into permanent housing. So far, this group tends to stay six months or longer.</p>
<p>A longtime director at Airbnb, Fourteau says that the mainstreaming of remote and distributed work has also brought in a growing group of digital nomad types who are looking for something more than a short-term rental. This half of the user base tends to stay around two or three months, to date.</p>

<p>To indicate that market opportunity, he cited <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-06-22-gartner-forecasts-51-percent-of-global-knowledge-workers-will-be-remote-by-2021">Gartner report</a> showing the remote-worker demographic could grow to 31% of all workers by the end of this year. But TechCrunch readers might find that number a little conservative. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/">Proptech investors who I surveyed for Extra Crunch</a> in March, for example, described office space as being more of a luxury in the future, with more workers living wherever they wanted — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/the-return-of-neighborhood-retail-and-other-surprising-real-estate-trends/">places with fun &#8220;third spaces&#8221;</a> for entertainment and community, like what many European cities are known for.</p>
<p>Ukio, which is Japanese for “living in the moment,” is hardly the only startup aiming for this changing demographic. A few prominent ones from a long list of them include Blueground, Sonder, Sentinel and Zeus (plus Airbnb’s long-term rental options). So what’s different here?</p>
<p>“Ukio rents, furnishes and manages properties to oversee the entire guest experience,” Fourteau explains. “Our vertically integrated approach allows us to professionalize supply for platforms such as Airbnb (a peer-to-peer marketplace), similarly to how global hotel chains professionalize supply for Booking.com.”</p>
<p>The idea originated from his time at Airbnb, where user demand for long-term rentals never really fit with the company’s platform model. “The core focus of [that] company is in strengthening their relationships with and growing their host community,” he says. If Airbnb were to build a vertically integrated rental operator like Ukio, “it would compete with their existing community and could compromise its relationship with them.”</p>
<p>Today, he says, the most desirable long-term rentals in a city get taken before they get posted on Airbnb or are snatched up from the platform well before demand is met. Ukio-operated apartments, on the other hand, “will be a part of that community for many years to come.”</p>
<p>Ukio’s relationship with property owners is another way of creating a moat around key locations, he believes. “We engage in 7-10-year lease contracts with full tenant management. These agreements optimize their returns, avoiding vacancy rates and reducing management costs. Ukio provides them guaranteed yields and offers a hassle-free solution. As a business, we now receive more inbound requests from landlords wanting to work with Ukio than targeted outreach, with a strong supply pipeline for growth in the next year.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207914" style="width: 1646px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207914" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207914 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png" alt="" width="1636" height="1432" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png 1636w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=768,672 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=680,595 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=1536,1344 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1636px) 100vw, 1636px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207914" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ukio</p></div></p>
<p>Here’s a more granular look at what he sees providing the differentiation long term, paraphrased for brevity: Ukio uses a 200-point process to choose potential apartments and only works with the owners of the best ones in prime locations. Many of these are single units, which allow for more of a mix spread across a city than startups like Sentral that use entire buildings. Each unit also gets a unique design, versus the templated approach of Blueground and some others. While many competitors are primarily platforms with hosts providing and managing their own units, Ukio has an internal team to manage all properties. It’s also starting out with a focus on Europe, whereas many of its most direct competitors like Zeus are focused on the U.S.</p>
<p>On the tech side, in addition to the supply acquisition tool, it uses a dynamic pricing model to help keep occupancy high, and an internal design system and catalogue to reduce installation and onboarding costs. Ukio’s product-focused co-founder, Stanley&#8217;s brother Jeremy, has a decade of experience from key roles at Zynga, EA, Headspace and most recently Knotel.</p>
<p>As a company whose core product is physical, Ukio faces risks of tightening local regulations as well as COVID-related restrictions. Fourteau (Stanley) acknowledged the issues but argued that Ukio’s particular model is better suited to cope because it is getting such heavy usage from long-term locals. The bigger question in this phase seems to be Ukio’s various well-funded competitors, who will no doubt tweak their models repeatedly to attract the remote workers of the future.</p>
<p>And so, this need for rapid scaling is the context for the large-sized seed round. It was led by French venture firm Breega with participation from Heartcore and Partech, and angels including Iñaki Berenguer, founder of Coverwallet, and Avi Meir, founder of Travelperk.</p>
<p><em>* Disclosure: I went to college with Stan nearly 20 years ago, but we&#8217;d lost touch a decade ago before he sent me this news.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank is gaga for startups in Latin America. Since first announcing it was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/07/softbank-launches-5-billion-latin-america-tech-fund.html">planting a stake</a> in the ground in the region in early 2019, the Japanese conglomerate has plugged more than $5 billion into the region, and it expects that number to top $8 billion by year&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>Its capital contributions are meaningful to say the least. In 2019, startups across Latin America raised $5.3 billion in funding, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">according to CB Insights</a>. In 2020, they raised roughly the same amount.</p>
<p>This year, the pace of deal-making has shifted into overdrive, with $9.3 billion being invested in Latin American startups in the first six months of the year. SoftBank Group CEO Marcelo Claure believes that by 2023, close to $30 billion will be invested in the region annually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, the world has realized that Latin America has size,&#8221; said Claure, a native of Bolivia, said this week at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. &#8220;It&#8217;s only half of China, but it&#8217;s two times the size of India, and three times the size of Southeast Asia.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also pointed to the fact that people in the region are making money. &#8220;Latin America has the same GDP per capita — $9,000 to $10,000 per year — as China, and that&#8217;s three times (GDP per capita) that of India and two times what people are making in Southeast Asia.</p>
