										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse announced today that it is unveiling four new features: Clips, Replay, Universal Search, and spatial audio for Android (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/29/clubhouse-spatial-audio/">already exists</a> on iOS). All of these features will launch today, except for Replay, which will roll out in October. These additions will help expand Clubhouse&#8217;s reach by making content available even after a live conversation has ended, allowing for asynchronous engagement.</p>
<p>Clips will allow live listeners in public rooms to snip the most recent 30 seconds of audio and share it anywhere &#8212; so, if you&#8217;re listening to a speaker who says something particularly wise (or not), you can create a clip, which generates a shareable moment with a link to join the room. These can be shared on other social media platforms. Hosts can decide whether or not they want listeners to be able to make clips in their room &#8212; if clips are turned on, users will be able to tap a scissor icon to make one.</p>
<p>Clubhouse already acknowledges that there&#8217;s a danger in letting people share 30 second audio clips out of context. A bad actor could potentially clip audio to obscure what someone really meant (you might say &#8220;the museum is always free on Friday,&#8221; but the clip could stop at &#8220;the museum is always free&#8221; &#8212; of course, Clubhouse is concerned about more sinister examples than this). So, to begin, Clubhouse is rolling out clips in beta to a small group of creators. Clubhouse has <a href="https://twitter.com/clubhouse/status/1383935475333820417?lang=en">struggled</a> with <a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/on-community-moderation/">content moderation</a> in its short history, and recently, doctors have been reportedly <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypm5/doctors-are-being-forced-off-clubhouse-by-anti-vax-harassment">forced off the app</a> due to harassment from anti-vaxxers. In light of these challenges, it makes sense that Clubhouse is more slowly unveiling this feature.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210804" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210804" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210804" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="451" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png 5940w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=680,451 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=1536,1019 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=2048,1358 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210804" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clubhouse</p></div></p>
<p>Universal Search improves discoverability on Clubhouse, so that when users type a keyword or name into the search bar, they can find relevant rooms (both live and scheduled), people, clubs, and bios. And Clubhouse says it&#8217;s bringing Spatial Audio to Android after positive feedback from iOS users. But even amid these feature updates, Clubhouse still has made itself <a href="http://forbes.com/sites/stevenaquino/2021/02/08/clubhouse-is-a-club-so-exclusive-it-excludes-disabled-people-by-design/?sh=eb02d9c60082">inaccessible</a> to Deaf and hard of hearing users by failing to add live captioning.</p>
<p>Of these new features, Replay could be the biggest game-changer for the app &#8212; it will allow creators to record a room, save it to their profile and club, or download the audio to share it externally, like on a podcast feed. Hosts and moderators can choose whether or not they want the room to be recorded.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, former PayPal COO David Sacks launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/callin-david-sacks-social-podcasting-app-launches-and-announces-a-12m-series-a-round/">Callin</a>, a &#8220;social podcasting&#8221; app that functions like a Clubhouse live audio room, but allows users to save and edit recordings into podcasts through the app. Then, Twitter said it would add <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">recorded Spaces</a> too. Now, Clubhouse&#8217;s Replay feature will make it more competitive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though Clubhouse has tried to appeal to live audio creators through its &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">Creator First</a>&#8221; program, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696403/clubhouse-creators-first-sponsorship-program">reports suggest</a> that the endeavor fell short of expectations. But if Clubhouse wants to appeal to creators, this easier way of saving and sharing audio can help keep hosts on the platform. Though the appeal of apps like Clubhouse is the ability to have a shared, live experience, allowing for asynchronous listening can help people grow their audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Korean internet service provider SK Broadband, a subsidiary of South Korean telco company SK Telecom, has filed a counterclaim against Netflix to demand payment for the bandwidth the streaming platform has used for the last three years.</p>
<p>This case comes in the wake of the South Korean court <a href="https://telecoms.com/510357/netflix-ordered-to-pay-for-network-usage-in-korea/">siding against Netflix in June</a> in the case. Now SK Broadband is empowered to levy network usage fees on streaming platforms for consuming an excessive amount of bandwidth and causing heavy traffic on its network.</p>
<p>“We will review the claim that SK Broadband has filed against us. In the meantime, we continue to seek open dialogue and explore ways of working with SK Broadband in order to ensure a seamless streaming experience for our shared customers,” a Netflix spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The U.S. streaming giant lodged an appeal to a higher court against the court decision in July after it lost the first court case that the company filed in 2020. That case alleged that SK Broadband, which is responsible for managing its networks, has no right to demand fees for the bandwidth. Netflix has claimed that the ISP was trying to &#8220;double bill&#8221; &#8212; its subscribers already pay for broadband use, and now want to charge the streaming company for it, too.</p>
<p>SK Broadband plans to charge about $23 million per year for network use, as per local media reports.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, SK Broadband requested the Korea Communication Commission come to a settlement, but the two companies couldn’t find an agreement.</p>
<p>SK Broadband claims that Netflix’s traffic on the ISP network has exponentially increased about 24 times, from 50 Gigabits per second in May 2018 to 1,200 Gigabits in September 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-korea-the-story-so-far">Netflix says</a> on 28 September that its investment in content production in South Korea has brought socio-economic impact worth $4.7 billion, covering everything from publishing to consumer goods. It claims to have led to the creation of 16,000 jobs in the country since it opened in 2016, using figures from a Deloitte Consulting <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CsnPesZ6dzrE7lDHVxqdceHF554Vo2_o/view">report</a>. Netflix Korea has 3.8 million paid subscriptions in South Korea as of the end of 2020, while its global paid memberships were estimated at 200 million, as per the report by Deloitte Consulting.</p>
<p>The Netflix spokesperson said on a separate note that the Korean show “Squid Game” is now on track to be <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-making-of-a-global-sensation-the-journey-to-creating-squid-game">Netflix’s biggest show</a> ever and it’s the first Korean show to ever be No. 1 on Netflix U.S.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another global streaming giant, Disney Plus, is set to launch in South Korea in November. Disney Plus reportedly plans to use third-party content delivery networks (CDNs) instead of using ISP’s networks to avoid the bandwidth usage fees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last night, Facebook published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/">two annotated slide decks</a> in an attempt to contextualize the documents that the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline">Wall Street Journal</a> published this month, which reported evidence that the company is aware of its negative impact on teen mental health. These documents were released in anticipation of today&#8217;s Senate hearing on the mental health harms of Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>The Senate <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/">Committee on Commerce, Science, &amp; Transportation</a> questioned Facebook Global Head of Security Antigone Davis over two and a half hours, but lawmakers grew frustrated with Davis&#8217; reticence to answer their questions directly, or provide much information that hasn&#8217;t been written in Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/explaining-research-to-support-families/">blog posts</a> <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/">rebuking</a> the WSJ reports.</p>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<p>&#8220;I congratulate you on a perfectly curated background,&#8221; Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn chided Davis. &#8220;It looks beautiful coming across the screen. I wish the messages that you were giving us were equally as attractive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis insisted that research from Facebook and Instagram has shown 8 out of 10 young people say they have a neutral positive experience on the app, and that her team wants 10 out of 10 young users to have a good experience. But Senators pushed back with other findings from Facebook&#8217;s own data, like the fact that among teenagers with suicidal thoughts, 13% of British users and 6% of American users said they could trace those thoughts to Instagram. Senator Richard Blumenthal (who serves as Chair of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security) said that his office did their own research by creating an account pretending to be a thirteen-year-old girl. Senator Blumenthal said they followed &#8220;easily findable accounts associated with extreme dieting and eating disorders.&#8221; Within a day, he said, the account&#8217;s recommendations were solely composed of accounts promoting self-harm and disordered eating.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&#8220;That is the perfect storm that Instagram has fostered and created. Facebook has asked us to trust it. But after these evasions and these revelations, why should we?&#8221; Senator Blumenthal asked.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7kOQ8BxzqG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/">Seeking to respin Instagram&#8217;s toxicity for teens, Facebook publishes annotated slide decks</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Seeking to respin Instagram&#8217;s toxicity for teens, Facebook publishes annotated slide decks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/embed/#?secret=7kOQ8BxzqG" data-secret="7kOQ8BxzqG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But in the midst of filibustering tactics that fit right in on the Senate floor (&#8220;We&#8217;re pretty good at filibustering in the Senate, too,&#8221; Senator Klobuchar told Davis), the Facebook Global Head of Safety did elaborate on some of the company&#8217;s plans to improve young users&#8217; experience, which Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442461241289555977">previously mentioned</a> on Twitter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Young people indicated that when they saw uplifting content or inspiring content, that could move them away from some other issues that they&#8217;re struggling with,&#8221; Davis said at the hearing. &#8220;So one of the things that we&#8217;re actually looking at is called &#8216;nudges,&#8217; where we would actually nudge someone who we saw potentially rabbit holing down content towards more uplifting or inspiring content.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to a &#8220;nudges&#8221; feature, Davis said that the company is looking at a &#8220;take a break&#8221; feature, which would encourage users to stop looking at the app if they&#8217;ve been browsing certain content for too long. In 2018, Instagram introduced a &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/02/instagram-do-not-disturb/">you&#8217;re all caught up</a>&#8221; notice, which would appear when the user had scrolled through all posts from the last two days. This feature was introduced alongside &#8220;do not disturb&#8221; toggles, which helped users control when they wanted to receive notifications. These updates were part of &#8220;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-time-well-spent-features.html">Time Well Spent</a>&#8221; initiatives, designed to curb screen time and encourage healthier social media habits. But by 2020, the space beneath the &#8220;caught up&#8221; notice was turned into a feed of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/instagram-finds-new-ad-space-at-the-end-of-your-feed-with-launch-of-suggested-posts-feature/">suggested posts and ads</a>.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Big Tech continues to blatantly prioritize raking in revenue over protecting children and teens, and that must stop. We know that these companies won’t change their ways unless Congress forces them to. That’s why I am re-introducing the KIDS Act. <a href="https://t.co/8rgZCevj15">pic.twitter.com/8rgZCevj15</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1443611317017976835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At the hearing, Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey (a <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/10/30/how-to-make-an-old-politician-a-tiktok-sensation/">social media star</a> in his own right) announced that he would <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-blumenthal-rep-castor-reintroduce-legislation-to-protect-children-and-teens-from-online-manipulation-and-harm">reintroduce</a> legislation with Senator Blumenthal called the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3411/text">KIDS (Kids Internet Design and Safety) Act</a>, which seeks to create new protections for online users under 16. The bill would prohibit platforms directed at children from leveraging follower and like counts, push alerts that encourage users to use the app more, auto-play settings, badges that award elevated levels of engagement, or any design feature that unfairly encourages a user (&#8220;due to their age or inexperience,&#8221; the bill specifies) to make purchases, submit content, or spend more time on a platform.</p>
<p>Previously <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-blumenthal-introduce-first-of-its-kind-legislation-to-protect-children-online-from-harmful-content-design-features_">introduced</a> in March 2020, Facebook has known about the proposed legislation for almost a year and a half.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our company has made its position really well known that we believe it&#8217;s time for the update of internet regulations, and we&#8217;d be happy to talk to and work with you on that,&#8221; Davis told Senator Markey.</p>
<p>But when Markey directly asked if Facebook would support the KIDS Act, Davis said that Facebook would follow up on the question later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, your company has had this legislation in your possession for months. And you&#8217;re testifying here today before the committee that would have to pass this legislation,&#8221; said Senator Markey. &#8220;I just feel that delay and obfuscation is the legislative strategy of Facebook, especially since Facebook has spent billions of dollars on a marketing campaign calling on Congress to pass internet regulations, and Facebook purports to be committed to children&#8217;s well being.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of the hearing, Davis said that she hopes the Senate will have hearings with companies that have kid-focused apps, like TikTok and YouTube. Currently, Facebook has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/messenger-kids-adds-expanded-parental-controls-details-how-much-kids-data-facebook-collects/">Messenger Kids</a> app, but the company but its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/daily-crunch-facebook-pauses-plans-to-release-instagram-app-for-kids/">Instagram for kids</a> product on hold in light of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-instagram-kids-tweens-attract-11632849667">WSJ&#8217;s reporting</a>. Though WSJ has published<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-documents-instagram-teens-11632953840"> six leaked documents</a> from Facebook, the company itself only annotated and re-published two of them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos just can’t get away from labor issues. The beleaguered billionaire, who has faced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/07/amazon-warehouse-workers-begin-historic-vote-to-unionize/">repeated and persistent criticism over working conditions at the company he formerly led, Amazon,</a> is now facing allegations of a hostile work environment at his space company Blue Origin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past">An essay jointly composed by 21 current and former employees</a> paints a vivid picture of Blue Origin’s work culture as one marred by sexual harassment, in which professional disagreement is stifled, environmental concerns are left unaddressed and speed of execution takes precedence over human safety.</p>
<p>The sole named author of the essay is Alexandra Abrams, who worked at Blue Origin for two years and six months, according to her LinkedIn profile. Abrams eventually became the head of employee communications during her tenure at the company. “I would say to Jeff that I really wished he was the person we all thought he was, and that Blue Origin was the company we all thought it was going to be,” she said in an interview to CBS Morning on Thursday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Alexandra Abrams, a former head of employee communications for Blue Origin, is speaking out against the company to <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurieSegall?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LaurieSegall</a>.</p>
<p>“You cannot create a culture of safety and a culture of fear at the same time. They are incompatible.” <a href="https://t.co/JHuFY3cjcs">pic.twitter.com/JHuFY3cjcs</a></p>
<p>— CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) <a href="https://twitter.com/CBSMornings/status/1443553601851322372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, a Blue Origin spokesperson said that Abrams “was dismissed for cause two years ago after repeated warnings for issues involving federal export control regulations.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Blue Origin has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,” the spokesperson added. “We provide numerous avenues for employees, including a 24/7 anonymous hotline, and will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct.”</p>
<p>Federal export control regulations restrict the exportation of certain goods and technology outside the U.S. At the time of publication, Blue Origin did not specify any further details related to Abrams’ departure from the company.</p>
<p>The essay couldn’t have been published at a worse time for Blue Origin, which is currently mired in a lawsuit against NASA over the agency’s awarding of a sole lunar lander contract to SpaceX. Blue Origin, which submitted its own bid, has been on the offensive ever since, disputing the contract on social media and to a major government accountability office. That office <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/feds-dismantle-blue-origin-and-dynetics-protests-of-nasas-spacex-lunar-lander-award/">dismissed Blue’s complaint</a>.</p>
<p>The essay alleges that safety took a backseat to the so-called billionaire space race, marked this summer by two trips to orbit by Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson and Bezos himself in July. The essay further claims that company leaders expressed a goal of hitting more than 40 launches of BO’s New Shepard spacecraft per year – a breakneck pace that the essay writers say did not match available staffing and resources.</p>
<p>“In the opinion of an engineer who has signed on to this essay, ‘Blue Origin has been lucky that nothing has happened so far,’” the essay says. “Many of this essay’s authors say they would not fly on a Blue Origin vehicle.”</p>
<p>A series of accusations detailed in the letter also allege a culture of sexism amongst numerous senior executives, including one in CEO Bob Smith’s “loyal inner circle” whom the essay claims was reported to Human Resources numerous times for sexual harassment.</p>
<p>The essay says that women at the company would warn new female hires regarding another senior executive’s inappropriate behavior, which included making inquiries into female employees’ dating lives and referring to them using diminutives like “sweetheart” or “baby girl.”</p>
<p>“It appeared to many of us that he was protected by his close personal relationship with Bezos—it took him physically groping a female subordinate for him to finally be let go,” the essay says.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine this essay not affecting Blue Origin’s bottom line. After the successful launch of New Shepard in August, in which Bezos and three others went to space during an eleven-minute flight, the company intends to start welcoming more paying customers on flights.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2xHLuoOtak"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard carries Jeff Bezos and three crew members to space and back</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard carries Jeff Bezos and three crew members to space and back&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/embed/#?secret=2xHLuoOtak" data-secret="2xHLuoOtak" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That the majority of the letter writers chose to stay anonymous could be explained, at least in part, by the stifling new contracts employees were requested to sign in 2019, which included non-disparagement clauses, according to the essay.</p>
<p>The letter appears to have caught the attention of the Federal Aviation Administration, who told TechCrunch, &#8220;The FAA takes every safety allegation seriously, and the agency is reviewing the information.&#8221;<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Blue Origin regarding the other allegations in the letter and will update the story if they respond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok this week presented its new plan to ramp up advertiser investment in its video platform with the expansion of e-commerce, a new promise of &#8220;brand safety,&#8221; and the launch of several new and interactive ad formats, ranging from clickable stickers to choose-your-own-adventure ads to &#8220;super likes&#8221; and more. The additions, the company says, will make TikTok&#8217;s advertising more interactive and creative, much like the TikTok experience itself.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/enter-tiktok-world-and-meet-the-next-era-of-marketing">demonstrated</a> its new additions at an online conference aimed at the advertising and marketing community on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Here, TikTok also announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">several new e-commerce partnerships </a>beyond its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/">pilot partner Shopify</a> to make online shopping a more native experience, with the ability for users to go from product discovery to checkout without leaving the app. It noted it&#8217;s making live shopping available to brands and offered several ad products made just for e-commerce brands. And, in some markets, TikTok is offering to take on the responsibilities of shipping and fulfillment, as well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TikTok&#8217;s broader ads business is getting a jolt with the launch of several new products designed with the goal of making TikTok better differentiated from other social media rivals.</p>
<p>On this front, TikTok introduced a new product called &#8220;instant page,&#8221; which is a quick-loading landing page that the company claims will load 11 times faster than a typical mobile website. This allows a user who clicks through on an ad to be immediately taken to a page where they&#8217;ll be able to see more information from the brand, watch more videos, and swipe through other content &#8212; all without leaving the TikTok app. This could compete with Instagram&#8217;s Link Sticker which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/instagram-is-ditching-swipe-up-links-in-favor-of-stickers/">recently stepped i</a>n to replace the swipe-up gesture in its app.</p>

<p>Another new product, &#8220;pop out showcase,&#8221; aims to make engaging with ads a more interactive experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With &#8220;pop out showcase,&#8221; advertisers can access a library of stickers and images that can be superimposed on top of their TikTok videos to illustrate the products they&#8217;re demonstrating or other key story elements. For instance, a beauty brand may add a sticker of a makeup brush to its content that, when tapped, takes the viewer to a page where they can buy a makeup brush from the brand.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210686" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210686" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210686" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg 2662w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210686" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok (pop out showcase)</p></div></p>
<p>Other new formats encourage TikTok users to tap on the ads themselves.</p>
<p>One of these is TikTok&#8217;s &#8220;super like.&#8221; This offers a way to make &#8220;liking&#8221; a video a more engaging experience. When users tap the like (heart) button on a TikTok video, the Super Like can display different types of icons that appear on viewers&#8217; screens. Users are also invited to visit a landing page where they can learn more about the brand&#8217;s product or service being featured.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210689" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210689" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2210689" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?w=438" alt="" width="438" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg 1084w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=97,150 97w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=193,300 193w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=768,1192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=438,680 438w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=990,1536 990w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=32,50 32w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210689" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok (super like)</p></div></p>
<p>There are also gesture ads that will reveal rewards or other information to users who either slide or tap on videos. Like the &#8220;pop out showcase: and &#8220;super like,&#8221; these ads play to the familiarity that TikTok users &#8212; particularly its young Gen Z and millennial demographic &#8212; have with how to navigate their smartphones. It&#8217;s second nature for younger people to know to tap, swipe, and drag, and these ads offer some form of immediate gratification for doing so, whether that&#8217;s an explosion of icons or even a real-life reward.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210684" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210684" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2210684" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?w=399" alt="" width="399" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg 978w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?resize=88,150 88w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?resize=176,300 176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?resize=768,1308 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?resize=399,680 399w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?resize=902,1536 902w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210684" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok (gesture ads)</p></div></p>
<p>The final new product is TikTok&#8217;s &#8220;storytime tool,&#8221; which encourages users to become a part of the brand&#8217;s storytelling experience. Some streaming services, like Hulu, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/hulu-to-debut-new-ad-formats-in-2020-focused-on-letting-users-make-choices-transact-with-advertisers/">have experimented with ads</a> that ask the users to play along &#8212; but not quite to the extent of controlling the story. Instead of just watching a TikTok ad, this choose-your-own-adventure style format lets users tap to direct the action in the video to shape the narrative and personalize the outcome.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210690" style="width: 403px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210690" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2210690" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?w=393" alt="" width="393" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg 962w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?resize=87,150 87w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?resize=173,300 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?resize=768,1330 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?resize=393,680 393w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?resize=887,1536 887w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210690" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok (storytime tool)</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;All these solutions are a part of our goal to enable advertisers to create the most engaging ads in ways that taps into their creativity and fun that exists on the platform,&#8221; said Jaclyn Fitzpatrick, TikTok Product Strategist, Global Business Marketing, when introducing the new lineup.</p>
<p>Of course, performance and measurement capabilities are just as important to marketers as the ad creatives themselves. To address these concerns, the company touted its TikTok Ad Manager, editing suite, trends and insights, and other new tools for buying, scaling, and analyzing their campaigns. It launched a new buying type called Reach &amp; Frequency, which allows advertisers to target a higher volume of users through extended reach, or get more impressions with the same number of users by opting into a higher frequency for their ad placements.</p>
<p>TikTok also made a commitment to brand safety &#8212; an issue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/att-verizon-boycott-google-ads/">that&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/youtube-faces-brand-freeze-over-ads-and-obscene-comments-on-videos-of-kids/">plagued</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/21/after-youtube-boycott-google-pulls-ads-from-more-types-of-offensive-content/">YouTube</a> in the past &#8212; with the launch of a proprietary brand safety inventory filter.</p>
<p>The solution leverages machine learning technology to classify a video&#8217;s risk based on the video&#8217;s content, text, audio, and more, so advertisers can make decisions about which kind of inventory they want to run adjacent to, the company explained. TikTok says the new filter is aligned with the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM)&#8217;s industry framework and it partnered with Integrate Ad Science (IAS), Zefr, and OpenSlate to help it to ensure ads run next to brand-safe content.</p>
<p>The message to advertisers, clearly, is that TikTok should be considered not only because of its sizable audience &#8212; now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">1 billion monthly actives,</a> it says &#8212; but also because of its advertising toolset.</p>
<p>To date, marketers haven&#8217;t carved out as much of their spending for TikTok compared with other major platforms, like Facebook and Instagram. But TikTok parent company, ByteDance, has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-owner-bytedances-annual-revenue-jumps-to-34-3-billion-11623903622">been making inroads in the global ad market</a>, with annual revenue across its apps more than doubling in 2020 to reach $34.3 billion. In the U.S., TikTok was expected to bring in $500 million in 2020, up from $200-$300 million in the year prior, according to a report by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktoks-u-s-revenues-expected-to-hit-500-million-this-year">The Information.</a> (Some of that is from <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-revenue-75-million">in-app purchases</a>, of course.)</p>
<p>As TikTok has scaled its ad business, its ad prices have been steadily increasing, too. Bloomberg noted this summer it was jacking up home page takeover ads, its most valuable real estate, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/tiktok-is-jacking-up-prices-as-it-builds-its-ad-business?sref=gni836kR">to more than $2 million</a> on top days &#8212; like holidays. Reuters also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tiktoks-us-ad-business-roars-back-trumps-threats-recede-2021-02-16/">noted</a> that TikTok saw a 500% increase in the number of advertisers that were running campaigns in the U.S. from the start of 2020 to the end, though ad sales were still small compared with other major platforms.</p>

<p>That continues to be the case in 2021, as TikTok&#8217;s U.S. ad revenues are dwarfed by other social brands. In fact, TikTok was not even broken out in eMarketer&#8217;s recent tabulation of U.S. ad revenues, where it&#8217;s instead lumped into an &#8220;Other&#8221; category with other, smaller social networks which, combined, are expected to reach $1.3 billion in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All kinds of teams are raising venture funds these days, so don&#8217;t be surprised to see more investors from corporate venture firms decide to create their own outfits, too.</p>
<p>They might look to <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://counterpart.vc/">Counterpart Ventures </a>for inspiration. Founded by Patrick Eggen and Joe Saijo, the three-year-old, San Francisco-based outfit just closed a $110 million fund after investing a small amount across four companies as a kind of trial fund.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a decent amount of capital for a young outfit, but limited partners (who the firm isn&#8217;t naming) clearly like the partners&#8217; track records. Eggen launched Qualcomm Ventures&#8217;s Bay Area practice back in 2005, and when he left the outfit in the spring of 2018, he was the managing partner for all of North America.</p>
<p>While there are lots of reasons startups might want to hitch their wagon to Qualcomm &#8212; and Matterport, Noom and Cruise Automation are among those that did while Eggen was running the show &#8212; he does take some credit for persuading Qualcomm to invest in Zoom&#8217;s Series A round at a time when a lot of other venture firms didn&#8217;t see room for yet another video conferencing company in the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Saijo is no slouch, either. After spending several years in business development at Hitachi, he later became the president and managing partner at Recruit Strategic Partners, the corporate arm of Japan&#8217;s Recruit Holdings. According to his bio, his most notable investments include Palo Alto Networks, DocuSign, 99designs, DataRobot, ShipBob and (along with Qualcomm Ventures) Noom.</p>
<p>Surely, the networks of Eggen and Saijo are also a big draw for investors. Not only have they met hundreds &#8212; maybe thousands &#8212; of founders over their years in corporate VC, but corporate VC is its own not-so-little club, and the pair say they&#8217;ve actively fostered relationships with corporate venture arms, including hosting private events for the CVC community.</p>
<p>As for areas of focus, Counterpart &#8212; which is also run by senior associate Mikey Kailis &#8212; is focused on B2B SaaS, marketplace and mobility startups, and looks to lead or co-lead what it calls the “tweener” round, before a company&#8217;s Series A or Series B round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among its newest bets are <a href="http://www.cloudbeds.com/">Cloudbeds</a>, <a href="http://www.intricately.com/">Intricately</a> and<a href="http://www.prismosystems.com"> Prismo Systems</a>, deals it funded at the Series B, Series A and Series B stages, respectively.</p>

		Arthur Nobel is an entrepreneur turned investor, now working as principal at <a href="https://www.knight.capital/">Knight Capital</a> in Amsterdam, specializing in scaling companies. He started his career at Rocket Internet before holding various growth roles across Europe. Co-author of the book "Leaders of Growth," he also hosts its related podcast.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The T2D3 (triple, triple, double, double, double) acronym has become a well-known goal in the startup scene for achieving unicorn status. Formulating the goal can be easy, but realizing such tremendous revenue growth is notoriously difficult.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://dealroom.co/uploaded/2020/08/Probability-2.pdf">study</a> from Dealroom shows that about 16% of the companies that raise a seed round manage to raise a Series B investment, and only about 7% of those that raise seed funding raise a Series C investment.</p>
<p>This statistic is partially explained by a lack of a good organizational framework for scaling companies across seed to Series C. There is a lot of great content on the startup phase (getting to product-market fit) and success stories (raising hundreds of millions of dollars and multibillion dollar exits), but there is little available on how founders can grow a company from $1 million to $25 million in annual revenues (broadly defined as the Series A, B and C stages).</p>
<p>Based on 47 interviews with industry experts including Sean Ellis, Mark Roberge, Bill Macaitis, Micha Breakstone and Brian Requarth, desk research and our own experience as founders and investors in Series A to C companies, we have derived three major insights about how to scale a company from the organizational perspective. Here&#8217;s our framework:</p>
<h2>Scaling is a continuum with maturity stages</h2>
<p>A fast-scaling company with revenue of $5 million revenue has different scaling needs compared to a fast-scaling startup with $15 million in revenue. The concept of &#8220;maturity stages&#8221; for scaling a company can be useful to address the different needs.</p>
<p>The most common &#8220;maturity stages&#8221; of scaling a company are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ad hoc.</li>
<li>Basic process.</li>
<li>Repeatable process.</li>
<li>Predictable process.</li>
<li>At scale.</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2210543" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210543" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2210543" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png" alt="" width="1024" height="626" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png 1219w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png?resize=768,469 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png?resize=680,416 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210543" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Knight Capital</p></div></p>
<p>Typically, for a seed-stage company, everything is developed in a more or less ad-hoc manner. At the Series A stage, it’s more about developing repeatable processes. Series B and C are about predictability of outcomes. Beyond Series C, it’s about doing everything at scale.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a companywide view. As we argue below, this can be different for individual departments. For example, a company at a &#8220;repeatability&#8221; stage that generates inbound leads through digital marketing efforts and has an enterprise sales department will often have a much more mature marketing department compared to sales.</p>
<p>The takeaway is to initially figure out in which stage your company and departments are in and only do what is required for that stage.</p>
<h2>The challenges to scaling</h2>
<p>You scale a company, from an organizational perspective, by overcoming numerous challenges. We believe that these challenges can be largely categorized into five buckets:</p>
<ol>
<li>KPIs and data.</li>
<li>People.</li>
<li>Documentation and enablement.</li>
<li>Processes.</li>
<li>Tooling.</li>
</ol>
<p>We believe it is best to approach these challenges on the departmental and subdepartmental levels to make it workable.</p>
<h3>KPIs and data</h3>
<p>Data-informed decision-making is particularly important in the T2D3 journey. It is important to realize that different KPIs are relevant at different stages. First, focus on the right metrics for your stage. An LTV:CAC metric (lifetime value to acquisition costs) is less relevant for a seed company than retention.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arctic-wolf-networks">Arctic Wolf</a>, a managed cybersecurity company that offers a “security operations-as-a-concierge” service, has acquired Habitu8, a security training and awareness content platform.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/arctic-wolf-series-f/">which comes just two months after Arctic Wolf secured $150 million in Series F funding</a> &#8212; were not announced, but a person with knowledge of the matter told TechCrunch that it was paid for with a combination of cash and equity. Arctic Wolf will acquire between 60 and 70 customers as a result of the takeover, the source added.</p>
<p>Habitu8 was co-founded in 2017 by Jason Hoenich, who previously led security training initiatives at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sony-pictures-entertainment/">Sony Pictures Entertainment</a>, Walt Disney and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/activision-blizzard/">Activision Blizzard</a>. The startup, which has completed three rounds of funding, takes a &#8220;Hollywood-style&#8221; approach to cybersecurity awareness, comprising live-action videos, which it claims has proven effective in fortifying the human element in security.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As a result of the acquisition, Habitu8&#8217;s Learning Platform<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>will be combined with Arctic Wolf’s Managed Security Awareness offering (which the company tells TechCrunch has been delivered to “hundreds” of customers since it debuted in May this year) to create the industry’s first security awareness and training program delivered as a concierge service.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“We know that training and awareness programs are a cornerstone in ending cyber risk,” said Nick Schneider, president and CEO of Arctic Wolf. “Unfortunately, the content that most security programs offer is low-grade, often tedious, and ultimately doesn’t effectively serve the needs of modern users who expect on-demand and high-quality experiences like Netflix.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“With the addition of Habitu8 to the Arctic Wolf Platform, we will deliver modern, high-quality security awareness and training programs as a managed service, which, combined with our expert concierge guidance, will significantly strengthen customers’ overall security operations.”</p>
<p>Hoenich will also join the Arctic Wolf team as vice president of Service Delivery and will lead security awareness management and delivery.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Data tells us that humans need ongoing, engaging and memorable content to retain and resonate with training concepts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am confident that combining the power of Arctic Wolf Managed Security Awareness and the Arctic Wolf Platform with our Hollywood-style content will make this the most effective and sought-after solution on the market for customers of all sizes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Arctic Wolf&#8217;s takeover of Habitu8 is likely the first of many acquisitions on the company&#8217;s roadmap; in July, the company told TechCrunch that it plans to do &#8220;between five and 10 acquisitions&#8221; over the next 12 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kevin Ryan &#8212; the New York-based investor and entrepreneur who first rose to prominence as CEO of the early online ad business DoubleClick &#8212; could have launched or joined a traditional venture firm many years ago. Instead, he has launched one company after another with largely his own capital at the outset to get them going. Think Business Insider and Gilt Groupe, MongoDB and Zola.</p>
<p>Ryan is still at it, investing a $500 million evergreen fund with primarily personal capital through a growing team that also chips into the fund and helps him both fund startups as well as incubate them. Interestingly, despite that Ryan has no background in healthcare, more of those dollars have been moving into healthcare, too. His investment firm, <a href="https://alleycorp.com/">AlleyCorp</a>, has already made 20 healthcare-related bets in recent years. Now, it&#8217;s carving out $100 million for a new fund to double down on the sector.</p>
<p>The fund, chaired by Ryan, is being led by Brenton Fargnoli, M.D., a one-time resident physician at Brigham &amp; Women&#8217;s Hospital in Boston who was able to arrange a research elective with Flatiron Health back in 2016, which brought him to New York and into the world of entrepreneurship. (Fargnoli later did double duty, working as a medical director at Flatiron and also as an attending physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.)</p>
<p>Fargnoli is being joined by another M.D., Jeff De Flavio, a physician-entrepreneur who has launched numerous companies, including <a class="dy ie" href="http://www.jointempest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Tempest</a>, a holistic alcohol recovery program backed by AlleyCorp, and <a href="https://pearlhealth.com/">Pearl Health</a>, a primary care physicians group that he created inside of AlleyCorp and which just received <a href="https://pearlhealth.com/blog/pearl-strands/pearl-health-raises-18m-led-by-a16z-to-create-an-efficient-marketplace-for-healthcare-risk/">Series A backing</a> led by Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>The team also includes medical students Omar Njie and Sherman Leung, as well as Jane Suh, who previously worked at Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>We talked earlier this week with Fargnoli, who said the broad idea with the new fund is to focus on startups that are improving quality of care for patients, increasing access to care for patients and decreasing costs, writing initial checks of $1 million to $3 million.</p>
<p>We also talked at some length about the small but growing world of physician entrepreneurship, into which Fargnoli was himself pulled by Krishna Yeshwant, a physician, programmer, and general partner at GV who completed his own residency at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, where he practiced for several years and where he apparently remains an inspiration to others. &#8220;Everyone knows Krishna,&#8221; said Fargnoli.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, he said that AlleyCorp now has nine &#8220;doctorpreneurs&#8221; across its portfolio and that Ryan, just before the pandemic, organized a gathering of 100 doctor physicians at his home. &#8220;It&#8217;s really part of this next generation [of healthcare] that merges the clinical with the tech,&#8221; noted Fargnoli.</p>
<p>Certainly, AlleyCorp isn&#8217;t alone in seeing a huge opportunity in healthcare and turning to physicians for help in both understanding underserved areas of their industries, as well as helping to suss out solutions. In addition to healthcare-focused funds that have for years brought doctors into the fold, generalist firms like Andreessen Horowitz have also been more aggressively hiring doctors into the firm. Among them: Vineeta Agarwala, one of a16z&#8217;s newer general partners, who earlier in her career saw patients. She led the firm&#8217;s investment in Pearl Health, in fact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.voodoo.io">Voodoo</a> has made a significant acquisition in the casual mobile gaming market. The company is acquiring <a href="https://www.bbumgames.com">Beach Bum</a>, a game studio based in Israel and specialized in tabletop and card games.</p>
<p>It’s hard to get a clear number for this acquisition as Voodoo is offering both cash and shares and there are some retention bonuses. According to a source, Voodoo could be paying a few hundred million dollars in total. Beach Bum has generated $70 million in revenue over the past 12 months, so that gives you an idea of the size of the deal.</p>
<p>Voodoo is better known for its <a href="https://www.voodoo.io/games">hyper-casual games</a>, such as Helix Jump, Crowd City, Hole.io or Paper.io 2. The company is both a game developer and publisher. It partners with other game studios and has built a tech stack to optimize distribution, average revenue per user and more.</p>
<p>The company has raised money <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/tencent-takes-minority-stake-in-french-casual-games-maker-voodoo/">from Tencent</a> and Goldman Sachs. More recently, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert invested €266 million ($309 million at today’s exchange rate) in Voodoo. It values the company at €1.7 billion (nearly $2 billion).</p>
<p>Voodoo didn’t waste any time and started looking at acquisition targets for external growth opportunities right after raising some fresh capital. Right now, there are 350 people working for Voodoo. Beach Bum has 150 employees who will join Voodoo.</p>
<p>With today’s acquisition, Voodoo is expanding to a new segment, adding a handful of casual games to its hyper-casual catalog. Beach Bum currently has three games in the App Store — Backgammon (Lord of the Board), Spades Royale and Gin Rummy Stars.</p>
<p>The business model is also a bit different. Historically, Voodoo has mostly relied on advertising to monetize its games. Beach Bum focuses on in-app purchases instead. This way, the acquisition diversifies Voodoo’s revenue sources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“[Beach Bum] has two more games in development right now. The intention of Voodoo is to use Beach Bum as their entrance into in-app purchases. So I think they’ll want Beach Bum to put out as many games as possible,” Gigi Levy-Weiss told me.</p>
<p>Gigi Levy-Weiss is a general partner at VC firm <a href="https://www.nfx.com">NFX</a> and co-founded Beach Bum back in 2015. He doesn’t currently have an operational role at the gaming company but he is active chairman of the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Israeli gaming industry has grown significantly in the recent few years. To date, it counts 400 different companies. Few exits have taken place, mainly by European and Asian buyers. A few months ago, an Israeli gaming company <a href="https://www.playtika.com">Playtika</a> IPOed at Nasdaq for the valuation of $11B,&#8221; Avihai Michaeli, a senior investment banker based in Tel Aviv, told me.</p>

Financial terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed. Rumors that Sony was buying Bluepoint started to spread online right around the time the company acquired <em>Returnal</em> developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque-104158645.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Housemarque</a> in late June.

<p>“PlayStation has such an iconic gaming catalog and for us there’s been nothing better than to bring some of gaming’s masterpieces to new players,” said Marco Thrush, the president of Bluepoint Games. “Becoming a part of PlayStation Studios empowers our team to raise the quality-bar even further and create even more impactful experiences for the PlayStation community.”</p>
<p>With the announcement of today’s deal, Sony has acquired three studios in the past year. That number increases to four over more than two years if you include its 2019 purchase of <em>Spider-Man</em> developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-19-sony-interactive-snaps-up-spider-man-developer-insomniac-games.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Insomniac Games</a>. That’s a significant change of pace for a company that was previously much slower to buy up external developers to bolster its first-party lineup. But then a lot has changed in just the last year. Microsoft’s recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-buys-zenimax-bethesda-id-arkane-131006192.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">$7.5 billion deal</a> to buy Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media means many highly anticipated games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starfield-xbox-series-x-s-pc-novemeber-11-2022-164701716.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><em>Starfield</em></a> aren’t coming to PlayStation anymore. Sony needs the kind of talent that’s at Bluepoint to keep pace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blockchain cybersecurity startup <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin</a> this morning announced a $23 million investment in <a href="https://forta.org/">Forta</a>, a security service aimed at smart contracts.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz led the round, which OpenZeppelin CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/demibrener">Demian Brener</a> described as 3x oversubscribed. The investment also attracted capital from Coinbase Ventures, True Ventures and Blockchain Capital, among others.</p>
<p>Per Brener, OpenZeppelin will retain a stake in Forta.</p>
<p>Forta is a neat project that comes at an interesting point for the larger blockchain community. When bitcoin came to market, it attracted interest as a potential medium of exchange, or perhaps a store of value. The latter use case wound up being the key bitcoin value offering. But while bitcoin was maturing, other blockchains were built that featured more native programmability, allowing developers around the world to leverage smart (self-executing) contracts for a host of use cases.</p>
<p>Ethereum is one of the best-known blockchains to feature smart contracts, which <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/">its foundation describes</a> simply as &#8220;program[s] that [run] on the Ethereum blockchain.&#8221; There&#8217;s more nuance to the matter, but that will suffice for our needs today. Forta, in turn, wants to help secure smart contracts across the blockchain market.</p>
<p>We summarized it as an attempt to build Web 3.0 security using Web 3.0 DNA when we were chatting with Brener, and he agreed. By that, we mean that Forta isn&#8217;t precisely the sort of company that TechCrunch tends to write about when it comes to venture capital fundraises; instead, Forta is nearly an attempt to empower a community of developers to build the tooling that they need to keep their own projects secure.</p>
<p>The heart of Forta, Brener explained, is a community of &#8220;agent writers,&#8221; or developers creating pieces of code that hunt up threats &#8212; on layer-one or -two chains, and sidechains &#8212; that fall into one of four main buckets of risk, namely cybersecurity, financial, operational or governance. The other half of the Forta project is nodes, or essentially what runs the agents themselves.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Per OpenZeppelin, lots of the code used to write Forta agents will be repurposable, which could help code get written once and then deployed with variations to many chains. This is what Brener means when he thinks of Forta as helping developers in the larger blockchain world help themselves.</p>
<p>And the concept is not idle. Per a release from Forta, the team behind the project thinks that the &#8220;pace of innovation on public blockchains&#8221; is rapid enough that no &#8220;centralized solution can effectively address these evolving risks.&#8221; So, threats attacking the decentralized market will have to be solved, in Forta&#8217;s view, by even more decentralized activity.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was obviously curious how the Forta project would make money. Brener said that for the project to become a business, it will need to first help its community thrive. Part of that is opening its doors a little more today, allowing more developers than it did during its private beta to write agents.</p>
<p>Presuming that Forta can attract as many developers as it hopes, it will become a centralized source of smart contract security tooling. From that point, making money won&#8217;t be impossible, though it will be interesting to see precisely what business model Forta eventually chooses.</p>
<p>On the point of organizational centrality, Forta is today run by a set of folks. In time, the company could become a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, Brener said. If that bears out, the blockchain community will have managed to take external capital and internal knowledge, blended the two into a development community, and built not only security tooling for smart contracts, but managed to do so under the auspices of its own smart contract (DAO). So, this is at once a venture capital story and also a meta-moment for how far the crypto world has come in terms of taking care of itself.</p>
<p>I am sure that at some point in the above paragraphs I got something slightly wrong. Such is the risk of covering nascent efforts to build security tooling for the cutting-edges of the digital economy. But what matters more than any particular quibble is that the blockchain world is working to build the tools it needs to keep smart contracts safe; by doing so, using smart contracts should become less risky. And less risk means more market appetite.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s something that a16z, with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/a16zs-new-2-2b-fund-wont-just-bet-on-the-crypto-future-it-will-defend-it/">huge crypto-focused bets</a>, and companies like Coinbase are more than in favor of. The dollars flowing toward Forta are a rounding error for its wealthy backers, even if its possible impact on their favorite market might be anything but.</p>

		Chelsey Colbert is policy counsel at the <a href="https://fpf.org/">Future of Privacy Forum</a>. Chelsey leads FPF’s portfolio on mobility and location data, which includes connected and automated vehicles, ride-sharing, micromobility, drones, delivery robots and mobility data sharing.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In recent years, rows of electric scooters and bikes lining sidewalks have become a common sight in cities around the United States.</p>
<p>The size of the e-scooter market alone is expected <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-il/publications/2019/promise-pitfalls-e-scooter-sharing">to surpass</a> $40 billion by 2025, and Americans have taken more than <a href="https://nacto.org/shared-micromobility-2019/">342 million</a> trips on shared bikes and e-scooters since 2010.</p>
<p>Micromobility services generate a massive amount of mobility data, including potentially sensitive precise location data about users. Data from mobility services can provide valuable and timely insights to guide transportation and infrastructure policy, but the sharing of sensitive mobility data &#8212; between companies or between and with government agencies &#8212; can only be justified if issues of privacy and public trust are first addressed.</p>
<p>Innovative mobility options are providing cities with opportunities to solve the <a href="https://escooternerds.com/last-mile-transportation-electric-scooter/">last-mile transportation problem</a>, and the data from these services has a range of <a href="https://policydata.numo.global/">productive uses</a>.</p>
<p>It can help city planners design transportation improvements, such as protected bike lanes, to keep users safe. Access to mobility data gives community advocates and government officials the ability to know in nearly real time how many mobility devices are in a certain area so cities can enforce limits to ensure neighborhoods are not overcrowded or underserved. This data can also <a href="https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/about-mds/">streamline communications</a> between companies and city governments, making it easier for mobility services to quickly adapt to events and emergencies in cities.</p>
<p>However, there are valid privacy concerns over the granularity and quantity of data that digitally enabled mobility services are able to collect and request to share with governments.</p>
<p>For example, a recent <a href="https://www.aclusocal.org/en/cases/sanchez-v-los-angeles-department-transportation">lawsuit</a> filed against the Los Angeles Department of Transportation and the City of Los Angeles alleges that the city’s collection of e-scooter trip data through the <a href="https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/about-mds/">Mobility Data Specification</a> violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act. A lower court <a href="https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/2021/08/03/clinic-files-technologists-brief-in-ninth-circuit-scooter-privacy-case/">dismissed the lawsuit</a> and the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU of Northern and Southern California recently asked a federal appeals court to <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-aclu-urge-appeals-court-revive-challenge-los-angeles-collection-scooter-riders?s">revive it</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Additionally, a bill recently <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB859">introduced</a> in the California Legislature would require specific conditions to be met before mobility data is shared with public agencies or contractors. Under this bill, data could only be shared to assist transportation planning or protect the safety of users. The bill also requires that any trip data must be more than 24 hours old before being shared.</p>
<p>Near-real-time <a href="https://fpf.org/blog/a-closer-look-at-location-data-privacy-and-pandemics/">location data</a> is often required to fulfill valid safety and regulatory enforcement purposes, but this data is very sensitive because it could reveal intimate aspects of an individual’s life. Patterns in location data could indicate personal habits, interpersonal relationships or religious practices.</p>
<p>While it is possible in some cases to “de-identify” location data tied to a specific individual or device, it is incredibly difficult to truly make any data set of precise location history truly anonymous. Even highly aggregated location data about patterns of large groups of people can unintentionally reveal sensitive information.</p>
<p>In 2017, a “global heat map” of user movement in the Strava fitness app inadvertently <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/strava-heat-map-military-bases-fitness-trackers-privacy/">revealed the location</a> of deployed military personnel in classified locations. Location data, even when de-identified or aggregated, should be subject to checks and controls to ensure the data remains protected and private.</p>
<p>Local governments and mobility companies are taking these issues of user privacy seriously. Over the past few months, the<a href="https://fpf.org/"> Future of Privacy Forum</a> has worked with SAE’s <a href="https://mdc.sae-itc.com/">Mobility Data Collaborative</a> and public and private stakeholders to create a<a href="https://fpf.org/blog/fpf-and-mobility-data-collaborative-release-resources-to-help-organizations-assess-the-privacy-risks-of-sharing-of-mobility-data/"> transportation-tailored privacy assessment tool</a> that focuses on considerations for organizations that want to share mobility data in a privacy-sensitive manner.</p>
<p>The Mobility Data Sharing Assessment (MDSA) provides organizations in both the public and private sectors with operational guidance to conduct thoughtful, in-depth legal and privacy reviews of their data-sharing processes. Organizations that use this tool for sharing mobility data will be able to embed privacy and equity considerations into the design of mobility data-sharing agreements.</p>
<p>The goal of the MDSA is to enable responsible data sharing that protects individual privacy, respects community interests and equities, and encourages transparency to the public. By equipping organizations with an open-source, interoperable, customizable and voluntary framework that includes guidance, the barriers to sharing mobility data will be reduced.</p>
<p>This is the first version of the MDSA tool; it focuses specifically on ground-based mobility devices and location data. Some mobility vehicles like e-scooters now come equipped with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/19/e-scooter-pedestrian-detection-voi/">on-board cameras</a>, so in the future, the MDSA may be appended to add guidance about images and video collected by mobility devices.</p>
<p>The MDSA tool is open source and customizable, so organizations sharing this type of mobility data can edit it to consider the risks and benefits of sharing sensor or camera data that includes images.</p>
<p>Micromobility services can play a key role in improving access to jobs, food and health care. However, there are multiple factors for companies and government agencies to consider before sharing mobility data with other organizations, including the precision, immediacy and type of data shared. Organizations must assess these factors in a thoughtful, structured manner that considers any potential sources of bias.</p>
<p>That’s the key to using mobility data to maximize the benefits of services in the short term and build their infrastructure in the long term, allowing people to move about cities safer and faster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">At last year&#8217;s inaugural <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633015242487000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHor_VGE6KntM1F3I-krw4ZtxLP_g">Sight Tech Global </a>event, a virtual event dedicated to applications of AI and related tech to accessibility for people who are blind, one of the most popular sessions belonged to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saqibshaikh/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/saqibshaikh/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633015242487000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtrz_VaQtePncD9TSRSG6Bq9B3PA">Saqib Shaikh</a>. The Microsoft engineer co-founded and leads the Seeing AI mobile app, which embeds a remarkable number of services beneficial to people who are blind, from reading documents and signs, to recognizing friends, grocery items, currency notes and even exploring photos by touch.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re delighted that Shaikh will make a return appearance at this year&#8217;s Sight Tech Global. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633015242487000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFYrWaYGskT0MQWNDjw1im9s8Cr-w">Register now</a> for the free, virtual event on December 1-2.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Shaikh describes his work as &#8220;a conversation between the blind community and the engineers/scientists at Microsoft &#8212; understanding the daily challenges our customers face and what emerging technologies could be leveraged to create novel solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the past year, Shaikh&#8217;s team has been adding features at a fast pace. Most recently they have created an audio augmented reality experience to assist with exploring an unfamiliar environment. It recognizes things in the world and places them in 3D space. When wearing headphones, items will be announced from their position in the room, such as the word &#8220;chair&#8221; coming from the chair itself. Users can place virtual audio beacons on objects to track the location of the door, for example, and use the haptic proximity sensor to feel the outline of the room.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">All of this is made possible by combining the latest advances in AR, computer vision and the iPhone 12 Pro&#8217;s lidar sensor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At Sight Tech Global, Shaikh will discuss the Seeing AI team&#8217;s work to combine these remarkable technologies that promise to improve the independence of folks with vision loss, and describe the team&#8217;s latest steps toward this audio augmented reality experience, and paint a vision for the future of assistive agents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let’s talk about arms for a second. Or, rather, let’s talk about a lack of arms. It’s a common thread between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/04/the-lonely-death-of-jibo-the-social-robot/">Jibo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/kuri-maker-mayfield-robotics-will-cease-operations-in-october/">Kuri</a> and now Astro. I suppose one could make the argument that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/the-owner-of-ankis-assets-plans-to-relaunch-cozmo-and-vector-this-year/">Anki’s Cozmo</a> had arms of a kind, but the overhead forklift wasn’t good for much beyond hooking into a proprietary block.</p>
<p>Arms &#8212; or, rather, mobile manipulators, are hard. They’re a second-generation problem. Or maybe a third or fourth. Once you’ve proven out that enough people are interested in your new little home robot, then you can have those frank discussions about how much R&amp;D you want to dump into a pair of arms that can dust the counter and make sure your magazines are in an orderly pile without breaking down every two days. Maybe arms are when you start scanning the periphery for possible startup acquisitions.</p>
<p>To hear Amazon talk about it, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/why-amazon-built-a-home-robot/">Astro was created</a> without the aid of acquiring any specific companies. A lot of &#8220;ground up&#8221; development was required for what has thus far been a four-year project, most notably, the in-house development of a SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) system, so the robot knows where it is and where it’s going. And while the department worked with Amazon Robotics, the company’s industrial automation wing born out of its 2012 purchase of Kiva Systems, on-board technology from its autonomous cart system Canvas apparently didn’t factor in.</p>

<p>Credit to the person on Twitter who compared Astro’s look to a tablet mounted on a vacuum canister. We had, um, a lot of feedback on the site, but that was one of the more amusing comments and I think it &#8212; perhaps unintentionally &#8212; gets to something deeper about the $1,000/$1,500 robot. Astro exists at this kind of perfect nexus of Amazon hardware efforts, from Ring security to Echo Show.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s common refrain of “Alexa on wheels” isn’t entirely off-base. Astro is a kind of baby step into a world of more ubiquitous home robotics. There’s a consensus among many that we’ll get there in five, 10 or 15 years, but the most immediate question is how we get there &#8212; which is to say, what are the immediate stepping stones? For iRobot, it’s leveraging the home mapping of robotic vacuums and using that in tandem with home assistants like Alexa or Google. For Amazon, Alexa is that foundation.</p>

<p>These are both fairly solid foundations from the standpoint of relative ubiquity. Pulling from some third-party research from last year, around a quarter of U.S. adults live with a smart speaker, and of those, almost 70% use Alexa. But even with numbers like that, the jump from Echo to Astro is still a big one. But credit to Amazon for giving it a go, even if its track record has made many consumers understandably weary of the messenger.</p>
<p>I spent a little time with Astro last week ahead of the launch and was impressed by what Amazon put together here. I wasn’t $1,500 worth of impressed. Pricing is going to be a pretty big hump to get over here (all of the caveats about that eventually coming down if Amazon can scale it), but the built quality is high and Astro is a clever combination of existing Amazon product lines, a few years of hard work and some clever workarounds like the periscope camera that pops out of the robot’s head.</p>

<p>There are questions swirling around whether a $1,500 robot can ever be a mainstream product from a company that trades in consumer electronics commodities (hell, I ask one below), but there&#8217;s a sense in which that is almost besides the point. It seems extremely unlikely that there will be an Astro in every home, but it does mean that Amazon is able to plant a flag here. Sure Samsung shows off a bunch of helper robots each year at CES, but until proven otherwise, they amount to little more than hypotheticals.</p>
<p>With Astro, Amazon announced a robot that&#8217;s going on sale soon &#8212; price prohibitive and invite-only as it may be. There&#8217;s a sense in which that&#8217;s a win in and of itself. Certainly Amazon hardware ambitions won&#8217;t live or die by the Astro&#8217;s success. Once they begin rolling out, the company could potentially have access to the largest wide scale home robotics trial for anything without a vacuum attached.</p>
<p>As Amazon Device VP Charlie Tritschler notes in our conversation below, Astro finds the company taking the first step toward a broader world of home robotics. Ultimately, Amazon&#8217;s consumer robotics might not look like Astro at all.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s start with the ‘why.’ Why is this something Amazon is actively pursuing?</strong></p>
<p>Given the fact that Amazon is always focused on customer experience, one of the things we look at is what are the upcoming technologies that can impact what’s available? In a senior meeting a few years ago, we were talking about just that. We talked about AI, computer vision, processing power. One of the topics that came up was robotics. How have robotics changed to make it possible now for consumers. We have a lot of experience using robotics in our fulfillment centers, of course, and we thought about what can we do to make robotics in the home more convenient for consumers or provide peace of mind as part of the experience. That started us thinking about it, and by the end, we were saying, ‘does anyone in the room think that we won’t have robots in the home in five to 10 years?’ And everyone said, ‘yeah, we will.’</p>
<p><strong>Obviously there are already Roombas in a lot of homes, but those are robots that do one very specific thing. I assume you began by looking beyond that application?</strong></p>
<p>The three big things that we saw ourselves that were confirmed with our beta testers were home monitoring &#8212; that’s both security and the ability to check in on the home remotely. The second is the ability to care for loved ones, especially when they’re remote and you can’t care for them all the time. And the third was Alexa: being able to take Alexa and being able to add intelligent mobility to give it new capabilities around the home.</p>

<p><strong>How much of the robot was built from scratch?</strong></p>
<p>Tough to give you a specific number, but the vast majority of it. We learned a lot, especially early on in the program, from other parts of the company. We already had robotics experience, like Amazon Robotics, who primarily focus on the fulfillment center and are looking at efficiency and making jobs easier. But we recognized as we started doing the work that to conquer the domain that is is the home &#8212; every home is different, every home changes all the time, as people move things around, put things down, drop a chair on the floor, put a backpack somewhere. So the team started looking at that and we realized we had to create our own SLAM experience.</p>
<p><strong>Nothing on the robot was the direct result of an acquisition?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>It struck me that Amazon’s purchase of Canvas would make sense from the standpoint of creating this fully autonomous [robot].</strong></p>
<p>If there’s tools that make sense &#8212; if there’s a simulation tool or other pieces, of course we will take advantage of those internal capabilities wherever possible, but the unique demands of creating a robot for the home means that we really did have to do a lot of invention to create the solution for consumers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208851" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208851" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2208851" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208851" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p><strong>What were the biggest challenges in developing Astro?</strong></p>
<p>Where can I start? One of the topics is just figuring out how do you conquer the technical problems. There were just so many places where we really needed to invent and create, which is hard to predict. You have to go in and start the work. We had many places during the development where we would go down a path, stop, come back, start, rethink and redo. So the overall complexity of the experience from a development perspective and all of the interdependencies between different systems were some of the biggest areas we had to overcome.</p>
<p><strong>What has the primary failing of home robotics been to this point?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think it’s failings. I think it’s just that we’ve taken a slightly different approach, which is we focused on what the end value is that we’re trying to create. And then we brought to bear all of the learnings that we have as Amazon with our robotics abilities and then applied all of our Amazon assets as well, like Alexa, Ring, Alexa Care or Amazon Kids.</p>
<p><strong>At what point was it clear this is something you could/should bring to market?</strong></p>
<p>We had the vision of it early on, but I think for me it was the very first time I saw it actually navigate a room by itself. Up until then, we thought we could do it. We’re smart people, we’re working on it. But to see it actually happen and move gracefully and avoid obstacles, when you place something in front of it. I knew that some of the core things that had to be true to make this work were achievable.</p>

<p><strong>Were there any major failings in the testing process that caused you to circle back?</strong></p>
<p>There were[…] SLAM, for instance, took a long time to get to the point where we could get it working well enough. People would say, &#8216;it stopped in the corner. I don’t know why, but it went over there and stopped.&#8217; SLAM had some issues.</p>
<p><strong>Do you anticipate the pricing will remain the same when Astro is available in a more mainstream way?</strong></p>
<p>Hard to know. I think that’s part of what we’ll hear from customers. Obviously, Amazon has a history of trying to provide more value to customers over time, and as the whole space of robotics and sensors come down, we will pass that onto the customer.</p>
<p><strong>You had the conversation four years ago when you said robotics would be mainstream in five to 10 years. We’re pushing right up against that deadline. Do you envision Astro as a mainstream product or a stepping stone?</strong></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s the first of the robot series that we’re doing. That’s why it’s an invite-only program. We want to make sure that people that get Astro have a great experience with it, given the challenges of homes and different spaces. We think long-term when we think of consumer robotics. We want to have all different kinds of price points and capabilities and have a more directed mainstream product as part of that.</p>

<p>All right, I think that’s probably enough words about Amazon’s $1,500 home robot for now &#8212; at least until we spend some more time with the product, which will hopefully be in reasonably short order.</p>
<p>So we go out of the home and into the field for a pair of agtech raises. The first one, from Iron Ox, just missed the deadline for last week’s roundup, but it’s an interesting company doing interesting things in agtech that are worth mentioning here. The Bay Area firm isn’t strictly a robotics company, but the technology does play a big role in what it does.</p>

<p>Effectively, the company runs a robotic greenhouse as a “closed loop system” designed to grow produce with a significantly smaller environmental footprint than traditional farming &#8212; including a 90% reduction in water. Iron Ox just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/robotic-farming-firm-iron-ox-raises-53m/">announced</a> a $53 million Series C, which will go toward ramping up manufacturing, R&amp;D and making a bunch of new hires.</p>
<p>Burro, meanwhile, is a company that first hit my radar as Augean Robotics. The company participated in a TechCrunch pitch-off ahead of our 2020 Robotics event. Always cool to see a startup level-up like that. This week it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/burro-raises-10-9m-for-autonomous-produce-field-transport/">announced</a> a $10.9 million raise for its autonomous cart system, which is designed to relieve the burden of carrying crops for overworked field hands.</p>

<p>The technology, which Burro calls “pop-up autonomy,” makes a lot of sense in a world where there were labor constraints even prior to the pandemic. The company currently has around 90 robots in the field, which plans to expand to more than 500 next year.</p>
<p>Looping back around to a very different set of robotic arms, <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/business-technology-robotics-a03ec89db139ba6d7f936a8c8e52bfd3">GrayMatter this week</a> announced a $4.1 million seed round, co-led by Stage Venture Partners and Calibrate Ventures and featuring 3M Ventures, OCA Ventures, Pathbreaker Ventures and B Capital Group. Founded in 2020, the company leverages robotic systems to help manufacturers finish surfaces.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is shocking that millions of people still manually work on extremely tedious tasks that can be harmful to their health; younger generations do not want such jobs,&#8221; CEO Ariyan Kabir said in a release. &#8220;We want to improve shop workers&#8217; lives, enhance their productivity, and enable them to focus on higher-value tasks. Manufacturing drives our economy, and without automating surface finishing and treatment, there is a significant risk the global economy may suffer due to an increasing labor shortage.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A U.K. law firm is bringing a class-action style claim over a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/04/concerns-raised-over-broad-scope-of-deepmind-nhs-health-data-sharing-deal/">patient health data scandal</a> that dates back to 2015 and involves the Google-owned AI company DeepMind, after it was quietly passed medical information on more than a million patients by an NHS Trust as part of an app development project.</p>
<p>Law firm Mishcon de Reya <a href="https://www.mishcon.com/news/confidential-medical-records-at-the-centre-of-a-new-claim-against-google">announced</a> the legal action today, saying a &#8220;representative action&#8221; has been filed on behalf of a U.K. citizen, called Mr Andrew Prismall, and the approximately 1.6 million others whose confidential medical records were obtained by DeepMind/Google without their knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>Google and the Royal Free NHS Trust have been contacted for comment on the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/google-confirms-its-pulling-the-plug-on-streams-its-uk-clinician-support-app/">TechCrunch reported</a> that Google was pulling the plug on the clinician support app, Streams, which was developed by DeepMind and the London-based Royal Free NHS Trust starting in 2015.</p>
<p>The Streams app was rolled out for use by clinicians at the Royal Free and a handful of other NHS Trusts. However, the Royal Free was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/uk-data-regulator-says-deepminds-initial-deal-with-the-nhs-broke-privacy-law/">sanctioned in 2017</a> by the U.K.&#8217;s data protection watchdog, the ICO, for breaching data protection rules when it passed patients&#8217; sensitive medical information to the Google-owned company during the development phrase of the app.</p>
<p>In a press release today, Mishcon de Reya described the lawsuit as an &#8220;important step in seeking to address the very real public concerns about large-scale access to, and use of, private health data by technology companies&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It also raises issues regarding the precise status and responsibility of such technology companies in the data protection context, both in this specific case, and potentially more generally,&#8221; the firm added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During the height of the COVID-19 crisis last year, the U.K. government inked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/uks-covid-19-health-data-contracts-with-google-and-palantir-finally-emerge/">a number of health data processing contracts with tech giants, including Google and Palantir</a> &#8212; and those deals have also faced concern and criticism over a lack of transparency.</p>
<p>The government is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">consulting on whether to reduce the level of data protection</a> afforded to U.K. citizens, as it seeks to diverge from the European Union&#8217;s gold standard of privacy by design and default, set out in legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK dials up the spin on data reform, claiming &#8216;simplified&#8217; rules will drive &#8216;responsible&#8217; data sharing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/embed/#?secret=pbfn1qw10l" data-secret="pbfn1qw10l" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a statement on why he&#8217;s taking the legal action, Prismall said: &#8220;Given the very positive experience of the NHS that I have always had during my various treatments, I was greatly concerned to find that a tech giant had ended up with my confidential medical records.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a patient having any sort of medical treatment, the last thing you would expect is your private medical records to be in the hands of one of the world&#8217;s biggest technology companies. I hope that this case will help achieve a fair outcome and closure for all of the patients whose confidential records were obtained in this instance without their knowledge or consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mishcon partner Ben Lasserson, who is leading the case, added: &#8220;This important claim should help to answer fundamental questions about the handling of sensitive personal data and special category data. It comes at a time of heightened public interest and understandable concern over who has access to people&#8217;s personal data and medical records and how this access is managed.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Mishcon de Reya confirmed to us that it has issued the claim in the U.K. High Court.</p>
<p>Asked about whether the claimant is seeking financial damages and/or asking for the data to be deleted she said she was unable to provide any more information at this early stage.</p>
<p>Most of the NHS Trusts that inked five-year deals with DeepMind to use the Streams software &#8212; contracts which subsequently transitioned to Google&#8217;s health division, after the company took over DeepMind Health in 2018 &#8212; told us they had terminated their arrangements <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/google-confirms-its-pulling-the-plug-on-streams-its-uk-clinician-support-app/">when we asked them about their use of the app last month</a>, as it emerged Google was pulling the plug on the U.K. app following news of an internal reorganization of its health efforts.</p>
<p>However, the Royal Free Trust claimed it would continue to use Streams, despite Google&#8217;s announcement that support was being withdrawn &#8212; raising questions over how the Trust would ensure the app&#8217;s security was kept up-to-date and which divisions within Google would be responsible for handling related service level agreements, going forward, after the tech giant&#8217;s internal reorg of its health, wellness and AI efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Google declined to provide a comment at this time but a spokesperson confirmed it&#8217;s aware of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The company added that no claim form has been formally served but said once it has it will look at it in more detail.</p>
<p>The tech giant also pointed us to a third party audit carried out by Linklaters into the data processing arrangement between Royal Free and DeepMind &#8212; as part of the ICO settlement &#8212; which it said found the Royal Free&#8217;s use of Streams to be lawful and compliant with data protection laws. However that third party audit did not examine the original data processing arrangement &#8212; which was the one sanctioned by the ICO &#8212; looking only at a replacement deal, not the historical misstep, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/13/audit-of-nhs-trusts-app-project-with-deepmind-raises-more-questions-than-it-answers/">we reported at the time</a>, so it&#8217;s essentially irrelevant to the legal issue being raised by this lawsuit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just six months after raising $3.3 million in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/mexicos-higo-ai-nets-3-3m-to-become-the-venmo-for-b2b-payments-in-latam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seed funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Mexico City-based Higo announced today it has raised $23 million in a Series A round led by Accel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global Management also participated in the financing, along with existing backers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haystack, Homebrew, Audacious, Susa Ventures and J Ventures. A number of angel investors also put money in the round, including Stripe COO Claire Hughes-Johnson and Cristina Cordova, former head of partnerships at Stripe.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, </span><a href="http://higo.io"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is out to transform B2B payments for SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses) in Latin America, starting with its home country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodolfo Corcuera, Juan José Fernández and Daniel Tamayo founded the company in January 2020, recognizing that the process of paying vendors for business owners is largely “manual and cumbersome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Mexico, small businesses mostly handle payables with nothing more than spreadsheets and email and legacy bank accounts,” CEO </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodolfo-corcuera-meier-58377844/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corcuera</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why global investors are flocking to back Latin American startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/embed/#?secret=IbIrrnWxXq" data-secret="IbIrrnWxXq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio formed Higo to automate processes and provide visibility into cash flow, particularly for small businesses. “Informal” businesses make up about 23% of Mexico’s GDP, according to data from </span><a href="https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/saladeprensa/boletines/2019/especiales/ENAPROCE2018.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">INEGI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the government’s National Institute of Statistics and Geography. Higo launched its SaaS platform last November with the goal of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“building the simplest way for businesses in Latin America to pay, collect and finance invoices.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company says it has grown “over 20x,” to thousands of companies paying and getting paid with its platform compared to just a handful at the beginning of 2021. Also, since its last funding round, the company has launched a financing product to help companies increase liquidity through AP (accounts payable) extension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We provide on-demand financing in case payments are late, making cash flow concerns a thing of the past,” Corcuera said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exec, who started two other Mexican startups in the past &#8212; Aliada and Tandem &#8212; likens Higo’s business to that of Venmo, but for businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Higo is the first B2B payments platform that automatically populates all invoices from a customer&#8217;s vendors &#8212; and provides a single ledger where users can approve, pay and finance these invoices without ever leaving our platform,” he said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of us a bit like Venmo for B2B, with the added ability to fully finance payments you need to make or receive, with one click.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higo began 2021 with five employees and now has 31, with the goal of having a staff of 60 by year’s end. It plans to use its new capital primarily for hiring across all teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Mexico, companies don’t get paid on time,” Corcuera said. “Even large companies struggle to meet deadlines, so we are helping companies get paid faster.” The startup has enterprise clients such as logistics provider 99minutos.com and e-commerce giant Jokr, as well as small companies like vinoschidos.mx, an online wine boutique.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Higo remains committed to working in its home country, where Corcuera estimates there are 4.2 million SMEs, which employ 70% of the population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel’s <a href="https://www.accel.com/people/amit-kumar">Amit Kumar</a> notes that the Palo Alto-based firm has been “very active” investing in LatAm, and that Higo represents its largest Series A investment in the region. Accel, he said, increasingly believes there is significant opportunity in Latin America “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to build the next generation of fintech rails.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His firm, he said, was struck not just by Higo’s “laser focus” on B2B payments and its potential to accelerate the local SMB ecosystem, but also by its belief that the co-founding team is “building one of the best early-stage teams” that it’s seen globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Kumar thinks that Higo’s focus on invoices is the right one for LatAm, since that is where the vast majority of inter-company commerce is conducted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The growth velocity in terms of deposits, transactions and vendors onboarded all indicate they’ve solved a really important problem for a large swath of businesses and will accelerate this entire ecosystem,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EV startup Lordstown Motors made headlines when it purchased a 6.2 million-square-foot factory from General Motors in 2019. Now, it looks like the strapped-for-cash startup will likely sell that facility to Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group.</p>
<p>The news was first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-30/lordstown-nears-deal-to-sell-ohio-car-plant-to-taiwan-s-foxconn">reported by Bloomberg</a>, who said unnamed sources suggested the deal could close as early as this week. Lordstown executives had said during a second-quarter earnings call that the company was in “serious discussions” with partners to lease the northeast Ohio facility to other companies, so news of the sale isn’t a total surprise.</p>

<p>While financial details of the transaction were not disclosed, Lordstown would reportedly operate in the facility in parallel with Foxconn &#8212; an arrangement that could, in the end, be a net benefit for the beleaguered EV maker, which would receive both a cash injection and Foxconn’s mass-manufacturing expertise.</p>
<p>Foxconn, though best known for manufacturing Apple’s iPhone, has made major strides to enter the electric vehicle manufacturing market over the past few years. The company has inked deals with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/fisker-and-foxconn-sign-deal-to-build-electric-vehicles/">EV startup Fisker</a> to co-develop and manufacture a new electric vehicle, and Foxconn will also start manufacturing up to 50,000 vehicles at a Thailand factory in partnership with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/foxconn-says-thailand-ev-factory-will-begin-producing-50000-units-by-2023/">Thai oil supplier PTT PLC</a>.</p>
<p>Foxconn’s ambitions don’t end there: the manufacturer envisions itself as becoming a contract manufacturer for automakers, and it formed a joint venture with Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group to provide design, R&amp;D and manufacturing to OEMs looking to sell EVs.</p>

<p>Lordstown is aiming to deliver the first models of its flagship electric truck &#8220;Endurance&#8221; to a small group of customers early next year. The company named a new chief executive in August, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/lordstown-motors-ceo-and-cfo-resign-amidst-production-woes/">former CEO Steve Burns resigned</a> following concerns over the company’s coffers. CEO Dan Ninivaggi was instated scarcely a year after Lordstown announced its $1.6 billion SPAC merger.</p>
<p>At their 52-week highs, Lordstown shares hit $31.80 apiece. They’re now trading at $7.88.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Lordstown and Foxconn for comment and will update the story if they respond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, Rivian showed up at the Overland Expo West in Flagstaff, Arizona with a prototype of what is now known as the Camp Kitchen. Now, with production ready 2022 Rivian R1T electric pickup trucks coming off the assembly line, the final version of the kitchen is ready for prime time.</p>
<p>The automaker has made a number of changes to the kitchen since it first debuted, including the addition of two supporting actors: a foundational shuttle system that the kitchen attaches to and a dishware set from Snow Peak.</p>
<p>Below is video that provides an up-close look of the production-ready Camp Kitchen, as well as information from Josh Glaser, the company&#8217;s senior culinary program manager (aka the food guy) on how the accessory has been used and tested in Rivian&#8217;s factory.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jf0LWv20o_4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>A few specs for you. The Camp Kitchen is a $5,000 optional upgrade. For a limited time, the tunnel shuttle and Snow Peak kitchen set are included. Eventually, buyers who opt for the kitchen will also have to buy the $1,500 Rivian Gear Tunnel Shuttle option, which the kitchen sits on.</p>
<p>This tunnel shuttle holds and powers the kitchen, which locks onto the platform in three sections. Rivian plans to use the shuttle for other accessories in the future. The shuttle has integrated dual power plugs — 120V AC and 12V DC — and can hold up to 200 pounds when extended out from the truck.</p>
<p>The kitchen, which has a Richlite (a durable compressed paper resin) surface, includes a 1,440-watt two-burner induction cooktop, a nearly four-gallon water tank with a pressurized pump, collapsible and removable sink and several drawers with cork inserts to hold the 30-piece kitchen set from Snow Peak. The set includes a nylon spatula, bamboo spatula, tongs, ladle, two knives, corkscrew, can opener, peeler, titanium cutlery set, tableware, stacking mugs, cutting board, two large pots, a coffee grinder, kettle and pour-over stand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There is even a string of lights that can be erected to provide a bit of ambiance at night.</p>
