										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe announced today it is acquiring </span><a href="https://frame.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frame.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a video review and collaboration platform used by over a million customers, for $1.275 billion in cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2014 by the owner of a post-production company Emery Wells and technologist John Traver, New York-based Frame.io was created to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/31/frame-io-is-cloud-based-collaboration-for-everything/">solve the workflows</a> challenges filmmakers faced in their daily lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Frame.io platform helps creative professionals streamline the video creation process by centralizing media assets, including dailies, scripts, storyboards, work-in-progress, and more, while also allowing for frame-accurate feedback and comments, annotations, and real-time approvals. The company additionally touts faster upload speeds than other cloud hosting services, like Vimeo, Box, Dropbox, and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frame.io has raised $90 million in venture funding over its lifetime, and in November 2019, announced a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/cloud-video-collaboration-platform-frame-io-raises-50-million-heads-to-hollywood/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$50 million Series C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Insight Partners that included participation from Accel, FirstMark, SignalFire, and Shasta Ventures. Accel led the company’s seed and Series A rounds in 2015.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cloud video collaboration platform Frame.io raises $50 million, heads to Hollywood&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/cloud-video-collaboration-platform-frame-io-raises-50-million-heads-to-hollywood/embed/#?secret=6maLIoBMBF" data-secret="6maLIoBMBF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe said the combination of its creative software, including Premiere Pro and After Effects video editing products, and Frame.io’s review and approval functionality would “deliver a collaboration platform that powers the video editing process.” The Frame.io web platform was designed to be a part of its customer’s existing processes, by integrating with non-linear editing systems (NLEs) such as like Adobe Premiere Pro. Such integrations allow editors to upload directly to Frame.io, then organize and share their products both internally and with external clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether it&#8217;s the latest binge-worthy streaming series, a social media video that sparks a movement, or a corporate video that connects thousands of remote workers, video creation and consumption is experiencing tremendous growth,” Adobe said in a statement. “&#8230;Today’s video workflows are disjointed with multiple tools and communication channels being used to solicit stakeholder feedback. Frame.io eliminates the inefficiencies of video workflows by enabling real-time footage upload, access, and in-line stakeholder collaboration in a secure and elegant experience across surfaces.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal is expected to close during the fourth quarter of Adobe’s 2021 fiscal year, and is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Once the deal closes, Well and Traver will join Adobe. Wells will continue to lead the Frame.io team, reporting to Scott Belsky, Adobe’s chief product officer and EVP of Creative Cloud.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today, OnlyFans dropped the massive bombshell that it will be banning “sexually explicit content” from the app later this year. This is obviously a wildly seismic shift for OnlyFans, which completely disrupted the adult content industry and gave performers a path towards greater independence by allowing them to connect directly with their fans via subscriptions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This shutdown is also the opportunity of a lifetime for the crypto industry which could capitalize on the shutdown and a recent wave of increasingly consumer-friendly crypto payments infrastructure products to create a platform that won’t crumble under the influence of payment providers.</p>
<p class="p1">OnlyFans, which has been trying to raise at a unicorn valuation and running into plenty of trouble doing so despite huge revenues, didn’t mince words on the reasoning for today’s fundamental change. “These changes are to comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers,” a <a href="https://twitter.com/danprimack/status/1428420774449266691">statement on the news from OnlyFans</a> partially read.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oukvwoyCeD"><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">OnlyFans bans explicit content</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OnlyFans bans explicit content&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/embed/#?secret=oukvwoyCeD" data-secret="oukvwoyCeD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p1">Despite popular culture’s ongoing destigmatization of sex work and adult content, banking institutions are still fundamentally conservative and wary to handle money flowing through these platforms. Most of the operators of these platform are forced to deal with constant uneasiness of knowing their platforms might one day lose favor among these providers and instantly lose everything. All the while, “vice clauses” present in plenty of venture capital firms’ underpinnings keep them from operating in these spaces as well and prevent these platforms from accessing growth capital. It&#8217;s clear that adult content platforms are probably never going to have a friendly relationship with these financial institutions and it&#8217;s likely time for the platforms &#8212; and the creators using them &#8212; to move on.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, OnlyFans dumping porn seems like an outright betrayal of their creator network and one those creators will be sure to remember when embracing whatever copycats spring up in their wake. They are likely going to look at new platforms with renewed skepticism in how they&#8217;ll handle payment provider standoffs, but there likely isn&#8217;t going to be a different outcome for ambitious platforms looking to grow. That would likely be a different situation for crypto native platforms, but given the tiny adoption, it&#8217;s still a substantial risk for creators to embrace a platform their fans might not know how to pay for content on.</p>
<p>The porn industry has been embracing crypto payments, albeit slowly. In 2018, Pornhub first announced that they would begin accepting cryptocurrency payments, fast forward to 2020 when Visa and MasterCard dumped the platform, now crypto payments and ACH bank transfers are the only ways to pay for its premium subscription service. There are already a few crypto platform players in this space like CumRocket and SpankChain catering to niche audiences (and probably in need of rebranding), but with the OnlyFans juggernaut out of the way, there might actually be a space for an existing or upstart player to innovate and capture this market.</p>
<p>The real challenge is in making it simple to onboard new users to both a new platform and potentially their first crypto wallet &#8212; while staying compliant with regulatory guidelines &#8212; at a time when more conventional web payment structures have gotten so streamlined and free adult content is just as prolific as ever. Know your customer (KYC) guidelines that push users to upload their passport or driver&#8217;s license to verify crypto purchases probably aren&#8217;t the easiest onboarding ask for a new crypto porn site, but as the market matures a bit and the challenges of a user setting up their first wallet are decoupled from the onboarding process for the platform, there are plenty of benefits to be realized.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Porn has always been a launchpad of sorts for new technologies. While the popularity of crypto has surged in recent months and nearly eclipsed $2 trillion in total assets, crypto penetration among the apps that people are actually using remains extremely low. As new solutions and startups pop up aiming to demystify buying and sending crypto, it feels like there’s a chance the industry could be in the perfect place to fill the void left by OnlyFans’ exit and build a more innovative platform in its image that goes all-in on crypto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Have you ever tried to share a funny tweet with a few friends via Twitter DM, only to accidentally start a group chat? You&#8217;re not alone. Today, Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408769835421701">announced</a> that it will roll out a few quality of life improvements to its direct messaging system over the next few weeks, including the ability to DM a tweet to multiple people at once in individual conversations. Researcher Jane Manchun Wong noticed that Twitter was working on this functionality <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1413468258888417291">last month</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">No more (awkward) accidental group chats when you DM a Tweet to multiple people. Now you can share the same Tweet in up to 20 different DM convos, separately.</p>
<p>Rolling out on iOS and web, and soon on Android. (2/5) <a href="https://t.co/oHYseF3EJE">pic.twitter.com/oHYseF3EJE</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408781239504898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A potential downside of this update is that it might invite more spam &#8212; you can&#8217;t send a message to more than 20 people at once, but that&#8217;s still a lot of people. And users receiving these messages now may not realize they were a part of group spam, as the individual DMs will seem like private 1:1 messages.</p>
<p>Twitter says Android users will have to wait a bit longer than iOS and web tweeters to gain access to this feature &#8212; and it&#8217;s unclear how long that will take, because in the past, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434936/twitter-dm-search-android-expanding">it&#8217;s taken years</a> for iOS DM updates to reach Android. But as a consolation prize, on both Android and iOS, if you scroll up in a DM conversation, you&#8217;ll be able to return to the latest message by pressing a down arrow button to quick-scroll.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s other two DM improvements are only rolling out so far on iOS &#8212; instead of timestamping individual messages with the date and time, messages will be grouped by day. Individual DMs will still have a timestamp, but Twitter says that this change will yield &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408787245928453">less timestamp clutter.</a>&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Finally, in DMs, iOS users will be able to access the &#8220;add reaction&#8221; menu from both double-tapping and long-pressing on a message. Long-pressing a friend&#8217;s message also gives you the option to delete the message on your account only, report the message, or copy the text.</p>

<p>Twitter also announced today that it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/twitter-is-testing-a-feature-that-puts-users-revue-newsletters-on-their-profiles/">testing a feature</a> that puts users&#8217; Revue newsletters on their profile (Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">acquired</a> the newsletter platform earlier this year). But last week, it unveiled more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/twitter-redesigns-website-with-new-font-less-clutter-and-high-contrast-features/">noticeable UI updates</a> that experts believe made the platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/twitters-web-redesign-isnt-as-accessible-as-it-should-be-experts-say/">less accessible</a>. Within two days of the update, Twitter made <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1426260504687824905">contrast changes</a> on its buttons and <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1426344402142826497">identified issues</a> with its proprietary font Chirp on Windows.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OnlyFans has announced that it will ban sexually explicit content starting in October. The platform was not built specifically for porn but that has grown to be its most popular and visible use case, but pressure from &#8220;banking partners and payout providers&#8221; means the company will have to leave the adult content world behind and focus solely on SFW material going forward.</p>
<p>The news, first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg</a>, was confirmed by the company in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Effective 1 October, 2021, OnlyFans will prohibit the posting of any content containing sexually-explicit conduct. In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform, and to continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our content guidelines. Creators will continue to be allowed to post content containing nudity as long as it is consistent with our Acceptable Use Policy.</p>
<p>These changes are to comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers.</p>
<p>We will be sharing more details in the coming days and we will actively support and guide our creators through this change in content guidelines.</p></blockquote>
<p>OnlyFans did not respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s inquiries as to its definition of sexually explicit content or how it expected this would impact the company&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>The OnlyFans platform has become the de facto standard for independent creators doing adult content. Over the pandemic it grew increasingly popular as the adult industry, like others, had its normal operations interrupted. It has proved an invaluable asset for many creators, professional and aspiring, who used the platform to directly monetize fans without interacting with notoriously predatory established adult industry companies.</p>
<p>But sex work has always been risky in online operations. The practical risk of hosting illegal content means platforms must exert constant vigilance for things like child sex abuse material, malicious content like revenge porn and unwanted leaks, and everyday internet threats like piracy.</p>
<p>At the organizational level, however, the companies may find it difficult to scale due to the trepidation of investors and banks, both of which tend to avoid the industry in general as a &#8220;vice,&#8221; much the way cannabis and sex toy startups have faced challenges. Pushback from financial backers and payment processors can effectively sink an entire business model.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Vn9uoDEkUw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/onlyfans-promotes-its-sfw-app-as-it-seeks-funding-at-a-1b-valuation/">OnlyFans promotes its SFW app as it seeks funding at a $1B+ valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OnlyFans promotes its SFW app as it seeks funding at a $1B+ valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/onlyfans-promotes-its-sfw-app-as-it-seeks-funding-at-a-1b-valuation/embed/#?secret=Vn9uoDEkUw" data-secret="Vn9uoDEkUw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>OnlyFans in this case says openly that it is abandoning adult content due to exactly this type of pressure. While the company has recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/onlyfans-promotes-its-sfw-app-as-it-seeks-funding-at-a-1b-valuation/">debuted and promoted its OFTV app</a>, a SFW alternative to the main OnlyFans site, and of course there are many creators on the platform who do not produce sexually explicit content, this will be an enormous blow to both the sex work industry and to the company itself. Affected creators were not notified ahead of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is going to shatter a lot of people&#8217;s main source of income, the foundation of their entire business,&#8221; said Tristan West, who as dreamboytristan is a top creator of adult content on OnlyFans. &#8220;Me and a lot of people have got to do a lot of work to secure our business, move our assets, move our content to another platform. It&#8217;s not the end of the world, but this is a huge setback.&#8221;</p>
<p>West noted that other platforms are finding ways to monetize adult content as well, such as Twitter adding its paid follows and sites like PornHub building out direct monetization opportunities as well. But OnlyFans holds all the cards and will need to make that transition possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see them do what&#8217;s needed — it&#8217;s weird that they haven&#8217;t come to us and talked to us in any way,&#8221; said West. &#8220;Offer a quick option to download all your content on OnlyFans — that&#8217;s your asset, that&#8217;s your business. That&#8217;s the bare minimum that they can do for creators.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a serious question whether OnlyFans will be able to survive this transition in any recognizable form. The choice to abandon their most lucrative and loyal segment of customers and creators may poison the well, with others declining to rely on a platform that failed to support others. Investors, once wary of the risk of putting money into a sex-adjacent product, may now be wary of paying to board a sinking ship. That $1 billion valuation may be farther away than ever.</p>
<p>The obvious and immediate answer from the tech community is to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-porn-ban-is-cryptos-opportunity-of-a-lifetime/">operate OnlyFans or something like it using cryptocurrencies</a>, which are generally speaking not subject to these limitations. This may represent a way forward for the next platform, but for OnlyFans it may be too late to adapt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankfully, we have a couple months,&#8221; West said. &#8220;OnlyFans was the top platform in this market but they&#8217;re not the only one. It&#8217;s an opportunity for someone else to come around and do better for sex workers and online creators.&#8221;</p>
<p>This story is developing and may be updated in the near future with more information.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Wash, rinse, repeat: A startup is founded, first product ships, customers engage, and then a larger company’s corporate development team sends a blind email requesting to “connect and compare notes.”</p>
<p>If you’re a venture-backed startup, it would be wise to generate a return at some point, which means either get acquired or go public.</p>
<p>If you’re going to get acquired, chances are you’re going to spend a lot of time with corporate development teams. With a hot stock market, mountains of cash and cheap debt floating around, the environment for acquisitions is extremely rich.</p>
<p>And as I&#8217;ve been on both sides of these equations, an increasing number of my <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/friendda-nda-friends-douche">FriendDA partners</a> have been calling for advice on corporate development mating rituals.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Before my first company was acquired, I believed that every acquisition I’d ever read about was strategic and well thought out. I was blindingly wrong.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>You need to take the meeting</h2>
<p>Book a 45-minute initial meeting. Give yourself an hour on the calendar, but only burn the full 60 minutes if things are going well. Don’t be overly excited, be a pleaser and or ramble on. Pontificate? Yes, but with precision.</p>
<p>You need to demonstrate a command of the domain you’ve chosen. Also, demonstrate that you’re humble and thoughtful, but never come to the first meeting with a written list of “ways we can work together.” That will smell of desperation.</p>
<p>In the worst-case scenario, you&#8217;ll get a few new LinkedIn connections and you’re now a known quantity. The best-case scenario will be a second meeting.</p>
<h2>But they’re going to steal my brilliant idea!</h2>
<p>No, they aren’t. I hear this a lot and it’s a solid tell that an entrepreneur has never operated within a large enterprise before. That’s fine, as not everyone gets to have an employee ID number with five or six digits.</p>
<p>Big companies manage operational expenses, including salaries and related expenses, pretty tightly. And there frequently aren’t enough experts to go around the moneyball startups for new domains, let alone older enterprises.</p>
<p>So there’s no secret lab with dozens of developers and subject matter experts waiting for a freshly minted MBA to return with their meeting notes and start pilfering your awesomeness. Plus, a key component to many successful startups is go-to-market (GTM), and most larger enterprises don’t have the marketing and sales domain knowledge to sell a stolen product.</p>
<p>They still need you and your team.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> is launching a new feature called <a href="https://www.revolut.com/payday">Payday</a>. It is an alternative to credit card debt and short-term credit as it lets you unlock a portion of your wage early. If a business decides to integrate with Revolut, users can then access the feature from the financial super app directly.</p>
<p>Right now, the feature is limited to businesses based in the U.K., but the company plans to launch it in the European Economic Area and the U.S. as well. That’s the trick — Payday isn’t going to be available to everyone who receive their salary in their Revolut account through direct deposit.</p>
<p>Revolut has to plug into an employer’s payroll system first so that the company knows how much employees are earning at any point in time. The fintech startup says that employers don’t have to change their payroll system, though.</p>
<p>Once this is done, employees can unlock a portion of their earned pay whenever they want. Users can withdraw up to 50% of what they’ve earned in advance. While the feature is free for businesses, Revolut will charge a small, flat fee to users.</p>
<p>“We believe in the importance of making financial wellbeing accessible to all, and this includes focusing on the impact of financial stability on employees’ mental health,” Revolut co-founder and CEO Nik Storonsky said in a statement. “After the difficulties of the past year, the last thing employees need now is financial uncertainty and stress. It is important to move away from a situation where many are dependent on payday loans and expensive short-term credit, a reliance that is exacerbated by the monthly pay cycle.“</p>
<p>People who live paycheck to paycheck could leverage Payday for unplanned expenses. For instance, if you have to fix your car and it cannot wait until the end of the month, you can unlock some money right away.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This isn’t debt and doesn’t affect your credit score — it’s a portion of your salary, which means that you’ll receive less money at the end of the month when you get paid.</p>
<p>Even if you’re not using the salary-advance feature, Payday lets you see how much you’ve earned so far this month. It’s going to be interesting to see whether a lot of companies adopt the feature. With millions of users in the U.K., chances are businesses are going to learn about Payday from their own employees.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The success of a fundraising process is entirely dependent on how well an entrepreneur can manage it. At this stage, it is important for founders to be honest, straightforward and recognize the value meetings with venture capitalists and investors can bring beyond just the monetary aspect.</p>
<p>Here are five pointers that founders should consider while pitching to venture capitalists:</p>
<h2>Be honest and accurate</h2>
<p>Raising a venture round is, in a way, a sales process, but any claims that could call into question a founder’s trustworthiness can result in a negative outcome rather than an investment.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As VCs, we cannot overemphasize how important it is that founders are transparent and upfront. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Here are a few select cases of such claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overstating traction or revenues, which due diligence brought to light.</li>
<li>Concealing material attributes of the founding team — such as a co-founder’s commitment to the company, which at best was part time.</li>
<li>Speaking of committed investors who were about to wire money to the company, except they were still at the due diligence stage and eventually decided not to invest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Investing in early-stage companies is often about making bets on people. As VCs, we cannot overemphasize how important it is that founders are transparent and upfront. It is critical to help establish the initial seeds of trust with a capital partner.</p>
<p>Further, most investors understand that things change — if there are any material shifts during the diligence process, communicating them promptly is an additional signal of maturity and uprightness. This will go a long way during the capital raise and beyond.</p>
<h2>Know your BATNA</h2>
<p>Founders often enter conversations with venture capitalists with a good handle on their product and the business. However, it&#8217;s common for entrepreneurs to falter at the negotiation stage, not knowing what their best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA) is.</p>
<p>We have witnessed founders who mistake initial interest in the venture market for real commitment, and unreasonably hike their valuation, which results in them losing serious investors. We have also seen founders fail to ascribe the value serious VCs bring to the table and consequently hesitate to discount their valuation, only to later realize that the existing cap table lacks firepower.</p>
<p>The best way for founders to uncover their BATNA is to run an efficient process. This requires:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If your employer does any sort of charity donation matching, the system powering it might be… not great. Maybe it’s got an ancient interface; maybe it’s stuffed behind the VPN at some weird URL that takes a half hour to dig up every December when you remember there’s donation match money about to expire.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.joindeed.com">Deed</a>, a company out of the ongoing Y Combinator S21 class, is looking to modernize the Corporate Social Responsibility (or CSR) concept &#8212; and do a bit more to keep it on your radar, while they’re at it.</p>
<p>Deed&#8217;s web interface does much of what you&#8217;d expect of a platform like this. It&#8217;ll handle employee donations and facilitate donation matching based on the employer&#8217;s rules, and it&#8217;ll offer up volunteer opportunities and track volunteer hours accordingly. And it&#8217;ll do it all with a clean interface that shouldn&#8217;t look out of place and dated in a modern company&#8217;s toolset.</p>
<p>But it also offers up plenty of neat stuff I haven&#8217;t seen the alternatives do — like a dating app-style swipe interface for narrowing down volunteering opportunities, deeper support for employee resource groups (you can follow employee groups within your company, and those groups can highlight organizations you might want to donate to) and tools to promote a bit of friendly who-can-volunteer-more competition between departments. Next up: Slack integration.</p>

<p>This week Deed is rolling out an early build of <a href="https://www.joindeed.com/solutions/slack-app">its Slack tie-in</a>, which, as company co-founder Deevee Kashi tells me, is meant to “meet employees where they are.”</p>
<p>While Deed&#8217;s web interface isn&#8217;t going anywhere, this new integration lets them beam many of the most commonly accessed features &#8212; plus a feed of any donation/volunteer activity your co-workers opt to share &#8212; right into Slack. Easier access, harder to forget.</p>
<p>Deed is a bit further along than many of the companies we see coming out of YC. Many of the teams we see in each YC batch are made up of a couple co-founders working from whatever desk space they can find; Deed, meanwhile, has 20+ employees across the world and a growing HQ in Berlin.</p>
<p>But it’s still early days for the company &#8212; much of its growth, and even its focus on the enterprise, is relatively new.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191703" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191703" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2191703 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="473" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg 4542w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=768,534 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=680,473 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=1536,1069 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=2048,1425 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191703" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Deed&#8217;s hybrid in-person/remote team</em><strong> Image Credits: </strong>Deed</p></div></p>
<p>Deed started its life in 2016 as an app with a similar, but different, focus. Kashi, coming off a 10-year stint of running night clubs and, as he puts it, “throwing parties for a living,” decided it was time to retune.</p>
<p>“Externally people perceived my career as being successful. Internally, I was very… distraught,” he tells me. “I wasn’t really connecting to what I was doing and, by any means, it didn’t align with my values.”</p>
<p>“I took a step back and decided to volunteer, just kind of locally in the city. After trying to volunteer, I realized how cumbersome the process was &#8212; how antiquated all the technology was and how nonprofits were struggling to engage with younger demographics.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From that came the first iteration of Deed, then an app meant to help individuals find the right volunteer opportunities for them. They grew a community of tens of thousands of users around New York… then the big companies came knocking.</p>
<p>“Their employees came to them and said they really enjoyed using the app in their free time,” says Kashi. “They’d assumed we had an enterprise offering as well to help them with their employee volunteering and engagement programs.”</p>
<p>After a bit more tugging at that thread, the team decided to go all in on enterprise in 2020. They took what they learned about building a pretty, modern interface for individual volunteering and adapted it for the needs of these big teams. And it seems to be working; they quickly signed their first big customer with Adidas. Then came Sweetgreen, Airbnb and Stripe. Kashi tells me that they’re now working with companies with anywhere from 250 employees to 100,000.</p>
<p>Deed raised $2 million at the end of last year &#8212; and with the momentum behind its shift to enterprise teams, saw its own team grow quickly. “We couldn’t afford two desks.&#8221; says Kashi. &#8220;Now we’ve hired a bunch of people over the past year and a half. And I’d never met them in person! Then all of a sudden I walk up and the entire floor is ours. It’s really surreal onboarding people remotely, managing them for a year and a half… and <em>then</em> seeing them for the first time.”</p>

<p><a href="https://astra.com/">Astra</a> CEO Chris Kemp tweeted the news on Thursday, adding that the launch operator license through the FAA is valid through 2026. The new license is a modification of the company’s previous launch license and applicable to the current version of the company’s rocket, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tabletop gaming is in the middle of a historic boom, despite recent restrictions imposed on in-person gatherings by COVID. The tools adopted by game masters and casual players to play remotely are powerful, but not always the easiest to use or adopt. <a href="https://www.playrole.com/">Role</a> hopes to change that with a super-accessible video platform focused on the social aspect of role-playing games, and it has raised a $2.75 million seed round to do so.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say what has powered the incredible growth of the tabletop gaming space, which just a few years ago was perceived as a sleepy realm of basement-dwelling nerds, a niche within a niche. But it was a different kind of sleeping giant, one that has proven to be immensely diverse, valuable and surprisingly tenacious in the face of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Some platforms, like <a href="https://roll20.net/">Roll20</a> and <a href="https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/home.php">Fantasy Grounds</a>, have seized on this opportunity to provide online video collaboration platforms for playing games like D&amp;D, strategy titles and many others of the general tabletop type.</p>
<p>But Logan Dwight and Ian Hirschfeld, co-founders of Role, felt these approaches tended to emphasize the mechanics over what they felt was a more important aspect of RPGs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We asked ourselves, why is it that people, when they have all these options, choose to play D&amp;D on the internet? And what we figured out is, it&#8217;s the people,&#8221; said Dwight. &#8220;The game lives in the minds of the people, a shared social experience. It&#8217;s about the conversation, the face-to-face interactions.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191332" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191332" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2191332 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="695" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=768,521 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=680,461 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=1536,1042 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=2048,1389 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2191332" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Role</p></div></p>
<p>This is the start of something new, they said — and big. As an analogue, they referred to the social gaming explosion a decade ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;People always find a way to play. Because we had social media platforms and mobile phones then, we were socializing over those — so we naturally looked for ways to play over them,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We&#8217;re at another one of those inflection points now with the explosion of online video and the creator economy in gaming. Video has become so good and so ubiquitous it&#8217;s becoming the dominant way people socialize — and then what naturally happens is we look for a way to play. And it turns out the, answer was right under our noses, and it&#8217;s been there since the &#8217;70s: it&#8217;s role playing, a game that takes the form of conversation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Role was designed from the ground up to smooth out and simplify how the complex mechanics of these games are implemented, putting the players visually and cognitively at the forefront. After all, when you&#8217;re playing D&amp;D or another game around the table, you spend most of your time looking at each other, not the game board — because it&#8217;s a game and you&#8217;re having fun with each other, right?</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s easy to say the face-to-face interactions should be front and center, but the truth is these games are mechanically complicated and involve sheets, dice, maps, rulebooks and so on. Dwight said the problem here is not so much keeping them always in view, but making them simple and intuitive to access and involve in gameplay.</p>
<p>Take a character sheet with some attributes and associated bonuses, and a standard combat encounter. Depending on how well the GM has prepped, it may be that the dice rolls need to have bonuses added manually, and the results compared manually to the defending monster&#8217;s sheet. But if the bonuses, the dice and the monster&#8217;s stats are all aware of one another, you know if you hit as soon as the die is cast.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191333" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191333" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2191333" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Role's interface for building game systems." width="1024" height="597" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=768,448 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=680,397 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=1536,896 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=2048,1194 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2191333" class="wp-caption-text">It looks complicated, but compared with scripting it manually, this is a cakewalk. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Role</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This can be done in many games, but it&#8217;s not always easy, and becomes much harder the further one goes from official, canon rulebooks. House rules are common enough, but these days there are entire variant game types being built out from open-license rulebooks that have no &#8220;official&#8221; support from a major gaming company like Wizards. Prepping a game for play online might be weeks of work that&#8217;s relatively technically demanding.</p>
<p>Some GMs and creators take pleasure in the intricacy of these systems, but as Dwight pointed out, the expansion of the community means more people are coming to this from non-gaming and non-tech backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core skills people are bringing to this are that they&#8217;re a writer or something. So the ability to create together needs to be really easy and really powerful,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We want to give people like&#8230; a Squarespace for tabletop RPGs. It&#8217;s a WYSIWYG editor, the RPG equivalent of a box of LEGO. You can make a whole set of templates for whatever game you want to run, tweak sheets, create animations, all without having to touch code, and you can share it easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform has already seen major growth in user-created campaigns and variants for games designed to be built upon, like Mörk Borg and Lancer, with thousands being shared.</p>

<p>Role first raised money via Kickstarter (though the idea goes back to 2015), then via some angel funding, but this seed round brings in their first proper VC money. The $2.75 million round is co-led by Konvoy and London Venture Partners, with whom Dwight said they were pleased to find willing partners who understood the opportunity perfectly. That&#8217;s a feat, considering the skyrocketing value and diversity of tabletop has taken even industry veterans by surprise.</p>
<p>The money is going toward effecting the lessons the company has learned from its early adopters, with a renewed focus on ease of use, accessibility and extensibility. As for making money, the company intends to do so through a marketplace for games and scenarios, and for premium features like extra online storage and so on. But for regular users who just want to play with friends, Role is free to <a href="https://app.playrole.com/signup">sign up for</a> and use right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This January, Twitter acquired the newsletter platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a>, but until now its integration into Twitter has been minimal; sometimes when you write Twitter threads, you&#8217;ll be greeted with a &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/luca/status/1364481560506900482?lang=en">Hello, wordsmiths</a>&#8221; message that tells you about its newsletter tools.</p>
<p>Starting today, Twitter is testing a feature that brings Revue newsletters more prominently into the Twitter experience. Some users on web and Android will be able to see writers&#8217; Revue newsletters appear on their profile beneath their follower counts. If you click subscribe, you&#8217;ll be prompted to read a sample issue or subscribe using the email address connected to your Twitter account. Revue says this feature will also <a href="https://twitter.com/revue/status/1428371224099446786">roll out on iOS</a> soon.</p>

<p>Today, we’re starting to test a feature that allows people to subscribe to your Revue newsletter directly from your Twitter profile. </p>
<p>It&#39;s available to all Revue creators immediately. To start though, your newsletters will show only for a test group on Twitter. <a href="https://t.co/YDa1aOGeLM">pic.twitter.com/YDa1aOGeLM</a></p>

<p>The newsletter market is heating up — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/medium-revamps-its-partner-program-launching-new-eligibility-requirements-and-referral-bonuses/">Medium</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/creators-can-now-monetize-their-expertise-on-quora/">Quora</a> have both recently released new monetization structures, Substack is currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/">valued at $650 million</a> and Facebook is curating a slate of flashy newsletters on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Bulletin</a>. Even Tumblr is attempting to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/">cash in</a> on paywalled writing, though its user base <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription/">isn&#8217;t thrilled</a>. But with its new front-and-center integration on Twitter profiles, Revue may pick up steam too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;One of the reasons I switched to using their platform was the potential to link my newsletter with my Twitter feed &amp; make it easier for my followers to subscribe,&#8221; Revue writer <a href="https://twitter.com/jewelwickershow/status/1428372246582775813">Jewel Wicker</a> tweeted. &#8220;Happy the rollout has begun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Revue takes a <a href="http://help.getrevue.co/en/articles/4754361-how-pricing-works-on-revue">5% cut of creators&#8217; earnings</a>, plus a standard 2.9%, plus $0.30 processing fee. So, if someone subscribes to your Revue newsletter for $5, you&#8217;ll take home $4.30. Comparatively, Substack takes 10% of writers&#8217; revenue, plus processing fees.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Chicago is an outlying benefactor from accelerating venture capital activity and the rise of remote investing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chicago’s startup scene is finally getting the attention it long felt it deserved.</p>
<p>By now it’s common knowledge that 2021 is shaping up to be a breakout year for the startup and venture capital worlds, surpassing years of strong results in a long-term bull market for tech-focused business upstarts. But no boom is equally distributed.</p>
<p>Different markets are seeing differing amounts of activity, driven in part by their startup ecosystem’s maturity and the ease with which external capital can be deployed. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">African startups will set fresh venture capital records</a> this year, for example. But markets closer to the leading hubs of venture capital are seeing even stronger results, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/">Latin America demonstrates</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/vcs-unfazed-by-chinese-regulatory-shakeups-so-far/">China’s venture capital market, meanwhile, is easing</a> as others accelerate.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Even inside the United States, there is divergence in how individual markets are performing. Chicago is an outlying benefactor from accelerating venture capital activity and the rise of remote investing. Data <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">collected by CB Insights</a>, for example, indicates that Chicago’s ability to attract venture funds has risen to new heights in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>While we anticipated Chicago might do well in a generally warm environment for startup investment, its results were better than we expected. To more fully understand just what is going on in the Windy City, The Exchange corresponded with <a href="https://m25vc.com/">M25</a>, a Midwest-focused venture capital fund; Moderne Ventures’ partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liza-benson-a8091828/">Liza Benson</a> (fresh off her firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/moderne-ventures-closes-second-fund-with-200m-targets-industry-digital-transformation/">raising $200 million for its second fund</a>); <a href="https://twitter.com/kitun">Scott Kitun,</a> of the Technori community and investing platform that has roots in the city; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-barnes-m1">Brian Barnes</a>, CEO of M1 Finance, a local unicorn in the fintech space that TechCrunch has covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/m1-finance/">extensively</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The picture that emerges from their comments is one of a city long underfed in capital terms leaning into a changing investing market. And the investors don’t expect that the back half of the year will be too different from the first. That means Chicago-based startups are in the middle of their best year of raising capital <em>ever</em>. Let’s talk about how that came to be.</p>
<h2>A venture capital run for the ages</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pace at which Chicago-area startups have raised capital reached a new, high plateau starting in the second half of 2020. In historical terms, data indicates that Chicago was a beneficiary of an accelerated pace of venture investment that took hold globally once investors, concerned that startup growth could slow, shrugged off initial COVID shocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, startups were not affected as many feared, with many young tech companies actually accelerating during the pandemic’s first quarter of lockdowns, as many traditional businesses had to lean into software solutions and other services that startups sold.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The early boost to Chicago’s venture totals in the final two quarters of 2020 was easily bested in the first quarter of 2021. And then the second quarter of this year crushed <em>that</em> record.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Instead of an EV battery being something that needs to be recharged, like an iPhone, Ample wants to turn them into things that can be swapped out, like batteries in a digital camera.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Francisco-based Ample has raised a $160 million Series C to scale its battery swapping service, the largest round yet for the 8-year-old startup that wants to completely rethink how we use electric vehicles.</p>
<p><a href="https://ample.com/">Ample’s</a> approach is relatively straightforward: Cars equipped with the company&#8217;s modular battery pack can drive into one of Ample’s automated charging pod locations and swap out their depleted batteries for ones that are fully charged. The swapped-out batteries are then recharged in the pod and ready to be reinserted into another vehicle.</p>
<p>Although Ample’s battery swapping model is simple on paper, the company is proposing thinking about EV batteries in a completely different way. Instead of an EV battery being something that needs to be recharged, like an iPhone, Ample wants to turn them into things that can be swapped out, like batteries in a digital camera.</p>
<p>This latest nine-figure funding round is a sign that investors are paying attention. The internationally funded Series C was led by Moore Strategic Ventures with participation from PTT, a Thai state-owned oil and gas company, and Disruptive Innovation Fund. Existing investors Eneos, a Japanese petroleum and energy company, and Singapore’s public transit operator SMRT also participated. Ample&#8217;s total funding is now $230 million.</p>
<p>“We realized that there&#8217;s this big elephant in the room with electric vehicles and [it&#8217;s that] nobody is that excited about spending an hour, two hours or three hours charging their vehicle,” Ample co-founder John de Souza said.</p>

<p>Industry’s response has been to develop technology like DC fast chargers, which have managed to shave charging time down to only 20 or 30 minutes. But de Souza said that improvements in charging time don’t get rid of fundamental problems: “[Fast charging] generates a lot of heat; the grid doesn’t support it,” he said. “Even if you could have batteries you charge in five minutes, you’d need chargers that were massively powerful and you’d need power plants around every corner to do it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ample is currently focused on fleets – it operates five battery swapping stations in the Bay Area for participating Uber drivers, and it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/ev-battery-swapping-startup-ample-charges-up-operations-in-japan-nyc/">locked in a partnership</a> with Sally, an EV rental company for taxi and last-mile deliveries in New York City. But the company sees its battery swapping service as suitable for consumers, as well. Ample co-founder Khaled Hassounah said battery swapping could also be useful for personal consumers who don’t have a good charging solution available to them, like people who live in apartment buildings. “We’re really a lot more focused on the cars that are coming on the road” rather than EVs that have already been manufactured, Hassounah added.</p>

Ample co-founders John de Souza and Khaled Hassounah. </p></div></p>
<p>The company says that its modular system means that drivers only need to carry around as much battery as they need. For Ample, that means less battery waste and less weight in the vehicle.</p>
<p>Much of Ample’s vision relies on buy-in from automakers. For example, the company is imagining that when a person goes to buy a car, the OEM could offer either a fixed battery option or a vehicle equipped with an Ample battery system.</p>
<p>Ample says it has validated its approach with 10 different car models by working directly with OEMs, and that none of them have required making modifications to the vehicle. That doesn’t mean that there are no interfaces between the battery and the car that need to be altered &#8212; there are things like voltage cables or a cooling line, for example &#8212; but that the actual architecture of EVs is simpler than one might think.</p>
<p>“The marketing departments at the OEMs want to tell you that … ‘This is a super-duper battery that is very well integrated with the car; there&#8217;s no way you can separate it,’” Hassounah said. “The truth of the matter is they’re built completely separately and so true for almost &#8212; not almost, for every battery in the car, including a Tesla.</p>
<p>“Since we&#8217;ve built our system to be easy to interface with different vehicles, we&#8217;ve abstracted the battery component … from the vehicle,” he added.</p>
<p>Ample said it&#8217;s working with five different OEMs right now, “some of the largest OEMs out there,” de Souza said, though he declined to specify which ones. He added that growing demand from fleets goes hand in hand with conversations with OEMs, which are eager to sell vehicles.</p>
<p>It could be an attractive proposal because much of the cost of an electric vehicle is its battery system. The market has seen a version of this idea from Chinese automaker Nio, which offers consumers the option of purchasing a vehicle with or without a battery (for the latter option, Nio leases the batteries). Under the leasing option, drivers shave ¥70,000 ($10,800) off the price of a vehicle. Nio has already completed more than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/chinese-ev-maker-nio-is-stepping-outside-of-china-for-the-first-time/">2.4 million battery swaps</a> for Chinese drivers, founder William Li said in May.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Ample is focused purely on scaling: deploying with large customers in new cities. Interestingly, de Souza added that the company is getting a lot of interest from governments who want to shift to electric transportation but don’t have the requisite charging infrastructure.</p>
<p>“The question is, how can we get more miles and be electric, rather than build more infrastructure?” Hassounah said. “If you go and deploy a million fast chargers and no one uses them, we haven&#8217;t achieved anything.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Leaders and senior management everywhere are grappling with how (or not) to bring employees back to the office. It’s a high-stakes decision: Fifty-eight percent of workers said they will look for new jobs if they can’t work remotely, according to a<a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/flexjobs-survey-finds-employees-want-remote-work-post-pandemic/"> FlexJobs survey</a>.</p>
<p>An often overlooked and/or cobbled-together piece of this puzzle is compensation. And inside the transition to hybrid work, compensation planning encapsulates a cacophony of nuances for founders, people leaders and compensation experts.</p>
<p>Here are just a few new questions this group needs to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we adjust salaries for people who have moved to different regions?</li>
<li>Do we alter pay for employees performing the same role, with the same title, when one is remote and the other is in-office?</li>
<li>How can we educate geographies that aren’t as familiar with the value of equity as is, say, Silicon Valley?</li>
</ul>
<p>As we’ve seen in recent weeks, the answers to these questions are different for us all.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/pay-cut-google-employees-who-work-home-could-lose-money-2021-08-10/"> Google employees who work from home</a> may experience a pay cut. <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/companies-switching-remote-work-long-term/">Adobe workers</a> can self-select what days they work remotely, up to 50% of the time, with no salary impact. Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/linkedin-allow-most-employees-work-remotely-reversing-course-2021-07-29/"> LinkedIn</a> just loosened its policy, allowing employees to work from home permanently.</p>

			The first step in developing a compensation plan — regardless of your company’s stance on distributed work — is determining how your team’s pay compares with the market.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Regardless of your startup’s stance on the topic, having a consistent compensation philosophy that you apply to your evolving workplace has a unicorn-sized influence on important growth metrics: attracting and keeping top talent, as well as creating a culture of trust and performance.</p>
<p>As the CEO of a compensation intelligence company, I see four common mistakes that startups commit when compensation planning that hinder successful remote or hybrid workforces. Here are the ways to sidestep them.</p>
<h2>1. Using subpar data for competitive analysis</h2>
<p>The first step in developing a compensation plan — regardless of your company’s stance on distributed work — is determining how your team’s pay compares with the market. To understand market rates, you need one thing: data.</p>
<p>If you’re moving from a strictly office-based environment to a hybrid model, 2019 data won’t work. While it’s tempting to search for free data online or use survey data that your company has purchased in the past, both approaches have risks. Traditional compensation survey information is stale, limited and often not verified. And spreadsheets are hyperprone to error and security risks because they involve manual, and often super laborious, work.</p>
<p>In a world that’s still reacting to a pandemic, only fresh, real-time, accurate benchmarks and pay ranges are sufficient. Both must reflect aggregated information about what others in your segment are paying employees — by experience level, role, department, geography, industry and company size.</p>
<p>For example, technology startups need different data sources than global financial services organizations. Both need information geared toward companies of a similar size and stage. Software engineer salaries need to reflect those of similar roles, with nuances for those that specialize in machine learning, data science, etc.</p>
<p>You’d be shocked how often self-reported data on free websites is inaccurate and unverified. As you seek a credible intelligence source for your compensation data, a data source must:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Emergency response is a time-sensitive business. When fires burn or a driver crashes their car, seconds can mean the difference between saving lives and watching a situation spiral rapidly out of control. For fire and police departments, getting teams on site can be challenging, what with the vagaries of traffic and bad routing.</p>
<p>Houston-headquartered <a href="https://paladindrones.io">Paladin</a> is a startup building a custom drone hardware and software solution for cities to be able to respond to emergencies faster and with better data. After years of development, the company is publicly unveiling its Knighthawk and Watchtower products.</p>
<p>The Knighthawk is a custom-made drone designed for the specific needs of emergency response personnel. It comes complete with two cameras — one 10x zoom optical and one thermal — to provide the best video feeds on a developing situation at both day and night with only a half second latency. Importantly, the drone has a time range of 55 minutes and can travel multiple miles away to reach a site, according to the company. Launch time can be as short as a few seconds from when a 911 call comes in.</p>

<p>To manage the drones and watch the video feeds, operators use the company’s Watchtower software (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1407493274">available as an app</a>) to place a pin on a map to direct the drone to the likely site of an emergency. Once there, uploaded video feeds will display in the app as well as in a 911 center’s existing computer-aided dispatch systems, a topic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1/">we covered quite a bit in our RapidSOS EC-1 from a few weeks ago</a>.</p>

<p>The public launch is a huge step forward for the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/28/paladin-drones-picks-up-1-3m-to-give-first-responders-a-live-feed-of-emergencies/">which TechCrunch last profiled in 2019</a> as it was emerging from Y Combinator with a $1.3 million seed from the likes of Khosla, Correlation Ventures, and Paul Buchheit. Back then, the focus was on building software to integrate with an off-the-shelf DJI drone. Paladin was experimenting with a beta Android app where an operator could place a pin on a map and direct the drone to a site.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Yet, that model proved insufficient for the task. CEO and co-founder Divy Shrivastava said that as the company developed its product, it learned it needed to own the hardware stack as well. “The drones that we were using weren’t purpose-built for automation,” he said. “We ended up coming up with our own communication technology for our drones … so that we won’t lose connection.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191613" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191613" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2191613" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191613" class="wp-caption-text">CEO and co-founder Divy Shrivastava. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Paladin Drones.</p></div></p>
<p>Since the company’s founding in 2018, it has responded to about 1,600 emergencies, according to its own internal data. The company has spent prodigious hours with departments in two locations — Memorial Villages in Houston and Orange Township in Ohio — responding to a handful of calls per day at specific hours.</p>
<p>That restriction hints at what has been one of the toughest challenges for the drone startup: regulations. The FAA has put in place strict rules around visual line of sight for operators of drones. In order to realize its vision of a completely seamless and easily deployed system, Paladin has had to collect extensive data and present it to the FAA to get operating waivers, which the agency offers through a “<a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/public_safety_gov/public_safety_toolkit/media/TBVLOS_Waiver_Final.pdf">First Responder Tactical Beyond Visual Line of Sight</a>” and related exceptions. So far, Paladin has secured true beyond-line-of-sight waivers for the two cities it works with, and Shrivastava is confident that the company has developed a repeatable process for any new cities that want to purchase its products.</p>
<p>Installation is relatively simple, according to Shrivastava. The drones themselves can be placed anywhere, even “a parking lot,” and are often stationed at a police department or firehouse. No special hardware or sensors or guidelines need to be installed in the city for the drones to process the terrain or understand their surroundings. Some software integration is required to connect drones into the computer-aided dispatch system used by 911 call takers.</p>
<p>With the public launch and more proof points on the board, the company is focusing on ramping up sales and “our long-term goal is to have every single fire, police and first response agency use us,” Shrivastava said. The team has expanded to about eight, although the company’s other co-founder, Trevor Pennypacker, departed in late 2019, and now works at Tesla.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">First of all, we’ve got a fancy new name. While “Robotics Roundup” was nothing if not very technically accurate, it lacked the kind of panache one ought to strive for when rounding up robotics. Actuator, on the other hand &#8212; that’s a mover and shaker.</p>
<p>It’s a name you can take to the bank (or at least run by the legal department for clearance). To mark this momentous occasion, we employed our resident graphic design genius Bryce to sketch up something befitting our rebrand.</p>
<p>We’re also using the opportunity to announce that Actuator will be coming soon to an inbox near you as a free TechCrunch newsletter. All of this fun change seems extra fitting, given that this happens to be the 25th edition of the roundup. You can find all of the older updates <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/actuator/">under our Actuator tag</a> if you want to catch up.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following for a while, you’ve got the gist of what the newsletter is about: a digestible look into the week’s robotics news. We cover all of the startups making waves and the big companies impacting the industry, along with the most fascinating updates in the world of robotic research, as well as dives into labor concerns and various ethical issues stemming from automation and AI.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2191372" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg" alt="" width="578" height="164" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg 578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg?resize=150,43 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg?resize=300,85 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg?resize=50,14 50w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /></p>
<p>If all of that sounds good, you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">can sign up here to get Actuator in your inbox</a> as soon as the first issue hits. I’m told you may have to prove you&#8217;re not a robot, so apologies in advance to all of the robots reading this. But hey, if you’ve gotten this far, you’ll figure it out.</p>

<p>Following an earlier <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-says-it-s-winding-down-realsense-camera-business">report from CRN</a>, Intel has since confirmed with TechCrunch that it will be winding down its 3D imaging platform, RealSense. It’s always a shame to see these sorts of forward-looking initiatives go away. And certainly Intel has been leaning pretty heavily on the division as a leading indicator of its efforts to remain relevant as the industry evolves.</p>
<p>Over the years, we’ve covered RealSense’s involvement in drones, robotics and AR/VR. In June of last year, we covered the platform’s embrace of 5G connectivity.</p>

<p>“We are winding down our RealSense business and transitioning our computer vision talent, technology and products to focus on advancing innovative technologies that better support our core businesses and IDM 2.0 strategy,” the company said in a statement offered to TechCrunch. “We will continue to meet our commitments to our current customers and are working with our employees and customers to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<p>Translation: The company is choosing to focus its core competency. <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership.html">IDM 2.0</a> refers specifically to the new chipmaking strategy into which the company is pumping $20 billion. Understandable, but it’s always hopeful to see big companies like Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm really go all in on such forward-facing technologies.</p>

<p>Boston Dynamics, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/atlas-slugged/">made news this week</a>, ostensibly for another slick viral video, this one featuring the Hyundai-owned company’s humanoid Atlas robot. By now we’re all well aware of the fact that the company makes impressive robots and highly effective YouTube videos that launch a million Black Mirror and Terminator jokes on Twitter.</p>
<p>I’ve seen Atlas do some really impressive stuff in person at BD’s headquarters, and I’ve got a pretty good idea of what it’s currently capable of. So, while Atlas is extremely cool, I didn’t find the recent parkour video especially shocking. What did catch me off guard, however, was the fact that the company also used the opportunity to essentially publish some outtakes from the film.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190175" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190175" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2190175" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Recording-2021-08-16-at-3.17.55-PM.2021-08-16-15_20_47.gif" alt="" width="800" height="417" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190175" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Boston Dynamics</p></div></p>
<p>A six-minute, behind-the-scenes video featured a montage of Atlas falling on its face. Like any great skateboarding video, there are a few gratuitous shots included that demonstrate that, regardless of how advanced the system is, there are still going to be some face-planting, gasket-blowing falls that leave its chest scuffed in a pool of its own fluid. The company notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>During filming, Atlas gets the vault right about half of the time. On the other runs, Atlas makes it over the barrier, but loses its balance and falls backward, and the engineers look to the logs to see if they can find opportunities for on-the-fly adjustments.</p></blockquote>

<p>That’s probably enough news of shuttered divisions and bodily robot harm for this week. A couple of fundraising rounds are worth noting.</p>
<p>First is Rapid Robotics, which has been on a fundraising tear of late. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/rapid-robotics-raises-another-36-7m/">new $36.7 million Series B</a> values the manufacturing robotics company at $192.5 million and marks its third(!) fundraising round in a year that started with a seed raise.</p>

<p>CEO Jordan Kretchmer cites pandemic-fueled manufacturing bottlenecks as a big source of interest in the company:</p>
<blockquote><p>We hear a lot about the semiconductor shortage, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Contract manufacturers can’t produce gaskets, vials, labels — you name it. I’ve seen cases where the inability to produce a single piece of U-shaped black plastic brought an entire auto line to a halt</p></blockquote>

<p>Rapid will be making its robotic systems available through the increasingly popular RaaS (robotics as a service) model also being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/diamond-age-raises-8m-to-speed-up-home-construction-with-3d-printing-and-robot-arms/">employed by Diamond Age</a>. The fellow Bay Area-based firm announced its own $8 million seed round this morning for an intriguing mix of robotics and 3D printing designed at speeding up house construction. The company is still in its early stages, but it claims its technology can dramatically reduce the need for manual labor and shrink house construction time from nine months to 30 days.</p>

<p>Following its own recent funding back in May, Picnic this week<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/picnic-launches-its-first-robotic-pizza-sytem/"> announced that it’s finally selling its modular robotic pizza maker.</a> Pizza is, of course, a popular target for food robotics companies, because Americans eat a ton of it &#8212; reportedly 100 acres a day, as of 2015. It’s also relatively uniformly constructed as far as self-contained meals go, and is therefore easier to automate.</p>

<p>And speaking of pizza robots, before we leave you this week, a note to check out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-operations/">EC-1 on Nuro</a>. Here’s a fun anecdote from Domino’s chief innovation officer that seems to ring true across the robotic spectrum:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the things we laugh about is how customers constantly talk to the bot. It’s almost like they think it’s ‘Knight Rider.’ It’s very common for customers to thank it or say goodbye, which is great because that indicates we’re creating an engaging experience that they’re not frustrated by.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.digisure.ai/">DigiSure</a>, a digital insurance company that caters to modern mobility form factors like peer-to-peer marketplaces, is officially coming out of stealth to announce a $13.1 million pre-Series A funding round. The startup will use the funds to hire more than 50 engineers, data scientists, business development, insurance and compliance specialists, as well as scale into new industry verticals and across into Europe.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2018, DigiSure has built a business around using AI and machine learning to manage big data in real time in order to provide a nuanced risk assessment and more fairly priced liability insurance for individuals renting vehicles. DigiSure has a total of 12 clients, including motorcycle rental company EagleRider, EV rental company Envoy and truck rental company Fetch. DigiSure says it goes beyond credit and driving history to give users a more personalized quote, and in the process helps operators lower their own insurance costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;With our DigiSure Protection Suite, we screen all the people who are looking to rent and operate vehicles, we prevent bad actors from getting on these vehicles that might harm other people and then we provide insurance to the operator, as well as to the individual renters,&#8221; Mike Shim, DigiSure&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Property and casualty insurance, which is usually one of an operator&#8217;s top operational costs, is <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/property-casualty-direct-insurance-united-states/">nearly a $700 billion industry</a> in the U.S., and Shim thinks that&#8217;s in large part because of outdated screening methods that result in bad actors slipping through the cracks and causing damage. Traditional auto insurance carriers typically provide a quote by comparing statistical averages to information like a user&#8217;s age, gender, education level, location, driving record, credit history, vehicle details and location, but in the vehicle rental space, Shim says underwriting is limited or non-existent.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is therefore a huge opportunity to improve the quality of the risk management by using more sophisticated pricing models that lead to better conversions and lower losses overall,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p>DigiSure&#8217;s Protection Suite uses traditional underwriting factors, as well, but also utilizes the renter&#8217;s transaction history alongside external data sources that a normal insurance company wouldn&#8217;t have access to. According to a statement from the company, the Protection Suite includes &#8220;AI-powered identity verification utilizing biometrics technology, advanced fraud detection, credit checks, driving history and telematics data integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>It then plugs the data into its proprietary machine learning algorithms to get better at providing real-time insurance quotes over time, says Shim. For example, DigiSure&#8217;s data science team might find that the ratio of rider height to seat height of a motorcycle is an important risk factor in predicting low-speed tip overs and then recommend improvements to the model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re basically constructing a composite risk profile on that user and building a profile on that user over time,&#8221; said Shim. &#8220;Our technology is creating a next generation underwriting model for next generation mobility.&#8221;</p>
<p>DigiSure is able to perform screenings and come up with a quote in seven seconds or less, according to Shim. On the user side of things, by the time they&#8217;ve begun the checkout process and are ready to finalize a booking of, say, an RV rental, DigiSure is able to offer up a dynamically priced bundled insurance product at the point of sale, making it feel like a real-time process.</p>
<p>DigiSure is still new, so there&#8217;s room to grow, says Shim. The traditional world of vehicle insurance is not built for newer mobility models, like peer-to-peer, which is currently DigiSure&#8217;s bread and butter, or shared micromobility, which the company sees a lot of potential in.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main problem was that insurance companies were just not serving our mobility customers and not able to keep pace with not only all the new business cases but also the fact that consumers are just looking to move and get around in different ways,&#8221; said Shim. &#8220;We&#8217;re basically creating a mobility insurance platform and a risk platform that is trying to get ahead and support these innovators.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the case of shared micromobility, where there&#8217;s no bundled insurance product offered at checkout, DigiSure would primarily offer its fast screening services to filter out potential loose cannons from hopping on shared scooters or bikes. The operator could then point to this service in order to lower its overall insurance costs, which typically make up a fairly large portion of the operating costs pie in an industry that&#8217;s barely been able to make a profit yet.</p>
<p>Presently, DigiSure doesn&#8217;t provide any insurance that covers the rider in the event of personal injury, but Shim says that&#8217;s standard for the industry. The platform provides property insurance for the operator or the owner of a vehicle on a peer-to-peer marketplace that protects the vehicle itself. It also provides casualty insurance for both the marketplace or operator and the rider or driver, which includes liability coverage to protect those parties if the driver is responsible for an accident that causes injury to another person or damage to another person&#8217;s property.</p>
<p>While insurance is certainly on offer here, it&#8217;s the screening tech that makes DigiSure&#8217;s product unique.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our view is it&#8217;s better to focus on the screening tech to weed out bad actors and keep the platform safe,&#8221; said Shim. &#8220;Those 1% to 2% of the customer base are likely the ones who are going to cause 30% to 40% of the worst-case claims costs. If you can control for those outcomes, you can really impact your bottom-line insurance costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>This funding round was led by<a href="https://www.moradoventures.com/"> Morado Ventures</a>, with participation from<a href="https://xplorer.vc/"> Xplorer Capital</a>,<a href="https://www.valorep.com/"> Valor Equity Partners</a>,<a href="https://www.clocktowerventures.com/"> Clocktower Technology Ventures</a>,<a href="https://truenorthcompanies.com/"> True North Cos</a> and ex-Upwork CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabiorosati/">Fabio Rosati.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reels are coming to Facebook in the U.S. The company this morning announced it will begin testing a new feature, Facebook Reels, which will give Facebook users the ability to create and share short-form video content directly within the News Feed or within Facebook Groups. The addition is an expansion of tests launched earlier this year in India, Mexico and Canada, which had focused on bringing short-form videos to Facebook users, including by sharing existing Instagram Reels to Facebook, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-instagram-india-idUSKBN2B10AV">as had been reported</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, Facebook today says it will also test a new feature that will give Instagram creators in the U.S. the option to have their Instagram Reels shown as recommended content on Facebook. If the creators opt in, their videos will appear in the &#8220;Reels&#8221; section in users&#8217; News Feed, alongside other Reels created on Facebook.</p>
<p>There will be many places where users can create Reels from Facebook, as the new feature launches.</p>
<p>Initially, you&#8217;ll be able to tap a &#8220;Create&#8221; button from the Reels section that appears as you scroll the News Feed, while you&#8217;re watching Reels or by tapping on &#8220;Reels&#8221; at the top of your News Feed. From here, users will gain access to a standard set of creation tools, including those for video capture, music selection, camera roll import, timed text and more &#8212; much like you would have access to on Instagram.</p>
<p>For audio, you can either choose a song from Facebook&#8217;s music library, record your own original audio or even use someone else&#8217;s audio, if their Reels are set to &#8220;public.&#8221; There are also a variety of effects and editing tools to choose from, including a timer for recording Reels hands-free, tools to speed up or slow down a part of the video or your original audio and a number of augmented reality effects created either by Facebook or third-party developers.</p>
<p>Facebook told us that, for the time being, &#8220;most&#8221; of Instagram Reels&#8217; features will also be available on Facebook Reels. But other features &#8212; like Remix (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/instagram-officially-launches-remix-on-reels-a-tiktok-duets-like-feature/">its take on TikTok&#8217;s side-by-side videos called Duets</a>) &#8212; will be added over time as the test scales to more people. The user interface for Reels may also evolve over time to look somewhat different from Reels on Instagram, depending on user feedback.</p>
<p>After a Reel has been created, you can choose who to share it with &#8212; such as &#8220;Friends,&#8221; a specific audience like &#8220;Friends except&#8230;&#8221;, or the general public. The latter is the default setting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The feature will be made available within Facebook Groups, where Reels can be created then shared with members of the community who have similar interests.</p>
<p>Users can also choose to tap into &#8220;My Reels&#8221; to view past creations. And you can browse Reels created by others in the News Feed, and in select Groups and Pages &#8212; where you can like, comment on or share them, just as you could with any other type of post. Reels will now be surfaced in Search results, too, Facebook told us.</p>
<p>Like much of what appears on Facebook, Reels will be recommended to users based on what people are interested in, what they engage with and what&#8217;s broadly popular. This will apply to both the shared Instagram Reels and the Facebook Reels.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191358" style="width: 655px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191358" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2191358 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?w=645" alt="" width="645" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png 1081w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=142,150 142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=284,300 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=768,810 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=645,680 645w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191358" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook (Reels in Groups)</p></div></p>
<p>The company explained the decision to replicate the Reels product inside Facebook is a result of consumers&#8217; growing interest in video, and particularly short-form video. Today, video accounts for almost half of all time spent on Facebook, in fact. On <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/29/facebook-fb-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/">Facebook&#8217;s latest earnings call</a>, CEO Mark Zuckerberg remarked that Reels was &#8220;already the largest contributor to engagement growth on Instagram,&#8221; given the popularity of short-form video.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very focused on making it easy for anyone to create video, and then for those videos to be viewed across all of our different services, starting with Facebook and Instagram first,&#8221; he had told investors.</p>
<p>But Facebook also understands that people have different communities and audiences on Instagram and Facebook, so simply offering a cross-posting option may not have sufficed.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>However, for existing Reels creators who do want to tap into Facebook&#8217;s large audience, a new option will allow them to opt-in to have their Reels shared to Facebook. This could be useful for those producing more general-interest Reels content.</p>
<p>These shared Reels will display the creator&#8217;s Instagram username, as well, which could help them build a following. Creators&#8217; Reels can also be remixed, with the creator&#8217;s permission, and their original audio can be re-used in other people&#8217;s Reels &#8212; again, much like on TikTok.</p>
<p>This feature will also be introduced as a &#8220;test,&#8221; Facebook said.</p>
<p>While Instagram is already beginning to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/instagrams-tiktok-rival-reels-rolls-out-ads-worldwide/">monetize Reels through ads</a>, Facebook told us that Reels on Facebook don&#8217;t currently include ads. But, &#8220;we plan to roll out ads in the future,&#8221; a Facebook spokesperson added.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Reels, which is Facebook&#8217;s answer to the growing threat of TikTok, first </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">launched to global audiences a year ago</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. This launch alone was not enough to win Instagram the top spot as the world&#8217;s most downloaded mobile app. In 2020,</span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/"> that win went to TikTok</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, after years where Facebook-owned apps dominated the top charts. And TikTok today continues to sit at the top of App Store charts in terms of both app installs and consumer spending, </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-1h-2021">according</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to multiple</span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.appannie.com/en/go/q2-2021-index/"> third-party reports. </a></p>
<p>For Facebook, TikTok represents an existential threat to its business. If users&#8217; time and attention are being spent elsewhere, Facebook&#8217;s advertisers could then follow, impacting Facebook&#8217;s bottom line. So instead of competing with TikTok in just one app, Facebook is now using two. And it&#8217;s leveraging its apps&#8217; interoperability to ensure the best content can easily flow to both places.</p>
<p>The company is also directly investing in the creator community in hopes of tipping the scales back in its direction.</p>
<p>In July, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">announced</a> a plan to invest more than $1 billion in creators across both Facebook and Instagram through 2022. This fund will reward more than just Reels&#8217; creators, to be clear, as it will also pay out bonuses for videos with in-stream ads enabled or for enabling IGTV ads, among other things. It will also reward top creators who have invited fans to send them tips in the form of a virtual currency, &#8220;stars.&#8221; But Instagram Reels, and now Facebook Reels, will be looped into that initiative.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tw6K9ci8mn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">Facebook will lure creators with $1 billion in payments</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Today, Facebook said it will announce additional bonus programs and seed funding in the months ahead that will pay out bonuses for Reels on Facebook. These will be funded from that $1 billion commitment. The company declined to share details on this front, but this news alone indicates Facebook Reels is far more than just &#8220;a test&#8221; in Facebook&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>The new Facebook Reels features will begin to roll out starting today, August 19, in the U.S. It will first be available to a &#8220;small percentage&#8221; of U.S. users on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>The feature will continue to operate in India, Mexico and Canada, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s CRED, which rewards users for paying their credit card bills on time, is broadening its offerings to help its 7.5 million members gain more from the service.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup said on Thursday that CRED users can now lend to one another at an interest rate of up to 9% annually.</p>
<p>Kunal Shah, founder and chief executive of CRED, said the startup is rolling out this feature, dubbed CRED Mint, initially to some users after testing this internally for months.</p>
<p>“We’re super excited about this because it’s the first time our community members will be able to invest in one another directly. It’s going to focus on high-quality, low-risk, but much better, inflation-beating returns you can get on your money,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m1edtp9M1d"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">India’s CRED valued at $2.2 billion in new $215 million fundraise</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;India’s CRED valued at $2.2 billion in new $215 million fundraise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/embed/#?secret=m1edtp9M1d" data-secret="m1edtp9M1d" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://cred.club">CRED</a> members have on average 200,000 Indian rupees ($2,685) sitting in their savings accounts, the startup said. &#8220;At up to 9% interest, CRED Mint will help these users, India’s most creditworthy individuals, to be rewarded for responsible financial behaviour with a smarter way to make idle money work for them. CRED members can apply for early access to Mint,&#8221; CRED said.</p>
<p>Peer-to-peer lending is not a new business idea. Several large and small firms operate in this space, but CRED appears to be uniquely positioned to solve one of the biggest challenges this category faces: <a href="https://www.capitalmind.in/2018/06/the-folly-of-retail-investors-lending-people-money-without-collateral-and-that-too-online/">defaulters</a>. According to some estimates, more than 20% of individuals taking a loan in a peer-to-peer service don’t pay it back.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CRED members have a credit score of 750 or higher, making them the most trustworthy audience to provide financial services. On CRED, a user has to have a credit score of 750 or higher to join the app.</p>
<p>“We do believe that the product-market fit of our offering is very strong. We believe that this could set a new benchmark for what fintechs should be doing,” said Shah. CRED also does lending itself &#8212; which is available to limited members &#8212; and has disbursed about $269 million to customers in loans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even at the scale of CRED Cash, the default rate has historically been less than 1%. To reduce risk further, the invested money will be routed directly to an escrow account held by CRED’s NBFC partner, LiquiLoans, and diversified across 200+ borrowers on average,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>For CRED Mint, the startup has partnered with LiquiLoans, an RBI-registered P2P NBFC. Shah said CRED will eventually partner with more players. Users can invest between 100,000 Indian rupees ($1,345) to 1 million rupees ($13,450) in about two minutes, and also request withdrawal at any time with no penalty.</p>
<p>&#8220;The withdrawal process is fully online, and the money with interest will be returned to the investor within a working day. As a digital platform, CRED reduces friction, inefficiency, commissions and overheads to pass on higher earnings for members,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>CRED &#8212; backed by Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital and Sequoia Capital India and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">valued at $2.2 billion in an April round</a> &#8212; has also received inbound requests from internal investors to raise a new round of over $300 million, according to people familiar with the matter. The proposed terms value CRED at about $4 billion post-money. CRED isn&#8217;t currently in advanced stages to close a round. Shah declined to comment on fundraise talks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you use AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, your mobile Netflix watching is about to get a bit more immersive. Yesterday, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/18/netflix-spatial-audio-support-roll-out/">Netflix confirmed</a> that it has begun rolling out spatial audio support on iPhone and iPad on iOS 14 after the feature was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Airpodsmax/comments/p6oiss/spatial_audio_is_now_working_on_the_netflix_app/">spotted</a> by a Reddit user.</p>
<p>Netflix joins <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-spatial-audio-ios-14-230008619.html">streaming competitors</a> like HBO Max, Disney+ and Peacock in enabling this feature, while other popular apps like Amazon Prime Video and YouTube still don&#8217;t have this functionality. Still, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/18/netflix-spatial-audio-support-roll-out/">Netflix said</a> the rollout won&#8217;t be immediate — users who have the update should be able to toggle it on or off in the Control Center.</p>
<p>Recently, Apple has been emphasizing its spatial audio features. The company first announced that it would bring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-is-bringing-spatial-audio-to-airpods-pro/">spatial audio to AirPods Pro</a> during the WWDC conference in 2020 — during this year&#8217;s conference, Apple added that Apple Music subscribers would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apple-music-launches-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio-adds-spatial-audio-playlists/">gain access</a> to spatial audio and lossless audio streaming at no extra charge. This even supports <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211775">dynamic head tracking</a>, which adjusts the sound when you move your head. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/apple-music-brings-its-spatial-audio-and-lossless-streaming-to-android/">Android version</a> of the Apple Music app also supports spatial and lossless audio. In February, Spotify said it would roll out a high-end subscription service, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">Spotify HiFi</a>, which would enable lossless audio, though there&#8217;s been no news since.</p>
<p>Last month, Netflix revealed that it started looking toward mobile gaming in addition to its original movies and television series. The company has already experimented with interactive entertainment with projects like &#8220;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&#8221; and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/netflixs-stranger-things-comes-to-roblox-ahead-of-its-july-4-premiere/">&#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; games</a>.</p>
<p>“We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV,” the company said in its <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx">quarterly earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>Spatial audio is popular among video game players — so while this update will enhance the streaming video experience on iPhone and iPad, perhaps we&#8217;ll see this feature at play in eventual Netflix mobile games, too.</p>
