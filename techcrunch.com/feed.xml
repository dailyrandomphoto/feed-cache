										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly every top investment bank is chasing Byju’s and nudging the most valuable Indian startup to seriously explore the public markets as soon as next year.</p>
<p>Most banks have given Byju’s a proposed valuation in the range of $40 billion to $45 billion, but some including Morgan Stanley have pitched a $50 billion valuation if the startup lists next year, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>The startup, which has raised $1.5 billion since the beginning of the pandemic last year, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">most recently valued at $16.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>The banks’ excitement comes as the Indian public market has shown a glimpse of strong appetite for consumer tech stocks. Food delivery Zomato had a stellar $1.3 billion debut on Indian stock exchanges last month. Scores of other top startups including Paytm, PolicyBazaar, Nykaa, Ixigo and MobiKwik have also filed paperworks for their IPOs.</p>
<p>Byju Raveendran (pictured above), the founder and chief executive of the eponymous startup, has publicly suggested in the past that he may list the firm in two to three years. According to a senior executive, who wishes to not be named as the matter is private, and an investor, the startup has not set a concrete timeline for an IPO.</p>
<p>In the immediate future, odds of Byju’s raising again is high. The startup has received several inbound requests from investors to raise at a valuation of about $21.5 billion, the people said.</p>
<p>The startup has used a significant portion of its recent fundraises to acquire firms. Earlier this year, it acquired Indian physical coaching institute <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/">Aakash for nearly $1 billion</a>. It has also acquired Great Learning, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/byjus-acquires-reading-platform-epic-for-500-million-in-us-expansion-push/">U.S.-based Epic</a>, among others, for over $1 billion in cash and stock deals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Byju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years it has also expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on the Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake.</p>
<p>The pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to enforce a months-long nationwide lockdown and close schools, accelerated its growth, and those of several other online learning startups including Unacademy and Vedantu.</p>
<p>As of early this year, Byju’s said it had amassed over 80 million users, 5.5 million of whom are paying subscribers. Byju’s, which is profitable, is on track to generate revenue of $300 million in the U.S. this year (per Raveendran), and as high as $1.1 billion in revenue overall by the end of the calendar year, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Byju’s declined to comment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Boston is benefiting from larger changes to the U.S. venture capital market, helping close historical gaps in its startup funding market and access funds that previously might have skipped the region.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global startup community is currently enjoying a period of fundraising success that may be unprecedented in the history of technology and venture capital. While this is happening around the world, few startup hubs in the world are reveling in a greater boost to their ability to attract capital than Boston.</p>
<p>The well-known U.S. city is a traditional venture capital hub, but one that seemed to fall behind its domestic rivals Silicon Valley and New York City in recent years. However, data indicates that Boston’s startup activity in fundraising terms has reached a new, higher plateau, funneling record sums into the city’s upstart technology companies this year.</p>
<p>And, according to local investors, there could be room for further acceleration in capital disbursement.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The Exchange wanted to better understand what&#8217;s driving Boston’s rapid-fire results, and discover if there is any particular need for caution or concern. Is the market overheated? According to local investors<a href="https://twitter.com/robgo"> Rob Go</a> from NextView, <a href="https://twitter.com/jamieagoldstein">Jamie Goldstein</a> from Pillar VC, <a href="https://twitter.com/lilylyman">Lily Lyman</a> from Underscore and <a href="https://twitter.com/sanjivkalevar">Sanjiv Kalevar</a> from OpenView, things may be more than warm, but Boston’s accelerating venture capital totals in 2021 are not based on FOMO or other potentially ephemeral trends.</p>
<p>Instead, Boston is benefiting from larger structural changes to at least the U.S. venture capital market, helping close historical gaps in its startup funding market and access funds that previously might have skipped the region. And local university density isn’t hurting the city’s cause, either, boosting its ability to form new companies during a period of rich investment access.</p>
<p>Let’s talk data, and then hear from the investing crew about just what is going on over in Beantown.</p>
<h2>A record year in the making</h2>
<p>When discussing venture capital data, we often note that it is somewhat laggy, with rounds announced long after they are closed. In practice, this means that more recent data can undersell how a particular quarter has performed. With Boston’s 2021 thus far, all that we can say is that if this data includes normal venture capital lag, it will simply be all the more incredible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ispace, a Japanese space startup that aims to lead the development of a lunar economy, has unveiled its design for a large lander that could go to the moon as early as 2024.</p>
<p>Tokyo-based ispace said this next-gen lander, dubbed Series 2, would be used on the company’s third planned moon mission. The lander is both larger in size and payload capacity than the company’s first lander, coming in at around 9 feet tall and 14 feet wide including legs. The vehicle will be capable of carrying up to 500 kilograms to the moon’s surface and 2,000 kilograms to lunar orbit. Series 1, which will fly in 2022 and 2023, has a maximum payload capacity of only 30 kilograms.</p>
<p>Crucially, the new lander is designed to be able to survive the frigid lunar nighttime, possibly as long as a two-week stint on the moon’s surface. It’s also capable of landing on either the near or far side of the moon, including its polar regions.</p>
<p>The new lander has a few other features as well: it has multiple payload bays, and an advanced guidance, navigation and control (GNC) system to ensure the craft sticks the landing on the moon&#8217;s surface. The GNC technology is being provided by engineering developer Draper, a company with a deep footprint in the space industry. Draper is which is also one of fourteen eligible contractors for NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.</p>
<p>Ispace said in a statement that the lander has completed its preliminary design review; the next stage is manufacturing and assembly, which will be completed in partnership with General Atomics, a defense and aerospace technology company.</p>
<p>The partnership with Draper – a CLPS contractor – is key, as ispace wants its Series 2 to compete in the NASA program. “Over the next few months, we will work closely with Draper and General Atomics to prepare for the next NASA CLPS task order,” Kyle Acierno, CEO of ispace’s U.S.-based subsidiary, said.</p>
<p>Ispace is developing the next-gen lander out of its North American offices in Colorado, and it intends to also manufacture the vehicle in the United States. In the meanwhile, the company is still at work preparing for its first two lunar missions in 2022 and 2023. The company said the Series 1 lander is undergoing final assembly of the flight module at a facility in Germany owned by space launch company ArianeGroup. The customer manifest for the first mission is full, but ispace did say payload capacity is still available for the subsequent mission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The lander unveiling comes just weeks after ispace announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/japanese-startup-ispace-raises-46m-to-support-planned-moon-missions/">the close</a> of a $46 million Series C funding round, capital it said at the time would go toward the second and third planned missions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re less than one month away from kicking off our flagship global event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>. And we’re feeling the adrenaline rush that can only come when more than 10,000 startup icons, experts, founders, investors and makers gather to learn, inspire, connect, collaborate, compete and network.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true">Buy your pass here</a> and brace yourself for three full days of Disrupt.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at just some of the opportunity that can help you move the needle on your startup aspirations.</p>
<p>You’ll find plenty of startup action on two distinct stages. First up, the Disrupt main stage featuring in-depth interviews and panel discussions with a who’s-who of tech, policy and celebrity-slash-entrepreneurial talent — like Calendly CEO Tope Awotona, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and movie-star-turned-pot-businessman Seth Rogan.</p>
<p>The Extra Crunch stage is where you’ll find a deep bench of subject-matter experts sharing practical how-to content. You’ll take away actionable insights you can put into practice now — when you need it most. We’re talking essential topics like <strong>How to Raise Your First Dollars</strong> and <strong>The Subtle Challenges of Assessing Product-Market Fit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip of the tech iceberg:</strong> Check out the full <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">Disrupt 2021 agenda</a> and don’t forget — your pass includes video-on-demand. You can relax knowing you won’t miss a single presentation.</p>
<p>Don’t miss the hundreds of innovative startups strutting their considerable stuff in Startup Alley, the virtual expo area. Dive into an ocean of opportunity — ask for a product demo, schedule a 1:1 video meeting or explore potential ways to collaborate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Networking is a huge part of Disrupt, and you’ll find multiple ways to make valuable connections. Whether they happen spontaneously in our virtual event platform (the chat is where it’s at!) or curated meetups through CrunchMatch, our AI-powered platform, you’ll meet smart, exciting people eager to make a business connection. Who knows where a simple conversation can lead?</p>
<p>Don’t miss Startup Battlefield — the epic pitch competition that launched big-name companies like Dropbox, Mint, TripIt, Vurb and many more. Top early-stage startups from around the world — from any country and industry — will compete for a shot at $100,000 in equity-free prize money. You might just catch the next unicorn in its pony stage. It’s more than thrilling — as noted by Jessica McLean, Director of Marketing and Communications, Infinite-Compute:</p>
<blockquote><p>Watching the Startup Battlefield was fantastic. You could see the ingenuity and innovation happening in different technology spaces. Just looking at the sheer number of other pitch decks and hearing the judges tear them down and give feedback was very helpful.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>.takes place September 21-23 — that’s less than a month away, folks! <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">Buy your pass</a>, plan your schedule and get ready to join your people and move your business forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.paxos.com">Paxos</a>, the company behind the Paxos Standard stablecoin (PAX), has <a href="https://www.paxos.com/the-digital-dollar-that-always-equals-a-dollar-paxos-standard-pax-is-now-pax-dollar-usdp/">announced</a> that it is changing the name of its cryptoasset. Paxos Standard is now Pax Dollar, and you’ll soon be able to identify it on your favorite cryptocurrency exchange, wallet or explorer under the USDP ticker.</p>
<p>Other than the name, USDP remains fundamentally identical to PAX. Like other stablecoins, USDP has been invented so that its value doesn’t fluctuate over time when you compare it to fiat currencies. The value of USDP is indexed to USD. At any point in time, one USDP is worth one USD.</p>
<p>Stablecoins provide many advantages. Sending money is as easy as moving crypto assets from one wallet to another. You don’t have to enter intermediary bank information, worry about local regulation, etc. Many people around the world don’t have bank accounts — stablecoins and cryptocurrency wallets could potentially become an alternative to traditional bank accounts.</p>
<p>You can also use stablecoins to take advantage of DeFi projects (decentralized finance). For instance, you can contribute to lending pools and earn interests from your stablecoin holdings.</p>
<p>In addition to USDP, other popular stablecoins include USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT). As you can see, a naming convention has emerged over time. And Paxos says that it is changing the name of its stablecoin for this reason in particular.</p>
<p>Whenever Paxos issues new tokens, it stores some USD and USD equivalent in a bank account. Right now, Paxos <a href="https://www.paxos.com/a-regulated-stablecoin-means-having-a-regulator/">uses</a> US Treasury Bills with short maturities as USD equivalent. Auditing firms regularly check the company’s claims.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paxos tries to position itself as a company that is deeply committed to regulation. It has recently written <a href="https://www.paxos.com/a-regulated-stablecoin-means-having-a-regulator/">a report</a> highlighting the differences between USDP, USDC and USDT. According to the company, USDC and USDT shouldn’t be considered as regulated assets because of their reserves. Paxos wants to emerge as the most legitimate player in the space so that big corporate clients choose Paxos as their preferred partners.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, Circle announced that USDC would <a href="https://www.centre.io/blog/usdc-reserves-composition">switch</a> to cash and cash equivalent for USDC reserves. I’m sure we’ll hear more from cryptocurrency companies and their stablecoin reserve strategies in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“In order to become a better writer, read your written words out loud.”</p>
<p>That’s one of the first, and best, writing tips I ever received. I always found the advice ironic because it required me to change the medium of my writing to become a better writer. Still, all these years later, it&#8217;s true: Vocalizing your words helps identify typos and incomplete thoughts, but also notice more subtle things like awkward turns of phrases or a weird rhythm in your sentence structure. Best of all, if you find yourself bored of your own text while reading out loud, you know readers will be, too.</p>
<p>This is all to say that writing, even for those who love writing, is a deeply human art built on top of non-obvious rules. While those complications don’t exactly scream for a tech solution, <a href="http://noredink.com">NoRedInk</a>, a San Francisco-based startup, has spent nearly a decade trying to help students get better at their writing through software.</p>
<p>NoRedInk announced today that its digital writing curriculum, which pairs adaptive learning with Mad Libs-style prompts, has helped it raise a $50 million Series B led by Susquehanna Growth Equity, with participation from True Ventures. Other investors in the company include GSV, Rethink Education and Kapor Capital.</p>
<p>The financing event comes nearly six years after its Series A, a signal that the company has ambition to scale meaningfully in the coming months and years. With millions more, though, NoRedInk has to address its biggest challenge: the intricacies of the subject matter that it wants to make simple.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffscheur"> Jeff Scheur</a> built NoRedInk in 2012 when he was an English teacher in Chicago. The site served as a way to help kids get more than &#8220;red ink&#8221; on their papers, a nod at how teachers often use red ink to mark corrections and suggestions on assignments.</p>
<p>“Kids get feedback on their paper and they have no idea what to do with it,” Scheur said. “They see the grade, but they tend to just throw it out … so I figured out how to help them apply very difficult-to-learn skills that we expect kids to know, but don’t explicitly teach them.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since launch, NoRedInk’s goal is to help students with writing skills ranging from how to structure an essay to how to cut fluff from their arguments to how to cite correctly.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193365" style="width: 875px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193365" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2193365" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png" alt="" width="865" height="458" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png 2182w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=680,360 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=1536,812 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=2048,1083 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193365" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NoRedInk</p></div></p>
<p>“One of the great challenges about teaching writing is that we want to demystify the process of becoming a great writer without reducing the art form of expression,” he said. “So that means providing kids with lots of targeted personalized practice, and helping them realize that there’s no one way to write.”</p>
<p>It thus makes sense that NoRedInk uses adaptive learning, an educational method that uses an algorithm to get inputs of learners, such as strength areas or preferences, to create an output that better meets them where they are. After asking students for their favorite characters and role models, NoRedInk creates personalized writing exercises targeting each student’s interests, then guides them through the writing process with light support.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193362" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193362" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2193362" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png" alt="noredink" width="857" height="344" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png 6814w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=300,120 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=768,308 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=680,273 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=1536,616 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=2048,821 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193362" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NoRedInk</p></div></p>
<p>Scheur described part of the goal of NoRedInk as “breaking down difficult to learn skills with various degrees of scaffolding.”</p>
<p>To date, more than 10 billion exercises have been completed on NoRedInk’s practice engine &#8212; which is data the company uses to underscore problem areas, shared struggles and potential blind spots of traditional curriculum for its districts.</p>
<p>NoRedInk has a free-but-limited version of its platform for teachers to try, but offers a full-fledged premium version that integrates with learning management systems and other classrooms to offer a school and district a view of progress.</p>
<p>As the business expands, NoRedInk might need to get deeper into drafts in order to win over market share. Will it ever play the role of suggesting tone the way <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/grammarly-raises-90m-at-over-1b-valuation-for-its-ai-based-grammar-and-writing-tools/">that AI-based grammar and writing unicorn Grammarly does</a>? For now, it appears not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grammarly is a great consumer app, it&#8217;s a modern-day version of Grammar spellcheck that Microsoft Word did all those years ago,&#8221; Scheur said. &#8220;NoRedInk is very different; it&#8217;s what schools and districts use to teach skills.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aileen Lee is one of the most prestigious and successful venture capitalists of the past decade. Before starting her own firm in Cowboy Ventures, Lee was a partner at KPCB for more than 12 years. Her portfolio includes DocSend, Ironclad, Philz Coffee, StyleSeat and many, many more.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Lee join us alongside one of her portfolio company founders, Guild Education&#8217;s Rachel Carlson, on an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-with-cowboy-ventures-and-guild-education?ref=2981607eb662">Click to register for free!</a></p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live brings founders and their investors together to pop the lid off of the black box that is fundraising. How did they meet? Why did they choose each other? What got them to yes? How do they work together now?</p>
<p>These are the pieces of the fundraising process that often aren&#8217;t covered in your average &#8220;how to fundraise&#8221; blog posts and programming, and we&#8217;re here to get these questions answered.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> also features the ECL Pitch-off, which gives folks in the audience the chance to raise their hand and pitch their startup to our guests, who will give their live feedback.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. Let&#8217;s get to know our guests.</p>
<p>Lee has been one of the most sought-after investors in Silicon Valley for as long as I&#8217;ve been in tech. A founding partner at All Raise, she is committed to diversity and inclusion and has an eye for talent, realizing that the former often precedes the latter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She&#8217;s been on the Midas List a handful of times, and is also listed as one of Forbes&#8217; most influential people.</p>
<p>Rachel Carlson founded Guild Education in 2015 and has led the company since. Guild has raised upwards of $370 million from investors that include General Catalyst, Felicis, Bessemer and more.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to these two about how to get to yes, what sings in a pitch deck and how they operate as partners to this day.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every time you turn around, someone new is winning the war in California around organizing workers in the sharing economy.</p>
<p>Labor struck first when California legislators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/10/gig-worker-bill-ab-5-passes-in-california/">passed</a> Assembly Bill 5, requiring all independent contractors working for gig economy companies to be reclassified as employees. That was expected to set off a chain reaction in state legislatures nationwide, until two things happened.</p>
<p>First, COVID-19 hit and quickly became all-encompassing, making it virtually impossible for lawmakers and regulators to focus on anything but surviving the pandemic. Second, Uber, Lyft, Instacart and others funded and voters approved Prop 22 in California, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/prop-22-results/">striking down</a> AB-5 and returning sharing economy workers to independent contractor status.</p>
<p>On the same day that Prop 22 passed, Democrats captured both chambers of Congress in Washington, but their margins were so slim (50-50 in the Senate and a nine-vote majority in the House), that federal legislative action on the issue was near impossible. Across the country, politicians read the tea leaves of Prop 22 and decided to mainly stay away. That kept the issue at bay during the 2021 state legislative sessions.</p>
<p>But the tide started to turn again this summer. First, U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Virginia) introduced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/842?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22protecting+the+right+to+organize%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1">PRO Act</a> in February 2021, stating that workers would be reclassified using an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/24/the-lobbying-is-fast-and-furious-as-gig-companies-seek-relief-from-pro-labor-supreme-court-ruling/">ABC test</a>, in addition to rolling back right-to-work laws in states and establishing monetary penalties for companies and executives who violate workers’ rights.</p>
<p>The bill handily passed the House in March, but has since stalled in the Senate, despite receiving a hearing and energetic support by high-profile senators including Bernie Sanders and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s appointees to the Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board are decidedly in favor of full-time-worker status. And now, a California Superior Court judge has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/californias-gig-worker-prop-22-ruled-unconstitutional-by-superior-court/">ruled</a> Prop 22 unconstitutional, saying it violates the right of the state legislature to pass future laws around worker safety and status.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The sharing economy companies are expected to appeal, and the case could <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/20/uber-lyft-prop-22-unconstitutional/">ultimately</a> wind up before the California Supreme Court.</p>
<p>So now what? The courts will ultimately determine the status of sharing economy workers in California, but since the decision will be about the specific legal parameters of California’s referendum process, it won’t determine the issue elsewhere. And despite noise from Washington, Congress isn’t passing the PRO Act any time soon (Democrats may try to include it in the reconciliation for the $3.5 trillion American Families Plan, but the odds of its survival are low). That means the action returns to the states.</p>
<p>New York is the biggest battleground outside of California. Democrats have amassed a supermajority in both chambers of the legislature, and New York lacks a referendum vehicle to overturn state law.</p>
<p>Sharing economy workers are the biggest organizing opportunity for private sector unions in decades, and labor will use all of its influence to pass worker classification reform in 2022.</p>
<p>However, Kathy Hochul, New York’s new governor, is a moderate, and state legislators recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/uber-new-york-union-bill-is-dead-for-this-year-sponsor-says">abandoned</a> a half-baked plan brokered by gig companies to safeguard independent contractor status, indicating a resolution on the issue will likely take time.</p>
<p>Illinois is fertile ground for worker reclassification, too, but the state <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/lyft-won-big-in-california-now-its-set-its-sights-on-illinois/">remains</a> a question mark.</p>
<p>There’s also a chance of movement in Massachusetts, where gig companies are making a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/uber-ceo-calls-massachusetts-gig-economy-ballot-measure-the-right-answer/">play</a> to establish a ballot initiative very similar to Prop 22. Legislators in <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattles-covid-19-rules-have-paid-off-for-delivery-app-drivers-whats-next/">Seattle</a> and <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/ab5-gig-worker-employees-independent-contractors-philadelphia-uber-lyft-20190911.html">Pennsylvania</a> have also signaled an interest in exploring the issue.</p>
<p>And just a few months after most state legislative sessions conclude next summer, we’ll hit the midterm elections, which could produce a Republican wave (especially in the House) that would yet again quash the chances of worker classification legislation passing anywhere.</p>
<p>In other words, this is going to ping back and forth for at least the next few years in the courts, in state legislatures, and in the halls of Congress and federal agencies. If you’re a sharing economy investor and you want this issue resolved once and for all, that peace of mind isn’t coming. And the market, rather than accepting that this will be an unresolved issue for the next few years, will probably overreact to each individual action, whether it’s a lower court ruling or a piece of legislation making its way through a state.</p>
<p>In reality, the answer is the same as it’s always been: Trying to shoehorn sharing economy workers into one of two existing categories &#8212; 1099 or W-2 &#8212; doesn’t work. We still need to recognize that the inherent nature of work has changed over the last decade, and we need to recognize that both parties &#8212; the sharing economy companies and the unions &#8212; are only looking out for their own interests and coffers at the expense of what’s best for actual workers.</p>
<p>California is not going to resolve this issue. It’s just swung back and forth from one extreme to another. Congress is not going to resolve this issue because it almost never resolves anything.</p>
<p>So the game comes down to states like Illinois, New York and Massachusetts. It comes down to legislators and leaders trying to craft good public policy at the expense of their donors and supporters and Twitter followers &#8212; and then it comes down to their colleagues doing the same.</p>
<p>It means sacrificing politics for policy. That almost never happens. And it probably won’t happen here, either. So if you’re trying to game out where this issue is going, accept the uncertainty and expect that a thoughtful, smart resolution &#8212; locally or nationally &#8212; is unlikely. It’s a dissatisfying conclusion but, sadly, it epitomizes exactly where our politics stand today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A quick survey of many of the most highly valued electric vertical take-off and landing companies shows one thing in common: All of them are developing aircraft powered by batteries. But a growing suite of aviation companies, turned off by what they see as the energy density limitations of lithium-ion batteries, are turning instead to hydrogen fuel cells.</p>
<p>This is where HyPoint comes in. The two-year-old company has been working with a number of eVTOL companies, like ZeroAvia, on air-cooled hydrogen fuel cell systems that it says have triple the power-to-weight ratio of traditional liquid-cooled hydrogen fuel cells. Now, the fuel cell developer is adding Piasecki Aircraft Corporation to its list of partners.</p>
<p>The relationship between the two companies is being minted with a $6.5 million multiphase development agreement for the design and certification of hydrogen fuel cell systems. Through the partnership, HyPoint aims to deliver five full-scale, 650 kilowatt hydrogen fuel cell systems for ground testing, demo flights and the certification process.</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system that has four times the energy density of existing lithium-ion batteries, double the specific power of existing hydrogen fuel cell systems, and that costs up to 50% less relative to the operative costs of turbine-powered rotorcraft. HyPoint unveiled a prototype of the new technology in March.</p>

<p>Through the deal, Piasecki will have exclusive license to the tech created as a result of the partnership. It aims to use the technology for use in its PA-890 manned helicopter, which it says would be the first hydrogen-powered helicopter on the market. HyPoint will maintain exclusive ownership of the fuel cell system.</p>
<p>The two companies said in a statement that they intend to make the system available to other eVTOL makers as well. “Piasecki is ready to support other eVTOL makers with Hypoint,” HyPoint CEO Alex Ivanenko told TechCrunch</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The agreement started with a feasibility study, in which HyPoint created a very small-scale prototype to show proof-of-concept. Now, the company is in the design stage, at work building a single power module (each 650 kW system contains several), and an integration concept of the system in Piasecki’s aircraft. The single power module will be ready by the end of this year, with the first 650 kW system being delivered to Piasecki in 2023, and a commercially available product by around 2025.</p>

<p>The two companies have also developed a certification roadmap that outlines when HyPoint needs to deliver systems, to ensure that they’re ready for testing and demo flights with the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>“Our objective is to develop full-scale systems within two years to support on-aircraft certification testing in 2024 and fulfill existing customer orders for up to 325 units starting in 2025,” John Piasecki, CEO of Piasecki, said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said on Tuesday the company plans to offer free temporary housing to 20,000 Afghan refugees around the world amid the Taliban’s rise to power in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Chesky said the company will cover the costs for the housing, using funds from contributions to its nonprofit Airbnb.org and a specific Refugee Fund established by that division, as well as personal contributions from Chesky himself. Airbnb will also work alongside NGOs through Airbnb.org, which provides people with emergency housing in times of crisis.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starting today, Airbnb will begin housing 20,000 Afghan refugees globally for free.</p>
<p>&mdash; Brian Chesky (@bchesky) <a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1430067315228352512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“The displacement and resettlement of Afghan refugees in the U.S. and elsewhere is one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time. We feel a responsibility to step up,” Chesky said <a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1430067315228352512">in a tweet.</a></p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet, Chesky said Airbnb hosts who are willing to offer up their residences will soon be able to sign up to accommodate a refugee family fleeing Afghanistan. Airbnb plans on sharing more details on how hosts and the broader community can support the initiative. Chesky said he hopes Airbnb’s initiative will inspire other business leaders to do the same.</p>
<p>The company said it has already worked with partners to place 165 refugees in safe housing after reaching the U.S. this past weekend. Airbnb plans to work with resettlement agencies to evolve the initiative and provide support as necessary.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Airbnb’s initiative comes at a time when tens of thousands of people are attempting to flee Afghanistan. Amid the crisis, companies and governments are facing increasing pressure to aid refugees fleeing the country. There are currently nearly 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan, according to the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/uk/afghanistan.html">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a>. Since August 15, countries have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-evacuation-war-footing-g7-meets-pullout-deadline-2021-08-24/">evacuated around 58,700 people</a> from the country’s capital, Kabul.</p>
<p>“As tens of thousands of Afghan refugees resettle around the world, where they stay will be the first chapter in their new lives. For these 20,000 refugees, my hope is that the Airbnb community will provide them with not only a safe place to rest and start over, but also a warm welcome home,” Chesky said in a statement.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting Airbnb has historically provided free housing to those in need over the past few years. In 2017, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/29/airbnb-free-housing-immigration-ban/">company offered free housing</a> to stranded refugees, students and green card holders affected by former President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html?">executive order</a> limiting refugees. More recently, Airbnb provided free or subsidized housing for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/airbnb-to-provide-free-or-subsidized-housing-for-100000-covid-19-healthcare-workers/">100,000 healthcare workers</a> amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Airbnb notes it has connected approximately 25,000 refugees to temporary housing over the past four years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israel-based AI healthtech company, <a href="https://www.dia-analysis.com">DiA Imaging Analysis</a>, which is using deep learning and machine learning to automate analysis of ultrasound scans, has closed a $14 million Series B round of funding.</p>
<p>Backers in the growth round, which comes three years after DiA last raised, include new investors Alchimia Ventures, Downing Ventures, ICON Fund, Philips and XTX Ventures &#8212; with existing investors also participating including CE Ventures, Connecticut Innovations, Defta Partners, Mindset Ventures, and Dr Shmuel Cabilly. In total, it&#8217;s taken in $25M to date.</p>
<p>The latest financing will go on expanding its product range and going after new and expanded partnerships with ultrasound vendors, PACS/Healthcare IT companies, resellers, and distributors while continuing to build out its presence across three regional markets.</p>
<p>The healthtech company sells AI-powered support software to clinicians and healthcare professionals to help them capture and analyze ultrasound imagery &#8212; a process which, when done manually, requires human expertise to visually interpret scan data. So DiA touts its AI technology as &#8220;taking the subjectivity out of the manual and visual estimation processes being performed today&#8221;.</p>
<p>It has trained AIs to assess ultrasound imagery so as to automatically hone in on key details or identify abnormalities &#8212; offering a range of products targeted at different clinical requirements associated with ultrasound analysis, including several focused on the heart (where its software can, for example, be used to measure and analyze aspects like ejection fraction; right ventricle size and function; plus perform detection assistance for coronary disease, among other offerings).</p>
<p>It also has a product that leverages ultrasound data to automate measurement of bladder volume.</p>
<p>DiA claims its AI software imitates the way the human eye detects borders and identifies motion &#8212; touting it as an advance over &#8220;subjective&#8221; human analysis that also brings speed and efficiency gains.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our software tools are supporting tool for clinicians needing to both acquiring the right image and interpreting ultrasound data,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder Hila Goldman-Aslan.</p>
<p>DiA&#8217;s AI-based analysis is being used in some 20 markets currently &#8212; including in North America and Europe (in China it also says a partner gained approval for use of its software as part of their own device) &#8212; with the company deploying a go-to-market strategy that involves working with channel partners (such as GE, Philips and Konica Minolta) which offer the software as an add on on their ultrasound or PACS systems.</p>
<p>Per Goldman-Aslan, some 3,000+ end-users have access to its software at this stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our technology is vendor neutral and cross platform therefore runs on any ultrasound device or healthcare IT systems. That is why you can see we have more than 10 partnerships with both device companies as well as healthcare IT/PACS companies. There is no other startup in this space I know that has these capabilities, commercial traction or many FDA/CE AI-based solutions,&#8221; she says, adding: &#8220;Up to date we have 7 FDA/CE approved solutions for cardiac and abdominal areas and more are on the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>An AI&#8217;s performance is of course only as good as the data-set it&#8217;s been trained on. And in the healthcare space efficacy is an especially crucial factor &#8212; given that any bias in training data could lead to a flawed model which misdiagnoses or under/over-estimates disease risks in patient groups who were not well represented in the training data.</p>
<p>Asked about how its AIs were trained to be able to spot key details in ultrasound imagery, Goldman-Aslan told TechCrunch: &#8220;We have access to hundreds of thousands ultrasound images through many medical facilities therefore have the ability to move fast from one automatic area to another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We collect diverse population data with different pathology, as well as data from various devices,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a Phrase &#8216;Garbage in Garbage out&#8217;. The key is not to bring garbage in,&#8221; she also told us. &#8220;Our data sets are tagged and classified by several physicians and technicians, each are experts with many years on experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also have a strong rejection system that rejects images that was taken incorrectly. This is how we overcome the subjectivity of how data was acquired.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the FDA clearances obtained by DiA are 510(k) Class II approvals &#8212; and Goldman-Aslan confirmed to us that it has not (and does not intend) to apply for Premarket Approval (PMA) for its products from the FDA.</p>
<p>The 510(k) route is widely used for gaining approval for putting many types of medical devices into the US market. However it has been criticized as a light-touch regime &#8212; and certainly does not entail the same level of scrutiny as the more rigorous PMA process.</p>
<p>The wider point is that regulation of fast-developing AI technologies tends to lag behind developments in how they&#8217;re being applied &#8212; including as they push increasingly into the healthcare space where there&#8217;s certainly huge promise but also serious risks if they fail to live up to the glossy marketing &#8212; meaning there is still something of a gap between the promises made by device makers and how much regulatory oversight their tools actually get.</p>
<p>In the European Union, for example, the CE scheme &#8212; which sets out some health, safety and environmental standards for devices &#8212; can simply require a manufacturer to self declare conformity, without any independent verification they&#8217;re actually meeting the standards they claim, although some medical devices can require a degree of independent assessment of conformity under the CE scheme. But it&#8217;s not considered a rigorous regime for regulating the safety of novel technologies like AI.</p>
<p>Hence the EU is now working on introducing an additional layer of conformity assessments specifically for applications of AI deemed &#8216;high risk&#8217; &#8212; under the incoming Artificial Intelligence Act.</p>
<p>Healthcare use-cases, like DiA&#8217;s AI-based ultrasound analysis, would almost certainly fall under that classification so would face some additional regulatory requirements under the AIA. For now, though, the on-the-table proposal is being debated by EU co-legislators and a dedicated regulatory regime for risky applications of AI remains years out of coming into force in the region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Waymo, the self-driving vehicle company under Alphabet, has launched a robotaxi service that will be open to certain vetted riders in San Francisco.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Tuesday, the company officially kicked off its Waymo One Trusted Tester program in the city with a fleet of all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs equipped with the company&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2020/03/introducing-5th-generation-waymo-driver.html">fifth generation of its autonomous vehicle system</a>. This AV system, which has been branded the Waymo Driver, is informed by 20 million self-driven miles on public roads and over 10 billion miles driven in simulation, according to Waymo.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The so-called Waymo One Trusted Tester program mirrors the company&#8217;s strategy in Phoenix, where it rolled out its first commercial ride-hailing service several years ago. The Trusted Tester program is a rebranding of Waymo&#8217;s previous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/waymo-launches-self-driving-car-service-waymo-one/">Early Rider Program</a> that it launched in Metro Phoenix in April 2017. Seeing as it&#8217;s been over four years, those riders are no longer exactly &#8220;early,&#8221; so a name change was in order, according to a Waymo spokesperson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Phoenix, Waymo eventually invited some of the early riders to move over to the Waymo One service, which let users publicly share their impressions on the service and invite friends or family member who weren&#8217;t part of the early rider program. Waymo then opened the service to everyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">San Franciscans can download the Waymo One app and express their interest in joining the program, which will begin with an initial select group from diverse backgrounds with varied transportation needs, including wheelchair accessibility, according to Waymo. The company would not share how many riders would be included in the initial group, nor how many Jaguars it will have roaming the city, but it did say riders would have to be willing to offer a lot of detailed feedback on their riding experience and sign a nondisclosure agreement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Waymo will encourage riders to use its autonomous service to help them with their everyday mobility needs. The rides are free for now, and will start out in an initial territory in parts of San Francisco, including <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the Sunset, Richmond, Pacific Heights, Noe Valley, the Castro, Haight-Ashbury and more, with expectations to expand over time. The service will be offered 24 hours per day, seven days per week, the spokesperson told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The company will have so-called &#8220;autonomous specialists&#8221; — another term for human safety operators — sitting in the front seat to monitor the ride and ensure a safe experience. These safety drivers are contract workers, and employed by Transdev. Waymo has long partnered with Transdev to provide staffing for some of its operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Waymo&#8217;s rider support team will also be available at the tap of the button on the in-car screen or through the app if riders have any questions during their rides, the spokesperson said.</p>
<div dir="auto">
<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo&#8217;s first ride-hailing service launched in Phoenix, but its roots are in California, notably the Silicon Valley enclave of Mountain View. It&#8217;s been testing in the greater San Francisco Bay area for more than a decade.</p>
<p>The company began testing its robotaxi service by offering autonomous rides to its employees in the city earlier this year.</p>
<p>The news about the Trusted Tester launch comes a week after Waymo announced that it&#8217;s scaling up its Waymo Via autonomous trucking operations in Texas, Arizona and California, and is building a trucking hub outside of Dallas. The company has also been testing its fifth generation Driver on Class 8 trucks in Texas, hauling freight for carriers like J.B. Hunt, so this newest application of the Driver is a sign that Waymo is either succeeding at its push to full autonomy, or that it&#8217;s putting the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/waymo-alphabets-self-driving-arm-raises-2-5b-in-second-external-investment-round/">$2.5 billion</a> in funding to good use.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Greenfly is building a workflow to provide sourcing, creation and automated distribution of short-form photos and videos created for social media.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Greenfly’s latest funding round has a new face: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Phoenix Suns point guard </span>Chris Paul joined as a strategic investor and partner in the company, which developed digital media flow management software.</p>
<p>Paul’s investment is part of an $8.4 million strategic growth round that also includes Verance Capital, Higher Ground Labs, DD Venture Capital, SW19 Ventures, LinkinFirm and Allievo Capital, as well as existing investors Go4it Capital, Elysian Park Ventures, Alpha Edison and Iconica Partners.</p>
<p>The new round gives Los Angeles-based Greenfly over $23 million raised since the company was founded in 2014 by former Major League Baseball All-Star Shawn Green and his cousin Daniel Kirschner, who previously held senior roles at the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission and Activision Blizzard.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;LeBron Tweets, Blames Chris Paul For Making Him Sign Up&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/06/lebron-james-tweet/embed/#?secret=GAS44XiZEp" data-secret="GAS44XiZEp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Green and Kirschner saw how social media was driving new sources of revenue for organizations like sports teams, politics and consumer brands, but needed a way for real-time distribution of media to be easily shared. Kirschner explained that when Green first started in his career, there were times when he needed to provide feedback for a public moment, like when his home run record was tied, and it occurred to Green that they could build a mini media studio.</p>
<p>Paul, an 11-time National Basketball Association All-Star, was one of Greenfly&#8217;s early adopters, using the platform to share content to his social media channels following his games. However, Paul realized he was also sitting on valuable content within his phone, like game or event photos, but without a good system for easily accessing them or matching them to events going on at that moment. He considers Greenfly &#8220;instant access to a media gallery&#8221; that he can share on his social media accounts.</p>
<p>One of the best features, he explained, was seeing a post on social media with only two photos of an event, but while searching Greenfly, he came across 12 to 15 other photos that he had never seen. He believes the company will continue to grow, and as a partner, will work with Greenfly to build awareness for the platform and get other players involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a big believer of creating memories and seeing photos,&#8221; Paul told TechCrunch. &#8220;You can go in and search for my name and Devin Booker&#8217;s and see photos of us playing together. The NBA uses Greenfly to automate the media and share with others. I love it because it makes it easy — you don’t want something hard and complicated.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead of just repurposing materials, Greenfly will continue to build a workflow around events that provides sourcing, creation and automated distribution of photos and short-form videos created for social media.</p>
<p>Greenfly is also working on increased improvements to curate media most relevant to users, and is collecting data to provide more insights around that so that users can manage relationships with their community to amplify their messages. The new funding will go toward growth and expansion to build additional collaboration tools and content as more players sign on.</p>
<p>“With Chris, it is an opportunity to come at it from the athlete’s perspective,” Kirschner said. “Our deals are mainly with leagues and teams, so to be working with athletes, who are their own brands, enables us to be the system of record for all sides.”</p>
<p>The past year was a big growth period for the company, and it had been reaching a tipping point just prior to 2020, he added. Greenfly is now working with more than 30 sports leagues, including the NBA, Major League Baseball and World Surf League.</p>
<p>It also boasts over 500 organizations in sports, media and entertainment, political campaigns, social causes and consumer brands, and is experiencing over 100% growth so far in 2021, Kirschner said.</p>
<p>With social media evolving, the company is looking for more polished content because it learned that stories and intimate content performs better.</p>
<p>“We set out to build a content collaboration platform to provide content that athletes and others can share on social media and also manage that workflow around large, complex organizations,” he added. “Organizations have lots of content and we make that available through routing tools and curation, making it easy to find what you are looking for.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> acquired <a href="http://slack.com/">Slack</a> at the end of last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">for almost $28 billion</a>, the deal seemed on its face to make sense, given that the coronavirus pandemic accelerated already growing demand for tools that enable people to work remotely and that roughly 90% of Slack’s enterprise customers already used Salesforce.</p>
<p>Today, the question is: How well are things going?</p>
<p>Salesforce just last week announced some initial integrations with Slack, including introducing so-called account and deal Slack rooms to its “Sales Cloud,&#8221; which Salesforce says will allow sales teams to interact around a customer deal cycle. Rob Seaman, SVP for Slack at Salesforce, told TechCrunch last week that, more broadly, “We really want Slack to be the primary engagement surface for our users, their communications, their work, their workflows and the processes and the apps they support.&#8221;</p>
<p>But these kinds of public pronouncements don&#8217;t get to the heart of what&#8217;s happening <em>inside</em> the company. That&#8217;s where TechCrunch steps in. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true">TechCrunch Disrupt happening September 21-23</a>, we are thrilled to be sitting down with both Bret Taylor &#8212; the entrepreneur and former Facebook executive who is now the No. 2 executive at Salesforce &#8212; and famed Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, to learn far more about their collective mission to take on Microsoft, and what, if anything, the market doesn&#8217;t understand about the tie-up between Salesforce and Slack. (Saleforces&#8217;s shares are only up slightly from a year ago and priced 16% higher than they were at the start of this year, compared to the S&amp;P 500, which is up 35%.)</p>
<p>Who reports to whom? How independently is Slack being run? How will the two judge the success of the merger, and by when? These are just a few of the many questions we have for these two iconic executives, whose candid conversation with TC is one you won&#8217;t want to miss.</p>
<p>To participate in this year&#8217;s virtual show, check out the<a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true"> handful of pass options with discounts now available for founders, students and nonprofits</a>. <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true">Get your ticket soon</a>, though; prices more than double on September 20. We hope to see you online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart today <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/08/24/walmart-launches-walmart-golocal-a-new-delivery-as-a-service-business">announced</a> a new delivery service business called Walmart GoLocal, which allows other merchants, both large and small, to tap into Walmart&#8217;s own delivery platform to get orders to their customers. Merchants can choose to use the service for a variety of delivery types, including scheduled and unscheduled deliveries, including same-day delivery, and they can expand their delivery capacity and coverage as their own customer demand requires.</p>
<p>GoLocal is powered by services Walmart first developed for its own delivery needs. Over the past three years, Walmart has been working to scale its in-house <a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/express-delivery/3696472">Express Delivery service, </a>which promises delivery in two hours or less. This service now offers 160,000+ products at some 3,000 stores, reaching nearly 70% of the U.S. population, the company says. Now it believes it&#8217;s ready to make these same capabilities available to other merchants across the U.S. with GoLocal.</p>
<p>While the new B2B service allows merchants to leverage Walmart&#8217;s last-mile network and logistics, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that Walmart employees will be delivering the packages &#8212; at least at first.</p>
<p>Instead, GoLocal&#8217;s last-mile capabilities will be handled by gig workers from <a href="https://drive4spark.walmart.com/">Walmart&#8217;s Spark Driver program.</a> These same drivers also support Walmart&#8217;s same-day grocery delivery. But while the same-day service additionally<a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/walmart-grocery-delivery-reaches-3000-stores/594282/"> relies on third-party delivery services </a>&#8212; like Roadie, DoorDash and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates/">Uber&#8217;s Postmates</a> &#8212; Walmart tells us that third-party delivery services won&#8217;t be involved in GoLocal.</p>
<p>Instead, Walmart plans to expand GoLocal over time to include more associate-powered delivery. Already, Walmart is testing associate delivery in electric vans in Northwest Arkansas, for example. These vans would allow Walmart to power delivery for a wider variety of merchants &#8212; like those with larger products that wouldn&#8217;t fit into Spark drivers&#8217; personal cars and trucks. Walmart also plans to evolve GoLocal delivery via newer innovations like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/furner_excited-to-see-the-progress-were-making-activity-6830524149019103232-ibgA">drones</a> and autonomous vehicles, which Walmart has been testing through its Express Delivery service.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve worked hard to develop a reliable last mile delivery program for our customers,&#8221; said Tom Ward, senior vice president, Last Mile, Walmart U.S., in a statement. &#8220;Now, we’re pleased to be able to use these capabilities to serve another set of customers – local merchants. Be it delivering goods from a local bakery to auto supplies from a national retailer, we’ve designed Walmart GoLocal to be customizable for merchants of all sizes and categories so they can focus on doing what they do best, leaving delivery speed and efficiency to us,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Participating GoLocal merchants don&#8217;t have to be of a certain size. Anyone from a mom-and-pop to a national retailer can opt to use the service. They also don&#8217;t have to sell on Walmart.com&#8217;s marketplace, as this isn&#8217;t a fulfillment service where Walmart both houses and delivers third-party inventory &#8212; it&#8217;s just the last-mile delivery portion. The merchant inventory remains at their own local stores.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While any retailer could use GoLocal, getting started requires technical integrations on the retailers&#8217; part. Walmart provides an API that plugs into their existing commerce platform, which will ping GoLocal when customers place orders. This alerts GoLocal to dispatch the driver while Walmart captures delivery experience feedback, it says. If widely adopted, this could also give Walmart access to local delivery data to analyze that could aid in improving its own delivery business or inform decisions about fulfillment center placement &#8212; a potential competitive advantage.</p>

<p>Walmart says it already has some merchant partners signed up for GoLocal, including contracts with some national enterprise retailers, but is not yet permitted to disclose those names. It won&#8217;t detail the pricing for the service, explaining that as a white-label option with a variety of features, the prices are customized to each retailer&#8217;s individual needs.</p>
<p>The service is one of several initiatives Walmart now has underway to generate revenue by serving the needs of other retailers. Recently, Walmart announced it would sell to retail businesses access <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/walmart-to-sell-its-e-commerce-technologies-to-other-retailers/">to its own e-commerce technologies</a>, for example. This is a part of Walmart&#8217;s broader strategy that will see it looking to turn a profit based on providing access to technologies and services it once used only for its own operations.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Square. Uber. Zillow. Airbnb. Besides being some of the biggest technology companies, what else do these titans have in common? They all operate in entrenched, highly fragmented, geographically localized and regulated industries. That means they required a lot of upfront venture capital investment to disrupt their respective markets. And the investment has paid off — these are now some of the most valuable companies in the world.</p>
<p>Venture capital alone hasn&#8217;t funded some of the largest companies. One of today&#8217;s most successful tech entrepreneurs was funded by massive infusions of investment from the federal government — Elon Musk received <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html">$4.9 billion in public subsidies</a> for his companies, including SpaceX and Tesla. Moreover, government investment, via tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, made it more affordable for consumers to buy the green transportation they needed.</p>
<p>But one massive industry has not yet benefited from the large amounts of money that both venture capital and government can provide: Childcare. Families in the United States spend <a href="https://www.investin.care/">$136 billion on infant and child care every year</a>, and the market is only growing. If you include school-age care and education for all children under 18, that number <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2020075REV">grows to $212 billion</a>. In investor terms, the TAM (total addressable market) is huge.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			To put things in perspective, one new company has raised more funding in 2021 than the entire childcare industry.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So where is the investment? Biden&#8217;s current compromise on an infrastructure plan <a href=" https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/06/24/us/joe-biden-news#what-is-in-the-infrastructure-plan">does not include</a> many provisions for childcare. Venture investment in this space is nascent and insufficient. In 2020, only $171 million was invested in care and early childhood education. The funding situation has improved in 2021, with <a href="https://medium.com/reach-capital/investing-in-the-youngest-learners-and-the-future-of-families-b7c9a7d07766">$516 million invested in childcare</a>, but it’s still just a tiny fraction of the <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-h1-2021-monthly-recap/">$288 billion of venture capital invested</a> so far this year.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation/">single new company</a> has raised more funding in 2021 than the entire childcare industry.</p>
<p>Funding emerging childcare technology may require a lot of upfront capital. For starters, the industry is regulated and safety is and should remain a priority. Caring for and educating young children takes training, skill and love — it cannot be done by a computer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But there are so many facets of the industry that are ripe for innovation. Parents sometimes take weeks to find a childcare provider that meets their needs. In some markets, there is <a href="https://childcaredeserts.org/2018/">not nearly enough supply</a> (three children for every licensed slot) to meet the demand. Assessing quality, pricing and availability is challenging, and payments and business operations tools for the nation’s 300,000+ daycares are still often pen, paper and Excel spreadsheet affairs.</p>
<p>This industry just needs patient investors with long-term perspectives.</p>
<p>This is a great time to diversify investment portfolios and support relatively recession-proof companies meaningfully expanding access to childcare. COVID has finally started to bring this largely offline industry online. Parents are now willing to go digital for childcare decisions and providers are adopting new online technologies at a record pace. These tailwinds provide the perfect conditions for startups.</p>
<p>Solving this problem is a huge business opportunity that affects so much else. When the millions of parents with young children can’t find care, they can’t work. We saw this over and over again since the start of the pandemic. The average American family can spend up to 25% of their income on early childhood care, while the average care worker makes approximately $12 an hour.</p>
<p>Unlocking innovation here at scale will require public and private investment. Government shapes and enables markets, from the explosion of technology that followed from Kennedy&#8217;s investment in the space race to more recent fundamental investments in wind, solar and electric vehicles. NASA catalyzed dozens of new technologies in the 1960s because it had both a generous budget and the flexibility to work with the best private-sector contractors available to solve specific problems.</p>
<p>The revitalization of the childcare sector would benefit from an ambitious and galvanizing “moonshot” goal, like providing universal, free childcare for all Americans.</p>
<p>By collaborating with flexibility and creativity across the public and private sectors, we can achieve a basic shared goal that other democracies have already fulfilled — the accessible provision of high-quality childcare for all members of society.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Subscription newsletter platform kingpin Substack shared today that they&#8217;ve acqui-hired the team behind <a href="https://cocoon.com/">Cocoon</a>, a subscription social media app built for close friends.</p>
<p>We covered the Y Combinator-backed startup&#8217;s initial $3 million seed raise led by Lerer Hippeau back in November 2019, shortly before the pandemic dramatically reconfigured how people used social media to communicate with the people nearest and dearest to them. Cocoon&#8217;s initial pitch was for a social network for your closest friends, something that could level-up the text group chat you may have been stuck using before; over time, Cocoon evolved its platform&#8217;s dynamics to allow for more open social circles that users could fine-tune at will. With the app, users could share text and photo updates while also using passive data from sources like mobile location data or fitness stats to deliver automatic updates to Slack channel-like feeds for specific groups of their friends.</p>
<p>The app was co-founded by Sachin Monga and Alex Cornell, who met in product roles at Facebook.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cocoon&#8217;s social app for close friends gets VC backing to chase Path&#8217;s dream&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/cocoons-social-app-for-close-friends-gets-vc-backing-to-chase-paths-dream/embed/#?secret=BohIGN8xki" data-secret="BohIGN8xki" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unlike plenty of other networking apps, Cocoon didn&#8217;t rely on advertising or user data to monetize, instead pushing users to pay for a $4 monthly subscription. Though it will continue to operate independently, Substack says they won&#8217;t be acquiring the fledgling Cocoon app, instead choosing to bring the small team aboard. Given some of Substack&#8217;s recent initiatives around community building for their network of newsletter writers, it isn&#8217;t surprising that they&#8217;re seeking more talent in the space to help evolve the functionality of their platform.</p>
<p>Back in March, the startup detailed it had closed a $65 million Series B at a $650 million valuation, bolstering up on cash as they look to define a space that has gotten more eyeballs on it as of late, with both Twitter and Facebook releasing newsletter products this year.  They&#8217;ve been snapping up a few smaller startups over the past few months. Earlier this month, they disclosed that they had bought the debate platform Letter for an undisclosed sum. In May, they acqui-hired the team from a community-building consultancy startup called People &amp; Company.</p>
<p><em>Update: an earlier version of this story implied that the Cocoon app would not continue to operate post-acquisition, it will operate independently.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, Instagram unveiled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/">Shops</a> as part of Facebook&#8217;s larger pivot toward e-commerce. Shops is front-and-almost-center on the app&#8217;s bottom navigation bar, even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/instagram-swaps-out-its-activity-tab-for-shop-in-new-global-test/">more readily accessible</a> than the button to upload a new photo. Now, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/instagram-tests-ads-in-its-shop-tab/">testing</a> in the U.S. earlier this month, Instagram will introduce ads on the Instagram Shop tab globally, rolling them out in all countries where the Instagram Shop tab is available.</p>
<p>This marks Instagram&#8217;s latest update in evolving its e-commerce platform. It previously implemented <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/">shopping in Reels</a> to compete with TikTok, organized exclusive product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/instagram-launches-a-new-section-for-shopping-product-drops/">Drops</a> into their own Shop category and added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/instagram-adds-affiliate-and-shop-features-for-creators/">affiliate features</a> for creators to earn a commission on sales of sponsored products.</p>
<p>Currently, items on Shops appear in a two-column grid of square tiles. Ads will appear as a tile within this structure, but they&#8217;ll be marked &#8220;Sponsored&#8221; in the bottom-left corner of the image. When the ad is clicked, it will open the Product Details page, which shows more information about the item, additional images and other products from the brand. Users can save a product from an ad to their wish list or send it to a friend &#8212; if the ad is inappropriate, they can press and hold its tile to see options to hide or report the ad.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192917" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192917" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2192917" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Shop-Tab-Ad.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Shop-Tab-Ad.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Shop-Tab-Ad.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Shop-Tab-Ad.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Shop-Tab-Ad.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Shop-Tab-Ad.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Shop-Tab-Ad.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192917" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Instagram tested Shops ads with U.S. advertisers like Away, Donny Davy, Boo Oh, Clare paint, JNJ Gifts, DEUX and Fenty Beauty. As TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/instagram-tests-ads-in-its-shop-tab/">previously reported</a>, these ads will launch with an auction-based model and only appear on mobile, since Shops isn&#8217;t available on desktop. A user&#8217;s experience with these ads will depend on how they use Instagram and how many people are shopping in the Instagram tab.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Imagine typing out a series of steps in plain English that would reflect a list of actions a human QA tester would undertake to test an app, then turning that list into an automated testing script. That&#8217;s exactly what <a href="https://testrigor.com/">testRigor</a>, a member of the Y Combinator Summer 2021 cohort, has done. Today the early-stage startup announced a $4.1 million seed round.</p>
<p>Investors include FlashPoint VC, Y Combinator, PTV, Phystech Ventures and several individuals. The company previously raised a $300,000 angel investment and a $700,000 pre-seed investment for a total of $5.1 million raised to this point.</p>
<p>The beauty of testRigor is that you can type out a series of steps like &#8220;Click the Start button&#8221; or &#8220;Click the Stop button&#8221; and testRigor turns this into code, automatically runs the script and reports back whether the application has passed or failed.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it executes your instructions, and then will give you basically a pass or fail at the end. If it fails, it tells you what the issues were, allowing you to create a JIRA ticket and fix it in place or showing what the steps are to reproduce the issue. [&#8230;] And this is actually where we bring the most value,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Artem Golubev explained.</p>

<p>To make this process even simpler, the company has created a Chrome extension for recording testing steps, and it also will create tests automatically based on analytics that determine how people use the app, testing the most popular features.</p>
<p>They call the latter feature behavioral testing. &#8220;We literally deploy our analytics script in production, and then the system will automatically [build a test] based on how your end users are using your application in production,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has around 100 customers, including Netflix and other Fortune 500 companies, along with 22 employees, 12 of whom were hired this year. Golubev hopes to have 30 in place by the end of the year. He says that hiring people has been a challenge, and one of the reasons he joined Y Combinator was to get help in that area.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m running around trying to solve this problem of hiring people, and we saw YC being helpful in this area. Our number one largest problem is we can&#8217;t hire quickly enough,&#8221; he said. He believes that being part of YC has indeed helped in this regard.</p>
<p>In spite of the hiring challenge he&#8217;s facing, he believes that you need to hire a diverse workforce and reports that around 40% of his 22 employees are women. He says that he believes a lot of companies are missing out on good people because of their own biases. &#8220;What I have seen is that people have such a huge bias, they&#8217;re missing out on very talented people who don&#8217;t match their kind of imaginary profile,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Golubev says that he launched pre-COVID as a remote company, and he believed that once he got funding like this round, he would open an office, but now he&#8217;s determined to be 100% remote, and sees GitLab, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/gitlab-offers-key-lessons-in-running-an-all-remote-workforce-in-new-e-book/">a fully remote company</a>, as a model for him as he grows his company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Two Sigma Ventures led the financing event, putting in $10 million, with prior investors completing the round.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HR automation software startup <a href="https://www.sora.co/">Sora</a> announced this morning that it closed a $14 million Series A round of funding. Two Sigma Ventures led the financing event, putting in $10 million, with prior investors completing the round.</p>
<p>The round comes after Sora <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/sora-raises-5-3m-to-power-its-hr-automation-service/">raised a $5.3 million seed round in July 2020</a>. First Round and Elad Gil led that investment.</p>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Sora CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/ldelbeccaro">Laura Del Beccaro</a> to chat about the round. We were curious about why this was the right moment for the company to raise more capital &#8212; the startup noted last year that it had around 2.5 years of runway &#8212; and what it intends to do with the money.</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, Del Beccaro said that her company raised its seed round to validate its market after finding early traction with its product. The CEO added that her company found better problem validation &#8212; product-market fit, essentially &#8212; than it had anticipated in the following quarters, and that after a year of scaling &#8220;thoughtfully&#8221; is now ready to accelerate its growth in both financial and human terms.</p>
<p>Sora reached an inflection point, she said, sometime in the first half of 2020. The early COVID days, in other words. The pandemic was tough on HR teams, Del Beccaro explained: With employees going remote, and a shift to hiring over Zoom, you can imagine why HR teams were having a time and a half during the rapid shakeups of the labor market.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s growth accelerated toward the end of 2020, the CEO said, leading to 7x customer growth and 8x revenue growth since its seed round.</p>
<p>To better understand why Sora found strong traction during COVID, let&#8217;s remind ourselves what the startup&#8217;s software actually does. It helps HR operations teams collect and sync data from various systems, create standardized processes for particular tasks, and aids collaboration among the larger people or HR team at a company. To do that, Sora can trigger automated emails from HR, centralize HR ops tasks, and shuttle data to and from disparate software tools used by a larger human resources team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The result, per Del Beccaro, is a reduction in busywork and rote tasks for HR operations teams, saving time and reducing the chance that a particular task falls through the cracks; because HR operations teams often oversee onboarding, for example, not making mistakes is pretty key.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was curious if Sora might eventually become a hub for employees to interact with HR systems more broadly; if the startup is already doing the work to connect deeply to HR software, why not save employees time by providing them with a single portal? Del Beccaro said that her company was becoming a source of truth for the HR world, but that an explosion of HR tooling in recent years has left some companies leery of adding another employee-facing tool to their collection.</p>
<p>Ask anyone who works for a major company what their Okta or similar dashboard looks like for an explanation of what she means, if it&#8217;s not clear.</p>
<p>Sora said that its target customer base is companies with around 100 employees and up, though some smaller customers that see more rapid onboarding and offboarding also make good Sora targets. The startup charges per employee managed, with no limit on processes because Sora wants HR teams to build as many workflows inside of its service as they want. The more integrated a company&#8217;s HR operations become in Sora, we reckon, the less likely it is to churn, so the pricing model makes sense.</p>
<p>Off a good year of growth, Sora has 11 employees today, essentially the same size that it was when it raised its seed round. Given its growth since that point, the startup has demonstrated notable operating leverage for a company of its size. Flush with new funds, Sora intends to double its staff in the next year.</p>
<p>Why did Sora pick Two Sigma to lead its round? Per the CEO, it is a newer firm, which means that her startup won&#8217;t be competing with dozens of other portfolio companies. But more importantly, Del Beccaro spoke highly of the partner at the firm who led the Series A, <a href="https://twitter.com/schwiepit">Frances Schwiep</a>, telling TechCrunch that she immediately understood what Sora wanted to do.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke briefly with Schwiep about her investment. The venture capitalist said that she had been looking at the HR tech world for some time. And having seen at her prior gig how much work in the robotic process automation space went into employee onboarding and offboarding, Sora fit where she saw HR tech heading. She also cited a few macro trends that are favorable for the startup, including declining average employee tenure &#8212; the more headcount turnover, the more HR work there is to either do by hand or automate &#8212; and a move to more remote work.</p>
<p>When we last checked in with Sora, we noted the no-code elements of its service, designed to let HR operations teams set workflows that they might want to automate. This time around, such a setup felt more like table stakes than something to call out in particular. Technology moves quickly.</p>
<p>The next time we talk to Sora, we&#8217;ll expect harder revenue figures given that it is no longer a seed-stage startup. For now, let&#8217;s see how far it can get with $14 million.</p>
