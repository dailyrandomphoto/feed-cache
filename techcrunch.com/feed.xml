										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook posted its second quarter earnings Wednesday, beating expectations with $29 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s biggest social media company was expected to report $27.8 billion in revenue for the quarter, a 50 percent increase from the same period in 2020. Facebook reported earnings per share of $3.61, which also bested <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/07/28/facebook-earnings/?sh=5ecfc92b4dbc">expectations</a>. The company&#8217;s revenue was $18.6 billion in the same quarter of last year.</p>
<p>In the first financial period to really reflect a return to quasi-economic normalcy after a very online pandemic year, Facebook met user growth expectations. At the end of March, Facebook boasted 2.85 billion monthly active users across its network of apps. At the end of its second quarter, Facebook reported 2.9 billion monthly active users, roughly what was expected.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s shares opened at $375 on Wednesday morning and were down to $360 in a dip following the earnings report.</p>
<p>In spite of a strong quarter, Facebook is warning of change ahead — namely impacts to its massive ad business, which generated $28.5 billion out of the company&#8217;s $29 billion this quarter. The company specifically named <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">privacy-focused updates</a> to Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system as a threat to its business.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to expect increased ad targeting headwinds in 2021 from regulatory and platform changes, notably the recent iOS updates, which we expect to have a greater impact in the third quarter compared to the second quarter,&#8221; the company stated its investor report outlook.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what Facebook planned to report Wednesday, the company is a financial beast. Bad press and user mistrust in the West haven’t done much to hurt its bottom line and the company’s ad business is looking as dominant as ever. Short of meaningful antitrust reform in the U.S. or a surging competitor, there&#8217;s little to stand in Facebook&#8217;s way. The former might still be a long shot given partisan gridlock in Congress, even with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/biden-executive-order-tech-antitrust/">White House</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/biden-jonathan-kanter-doj/">involved</a>, but Facebook is finally facing a threat from the latter.</p>
<p>For years, it&#8217;s been difficult to imagine a social media platform emerging as a proper rival to the company, given Facebook&#8217;s market dominance and nasty habit of acquiring competitors or brazenly copying their innovations, but it&#8217;s clear that TikTok is turning into just that. YouTube is huge, but the platforms matured in parallel and co-exist, offering complementary experiences.</p>

<p>TikTok hit 700 million monthly active users in July 2020 and surpassed three billions global downloads earlier this month, becoming the only non-Facebook owned app to do so, according to <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion">data from Sensor Tower</a>. If the famously addictive short form video app can successfully siphon off some of the long hours that young users spend on Instagram and Facebook&#8217;s other platforms and make itself a cozy home for brands in the process, the big blue giant out of Menlo Park might finally have something to lose sleep over.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The system aims to help users achieve more independence in their daily lives by allowing them to feel which way to walk through in-shoe vibrations connected to a navigation app on a smartphone.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Globally, 225 million people are estimated to suffer from moderate or severe visual impairments, and 49.1 million are blind,<a href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2767477"> according to 2020 data from the Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science journal</a>. A Japanese startup that was incubated at Honda Motor Company’s business creation program hopes to make navigating the world easier and safer for the visually impaired.</p>
<p>Ashirase, which debuted as the first business venture to come out of Honda’s Ignition program in June, shared details of its in-shoe navigation system for low-vision walkers on Tuesday. The system aims to help users achieve more independence in their daily lives by allowing them to <em>feel</em> which way to walk through in-shoe vibrations connected to a navigation app on a smartphone. Ashirase hopes to begin sales of the system, also named Ashirase, by October 2022.</p>
<p>Honda created Ignition in 2017 to feature original technology, ideas, and designs of Honda associates with the goal of solving social issues and going beyond the existing Honda business. CEO Wataru Chino had previously worked at Honda since 2008 on R&amp;D for EV motor control and automated driving systems. Chino’s background is evident in the navigation system’s technology, which he said is inspired by advanced driver assist and autonomous driving systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The overlap perspective can be, for instance, the way we utilize sensor information,” Chino told TechCrunch. “We use a sensor fusion technology, meaning we can combine information from the different sensors. I have experience in that field myself so that is helpful. Plus there is overlap with automated driving because when we were thinking of safety walking, the automated driving technology had given us an idea for the concept.”</p>
<p>“Ashirase” comes from the Japanese words ashi, meaning “foot,” and shirase, meaning “notification.” As its name suggests, the device, which is attached to the shoe, vibrates to provide navigation based on the route set within an app. Motion sensors, which consist of an accelerometer, gyro sensors and orientation sensors, enable the system to understand how the user is walking.</p>
<p>While en route outside, the system localizes the user based on global navigation satellite positioning information and data based on the user’s foot movement. Ashirase’s app is connected to a range of different map vendors like Google Maps, and Chino said the device can switch to adapt to different information available on different maps. This capability might be helpful if, say, one map had updated information about a road blockage and could send over-the-air updates.</p>
<p>“Going forward, we want to develop the function to generate a map itself using sensors from the outdoor environment, but that’s maybe five years down the line,” Chino said.</p>
<p>The vibrators are aligned with the foot’s nerve layer, so it’s easy to feel the pulse. To indicate the user should walk straight ahead, the vibrator positioned at the front of the shoe vibrates. Vibrators on the left and the right side of the shoe also indicate turning signals for the walker.</p>
<p>Ashirase says this form of intuitive navigation helps the walker attain a more relaxed state of mind rather than one that is constantly alert, leading to a safer walk and less stress for the user.</p>
<p>This also allows the user to have more attention to spare for audible warnings in their environment, like, for example, if they were at a crosswalk, because the device cannot warn the user of obstacles ahead.</p>
<p>“Going forward, we’re thinking about technical updates for users who are totally blind because they don’t have such information like obstacle awareness like low-vision people,” Chino said. “So at this moment, the device is designed for low-vision walkers.”</p>
<p>While indoors, like in a shopping mall, the GPS won’t reach the user, and there isn’t a map for them to localize to. To solve for this, the company says its plan is to use WiFi or Bluetooth-based positioning, connecting to other devices and cell phones within the store, to localize the visually impaired person.</p>
<p>Ashirase is also considering ways to integrate with public transit systems so that the device can alert a user if they have arrived or are near their next stop, according to Chino.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of tech to pack into one little device that attaches to a shoe &#8212; any shoe. Chino said the device, which only needs to be charged once a week based on three hours of use per day, is made to be flexible and fit onto different types, shapes and sizes of shoes.</p>
<p>Ashirase intends to release its beta version for testing and data collection in October or November this year and hopes to achieve mass production by October 2022. It’ll have a direct-to-consumer model, the price of which the company is not yet ready to disclose, and a subscription model, which should cost about 2,000 to 3,000 Japanese Yen ($18 to $27) per month.</p>
<p>Chino estimates it’ll take the company 200 million Yen ($1.8 million), including the funds the company has already raised, to make it to market. So far, the company has raised 70 million Yen ($638,000), which came in the form of an equity investor round and some non-equity rounds, according to Chino.</p>
<p>Honda maintains an investor role in the company, supporting and following the business along the way, but Ashirase’s aim is to go public as a standalone company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Queen's Gambit Growth Capital, the women-led SPAC in charge of the deal, called Swvl 'a disruptive platform that solves complex challenges and empowers underserved populations.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cairo and Dubai-based ride-sharing company Swvl plans to go public in a merger with special purpose acquisition company Queen&#8217;s Gambit Growth Capital, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/swvl-a-transformative-mass-transit-platform-announces-business-combination-with-queens-gambit-growth-capital-301343236.html">Swvl said Tuesday</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The deal will see Swvl valued at roughly $1.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swvl </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mostafa Kandil, Mahmoud Nouh and Ahmed Sabbah in 2017. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio started the company as a bus-hailing service in Egypt and other ride-sharing services in emerging markets with fragmented public transportation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its services, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bus-hailing, enables users to make intra-state journeys by booking seats on buses running a fixed route</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is pocket-friendly for residents in these markets compared to single-rider options and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">helps reduce emissions (Swvl claims it has prevented over 240 million pounds of carbon emission since inception).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After its Egypt launch, Swvl expanded to Kenya, Pakistan, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The company also moved its headquarters to Dubai as part of its strategy to become a global company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swvl offerings have expanded beyond bus-hailing services. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the company offers inter-city rides, car ride-sharing, and corporate services across the 10 cities it operates in across Africa and the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Queen&#8217;s Gambit, the women-led SPAC in charge of the deal,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-20/queen-s-gambit-is-said-to-boost-blank-check-ipo-to-300-million"> raised</a> $300 million in January and added $45 million via an underwriters&#8217; overallotment option focusing on startups in clean energy, healthcare and mobility sectors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/swvl-a-transformative-mass-transit-platform-announces-business-combination-with-queens-gambit-growth-capital-301343236.html">statement</a> also mentions a group of investors &#8212; Agility, Luxor Capital and Zain Group &#8212; which will contribute $100 million through a private investment in public equity, or PIPE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/swvl">Crunchbase</a>, Swvl has raised over $170 million. From an African perspective, Swvl features as one of the most venture-backed startups on the continent. The company has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been touted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach unicorn status in the past and will when this SPAC merger </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is completed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will aptly trade under the ticker SWVL</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The listing will make it the first Egyptian startup to go public outside Egypt and the second to go public after Fawry. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also make the mobility company the largest African unicorn debut on any U.S.-listed exchange, beating <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8b5024e0-5d1d-11e9-9dde-7aedca0a081a">Jumia&#8217;s debut</a> of $1.1 billion on the NYSE. In the Middle East, Swvl <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/anghami-spac-ipo/">joins music-streaming platform Anghami</a> as the second startup to go public via a SPAC merger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swvl had annual gross revenue of $26 million in 2020, according to the statement, and the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expects its annual gross revenue to increase to $79 million this year and $1 billion by 2025 after expanding to 20 countries across five continents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On why Queen&#8217;s Gambit picked Swvl for this deal, Victoria Grace, founder and CEO, said in a statement that the company fit the profile of what she was looking for: &#8220;a disruptive platform that solves complex challenges and empowers underserved populations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having established a leadership position in key emerging markets, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Swvl is ready to capitalize on a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> global market opportunity,” she added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/why-spacs-arent-targeting-african-startups/">wrote</a> that SPACs didn&#8217;t target African startups for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reasons, including a lack of global appeal and private capital and market satisfaction</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging by Grace&#8217;s comments, Swvl has that global appeal and is ready to venture into the public market despite</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being in operation for just four years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Excerpts from our Twitter Spaces chat with MKT1 founders Emily Kramer and Kathleen Estreich on the growth marketing industry, when to hire a marketer and when a startup should consider outsourcing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Emily Kramer and Kathleen Estreich are the founders of of <a href="https://www.mkt1.co/">MKT1</a>, a strategic marketing firm that does much more than just marketing. As we mentioned the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/mkt1-developer-marketing-is-what-startup-marketing-should-look-like/">last time</a> we spoke with the company, it offers a plethora of services ranging from marketing consulting and organizing recruiting and mentoring workshops to angel syndicate investing.</p>
<p>The two founders took to Twitter Spaces on July 20 with TechCrunch Managing Editor Danny Crichton to talk about about the growth marketing industry. They offered some new perspectives, like thinking of growth marketing as an engine and other subdivisions of marketing that make up growth marketing, as the fuel.</p>
<p>After talking about what they were seeing in marketing, we opened the floor for a Q&amp;A session that founders took advantage of to ask how to know when to hire a marketer and when is it good to outsource.</p>
<p>Below is an excerpt from the Twitter Spaces event, edited for length and clarity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What is growth marketing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emily Kramer:</strong> I think the easiest way to think about it is: Marketing consists of the fuel and an engine. Growth marketing is the engine and content marketing, product marketing, comms, events — all of that are your fuel. It&#8217;s building that engine: Everything from building marketing ops and making sure that you&#8217;re tracking and can get everything out the door, to what you&#8217;re doing with email, ads, SEO and on your website. All of these things that are used to drive your audience throughout your funnel.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>It’s not just getting someone to sign up or getting someone to be a qualified lead to pass over to sales. It&#8217;s also supporting the customer success team and the product team. Anything that is communicating with your audience in a one-to-many way is how I think about the marketing function. Specifically growth marketing in general — it’s a full funnel, it&#8217;s the engine, and it&#8217;s ever changing.</p>
<p>We in marketing have 5,000 names for everything, including growth marketing. You&#8217;ll often hear in top-down sales organizations it is called demand gen, but I really think of demand gen as a subset of growth marketing focused specifically on driving leads to sales. That&#8217;s kind of what it is and how I define it. Every marketer you talk to would define it a little bit differently.</p>
<p><strong>What does the landscape of growth marketing look like in 2021? What are you seeing in summer 2021?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> We&#8217;re seeing two major shifts. One is thinking about how community is a part of this, or at least throwing around the word &#8220;community&#8221; for things that have always been done. &#8220;Community-led growth&#8221; is obviously a big buzzword; that&#8217;s basically getting people in conversation to drive growth. The phrase &#8220;product-led growth&#8221; is another, and that is really just another way to describe self-serve.</p>
<p>Having growth marketers who can collaborate with product growth roles and product growth teams and having one centralized team has been a trend over the past 10 years. But now the term product-led growth is what we use for all of that. Marketers love to rebrand even their own functions.</p>
<p><strong>Kathleen Estreich:</strong> A lot of companies are starting to think about growth marketing earlier. We&#8217;re seeing a lot of companies thinking about hiring their first marketer. It used to be you&#8217;d hire at Series A, but because all the funding rounds are sort of being moved up a level, a lot of seed-stage companies are thinking about growth earlier.</p>
<p>The skill sets of growth marketers are in high demand. They always have been, but it feels pretty acute right now. Given that a lot of the companies are raising money earlier and starting to try and build that traction faster to grow into the valuations, we&#8217;re starting to see a huge need. Pretty much every company we talked to is wanting to hire and thinking about growth levers they should be using earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Where is there an oversupply of folks? Where is there an undersupply? Where&#8217;s the demand today? What&#8217;s underutilized today?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> In general, marketers are in pretty high demand. Product marketing in particular has been pretty interesting. We&#8217;re seeing a lot of folks in product marketing roles, because typically, the first marketer at a startup is someone who has product marketing experience and there are many companies being started and they&#8217;re looking for product marketers. And finding someone who has the experience in product marketing, who&#8217;s not just coming from a big company.</p>
<p>I think product marketing at a larger organization, you&#8217;re very much tied to a product line; you&#8217;re doing just product marketing. But at an early-stage company, you&#8217;re not doing just product marketing; you also need someone who understands distribution. So we encourage a lot of companies to hire someone that is what we call a pi-shaped marketer: Someone who has depth and competence in two areas of marketing.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 companies doing growth marketing right&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/5-companies-doing-growth-marketing-right/embed/#?secret=nkwIt4w3lO" data-secret="nkwIt4w3lO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Usually it&#8217;s product marketing and growth marketing, and finding that person is really challenging in a normal market. I would say in this market in particular, it&#8217;s a pretty tough role to fill. But if you can find the right person, you might have to make some trade-offs on either the level or the experience that you&#8217;re bringing someone in. But if you can find a person who has competence in product and growth marketing, I think that&#8217;s someone a lot of companies can benefit from in the early days of building their marketing teams.</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> I&#8217;ve had a couple of startups that I&#8217;ve talked to, even in recent weeks, and I&#8217;ve heard, &#8220;Oh, our first marketer is going to be a community marketer.&#8221; That role is evolving and changing a lot. Back when I started doing startup marketing, about 10 years ago, community really meant social media, and it doesn&#8217;t mean that at all anymore. So finding people that have had that exact role before is really difficult.</p>
<p>In some cases, when people say community marketing, they mean they&#8217;ve done a lot of content, virtual events or customer success. I think when people post that role, it&#8217;s kind of like square peg, round hole or not knowing if it&#8217;s square peg, round hole. I sometimes see this mismatch on roles that are posted and the talent that is actually available.</p>
<p>I think my advice to marketers based on that is: Really read the job description, and maybe the title — does it match exactly what you&#8217;ve done, or does the title even match what you think you should be doing? Maybe there&#8217;s an opportunity there to kind of educate on what you can do and also educate on how to define roles in really early-stage companies.</p>
<p><strong>When is a good time to start working with a growth marketer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> A question we hear quite often is, &#8220;When do I know is the right time to hire my first marketer?&#8221; One of the things that Emily and I often tell founders is, the founding team is the first marketing team. You&#8217;re doing a lot of the early messaging and positioning. Usually kind of the early vision — that&#8217;s probably how you raised money. I think the way to think about it is to take a step back and ask, &#8220;Okay, what are the needs? What are the things that we&#8217;re trying to get done?&#8221; And thinking about product-market fit.</p>
<p>I think a product marketer, growth marketer or pi-shaped marketer is generally the first person that you would bring on. You want to make sure before you bring your first marketer that you actually have a product that&#8217;s ready to go to market. And if not, then it&#8217;s probably worth waiting until you have the product out there with some semblance of a handful of customers. Once you have that, then it might be time to start thinking about who that first marketer is.</p>
<p>I think the first marketer then is usually some combination of a product marketer with growth experience or a growth marketer with product marketing experience. Someone who, like Emily said at the beginning of the call, has experience with your business model and is ready to roll up their sleeves, because the first marketing job when you&#8217;re an early-stage company involves wearing a lot of hats, testing a lot of hypotheses and doing a lot of the work.</p>
<p>So you want to make sure that you don&#8217;t hire someone too senior who is not going to want to do the work. They&#8217;re just going to want to hire a team, which you&#8217;re probably not ready for. You also want to make sure they&#8217;re not too junior and they don&#8217;t even know what to do yet. Finding that balance, a midlevel person, is also going to be important.</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> You mentioned that a product marketer can help you find the right niche to focus on. I think you should have some customers and a starting place. A better way to describe product marketers is actually audience marketers — they are figuring out how to communicate what you do to a specific audience. You probably have some idea, but they&#8217;re going to help you continue to explore within your team, like, &#8220;Should we expand to other audiences? Should we stay within this niche? What do those different audiences need? Are we talking to customers? What are they saying?&#8221;</p>
<p>They are responsible for knowing everything about your audience and also helping you grow into and test new audiences. That&#8217;s a huge part of the product marketing role. But again, it can be really risky to bring that person on too early at the sacrifice of building product and getting things out the door.</p>
<p><strong>Is MKT1 seeing any trends with B2B and growth-stage businesses around the balance between hiring FTEs and outsourcing certain marketing functions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> Early on, I think founders think, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need to hire a marketer. I&#8217;m spending so much time on marketing, but I don&#8217;t need to hire a marketer, or I&#8217;ll just hire a contractor or agency for content. I&#8217;ll hire a contractor or agency for paid or for SEM or even for SEO.&#8221; Then you end up with all of these contractors. But contractors, even the best of contractors, are only good when they have a contact or someone to help them review things, and when they have clear instructions on what they need to do. Because you&#8217;re working with so many clients, you can&#8217;t get up to speed on all of that quickly.</p>
<p>The management overhead of a contractor agency is sometimes just as much as doing the work yourself, especially if you are not experienced in that area, because of all the back and forth. Many times, marketing is more iterative than some other areas of the business where you can hand over some things, especially when it comes to the creative aspects, because you&#8217;re figuring out what your brand is. There&#8217;s just going to be a lot of back and forth.</p>
<p>I think there are a couple of areas where agencies and contractors are better to hire. One of those areas is paid searches. You won&#8217;t need to hire an SEM specialist for a while. And it is definitely a specialty; it is a unique beast and kind of changes a lot, what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not. Having someone who understands how that works and is inside AdWords all day is really helpful, so that&#8217;s a good area to bring someone on. So no matter the size of my marketing team, I think I&#8217;ve always had a search agency to augment. Even when I&#8217;ve had a dedicated search person on my team, I&#8217;ve still had an agency to augment them. That&#8217;s something you&#8217;ll always need; you&#8217;ll need different agencies as you scale to do different things.</p>
<p>I think another area where it makes sense is on the content side, to augment the content people or your product marketer. Again, you need to have a clear understanding of what you&#8217;re trying to write about, what you&#8217;re trying to say, what your unique perspective is, what your brand is, before you start paying a contractor to write a bunch of content. Because what you&#8217;re going to end up with if you do that, is just a bunch of content that doesn&#8217;t really say anything; it doesn&#8217;t really drive a goal.</p>
<p>So content, paid search, always really good areas. And then as you scale — not at the beginning, most likely there are some exceptions depending on what type of business you are — but PR is the other area where media relationships, I mean, we&#8217;re talking to TechCrunch here, but like they can probably speak more to this. But media relationships are something where economies of scale really come into play. So having an agency that is a master in media or has a bunch of media relationships makes a lot of sense. That&#8217;s more later on. PR, content and paid search, but make sure you have people internally to manage them or it can become more detrimental than helpful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric air taxi startup Lilium has tapped German manufacturer Customcell to supply batteries for its flagship 7-seater Lilium Jet.</p>
<p>The battery IP is the result of &#8220;multiple players,&#8221; a Lilium spokesperson told TechCrunch, but the manufacturing will be the sole job of Customcells. While Lilium declined to specify the number of battery systems as part of the agreement, it confirmed that Customcells will be manufacturing guaranteed capacity until 2026.</p>
<p>Customcells specializes in high-performance lithium-ion batteries for the aerospace, automotive and maritime industries. The manufacturer recently announced a new joint venture with luxury sports car maker Porsche AG, dubbed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/porsche-to-make-high-performance-batteries-in-joint-venture-with-customcells/">Cellforce Group</a>, for the low-volume  production of batteries for racing cars and performance vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is just the latest partnership <a href="https://lilium.com/">Lilium</a> has announced in recent months as it prepares to shift into component and vehicle testing. The Munich-based eVTOL company has developed an international network of partnerships with suppliers like Japanese company Toray Industries for carbon fiber composite; Spanish aerospace supplier Aciturri for the Jet’s airframe and Palantir Technologies, one of its investors, for software services. In June, Lilium added aerospace manufacturing giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/german-evtol-maker-lilium-partners-with-honeywell-for-flight-control-and-avionics-systems/">Honeywell</a> to its roster for the Jet’s flight control and avionics system.</p>
<p>Lilium’s decision to outsource major components to established manufacturers is a departure from many of the other leading eVTOL developers, like Joby Aviation, which have chosen to keep much of the engineering and production in-house. The strategy has a few advantages. For one, Lilium doesn’t have to spend millions – possibly hundreds of millions over time – in manufacturing facilities, or production and testing equipment. But the key advantage, Lilium executives suggest, may lie with the certification process.</p>
<p>Like other eVTOL manufacturers, the Lilium Jet must receive regulatory approval from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the Federal Aviation Administration in order to operate commercially in the EU and U.S., respectively. Lilium, in line with other major would-be players in the industry, has set an ambitious target of 2024 for commencing commercial operations. Established aerospace suppliers may use components that have already achieved a minimum performance standard recognized by regulators, which could save time in the certification process.</p>
<p>“Collaborating with experts, aerospace partners, is a deliberate choice for us,” Lilium’s chief program officer Yves Yemsi told TechCrunch earlier this year. “It will help us to reduce our time to market and still be safe.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ask 'Do you like working for him?' and you'll get a response that could have come straight from North Korea: 'Yup, he's a great leader! He motivates us to do great work.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drivers for Elon Musk&#8217;s underground Loop system in Las Vegas have been instructed to bypass passengers&#8217; questions about how long they have been driving for the company, declare ignorance about crashes, and shut down conversations about Musk himself.</p>
<p>Using public records laws, TechCrunch obtained documents that detail daily operations at the Loop, which opened in June to transport attendees around the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) using modified Tesla vehicles. Among the documents is a &#8220;Ride Script&#8221; that every new recruit must follow when curious passengers ask questions.</p>
<p>The script shows just how serious The Boring Company (TBC), which built and operates the system, is about controlling the public image of the new system, its technology and especially its founder, Elon Musk.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Your goal is to provide a safe ride for the passengers, not an entertaining ride. Keep conversation to a minimum so you can focus on the road,&#8221; advises the document. &#8220;Passengers will pepper you with questions. Here are some you may be asked and the recommended responses.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If riders ask a driver how long they have been with the company, they are instructed to respond with: &#8220;Long enough to know these tunnels pretty well!&#8221; The document goes on to note: &#8220;Passengers will not feel safe if they think you&#8217;ve only been driving for a week (even though that could mean hundreds of rides). Accordingly, do not share how long you&#8217;ve been employed here, but instead, find a way to evade the question or shift the focus,&#8221; the document advises drivers.</p>
<p>When asked how many crashes the system has experienced (the script uses the term &#8220;accidents&#8221;), drivers are told to respond: &#8220;It&#8217;s a very safe system, and I&#8217;m not sure. You&#8217;d have to reach out to the company.&#8221; Riders should expect similarly vague responses if they wonder how many employees or drivers TBC has, or how much the tunnels cost to dig. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/the-financial-pickle-facing-elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-system/">About $53 million in total</a>).</p>
<p>The use of Tesla&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system that is branded &#8220;Autopilot&#8221; is clearly a sore point at TBC. Clark County does not currently permit the use of the various driver assistance features anywhere within the Loop system, including automatic emergency braking or technologies that make the vehicle aware of obstacles and keep the vehicle in lane.</p>
<p>Officials even require mechanics to check the vehicles to ensure these are not activated.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to completing the actions under the initial inspection checklist, maintenance staff will verify that the automatic features of the vehicle, such as steering and braking/acceleration/deceleration assist (commonly known as Autopilot) are disabled for manual loop operation,&#8221; the document reads. The following checks will be conducted on a daily basis by CWPM technicians, according to the Vehicle Maintenance plan viewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>If a passenger should ask whether the Loop&#8217;s Tesla vehicles use Autopilot, drivers will give a response. However, this content was marked &#8220;Public Safety Related Confidential&#8221; in the documents TechCrunch received and was redacted, as were many other technical details.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s repeated requests to officials to explain this decision went unanswered.</p>
<h2>He who shall not be named</h2>
<p>The script also covers responses to questions about Musk himself: &#8220;This category of questions is extremely common and extremely sensitive. Public fascination with our founder is inevitable and may dominate the conversation. Be as brief as possible, and do your best to shut down such conversation. If passengers continue to force the topic, politely say, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry, but I really can&#8217;t comment&#8217; and change the subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the script provides a number of replies to common Musk questions. Ask what Musk is like and you should expect the answer: &#8220;He&#8217;s awesome! Inspiring / motivating / etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>Follow up with: &#8220;Do you like working for him?&#8221; and you&#8217;ll get a response that could have come straight from North Korea: &#8220;Yup, he&#8217;s a great leader! He motivates us to do great work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Should a customer wonder how involved Musk is in the business, the driver will tell them: &#8220;He&#8217;s the company founder, and has been very involved and supportive.&#8221; Questions about Musk&#8217;s erratic tweets will be brushed off: &#8220;Elon is a public figure. We&#8217;re just here to provide an awesome transportation experience!&#8221;</p>
<p>One question, however, seems to hint that not everyone is happy working for Musk: &#8220;Is it true what I&#8217;ve read about him in the papers that he [is a mean boss / smokes pot / doesn&#8217;t let employees take vacations / etc.]?&#8221; Your driver&#8217;s rather equivocal response will be: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen that article, but that hasn&#8217;t been my experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>On a side note: While the hundreds of pages of training documents and operational manuals that TechCrunch obtained detail strong policies against drug use and harassment at the Loop, the word &#8220;vacation&#8221; does not otherwise appear.</p>
<h2>Tech that&#8217;s allowed</h2>
<p>Because Clark County currently forbids the use of automated driving features in the Loop, human drivers could be part of the system for some time. But the system is home to plenty of other advanced technologies, according to design and operational documents submitted to Clark County. Each of the 62 Teslas in the underground Loop has a unique RFID chip &#8212; as used in contactless payment systems &#8212; that pinpoints its location when it passes over one of 55 antennas installed in the roadway, stations and parking stalls.</p>
<p>Each vehicle also streams data to 24 hotspots through the system, sharing its speed, state of charge, the number of passengers in the car, and whether they are wearing seatbelts. Riders should be aware that every car is also constantly streaming real-time video from a camera inside the passenger cabin. All this data, along with video from 81 fixed cameras throughout the Loop, is fed to an Operations Control Center (OCC) located a few blocks away from the Convention Center. Video is recorded and stored for at least two weeks.</p>
<p>In the OCC, an operator is monitoring the camera feeds and other sensors for security threats or other problems &#8212; such as a driver using their own cellphone or speeding. The OCC can communicate with any driver via a Bluetooth headset or an in-car iPad that displays messages, alerts and a map of the car&#8217;s location in the tunnels. Vehicles have strict speed limits, ranging from 10 mph within stations to 40 mph on straight tunnel sections, and must maintain at least 6 seconds of separation from the car in front.</p>
<p>During testing this spring, the documents reveal that Clark County officials found some drivers were not following all the rules. &#8220;When asked about the speed limitations, several drivers replied with wrong straightaway and/or curved tunnel speeds. None provided at station, express lane, or ramp speeds,&#8221; reads one document. &#8220;Drivers were not announcing to the passengers to buckle their seatbelts. When asked, [some were saying] that they are optional or not required.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several drivers were also failing to maintain the 6-second safety margin with cars in front. TBC told Clark County that it would provide refresher training in those areas.</p>
<p>TBC, Clark County, and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which oversees the LVCC, did not reply to multiple requests for comment for this story.</p>
<p>The LVCVA recently signed a contract with Alphabet&#8217;s spin-out urban advertising agency, <a href="https://www.intersection.com/">Intersection Media</a>, to sell naming rights to the Loop system, which it hopes will net it $4.5 million.</p>
<p>TBC is currently building two extensions to the Loop to serve nearby hotels and ultimately wants to <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/vegas-loop">build a transit system</a> covering much of the Strip and downtown Las Vegas with more than 40 stations. That system would be financed by TBC and supported by ticket sales.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This further differentiates the social-forward Snap Map from more established resources like Google Maps and Apple Maps, which you can't really use to find out what restaurants your friends like.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more people are venturing out into the world this summer (safely, we hope!), Snapchat wants to make it easier for people to find restaurants, stores, parks and other interesting spots in their neighborhood. Today, Snapchat is starting to roll out the My Places feature on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/snap-map/">Snap Map</a>, which connects users with over 30 million businesses. Users can log their favorite spots, send them to friends, and find recommendations.</p>
<p>My Places has three main tabs: visited, favorites and popular. Visited lists places you&#8217;ve checked into on Snapchat, and favorites saves, well, your favorites. But the popular tab is particularly interesting because it marks the first time that Snapchat is using an algorithm to provide personalized recommendations to help people engage with the world around them. The algorithm considers where you are, what you&#8217;ve tagged or favorited already, and where your friends and other Snapchatters have visited.</p>
<p>This further differentiates the social-forward Snap Map from more established resources like Google Maps and Apple Maps, which you can&#8217;t really use to find out what restaurants your friends like. Sure, Snapchat can&#8217;t give you directions to that trendy sushi bar, but it&#8217;s not meant to, just like how Google Maps isn&#8217;t meant to show you what bar all your friends went to without you last night.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Snapchat shared survey results indicating that its users are more likely on average to engage in &#8220;post-pandemic&#8221; activities (is that a good thing?) and added that 44% of Snapchatters turn to the Snap Map to find places around them that they&#8217;re interested in.</p>
<p>With over 250 million monthly active users on Snap Map, the company announced an update in May called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-brings-partner-centric-layers-to-its-social-map-used-by-250-million-people/">Layers</a>, which lets partner companies add data directly to their own map. So far, Snapchat has collaborated with Ticketmaster and The Infatuation, a restaurant recommendation website &#8212; these partnerships help users see where they can find live entertainment, or what great restaurants are hidden in plain sight. Snapchat plans to further integrate Layers into Snap Map and My Places later this year.</p>
<p>Last week, Snap announced that during Q2 this year, it grew both revenue and daily active users at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/snap-had-its-best-quarter-in-four-years/">highest rates</a> it has achieved in the last four years. Year over year, the app grew 23%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart&#8217;s investments in software and retail technologies it used to transform its business from a brick-and-mortar to one that combines both in-person and online shopping will now be made available to other retailers for the first time, the company <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/07/28/walmart-to-offer-technologies-and-capabilities-to-help-other-businesses-navigate-their-own-digital-transformation">announced</a> today. Through a strategic partnership with Adobe, Walmart will integrate access to Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace, as well as its various online and in-store fulfillment and pickup technologies, into the Adobe Commerce Platform.</p>
<p>The technologies will be made available to both Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source customers, <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/07/27/adobe-walmart-partner-integrate-fulfillment-technologies-marketplace-adobe-commerce.html#gs.7l2itu">Adobe says</a>.</p>
<p>The deal will allow Walmart to potentially reach thousands of small to mid-sized retailers, who will effectively be able to tap into the same tools that one of the largest global retailers is using to run their business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through the partnership, Adobe retail customers will be able to do things like show store pickup eligibility and available pickup times online; offer multiple pickup options like curbside and in-store pickup; provide their store associates with mobile tools to pick for orders, validate item selections and handle substitutions; and use tools to communicate with customers about their pickup orders, like those where customers can alert store associates of their ETA or arrival for curbside pickup.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the partnership will allow retailers to syndicate and sell their products across Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace.</p>
<p>The arrangement not only aims to benefit Walmart&#8217;s bottom line as it offers new revenue streams related to retail technologies, it could also serve as another tool in Walmart&#8217;s battle with Amazon for online retail dominance.</p>
<p>Retail businesses will use the Adobe Commerce platform to reach an expanded set of customers by listing products on Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace and then leverage Walmart&#8217;s Fulfillment Services to offer two-day shopping across the U.S.</p>
<p>And this, in turn, could boost the number of available products sold on Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace, which is still largely dwarfed by Amazon.</p>
<p>Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/how-pandemic-helped-walmart-battle-amazon-marketplace-sellers-2021-04-14/">had grown to an estimated 70,000 sellers</a> in 2020, fueled by a surge in online shopping triggered by the pandemic, according to third-party estimates. This was a more than doubling over 2019. Today, the marketplace is <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/walmart/number-of-sellers">topping 100,000 sellers,</a> per Marketplace Pulse data. Amazon&#8217;s Marketplace, on the other hand, counts an <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/amazon/number-of-sellers">estimated 6.3 million total sellers</a> worldwide, 1.5 million of which are currently active, per estimates.</p>
<p>Part of Walmart&#8217;s problem in scaling its marketplace business could be related to its ease-of-use on the seller side. Many smaller sellers <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/platforms/as-walmart-marketplace-grows-it-still-faces-hurdles-to-compete-with-amazon/">have reported that</a> Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace is far more difficult to use than Amazon&#8217;s, and they&#8217;ve complained about waiting months to hear back from Walmart about whether they were approved to sell on the platform.</p>
<p>Adobe&#8217;s partnership could help to address some of those challenges.</p>
<p>Adobe also notes it&#8217;s working to consolidate its other channel solutions into a single, unified extension that would allow its retail customers to sell across multiple sales channels &#8212; including <a href="https://magento.com/products/amazon-sales-channel">Amazon&#8217;s</a> &#8212; using one, integrated tool for easy account setup and catalog syndication.</p>
<p>This is the first time Walmart has made its retail technologies available to other businesses, the company said. And it has yet to forecast what sort of revenue the new partnership could bring in. But it&#8217;s a path that Amazon has also been pursuing in recent years to maximize the return on investment from its novel, retail innovations, like its A.I. and computer vision-powered <a href="https://justwalkout.com/">Just Walk Out system</a> that lets customers skip the checkout line.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core mission of helping people save money and live better is at the heart of every idea including Scan &amp; Go and checkout technologies, AI-powered smart substitutions and pickup and delivery,&#8221; said Suresh Kumar, chief technology officer and chief development officer of Walmart Inc., in a statement. &#8220;Combining Adobe’s strength in powering commerce experiences with our unmatched omni-customer expertise, we can accelerate other companies’ digital transformations,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Adobe’s retail customers in the U.S. will be able to integrate Walmart’s technologies in their own storefronts starting in early 2022, the companies said. Pricing and other details will be provided closer to launch.</p>
<p>While today&#8217;s announcement concerns channel partner Adobe, who will help to resell the technologies, Walmart also has a GoToMarket team that will target retailers directly.</p>

<p>It’s no secret that most tech companies tout their culture as &#8220;unique&#8221; or &#8220;open,&#8221; but when you take a closer look, it’s often merely surface level. Yes, you may be dog-friendly or offer unlimited beer on tap, but how are you helping your employees become the best versions of themselves? We’re at our best when our employees are at their best, so we do everything in our power to make that a reality.</p>

			We’re at our best when our employees are at their best, so we do everything in our power to make that a reality.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>After successfully running Vincit in Finland and Switzerland, in 2016 we made the jump to the United States, setting up an office in California. Although we had moved over 5,000 miles to a new country, it was important that our two main KPIs remain the same: Employee happiness and customer satisfaction. We believe that happy employees make clients happy, and happy clients refer you to others. Therefore, it was essential that this positive and prosperous workplace environment followed us to the United States.</p>
<p>So beyond traditional benefits, like full medical coverage, 401k matching and standard office amenities, we tapped into our Finnish roots to build and provide our employees with an uninhibited, supportive workplace. We keep our company culture as transparent as possible and fully believe in the power of empowering our employees. We have no managers and no real role hierarchy. Employees do not have to go through an approval process on anything they are working on.</p>
<p>We encourage our employees to make a trip to Finland to visit our headquarters. Instead of &#8220;Lunch &amp; Learn&#8221; meetings, we host &#8220;Fail &amp; Learn&#8221; meetings where employees get to share something that didn’t work and what they learned from it. And once a month, we let an employee become the CEO for a day.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the &#8220;CEO of the Day&#8221; program is one of our most popular initiatives. The program gives our employee the reins for 24 hours with an unlimited budget. The only requirement? The CEO must make one lasting decision that will help improve the working experience of Vincit employees. Whatever the CEO of the Day decides, the company sticks with. They can purchase something for the company, change a policy, update a tool we use … Really, anything that they come up with can be done.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Squire is now a 175-person company with a tech platform used by over 2,000 shops across three continents.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When co-founders Songe LaRon and Dave Salvant first began barbershop tech platform <a href="https://getsquire.com/">Squire</a> in 2016, they leaned in: The duo bought a barbershop in New York City&#8217;s Chelsea neighborhood to see firsthand how the business worked. For one year, the co-founders religiously worked at the shop, now owned by a larger barbershop chain, handling every bit of the business (except cutting hair).</p>
<p>Five years later, the co-founders view that experience as a key moment in the history of Squire, now a 175-person company with a tech platform used by over 2,000 shops across three continents. After last raising a Series C in December and tripling its valuation, Squire announced today that it has raised a $60 million round led by Tiger Global.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Q81A5kTNOU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/squire-haircuts-coronavirus-crv-34-million-series-b/">Squire balances clean fades with the coronavirus</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Squire balances clean fades with the coronavirus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/squire-haircuts-coronavirus-crv-34-million-series-b/embed/#?secret=Q81A5kTNOU" data-secret="Q81A5kTNOU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And, it tripled its valuation, again. Off of 300% year-over-year revenue growth, the New York startup is now valued at $750 million. It&#8217;s a massive uptick: A little over a year ago, Squire was valued at $75 million.</p>
<p>Like many startups these days, Squire wasn’t searching for capital when Tiger Global, which participated in its Series B and C rounds, offered to lead its next financing. The startup has only spent 10% of its previous round, a $45 million equity round, and now has tens of millions more in the bank. Ultimately, its decision to bring on more capital is so it can expand in the U.K. and Canada more aggressively &#8212; even in the wake of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/los-angeles-based-boulevard-has-raised-11-million-for-its-software-to-manage-salons-and-spas/"> early-stage competitors like Boulevard.</a> Squire’s dry powder also puts the co-founders in a position to acquire companies, a strategy that Salvant is into and plans to be “aggressive about.”</p>
<p>Squire also announced today the official launch of a product that has been in the roadmap since inception: Squire Capital, a money management platform with tools tailored to the needs of barbershop operations, such as instant payments. Squire’s core business has been more around appointments, loyalty programs and the installment of contactless payment. Now, a fintech layer aims to offer a more niche service than current financial services heavyweights like Square or Paypal.</p>
<p>Fintech is a “natural next frontier” for Squire, Salvant said, because the startup already has deep insights into how its businesses operate and how they process sales; now, it wants to add another service so it can offer a more holistic experience to them.</p>
<p>Squire Capital was built with <a href="https://www.bond.tech/">Bond</a>, a venture-backed fintech infrastructure startup that aims to help enterprise operations launch their own banking products. After experimenting with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/squire-series-c/">$15 million debt financing arm</a> around the time of its Series C, Squire isn’t offering loans at this time, hoping to find a better way to scale offerings in the future.</p>
<p>Squire is en route to becoming a historical and unfortunately still rare Black-led unicorn. Salvant talked about the significance of that feat, noting that this was “the optimal outcome” when founding the company. He hopes that VCs and investors will start to invest more in Black founders with Squire as a data point of a success story.</p>
<p>“Let’s face it, we’re not typical founders, we don’t look the same and we don’t act the same,” Salvant said. “I just want to serve as a lighthouse and this is validation for myself, my co-founder, but more importantly, what’s coming after us.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s hard to argue that any technology company has had a greater impact in the past decade than BioNTech, the mRNA-based therapeutics pioneer behind the world&#8217;s most widely-used COVID-19 vaccine. Developed in record time in partnership with Pfizer, thanks to an existing partnership to work on immunization for the common flu, BioNTech&#8217;s mRNA inoculation is without a doubt one of the biggest medical innovations of the past century.</p>
<p>BioNTech co-founder and CEO Uğur Şahin isn&#8217;t stopping there, of course: the company recently announced that it would be developing an mRNA-based vaccine targeting malaria, an illness that still kills more than 400,000 people per year. It also has treatments for a range of cancers in process in its development pipeline, and has announced plans to address HIV and tuberculosis with future candidates.</p>
<p>This year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ursheetpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ursheetpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disrupt 2021</a>, Şahin will join us along with Mayfield Fund Partner Ursheet Parikh, a key investor in BioNTech. Both Şahin and Parikh will be talking to us about how the COVID-19 vaccine came to be, but more importantly, about what the future holds for mRNA technology and its potential to address a wide range of chronic healthcare problems that have been tough challenges to solve for decades or even centuries. We&#8217;ll also be talking about what it means to build a biotech startup with true platform potential, and how that might differ now as compared to what investors were looking for just a few short years ago.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Şahin and Parikh are just two of the many high-profile speakers who will be on our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ursheetpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ursheetpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disrupt Stage</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ugursahinpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ugursahinpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extra Crunch Stage</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[While the rise of the Delta variant is extending the company’s work-from-home policy through October 18, it’s not entirely clear what happens after that date.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even for tech companies who create the tools for remote work, returning to the office is proving a major challenge. After early work-from-home recommendations last March, companies like Google eventually closed up shop, requiring employees to take their work home with them. The intervening year and change have been a fraught balancing act for the company (along with most of the world), which began outlining return-to-work plans for some employees as early as May 2020.</p>
<p>As Delta and other COVID-19 variants threaten anticipated returns to normalcy, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai offered a clearer look at the company’s new normal. In a letter to employees reprinted on <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/vaccines-and-our-return-to-office-plans/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29">the Google Keyword blog</a>, Pichai noted that all employees working out of one of Google’s campuses will need to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>“We’re rolling this policy out in the U.S. in the coming weeks and will expand to other regions in the coming months,” Pichai wrote. “The implementation will vary according to local conditions and regulations, and will not apply until vaccines are widely available in your area.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Further complicating matters is the second bullet point. While the rise of the Delta variant is extending the company’s work-from-home policy through October 18, it’s not entirely clear what happens after that date (assuming the virus doesn’t force another shift in the goal posts) to unvaccinated employees, who may not be able to work out of a Google office or remotely.</p>
<p>The post does, however, note some exceptions for those unvaccinated for “medical or other protected reasons.” Google hasn&#8217;t clarified how it will enforce such exceptions.</p>
<p>“For those of you with special circumstances, we will soon be sharing expanded temporary work options that will allow you to apply to work from home through the end of 2021,” Pichai wrote. “We’re also extending Expanded Carer’s Leave through the end of the year for parents and caregivers.”</p>
<p>Other tech giants like Apple have also pushed back return-to-office plans and implemented mask mandates in retail stores as restrictions have gone into effect amid increasing COVID-19 rates. Others, including Facebook, are sticking with original fall reopening plans.</p>
<p>“Expert guidelines state that vaccines are highly effective at preventing variants of COVID-19, including the Delta variant,” a spokesperson for the social media giant<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-office-is-back-what-if-covid-has-other-plans-11627099214"> recently told The Wall Street Journal</a>. “Our timelines to reopen our offices haven’t changed.”</p>

<p>Fisker is investing $10 million in private-investment-in-public equity (PIPE) funding for the merger of Allego and special purpose acquisition company Spartan Acquisition Corp III. The merger, announced Tuesday, puts Allego at a pro forma equity value of $3.14 billion.</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to inject the EV charging provider with $702 million in cash, including $150 million in PIPE from Fisker, investors Landis+Gyr, as well as funds and accounts managed by London-based VC firm Hedosophia and ECP. Funds managed by Apollo Global Management affiliates and Meridiam, the majority shareholder of Allego, also participated in the PIPE. (Apollo is in the process of acquiring Verizon Media Group, which includes TechCrunch.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fisker, the sole EV automaker contributing to the PIPE, is interested in Allego&#8217;s infrastructure. The company operates more than 26,000 charging points throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Fisker has agreed to “a strategic partnership to deliver a range of charging options for its customers in Europe,” according to Allego. It includes a provision granting a free year of charging on the Allego network to drivers that purchase Fisker Ocean SUV between the beginning of 2023 to March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>The two companies are also working on a “seamless charging experience” for Fisker drivers using Allego chargers, the EV maker said in a separate statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allego has been a long-standing pioneer in the push to create a seamless pan-European electric vehicle charging network,&#8221; CEO Henrik Fisker said. &#8220;Our investment in the PIPE is motivated by strategic and tactical considerations, ensuring we have a stake in the future of EV charging networks while delivering tangible benefits to our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>California-based Fisker is aiming to start deliveries of its all-electric Ocean SUV in November 2022, but it hasn’t always been a smooth road to pre-production. Henrik Fisker, a serial automotive entrepreneur best known for being the designer behind luxury vehicles like the Aston Martin V8 Vantage, raised nearly $1 billion in last year’s SPAC merger with Apollo Global Management Inc. That deal skyrocketed the startup’s valuation to $2.9 billion, but expectations deflated somewhat after major deals with Volkswagen fell apart.</p>
<p>Fisker has taken an outsourcing approach to its roster of electric vehicles. The Ocean will be produced via a long-term manufacturing agreement with Magna, Inc. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/fisker-and-foxconn-sign-deal-to-build-electric-vehicles/">signed an additional agreement</a> with Taiwanese company Foxconn, the lead manufacturer of iPhones, to develop a new EV by the end of 2023 that will be sold under the Fisker brand.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Like Microsoft and Apple in the wake of their after-hours earnings reports, Shopify shares are having a muted reaction to the better-than-expected results.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canadian e-commerce juggernaut Shopify this morning reported its <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Press-Release-Q2-2021.pdf">second-quarter financial performance</a>. Like Microsoft and Apple in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/microsoft-bests-earnings-estimates-as-azure-posts-51-growth-shares-fall/">their after-hours earnings reports</a>, its shares are having a muted reaction to the better-than-expected results.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2021, Shopify reported revenues of $1.12 billion, up 57% on a year-over-year basis. The company&#8217;s subscription products grew 70% to $334.2 million, while its volume-driven merchant services drove their own top line up 52% to $785.2 million.</p>
<p>Investors <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/shopify-tops-1-billion-in-quarterly-sales-for-the-first-time-as-e-commerce-spending-stays-strong-11627471417">had expected</a> Shopify to report revenue of $1.05 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shopify also posted an enormous second-quarter profit. Indeed, from its $1.12 billion in total revenues, Shopify managed to generate $879.1 million in GAAP net income. How? The outsized profit came in part thanks to $778 million in unrealized gains related to equity investments. But even with those gains filtered out, Shopify&#8217;s adjusted net income of $284.6 million more than doubled its year-ago Q2 result of $129.4 million. Shopify&#8217;s earnings per share sans unrealized gains came to $2.24, far ahead of an expected 97 cents.</p>
<p>After reporting those results, Shopify shares are up less than a point.</p>
<p>In light of somewhat muted reactions to Big Tech earnings surpassing expectations, it&#8217;s increasingly clear that investors were anticipating that leading tech companies would trounce expectations in the second quarter; their earnings beats were largely priced-in ahead of the individual reports.</p>
<p>The rest of Shopify&#8217;s quarter is a series of huge figures. In the second three-month period of 2021, the company posted gross merchandise volume (GMV) of $42.2 billion, up 40% compared to the year-ago period. That was more than a billion dollars <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3719731-shopify-q2-2021-earnings-preview">ahead of expectations</a>. And the company&#8217;s monthly recurring revenue (MRR) grew 67% to $95.1 million in the quarter. That&#8217;s quick.</p>
<p>Shopify is priced like the growth will continue. Using its Q2 revenue result to generate an annual run rate for the firm, Shopify is currently valued at around 43x its present top line. That&#8217;s aggressive for a company that generates the minority of its revenues from recurring software fees, an investor favorite. Instead, investors seem content to pay what is effectively top dollar for the company&#8217;s blend of GMV-based service revenues and more traditional software incomes.</p>
<p>Consider the public markets bullish on the continued pace of e-commerce growth.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how BigCommerce, a Shopify competitor and fellow public company, performs when it reports earnings in early August. Shares of BigCommerce are up more than 3% today in wake of Shopify&#8217;s results. Ironic given Shopify&#8217;s relaxed market reaction to its own results? Sure, but who said the public markets are fair?</p>

					<description><![CDATA['The days of our ad business accounting for less than 10% of our total revenue are behind us, and going forward, I expect ads to be a substantial part of our revenue mix,' CEO Daniel Ek said.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the minutes before its quarterly earnings call this morning, Spotify played advertisements for its originals and exclusives, like the true crime show &#8220;Deathbed Confessions,&#8221; and the sex and relationships podcast &#8220;Call Her Daddy,&#8221; which Spotify recently acquired in <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/spotify-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper-exclusive-1234996840/">a deal worth $60 million</a>. Sure, it&#8217;s kind of hilarious to hear a recording of host Alex Cooper&#8217;s voice say, &#8220;Hey, daddy gang!&#8221; as investors log in to an 8 a.m. call, but the subtext rang clear: Spotify is serious about growing its podcast business.</p>
<p>Given how many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/">podcasting companies</a> Spotify has acquired over the past few years, it would be concerning if there hadn&#8217;t been significant growth in this realm. Among Spotify users who already listen to podcasts, podcast listening increased 30% year over year, with total hours consumed up 95%. Meanwhile, podcast ad revenue increased by 627%, which outperformed expectations. Spotify attributes this success to a triple-digit year-over-year gain at its in-house studios (The Ringer, Parcast, Spotify Studios and Gimlet) and exclusive deals with &#8220;The Joe Rogan Experience&#8221; and the Obamas&#8217; Higher Ground studio. Spotify also referenced its November <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">acquisition of Megaphone</a>, a podcast hosting and ad company.</p>
<p>&#8220;The continued outperformance is currently limited only by the availability of our inventory, which is something we&#8217;re actively solving for,&#8221; said CEO Daniel Ek. &#8220;The days of our ad business accounting for less than 10% of our total revenue are behind us, and going forward, I expect ads to be a substantial part of our revenue mix.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In April, Spotify launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/spotify-launches-paid-podcasts-through-new-anchor-feature/">paid podcast subscriptions</a> &#8212; through Anchor, the podcast host that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">bought in 2019</a>, creators can choose to put certain content behind a paywall. Apple launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-go-live-worldwide/">similar feature</a>, but it&#8217;s still too early to know how these subscription services will impact listeners and creators. However, Spotify did share a bit more information about its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-spotify-audience-network-an-audio-ad-marketplace/">Audience Network</a>, an audio ad marketplace. Since its rollout in April, Spotify&#8217;s &#8220;monetizable podcast inventory&#8221; tripled. Spotify has also seen a &#8220;meaningful&#8221; increase in unique advertisers and a &#8220;double-digit lift&#8221; in CPMs (cost per thousand ad impressions), but didn&#8217;t provide specific figures.</p>
<p>Still, the more power a platform like Spotify has over the podcasting industry, the fewer options creators will have for monetization &#8212; already, the ubiquity of streaming platforms has taken a toll on musicians, who are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/justice-at-spotify-demands-better-compensation-and-increased-transparency-for-musicians/">working together</a> to demand better compensation from Spotify. The <a href="https://www.unionofmusicians.org/justice-at-spotify">Justice at Spotify</a> movement points out that on average, artists get $0.0038 per stream of a song, which means that a song needs to be streamed 263 times to make a single dollar. Spotify has continued to grow during the pandemic, but because live shows are musicians&#8217; best way to make money in the age of streaming, artists have struggled while it&#8217;s unsafe to go on tour.</p>

<p>On this morning&#8217;s earnings call, Ek pointed to live performances as a potential way for musicians to increase revenue. In the past quarter, Spotify has tested <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/spotify-launches-a-virtual-concert-series-with-the-black-keys-and-more/">live concerts</a> as an income stream, partnering with artists like The Black Keys. Still, smaller artists might not trust the platform given its refusal to make streaming itself a more viable way to get paid for their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Live is a meaningful thing for many of our creators, and it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re excited about,&#8221; said Ek, adding that Spotify saw positive results from its digital live events thus far. &#8220;We want to provide as many opportunities for creators &#8230; to turn a listen into a fan, and turn fans into super fans, and increase the monetization for those creators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Spotify missed its target for monthly active users (MAUs) in Q2, other key metrics trended upward, like paid subscriber growth and revenue. The platform attributes this road bump in MAU growth to the lingering impact of COVID-19, as well as an issue Spotify had with its third-party email verification system.</p>
<p>&#8220;In full disclosure, this was an issue on our end,&#8221; said CFO Paul Vogel. &#8220;The estimate right now was that it was about 1 to 2 million of MAU growth that was impacted by the friction created by this email verification change. It&#8217;s since been corrected and should not be an impact in Q3.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of Spotify&#8217;s 365 million MAUs, 165 million (about 42.5%) are paid subscribers &#8212; that&#8217;s still far beyond its next biggest competitor, Apple Music, which had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/apple-music-surpasses-60-million-subscribers/">60 million subscribers</a> in 2019 but hasn&#8217;t released updated figures since.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Anomaly detection is one of the more difficult and underserved operational areas in the asset-servicing sector of financial institutions. Broadly speaking, a true anomaly is one that deviates from the norm of the expected or the familiar. Anomalies can be the result of incompetence, maliciousness, system errors, accidents or the product of shifts in the underlying structure of day-to-day processes.</p>
<p>For the financial services industry, detecting anomalies is critical, as they may be indicative of illegal activities such as fraud, identity theft, network intrusion, account takeover or money laundering, which may result in undesired outcomes for both the institution and the individual.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Detecting outlier data, or anomalies according to historic data patterns and trends can enrich a financial institution’s operational team by increasing their understanding and preparedness.</p>
<h2>The challenge of detecting anomalies</h2>
<p>Anomaly detection presents a unique challenge for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, the financial services industry has seen an increase in the volume and complexity of data in recent years. In addition, a large emphasis has been placed on the quality of data, turning it into a way to measure the health of an institution.</p>
<p>To make matters more complicated, anomaly detection requires the prediction of something that has not been seen before or prepared for. The increase in data and the fact that it is constantly changing exacerbates the challenge further.</p>
<h2>Leveraging machine learning</h2>
<p>There are different ways to address the challenge of anomaly detection, including supervised and unsupervised learning.</p>

					<description><![CDATA['People are deciding between their pocket or their planet,' said CEO José Manuel Moller. 'So we needed to be cheaper and better.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Single-use plastic containers make up a huge amount of the world&#8217;s waste, but so far no one has come up with a good way to replace them that&#8217;s also easy for consumers and cost-effective. <a href="https://algramo.com/en/home/">Algramo</a> may have cracked this nut with a combination of reusable containers and distribution points that both makes and saves money, and it&#8217;s about to expand its footprint in a big way with a new $8.5 million funding round.</p>
<p>Founded in Chile nearly a decade ago, Algramo is now findings its legs as companies in multiple industries are under immense pressure to go green.</p>
<p>One compelling way to reduce waste is to cut down on single-use plastics, which of course are common for everything from cleaning supplies to soft drinks. The difficulty is figuring out how exactly to do that while not passing the cost on to consumers. If the product is eco-friendly but costs twice as much, only the wealthy will buy it and those working on a tight budget have to go, against their better judgment, with the cheaper, worse option.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People are deciding between their pocket or their planet,&#8221; said CEO José Manuel Moller. &#8220;So we needed to be cheaper and better. So rather than make things more complex, we&#8217;re trying to make things more simple.&#8221;</p>

<p>The solution they&#8217;ve arrived at after years of testing is a modified label for existing products, like detergent or shampoo, that includes an RFID tag that lets the consumer easily refill the bottle at a dispenser. Sold at bulk prices and having removed the cost of packaging (30% of the product&#8217;s cost, Moller estimated), it&#8217;s cheaper and requires nothing but going to a different shelf at the store.</p>
<p>The breakthrough wasn&#8217;t the idea, though &#8212; it was the relationships with big brands. If someone has to drive past their normal grocery store to refill your dish soap, they&#8217;re more likely to just buy a new bottle. Similarly, if only products on offer for bulk refilling are random off-brand ones, the same thing happens. So Algramo had to make the case to the Walmarts and Unilevers of the world — and very recently, they started to listen, at least at the local level.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was going to happen with or without Algramo,&#8221; Moller said. &#8220;But we&#8217;re integrating into their supply chains, working with the retailers and the brand so they don&#8217;t disrupt existing relationships. And actually, ordering the product in bulk saves them about 60% of the space.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are arrangements in place with Unilever, Nestlé, Colgate-Palmolive and Walmart Chile. By offering a turnkey solution that brings together big brands and big retailers and saves consumers a little cash, everyone gets what they want. Originally, Algramo operated using a fleet of small vehicles equipped with dispensers, but ultimately the retail avenue proved to be the more successful one.</p>

<p>There are now Algramo stations all over Chile, with around 50,000 users repurchasing products in bulk. Those products, by the way, were determined not by profitability but by which is the worst polluter. The worst by far, Moller said, is beverages, but those present a different challenge — one the company is happily taking on but not quite ready to debut.</p>
<p>Instead, there are frequently used products like laundry soap and toiletries — even dog food (dry, obviously &#8230; for now). And Algramo was careful to ensure that users can buy as much or as little as they want at the bulk rate, making it more accessible for people who have to make every penny count.</p>
<p>The work in Chile has helped validate the idea at scale, and now the company is raising money ahead of a smattering of pilots around the world. There are projects underway in Jakarta, New York, Mexico and London, all of which no doubt require a lot of local footwork, since different regulations, sub-companies, and distribution networks will necessitate new contracts and agreements everywhere they attempt to make a beachhead.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what the $8.5 million Series A is all about: the global push. It was led by Mexico&#8217;s Dalus Capital, with participation from (deep breath) Angel Ventures, FEMSA Ventures, Volta Ventures, Impact Assets, University Venture Fund, Century Oak Capital and Closed Loop Partners’ Ventures Group (the last of which led the 2019 seed).</p>

<p>Moller said that there are parallel efforts along the lines of Algramo, but that ultimately their platform may very well end up compatible with the others. Owning both the retail and brand relationships is paramount, then those with the customer, but the last step may be adapted to different circumstances. For instance, if there&#8217;s a successful reverse logistics system in place (such as the reusable food containers common all over India) that may be part of the solution, and if someone like a grocery chain were to build their own hardware solution, Algramo would be happy to operate at least partly behind the scenes. (Also, they own several patents.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all pie in the sky for now, as Algramo focuses on building its own presence in various major markets. If you&#8217;re in one of the locations mentioned, keep your eye out at your local big retail or grocery chain for the Algramo station, or just <a href="https://algramo.com/en/home/">check the map at the bottom of their website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What’s big enough, bold enough and influential enough to inspire more than 10,000 people around the world to carve out three days from their intensely busy schedules? If you said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=48hoursleft&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=48hoursleft&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>, the grand matriarch of startup tech conferences, well friend, you’d be right on the money.</p>
<p>And speaking of money, you have just 48 hours left to score the early-bird price on TC Disrupt Innovator, Founder and Investor passes. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=48hoursleft&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=48hoursleft&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy any of these passes</a> and attend all three days of Disrupt for less than $100. Here’s the catch: The early bird price expires on <strong>July 30 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Don’t miss the dynamic 1:1 interviews and panel discussions on the Disrupt Stage. We’ve tapped high-profile speakers — all leading voices in their fields — to download their insight, trends and sage advice. You’ll hear U.S. Secretary of Transportation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/us-secretary-of-transportation-pete-buttigieg-is-coming-to-disrupt-draft/">Pete Buttigieg</a> discuss some of the major challenges of moving people and packages around the block and across the globe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Houseplant COO, Haneen Davies will join company co-founders Michael Mohr and Seth Rogen — who, it seems, has a somewhat successful side hustle as a Hollywood writer, director and actor — for a lively CBD: Cannabis Business Discussion.</p>
<p>Head on over to the Extra Crunch Stage where you’ll find strategic insight across a range of essential startup skills. Think fundraising, product iteration, tech stack development and growth marketing.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick peek at just some of what’s going down Extra Crunchy.</p>
<p><strong>How to Cultivate a Community for your Company that Actually Lasts:</strong> The word of the year in startup-land is “community.” In this panel, Community Fund’s Lolita Taub, Commsor’s Alex Angel and Seven Seven Six’s Katelin Holloway will extract buzz from reality and help founders understand the growing importance of chief community officers in startup culture and, ultimately, financial success today.</p>
<p><strong>The Path for Underrepresented Entrepreneurs:</strong> Founding a startup comes with a wide array of challenges but, unfortunately, underrepresented founders face an extra layer of bias, both conscious and unconscious. We’ll talk with Hana Mohan (MagicBell), Leslie Feinzaig (Female Founders Alliance) and Stephen Bailey (ExecOnline) about their journeys, as founders, through fundraising and scaling — and as advocates who can offer tactical insights and advice.</p>
<p>We’re just warming up, folks. You’ll hear from execs, founders and CEOs from companies like Twitter, Calendly, Mirror, Evil Geniuses, Andreessen Horowitz and plenty more. Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">the Disrupt 2021 agenda</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know how much you love a good startup pitch-off. Who doesn&#8217;t? It combines the thrill of live, high-stakes entertainment with learning about the hottest new thing. Plus, you get to hear feedback from some of the smartest folks in the industry, thus learning how to absolutely crush it at your next pitch meeting with a VC.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, we&#8217;re introducing a special summer edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> that&#8217;s all pitch-off, all the time.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition?ref=12c1c3225394">July 21</a> and <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-july-28?ref=05f802c5b3e8">July 28</a>, Extra Crunch Live will feature startups exhibiting in the Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ecljuly2021suapost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=eclsuajuly&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September. Those startups will pitch their products/businesses to a pair of expert VC judges, who will then give their live feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is usually a combination of an interview with a founder/investor duo and an audience pitch-off. But as it&#8217;s summer, and Disrupt is right around the corner, we thought it would be fun to bring you even more pitches and even more feedback.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On July 21, our expert VC judges will be Alexa von Tobel of Inspired Capital and Anis Uzzaman from Pegasus Tech Ventures. As a special thank you, all attendees of this episode of Extra Crunch Live will be entered into a random drawing for a chance to win one of three free tickets to TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. Following the event, we&#8217;ll randomly select 3 winners and send details on how to redeem their passes. Do you need to submit any additional information to enter the drawing? Nope.
