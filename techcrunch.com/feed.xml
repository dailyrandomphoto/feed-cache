										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are 13 surviving copies of the original print of the U.S. Constitution. Today, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) announced it lost its bid to buy one from art dealer Sotheby’s after a high-stakes bidding war that captured the internet&#8217;s attention. Still, the bold ascendance of the DAO, a group of people who met on the internet, is a unique case study into the art of on-ramping swaths of people into crypto, one meme and auction at a time.</p>
<p>After a brief flurry of excitement on Twitter, where some members of the group mistakenly announced they had won in a live Twitter Spaces chat, the group <a href="https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO/status/1461498841820192771/photo/1">released a statement</a> saying it had lost after all. The group &#8220;broke records for the most money crowdfunded in less than 72 hours,&#8221; per the statement.</p>
<p>One organizer said in the group&#8217;s Discord channel that it lost because it had not raised enough money to establish a reserve required to maintain and care for the document on an ongoing basis. Participants in the ConstitutionDAO will be able to get their money back, minus gas fees, according to the group. Given the fact that there are no governance tokens that have yet been given to participants, the return of money could be complicated.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236961" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Austin Cain and Graham Novak, two 25-year-old Atlanta residents working in finance, first started a Discord chat to launch the effort, which now has more than 8,000 members. Within a week of launching, the DAO raised over $40 million worth of ETH on <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/">Juicebox</a>, an early stage DAO platform.</p>
<p>The effort, largely spun up through Twitter and a ballooning Discord server, is a window into what a community effort could look and feel like in a Web3 universe, where shared ownership and transparency are guiding principles. The opportunities presented by the DAO structure are sparking widespread interest &#8212; the value governed by DAO treasuries is now at over $6 billion, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/03/biggest-daos-now-hold-6b-worth-of-digital-assets-consensys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per some estimates</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, Daniel Monteagudo got a message at 7:57 p.m. from a friend asking if he wanted to hop on a call in three minutes with other people who wanted to buy the Constitution using ETH. He finished up the movie he was watching, hopped on the phone and decided to support the cause: he’s thrown $1,000 of his own money in so far, and currently runs the Twitter account for <a href="https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ConstitutionDAO.</a></p>
<p>Unlike most DAOs, ConstitutionDAO is not token-gated, meaning that someone who joins the Discord for the community doesn’t need to have made an investment in the organization. It’s different than say, a Bored Apes Yacht Club, in which users have to be able to afford one of the pricey NFTs in order to get access to the members-only community.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>”It’s been really weird,” Monteagudo said, of the momentum of the project so far &#8212; which has attracted over 19,000 members, <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1461162895547453445?t=ICtqKsM89XtymDvLAQMnkA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Grimes</a>, to join the DAO. “But I think people are excited at the prospect of raising a ton of money really quickly to mobilize action for a specific goal.”</p>
<p><a href="https://dune.xyz/ilemi/ConstitutionDAO-Funding-Tracker">Using a third-party dashboard</a>, Monteagudo estimates that 13% of contributors to ConstitutionDAO are using ETH for the first time. The same platform indicates that about 44% of people who have contributed to ConstitutionDAO have less than 40 transactions to their name.</p>
<p>The thrill of onboarding people into crypto is thus an exciting side effect of ConstitutionDAO, as theatrical as it may seem. It’s giving people a way to understand the impact and feel of a decentralized community, while also appealing to their emotions in a way that the U.S. Constitution might be able to over a work of abstract art.</p>
<p>“DAOs help large groups of people work together from all over the world. Companies can do that, but they tend to take a long time to get set up and it can be difficult to pay people across borders,” he said. “With DAOs, it’s easy to create a worldwide organization.”</p>
<p>The slew of fresh users may be exciting, but it also means that someone has the responsibility to educate the crypto-new on where their money is going &#8212; and if it’s even going to come back. Early on, for example, the ConstitutionDAO team had to change their pitch from “own a piece of the Constitution” to “you will get governance tokens” so contributors would understand exactly how their money would be spent.</p>
<p>“I just think that because the Constitution is the reason that many people &#8212; let’s say 3,000 people, have gotten into crypto, then I kind of feel responsible for making sure they do it well,” Monteagudo said</p>
<p>Upstream founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ajt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander Taub</a> wants to do away with the term &#8220;DAO&#8221; altogether; instead, his company is taking a page out of the Dapper Labs book and renaming the structure to &#8220;collectives.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We’re not reinventing the wheel. Pooling money with friends has happened for a long time, paying dues with communities has happened for a long time,” Taub said. Instead, DAOs are a bet by individuals who want one of two things, the founder continued: to make money, or to gain a sense of ownership and transparency within a community. The latter piece, while more promising, feels “less researched, talked about and discussed right now.”</p>
<p>It’s part of the reason Upstream announced today that it is creating <a href="https://twitter.com/ajt/status/1461411355903279105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a platform to offer DAOs-in-a-box</a>. He envisions a world where collective members can contribute money into a shared ETH wallet, write proposals for how money should be used, vote on decisions and choose delegates to have more voting power within the community. By creating a full stack spot for people to set up DAOs, Taub thinks that there will be more clarity around governance and compliance.</p>
<p>“The Upstream collective is going to be a lot of people’s first time in a DAO and using a Metamask wallet, Ethereum and getting comfortable with it,” Taub said. “It&#8217;s a good thing in general for more people to understand the future of how money is going to move because we&#8217;ve crossed the chasm.”</p>
<p>Upstream is just one of multiple startups that have entered the fray to accelerate DAO development recently. Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/08/31/investing-in-syndicate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed DAO tool builder Syndicate</a> in August, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/utopia-labs-is-building-an-operating-system-for-daos/">Utopia Labs raised $1.5 million</a> for a DAO operating system in October.</p>
<p>While groups like ConstitutionDAO embody promise for DAO proponents of the emerging structure, they are not immune to the critiques commonly leveled against new crypto technology. Some view ConstitutionDAO as just another stunt purchase, pointing out the vast number of alternative uses for the millions of dollars spent on buying the document.</p>
<p>Attention-grabbing schemes have helped people understand the power of new technologies like NFTs, but they aren’t and shouldn’t be the sole allure of crypto. That said, as it often is in the early days of a new technology, an event that appeals to those who aren’t crypto-fluent can be useful for education, albeit imperfectly so.</p>
<p>Beyond organizing to bid on rare historical documents, DAOs have a wide range of potential use cases. There are creator DAOs like Mirror that allow people to fractionally monetize their work and projects like PieDAO that use the structure to make business decisions similar to the way a corporation would. Most prominent DeFi (decentralized finance) lending platforms, like Uniswap and AAVE, are governed by DAOs.</p>
<p>Some established DAOs that launched with the purpose of making a one-off purchase have since widened their scope. PleasrDAO, for example, was originally formed to buy a Uniswap NFT artwork, but has since made inroads into DeFi and launched an incubator. Because it has gained so much traction and attracted copious resources, ConstitutionDAO could easily do the same.</p>
<p>Taub envisions potential long-term uses for DAOs that could serve the public interest &#8212; for example, in local government, where residents of cities could vote directly on how the treasury’s funds are used. But Taub also acknowledges that their newness and association with a notoriously homogenous, white, male Web3 community mean that DAOs have a long way to go.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the governance token structure underpinning many DAOs assigns voting rights based on how much money each individual has donated. ConstitutionDAO will likely sport this structure in the future, although ConstitutionDAO’s Discord chat is open to all for now. So while DAOs do provide transparency and ownership, it might be a stretch to call them democratic, as those who can’t afford larger stakes will not have the same level of say over the group’s decisions.</p>
<p>And like with other emerging Web3 technologies, DAOs facilitate huge transfers of capital with little formal oversight or regulation. Those who are attracted to the vision of community they offer may still harbor anxieties about losing their money or falling victim to fraud.</p>
<p>Joining a DAO can come with huge risks, given the regulatory grey area in which they exist today. In most U.S. states, DAOs are not governed by a concrete legal structure, so protocol developers and participants hold heightened liability compared to shareholders of regulated corporations.</p>
<p>Until these hurdles have been surmounted, DAOs are likely to center around social groups and niche communities like ConstitutionDAO rather than providing any material threat to entrenched corporate and societal structures. But once the infrastructure exists, DAOs could transform from groups of crypto-curious users buying niche items and having fun on the internet to serious collective entities that act like companies but can be more nimble and inclusive in their decision-making.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two days ago, Ed Sheeran posted <a href="https://twitter.com/edsheeran/status/1460638796697976841" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a cryptic Twitter message</a>, hinting at a soon-to-be announced collaboration with Pokémon GO. I&#8217;ll be honest: I&#8217;m not the biggest Ed Sheeran fan, but the hashtag <a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-1ny4l3l r-1ddef8g r-tjvw6i r-qvutc0" dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonGOxEdSheeran?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#PokemonGOxEdSheeran</a> made me laugh. So, like any self-respecting journalist, I emailed my contact at Niantic to see if he&#8217;d spill the beans (under embargo, of course).</p>
<p>He replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t share anything just yet about the Tweet, but will be sure to include you once we can!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure enough, today, Pokémon GO announced its collaboration with Ed Sheeran. Apparently, there&#8217;s going to be an Ed Sheeran performance in-app, which we&#8217;ll learn more details about on November 22, when the event starts. For now, we know that his song &#8220;Overpass Graffiti&#8221; will play every night during the event, and there&#8217;ll be some Ed Sheeran apparel for your avatar. Pokémon GO&#8217;s celebration of&#8230; Ed Sheeran&#8230; runs through November 30, and during the event, players will encounter increased wild spawns of the water starter from the first five generations of Pokémon: Squirtle (with sunglasses!), Totodile, Mudkip, Oshawott and Froakie.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236955" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ed always chooses the Water-type Pokémon as his first partner when he starts a Pokémon RPG,&#8221; the app wrote in <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/ed-sheeran-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a>.</span></p>
<p>On Twitter, Pokémon GO elaborated that not only does Ed Sheeran always pick the water starter, but his favorite Pokémon is, indeed, Squirtle.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">That’s not all! In celebration of Ed Sheeran’s favorite Pokémon, Squirtle wearing sunglasses will be returning to Pokémon GO! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f576.png" alt="🕶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />We might be “Thinking Out Loud,” but the thought of catching this Squirtle again feels so “Perfect” that it’s giving us “Shivers.”</p>
<p>&mdash; Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1461201258522583048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Okay, I interned at a music PR firm for a whole three months, so let me tell you. Ed Sheeran might want you to think he&#8217;s just like us, feeling fond nostalgia for simpler times when Game Boy Color was high tech, but this dude has a whole team of publicity professionals behind him, weighing the pros and cons of his every move. This is a guy whose song &#8220;Shape of You&#8221; is the most streamed song of all time. He has resources. So, is Squirtle really Ed Sheeran&#8217;s favorite Pokémon, or is that just a palatable fact to advertise? Squirtle is popular enough that average people can recognize it, but not as boring a pick as Pikachu. It makes sense. If you&#8217;re a PR professional and your client is revealing their favorite Pokémon, you don&#8217;t want them to say Cubone or something. Everyone knows Cubone is the most depressing Pokémon. But if they say Bouffalant, it&#8217;s like, why? Who cares?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Any serious Pokémon player knows that water types are over-powered, especially in the Kanto region. The first gym leader you face, Brock, specializes in rock-type Pokémon. Both Bulbasaur and Squirtle have super-effective moves against rock, but Charmander, a fire-type, is weak against Brock&#8217;s mighty level 14 Onix. You wanna know what&#8217;s even worse? Try battling Brock during your first-ever playthrough of Pokémon Yellow, using Pikachu&#8217;s thundershock against a rock snake. It sucks. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p class="containerBlock__headline">Like any good journalist waiting for an email about another story, I decided to investigate. Is Ed Sheeran&#8217;s favorite Pokémon <em>really</em> Squirtle? Or is this just a PR ploy?</p>
<p>If you were to search &#8220;ed sheeran pokemon&#8221; right now, you would find news articles from outlets with a more robust staff than TechCrunch, which published brief news hits this morning about this unlikely, wholesome collaboration. But I wanted to go deeper. Beyond this announcement, what do we know about Ed&#8217;s Pokémon fandom? So, I narrowed my search.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2236981" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="163" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png 1310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png?resize=150,36 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png?resize=300,72 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png?resize=768,184 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png?resize=680,163 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png?resize=50,12 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>I discovered that two years ago, the British superstar visited <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10272069/ed-sheeran-pokemon-karaoke-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Japanese karaoke bar</a> after the Rugby World Cup final. England lost to South Africa. Brutal. He was photographed wearing both Snorlax and Charizard onesies as he sang karaoke to his own songs, which is simultaneously cringe and a power move.</p>
<p>To date, it seemed Sheeran had only acknowledged the existence of Kanto region Pokémon, or, the basic ones. This past May, Ed Sheeran posted an Instagram photo next to a large Snorlax plush, staring fondly at it like an old friend. He is wearing socks.</p>

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script></div>
<p>The following month, in June, Ed spoke with Spanish streamer Ibai Llanos. Per <a href="https://nintendohill.com/2021/07/ed-sheeran-shares-his-favourite-starter-pokemon-and-more-in-this-live-performance-with-ibai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting from Nintendo Hill</a>, Sheeran shared three insights into his Nintendo fandom: his prized possession is a Nintendo 64 GoldenEye 007 cartridge, he met the creator of Pokémon (who also wrote him a letter!), and &#8212; wait for it &#8212; his favorite Pokémon is Squirtle.</p>
<p>So, unless if Sheeran&#8217;s probably-very-skilled PR team has been planning this for at least five months (not impossible, tbh!), we can probably say that Ed Sheeran&#8217;s favorite Pokémon is really Squirtle. But also, isn&#8217;t it fun to imagine if his favorite Pokémon was something super mundane, and Pokémon GO had to develop an entire event around it? Like Burmy, Nosepass or Zigzagoon.</p>
<p>Sheeran also confirmed in that interview that the first generation of Pokémon is his favorite. Which, I mean, yeah, Ed, we can tell. However, it does seem that he has at least engaged with Pokémon content released during the twenty-first century. In 2013, he posted a photo of a cat with a Pokémon card. And what Pokémon card was it? Turtwig, a fourth-generation starter Pokémon. A grass type.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 18, 2021. Today we’re talking how audio turns into the written word and how to stop watching <em>certain</em> video content if you can’t, ahem, turn it off. But first, don’t forget that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021">TechCrunch Sessions: Space</a> is coming up in just a few weeks! — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/investors-bet-that-sweetgreen-will-make-sweet-amounts-of-green/"><strong>Sweetgreen’s IPO turns out pretty sweet:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Whatever you thought of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/heavily-vc-backed-salad-chain-sweetgreen-heads-toward-public-markets/">Sweetgreen’s financial performance</a>, it is having a pretty great public debut. After pricing at $28 per share, above its target range, the company’s share price shot higher today to nearly double its starting value. Sure, you could argue that the company underpriced its public debut, but I doubt that the company is crying.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/india-paytm-makes-market-debut/">Paytm’s IPO doesn’t:</a></strong> But while Sweetgreen is rolling in clover, Indian fintech giant Paytm had a pretty awful first day as a public company, with its shares falling around 27% in regular trading. The SoftBank- and Alibaba-backed unicorn raised $2.5 billion in its public-market debut, so it at least locked in the funds before seeing its valuation fall.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/spotify-finally-rolls-out-real-time-lyrics-to-global-users/">Spotify finally rolls out live lyrics globally:</a></strong> If you, like myself, live on Spotify but are tired of using your web browser to look up song lyrics, good news! Now you don’t have to! Lyrics are live in the music service and they look like this:</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2236866" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2KQBhix4n2X6ZYF5L3yvX5?si=bb272f4ed28b432b"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236866" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236866 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/spotify_lyrics-1.png" alt="spotify_lyrics" width="1024" height="573" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/spotify_lyrics-1.png 2872w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/spotify_lyrics-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/spotify_lyrics-1.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/spotify_lyrics-1.png?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/spotify_lyrics-1.png?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/spotify_lyrics-1.png?resize=1536,859 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/spotify_lyrics-1.png?resize=2048,1145 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/spotify_lyrics-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2236866" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We have a few things to dig through from startups today, but first, Grammarly. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/grammarly-raises-200m-at-a-13b-valuation-to-make-you-an-even-better-writer-through-ai/">just raised $200 million at a $13 billion valuation</a>. This makes the company, variously, a <em>decacorn</em> or <a href="https://www.axios.com/unicorn-startup-privately-held-valued-1-billion-c64e66cb-ec22-4c68-9aaf-db7f71431704.html"><em>dragon</em></a> or <em>Company That Should Go Public</em>. Regardless, the old $1 billion valuation threshold that used to set startups apart has lost all meaning. The $10 billion mark, however, seems to be the new requirement to be a truly standout startup today.</p>
<p><strong>Notes from the TechCrunch transport desk: Cars of the future</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/biliti-bets-us-market-is-primed-for-electric-tuk-tuk-deliveries/"><strong>Electric tuk tuks for the U.S. market:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the play that Biliti thinks is going to be big. Tuk tuks are three-wheeled, open-cab vehicles that are something akin to a cross between a delivery van and a moped. They are popular in a number of global markets, if not the United States. But with more folks living in cities over time, and more of us expecting goods to be delivered to our homes, perhaps the time of the tuk tuk is nigh in the U.S.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/sono-motors-has-gone-public-aims-to-get-sion-solar-electric-vehicle-to-market-by-2023/"><strong>Sun power:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I don’t know how well this will work in the wild, but Sono Group just went public on the back of its solar-powered car idea. The idea is that the car can suck in enough juice from the sky to power a commute. Which means no charging cables, even if the car probably wouldn’t get you too far without other forms of electrical input. Still, the idea is very neat and we hope that all EVs in time have a solar component.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/apple-reportedly-aims-to-debut-a-fully-self-driving-car-in-2025/"><strong>Self-driving Apple:</strong></a> Remember the Apple car? Apart from the never-quite-here Apple television set, the Apple car is my favorite bit of tech from the consumer electronics giant that we have yet to set eyes on. But reporting indicates that we could see the self-driving vehicle in 2025. That’s just far enough away for us to forget about the date.</li>
<li>And speaking of self-driving, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/baidu-robotaxi-2030/"><strong>Baidu’s self-driving taxis could be in 100 cities by 2030</strong></a>. By 2030 that number better be bigger than 100, honestly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And now, a sampling of the rest of the day’s startup news:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/new-app-snax-combines-short-form-movies-with-interactive-games/"><strong>What if TikTok, but also gaming?</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the idea behind Snax, which intends to bring together short-form video and interactive elements. This could be very cool, or not, probably depending on whether Snax is able to let the crowds contribute content or it decides to do all that work itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/party-round-raises-7m-to-make-the-process-of-raising-capital-less-awful/"><strong>Party Round raises its own party round:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The idea behind Party Round is that raising money is a pain in the butt and that founders need better tooling. The service wants to make fundraising simpler and also allow founders to accept smaller checks. So that they can put together their own <em>party rounds</em>. Funding events with many smaller participants used to be mocked as a bad idea for founders. So much for that old logic. Party Round just added $7 million to its accounts using its own service.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/mlops-startup-comet-nabs-50m-series-b-just-six-months-after-raising-its-a/"><strong>Get used to reading about MLOps:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today&#8217;s news that machine learning operations startup Comet closed a $50 million Series B just months after closing its Series A might seem like just another example of a startup raising lots of money, very quickly. But recall that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/weights-biases-raises-new-capital-as-developer-tools-remain-a-venture-focus-ml-matures/">Weights &amp; Biases raised $135 million</a> for its own MLOps work the other week. It’s a category that is now perhaps seen as inevitable and therefore a lucrative long-term bet. Expect to see more of these investments.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/2236404/"><strong>Doorvest raises $14M to help folks buy, manage rental properties:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you want to get into real estate investing, your options set is limited today to your ability to build a small real estate company or invest in REITs. Doorvest wants to make the first option easier for folks and make itself a packet in the process.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/formstack-raises-425m-for-a-no-code-platform-that-helps-businesses-automate-their-customer-and-internal-workflows/"><strong>Workflow automation is big business:</strong></a> If you get on the horn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/06/how-one-startup-is-shaking-up-the-consumer-trading-boom/">with Appian CEO Matt Calkins</a>, he isn’t hard to get started on the subject of workflows. Workflows are what RPA and other automation tools, well, automate. And it’s a big enough piece of work that Appian is seeing startup competition. Formstack just raised $425 million for a no-code approach to business workflow automation, for example.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/kandji-pulls-in-100m-series-c-on-800m-valuation-up-10x-since-last-year/"><strong>MDM is investor catnip:</strong></a><strong> </strong>News out today that Kandji has raised $100 million at an $800 million valuation for its Apple device management business might not raise your eyebrows, but recall that Apple itself is getting in on the game and that Jamf, another competitor, already went public. Perhaps Apple’s corporate footprint is simply larger than we thought.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/remojo-gets-funding-to-help-men-quit-porn/">This startup wants to help you stop watching porn:</a></strong> If you’ve spent too much time online in the last while, you have at least heard of certain movements among the digitally inclined to stop consuming pornography. Now that porn is free and easily accessible, as opposed to costly and served in physical formats, some folks are overindulging. Enter Remojo, which wants to help men quit the media variety altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And, finally, accessibility:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Watching <a href="https://accessible.substack.com/">micro-publications with a focus on technology accessibility</a> get off the ground has brought the topic back to the front of my mind. Which is why news <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/clubhouse-live-captions-on-ios/">that Clubhouse is bringing live captions to iOS caught my eye</a>. It’s a good move, and one that we hope becomes table stakes for audio platforms moving forward.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://workday.com">Workday</a> announced this afternoon that it intends to acquire <a href="http://vndly.com">VNDLY</a>, a Mason, OH startup that helps companies manage external workforce personnel for $510 million.</p>
<p>Workday helps companies manage finance and human resources tasks, and VNDLY fits nicely into the latter category providing them with software to manage contractors, a service that should come in handy at a time where it&#8217;s increasingly difficult to fill full time job openings.</p>
<p>Pete Schlampp, chief strategy officer at Workday, says as the face of work changes, companies need a way to manage contractors and VNDLY gives them that. Folding that capability into the Workday platform expands their capabilities with an offering that customers will need in the future.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236927" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;VNDLY is at the forefront of the vendor management industry with an innovative and intuitive approach. The powerful combination of our technologies and talent will help customers better manage their evolving workforce dynamics, helping them keep pace with today’s changing world of work,&#8221; Schlampp said in a statement.</p>
<p>Bringing the two companies together means that customers can manage internal and external workers from the same interface, saving HR personnel from switching context based on worker type. In addition, customers will be able to plan for workforce needs, regardless of the type, while managing internal and external compliance and risk requirements related to this type of worker.</p>
<p>The two companies were not strangers to each other as VNDLY lists Workday as an integration partner on its website. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter next year, which corresponds with Workday&#8217;s Q4 2022 ending on 1/31/2022.</p>
<p>VNDLY is based in Mason, Ohio, and it marks the latest exit for a Midwest startup. Other big Midwest exits include Salesforce buying Indianapolis-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/04/with-exacttarget-acquisition-salesforce-com-has-spent-close-to-3-5-billion-to-get-into-the-chief-marketing-officers-suite/">ExactTarget for $2.5 billion</a> in 2013 and Cisco buying Ann Arbor, MI-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/02/cisco-is-buying-duo-security-for-2-35b-in-cash/">Duo for $2.35 billion</a> in 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded in 2017 and raised almost $58 million along the way, according to Crunchbase data. The company&#8217;s largest and most recent round was<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vndly-raises-35-million-in-series-b-funding-led-by-insight-partners-300975581.html"> a $35 million Series B</a> at the end of 2019 led by Insight Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The new economy of space has been made possible by the new generation of launch companies — the <em>old</em> new generation now, actually, as SpaceX and Rocket Lab cement their reputations. Now it&#8217;s up to the likes of Astra, Firefly Aerospace, Relativity Space and Launcher to change the game — as the CEOs of those companies will explain at our virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Space</a> event on December 14-15.</p>
<p>These companies all have very different approaches to the orbital launch services industry. <a href="https://launcherspace.com/">Launcher</a> is focusing on efficiency, for instance, with a 3D-printed copper liquid engine that it says is among the most fuel-efficient out there. Lower costs, less fuel per launch and subsequently more space for payloads mean it can undercut competitors in the increasingly competitive small launch market.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/rocket-startup-astra-is-going-public-vis-spac/">Astra</a>, on the other hand, intends to lower costs by making the launch vehicles as cheap as possible and throwing caution to the wind. Launching from Kodiak, Alaska and brazenly accepting a higher risk per launch, Astra&#8217;s philosophy is that demand will soon be so great that speed and convenience will grow in value, and its portable launch vehicle will be ready.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236622" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/firefly-aerospace-raises-75m-series-a-at-a-1b-valuation-plus-100m-in-secondary-sale/">Firefly Aerospace</a> has a larger launch vehicle that can take up to 1,000 kg to orbit and has begun diversifying as well. A $93 million NASA contract for an upcoming mission to the lunar surface shows that the company has escaped its complicated past and is ready to become a major new force in the industry in the Artemis Era.</p>
<p>First, of course, they have to get to orbit — as difficult a task as it ever was, but one that each company is progressing toward at their own pace. The CEOs of all three companies — Max Haot from Launcher, Benjamin Lyon from Astra and Lauren Lyons from Firefly — will be on stage with us to discuss the challenges and opportunities of the new launch (and funding) ecosystem in detail.</p>
<p>Lastly but certainly not least, we have Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, coming to TC Sessions: Space as well. Growing quickly and putting satellites into orbit by the dozen, Rocket Lab&#8217;s Electron is an established presence in launch but only the first step in Beck&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/peter-beck-says-rocket-lab-actively-prepared-for-interplanetary-missions-from-day-one/">long-planned expansion</a> into larger launch vehicles, satellite design and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=TRUE">Get your pass</a>, join your global space community and get the very latest thinking on space launch systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">TechCrunch Live</a> (previously known as Extra Crunch Live) is ending the year strong with a slate of fantastic speakers. We&#8217;re speaking to Eugenio Pace from AuthO and Sunil Nagaraj from Ubiquity Ventures. Then, our last show of 2021 will feature Alyson Watson from Modern Health and investor Annie Case from Kleiner Perkins.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled with the response to TechCrunch Live. Over the last year, we&#8217;ve had great speakers telling amazing stories of growth, exits and failure. Just recently, Laela Sturdy and Vlad Magdalin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/mixing-the-personal-with-the-professional-in-startup-fundraising/">spoke on mixing the personal with the professional</a> in startup fundraising. Aileen Lee and Rachel Carlson <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/aileen-lee-and-rachel-carlson-walk-through-guild-educations-early-pitch-deck/">walked through Guild Education&#8217;s early pitch deck</a> and we learned how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/how-lunchclub-landed-a-preemptive-term-sheet-from-lightspeed/">Lunchclub landed a preemptive term sheet</a> from Lightspeed.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is specifically designed to help founders build better venture-backed businesses. We do this by bringing together startup founders and the investors who back them to talk about what, specifically, helped close the deal. What metrics are the investors looking at? What questions did the founders answer that made the VCs want to learn more? How did the founders communicate their grand vision, and their step-by-step plan to getting there?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235691" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We cover all this — complete with a look at these companies’ early pitch decks, and more — on TechCrunch Live. TechCrunch Live is also home to the TCL Pitch-off, where founders in the audience can get on our virtual stage to pitch their startup to our esteemed guests and get their live feedback.</p>
<p>As with any TechCrunch event, this weekly series also features networking so you can meet and greet other attendees.</p>
<p>The event goes down every Wednesday at noon PT/3pm ET, and is free to attend. Only TechCrunch+ members get access to the complete library of on-demand content, so if you haven’t yet already, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/subscribe">sign up now</a>!</p>
<p>And without any further ado, here is a look at the outstanding guests joining us on TechCrunch Live in December.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joann Wu, a longtime LinkedIn executive who spent over a decade at the company working on user experience and product design, is moving to Uber. She will be joining Uber as VP of product design starting January 3, where she’ll report to Chief Product Officer Sundeep Jain.</p>
<p>Wu told TechCrunch that she&#8217;s a longtime user of both Uber and Uber Eats, the company&#8217;s food delivery business unit. &#8220;I see Uber as a platform that can make it easy to do both — &#8216;go&#8217; and &#8216;get,&#8217; and there&#8217;s a lot we can do with design around doing those two things really, really well every day and make people&#8217;s lives a little bit easier.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236836" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236836" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236836 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png?w=593" alt="Joann Wu " width="593" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png 836w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png?resize=131,150 131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png?resize=262,300 262w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png?resize=768,880 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png?resize=593,680 593w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236836" class="wp-caption-text">Joann Wu. <strong>Image Credits: </strong>Uber</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236829" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wu started at LinkedIn as a senior UX designer in content and publishing, and held a variety of roles throughout her tenure, including senior director of product design. In March 2021 she took over as VP of product design, where she headed LinkedIn’s global consumer product design team. She led the redesign of LinkedIn&#8217;s website and mobile app, built LinkedIn News and launched the LinkedIn Publishing Platform.</p>
<p>While she was at LinkedIn, the platform grew from around 100 million users nearly 800 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Design is the bridge between humans and technology,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Great experience will transfer users&#8217; intent into action and bring value to their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uber is constantly rolling out or piloting new features &#8212; like being able to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/uber-pilots-new-features-to-reserve-rides-at-airports/">reserve a car</a> at an airport or adding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uber-eats-adds-map-feature-so-users-can-find-nearest-restaurants-for-pickup/">a new mapping function</a> to its Eats business unit &#8212; so Wu will surely be busy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>The story has been corrected to reflect that Linked in has nearly, not over, 800 million users</em>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">You’re going to be judged on the first thing you launch — everyone is. Explaining that it’s just your minimum viable product (MVP) and it’s not ready yet is sometimes fine, but I’ve seen many times where that’s the dealbreaker in itself.</p>
<p>Why? Because your idea of minimal is far more minimal than that of the person you’re showing it to. Minimal is a sliding scale that will always slide onto you.</p>
<p>The notion of the minimum viable product (MVP) has always had its pros and cons, but the often bitter cocktail of time pressure, competition and agile software development made the MVP the ongoing easy choice.</p>
<p>My concept of the initial viable product (IVP) isn’t just a hyperiterated MVP. It’s the first truly viable product you choose to launch. On the continuum of idea to completely finished product, the IVP is simply the release of a non-minimal product.</p>

<p>Your IVP should eliminate any conversation about whether the product you’ve released is indeed viable. If your IVP is your presentation of unbaked pepperoni pizza, your MVP is when you present a can of sauce, a package of cheese, a Slim Jim and a pencil sketch of an oven.</p>
<p>I remember a conversation in Beijing with an entrepreneur looking to reinvent taxis. Not the service itself — Didi and Uber were just about to be born — but the notion of the traditional Beijing taxi itself. How to make it safer, more fuel-efficient, less harmful to the planet and all around better.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch’s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them. We’re just starting to roll out this year’s gift guides, so check back from now until the end of December for more! </em></p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s on video calls all the time these days, and there&#8217;s always a way to upgrade your setup with better sound, video or ease of use. Here are some options! Put them on your wish list, or get them for a loved one who always looks and sounds like they&#8217;re taking calls from the inside of a tin can.</p>

<h1>Webcams</h1>
<p>The best thing you can do for your setup is get a dedicated webcam — even the cheapest ones out there will generally be better than a laptop&#8217;s built-in cam.</p>
<p>You can go wild and wire up a full-blown DSLR for your Zoom calls … but if you don&#8217;t happen to have one lying around that can get expensive fast. Fortunately, there are more affordable options, and ones that are a bit easier to gift.</p>
<p>(Note: All of our recommended cameras allow for 60 frames-per-second video. Even though this isn&#8217;t always an option with these chat platforms right now, if you&#8217;re going to buy a nice webcam these days it really should be a little future-proofed.)</p>
<h2>A good starter cam with a built-in light</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2232897" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kiyo.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232897" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232897" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kiyo.jpg" alt="The Razer Kiyo webcam on a monitor." width="1024" height="653" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kiyo.jpg 1361w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kiyo.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kiyo.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kiyo.jpg?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kiyo.jpg?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kiyo.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232897" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Razer</p></div></p>
<p>Razer&#8217;s entry-level Kiyo is a great way to just step away from the quality of the built-in webcam in your laptop or desktop monitor. It has solid image quality and a basic ring light that will fill in the scene a bit. (That light is still pretty small, so you might want to get a real one, but it&#8217;s better than nothing for sure.)</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075N1BYWB/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B075N1BYWB&amp;linkId=449da86439a0da30185ec6431e55c8b2">$100 on Amazon</a> (on sale for $70 at the time of publishing)</p>
<h2>Logitech goes upscale</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2232902" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/streamcam.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232902" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232902" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/streamcam.jpg" alt="Logitech's streamcam on a monitor." width="1024" height="614" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/streamcam.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/streamcam.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/streamcam.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/streamcam.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/streamcam.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/streamcam.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232902" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Logitech</p></div></p>
<p>Logitech makes a ton of webcams, and they&#8217;re all fine, but the StreamCam is clearly their attempt to move the ball beyond the productivity-centric (and looking like it) gadgets they&#8217;ve offered for years. It&#8217;s attractive, has great 60 fps video and comes with advanced features like automatic framing.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TZT4Q89/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07TZT4Q89&amp;linkId=e73efad1ab56086c8ac6eb4f6e3c55cc">$160 on Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Great quality, YouTube and Twitch ready, but BYO mic</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2232899" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/elgato-facecam.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232899" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232899" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/elgato-facecam.jpg" alt="Elgato's Facecam on a monitor." width="1024" height="615" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/elgato-facecam.jpg 1263w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/elgato-facecam.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/elgato-facecam.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/elgato-facecam.jpg?resize=768,462 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/elgato-facecam.jpg?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/elgato-facecam.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232899" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Elgato</p></div></p>
<p>Used by TC staff, the Elgato Facecam provides great image quality with its uncompressed video options and slots right into a variety of streaming and recording services, something Elgato knows a little about. If either you or the recipient are thinking about getting into vlogging, doing how-tos or other popular YouTube things, this is a great way to get a pro look without going to a &#8220;real&#8221; camera. There&#8217;s no built-in mic, though, so be ready to provide one. Speaking of which…</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0973DV11T/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0973DV11T&amp;linkId=04621e00f639d7e5079b92986b759f94">$200 on Amazon</a></p>
<h1>Microphones</h1>
<p>Most webcams have a mic built in, but fundamentally you&#8217;ll just get better sound from something closer to your mouth — you know, where your voice comes out. A separate mic is a good option here if you don&#8217;t want to use earbuds (which have bad voice quality in general) or a big headset (which can look pretty goofy if you&#8217;re not actively in the middle of a deathmatch.)</p>
<h2>Budget-friendly and better than nothing</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2236734" style="width: 533px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236734" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236734 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fifine.jpg" alt="" width="523" height="583" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fifine.jpg 523w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fifine.jpg?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fifine.jpg?resize=269,300 269w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fifine.jpg?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236734" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> FIFINE</p></div></p>
<p>No one is going to use this to record their album or podcast, but I can tell you it&#8217;s a lot better than doing it on your laptop or webcam&#8217;s built-in one. For $30 FIFINE&#8217;s USB mic does exactly what it needs to: catch your voice accurately and adjustably from a position off-camera but near you. I ordered a couple to give to friends as gifts during the great video calling era of 2020 and they&#8217;ve been very pleased.</p>

<h2>Bee like me</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using NEAT&#8217;s Bumblebee mic for calls and recorded interviews for the last year or so and it&#8217;s treated me well. It&#8217;s a bit bulky but I like the fact that it&#8217;s super simple to set up, easily adjustable with a long neck and has controls for sound profiles, gain and headphone levels for the built-in port all right on there. I&#8217;ve had nothing but compliments on the sound quality and it&#8217;s built like a tank, too. Just don&#8217;t try to travel with it.</p>

<h2>Sound (and look) like a pro</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2236739" style="width: 973px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236739" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236739 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shure.jpg" alt="" width="963" height="596" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shure.jpg 963w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shure.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shure.jpg?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shure.jpg?resize=768,475 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shure.jpg?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shure.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 963px) 100vw, 963px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236739" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SHURE</p></div></p>
<p>The MV7 is probably more mic than most people need for everyday purposes, but if you&#8217;ve ever thought about recording, or your loved one&#8217;s up-and-coming podcast is hindered only by the audible whir of laptop fans, perhaps it&#8217;s time to invest in a serious piece of kit. A few TC staffers tap this one for their podcasting habits. Get a big tripod or articulating arm to make sure this thing is in frame so people know you bought one … everyone else seems to do it.</p>

<p>A decent size (12&#8243; or larger) ring light helps provide more even illumination and prevent the cold and changing light of your monitor from making you look sickly. There are a billion ring lights out there; you really can&#8217;t go wrong as long as you make sure it has a real tripod (among other things, so you can fold it up and file it away) and finely adjustable color temperature and brightness (look for dials with a range of settings, not sliders that limit you to two or three options.)</p>
<p>A lot of us at TC have been using this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FFM6PQ8/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07FFM6PQ8&amp;linkId=99ecb785f88290a5288b0486a32695bb">$90 18&#8243; GVM light</a> for our many virtual events over the last two years, and it gets the job done.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to add a bit more color to your look, Philips Hue Play light bar is the easiest gadget to recommend. You can use it as a bias light behind your monitor or a temperature-controlled illumination for yourself, bouncing it off the wall for plenty of natural scattering. Find it useful? Add more. They work well in sets.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> you can buy them in 2-packs, but if buying them individually is the same price, do that because the multipacks generally only come with one power brick while the single units each come with their own. More power bricks = more flexibility in how you use them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wait, am I muted? Now you don&#8217;t have to hunt down the mute/unmute icon or wiggle your cursor to make it show up, since it&#8217;s a button sitting on your desk — same for flipping video on and off. Linkidea&#8217;s little buttons are pretty cheap looking but seem to work pretty well, at least with Zoom. They come in Mac and Windows varieties so be sure before you buy.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08VGHHTSJ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08VGHHTSJ&amp;linkId=70d97231b2b588fa0428272f24443372">$21 on Amazon</a></p>
<h2>The upgrade version of the above</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2236772" style="width: 679px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236772" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236772 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vitalkeys.jpg" alt="" width="669" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vitalkeys.jpg 669w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vitalkeys.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vitalkeys.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vitalkeys.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236772" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> VitalKeys on Etsy</p></div></p>
<p>If you&#8217;d rather have something neat and at least kind of handmade, consider grabbing this little set of Zoom keys instead. It&#8217;s twice the price but looks more than twice as good, so if the recipient is (like me) picky about what sits on their desk, it may be worth upgrading. I like the little LEDs, like tiny &#8220;RECORDING IN SESSION&#8221; studio signs.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/957449108/zoom-keypad-mini">$40 on Etsy</a></p>
<h2>Hang up with a bang</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2236779" style="width: 1067px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236779" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236779 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/task.jpg" alt="" width="1057" height="790" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/task.jpg 1057w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/task.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/task.jpg?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/task.jpg?resize=768,574 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/task.jpg?resize=680,508 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/task.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1057px) 100vw, 1057px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236779" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alan Mond</p></div></p>
<p>Sometimes you just wanna smash that big red button. Alan Mond&#8217;s &#8220;task button&#8221; is so called because it can be reprogrammed to do other stuff if you want, but it comes all prepared to kill that Zoom call with style. Mount in frame for best effect! <em>(Note: These seem to be made in small batches.)</em></p>

		Teresa Phillips is the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.spherex.com/">Spherex</a>, a data and technology company that is pioneering the culturalization of media for international film and television distribution.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The recent controversy surrounding the <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2021/10/squid-game-netflix-subtitles-translation-capitalism.html">mistranslations</a> found in the Netflix hit “Squid Game” and <a href="https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/7-worst-movie-translations-ever/">other films</a> highlights technology&#8217;s challenges when releasing content that bridges languages and cultures internationally.</p>
<p>Every year across the global media and entertainment industry, tens of thousands of movies and TV episodes exhibited on hundreds of streaming platforms are released with the hope of finding an audience among 7.2 billion people living in nearly 200 countries. No audience is fluent in the roughly 7,000 recognized languages. If the goal is to release the content internationally, subtitles and audio dubs must be prepared for global distribution.</p>
<p>Known in the industry as “localization,” creating “subs and dubs” has, for decades, been a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4qQi5HAdsc">human-centered process,</a> where someone with a thorough understanding of another language sits in a room, reads a transcript of the screen dialogue, watches the original language content (if available) and translates it into an audio dub script. It is not uncommon for this step to take several weeks per language from start to finish.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236041" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Once the translations are complete, the script is then performed by voice actors who make every effort to match the action and lip movements as closely as possible. Audio dubs follow the final cut dialogue, and then subtitles are generated from each audio dub. Any compromise made in the language translation may, then, be subjected to further compromise in the production of subtitles. It’s easy to see where mistranslations or changes in a story can occur.</p>
<p>The most conscientious localization process does include some level of cultural awareness because some words, actions or contexts are not universally translatable. For this purpose, the director of the 2019 Oscar-winning film “Parasite,” Bong Joon-ho, <a href="https://youtu.be/KAZUKcCs9bc">sent detailed notes</a> to his translation team before they began work. <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/01/parasite-wins-foreign-language-film-golden-globe-bong-joon-ho-1202821526/">Bong</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/10/1044830237/squid-game-is-the-latest-example-of-when-subtitles-are-a-little-off">others</a> have pointed out that limitations of time, available screen space for subtitles, and the need for cultural understanding further complicate the process. Still, when done well, they contribute to higher levels of enjoyment of the film.</p>
<p>The exponential growth of distribution platforms and the increasing and continuous flow of fresh content are pushing those involved in the localization process to seek new ways to speed production and increase translation accuracy. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are highly anticipated answers to this problem, but neither has reached the point of replacing the human localization component. Directors of titles such as “Squid Game” or “Parasite” are not yet ready to make that leap. Here’s why.</p>
<h2>Culture matters</h2>
<p>First, literal translation is incapable of catching 100% of the story’s linguistic, cultural or contextual nuance included in the script, inflection or action. AI companies themselves admit to these limitations, commonly referring to machine-based translations as “<a href="https://blog.csoftintl.com/limitations-machine-translation/">more like dictionaries than translators</a>,” and remind us that computers are only capable of doing <a href="https://mindmatters.ai/2020/08/six-limitations-of-artificial-intelligence-as-we-know-it/">what we teach them</a> while stating they lack understanding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, the English title of the first episode of &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; is “<a href="https://www.myimperfectlife.com/features/squid-game-translation-issues">Red Light, Green Light</a>.” This refers to the name of the children&#8217;s game played in the first episode. The original Korean title is “무궁화 꽃이 피던 날” (&#8220;Mugunghwa Kkoch-I Pideon Nal&#8221;), which directly translates as “The Day the Mugunghwa Bloomed,” which has nothing to do with the game they’re playing.</p>
<p>In Korean culture, the title symbolizes new beginnings, which is the game’s protagonists&#8217; promise to the winner. “Red Light, Green Light” is related to the episode, but it misses the broader cultural reference of a promised fresh start for people down on their luck — a significant theme of the series. Some may believe that naming the episode after the game played because the cultural metaphor of the original title is unknown to the translators may not be a big deal, but it is.</p>
<p>How can we expect to train machines to recognize these differences and apply them autonomously when humans don’t make the connection and apply them themselves?</p>
<h2>Knowing versus knowledge</h2>
<p>It’s one thing for a computer to translate Korean into English. It is another altogether for it to have knowledge about relationship differences like those in “Squid Game” &#8212; between immigrants and natives, strangers and family members, employees and bosses &#8212; and how those relationships impact the story. Programming cultural understanding and emotional recognition into AI is challenging enough, especially if those emotions are displayed without words, such as a look on someone’s face. Even then, it is hard to predict emotional facial response that may change with culture.</p>
<p>AI is still a work in progress as it relates to explainability, interpretability and algorithmic bias. The idea that machines will self-train themselves is far-fetched given where the industry stands concerning executing AI/ML. For a content-heavy, creative industry like media and entertainment, context is everything; there is the content creator’s expression of context, and then there is the audience’s perception of it.</p>
<p>Moreover, with respect to global distribution, context equals culture. A digital nirvana is achieved when a system can orchestrate and predict the audio, video and text in addition to the multiple layers of cultural nuance that are at play at any given frame, scene, theme and genre level. At the core, it all starts with good-quality training data — essentially, taking a data-centric approach versus a model-centric one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ai-enforce-rules-engineers-doubtful-artificial-intelligence-11634338184">Recent reports</a> indicate Facebook catches only 3% to 5% of problematic content on its platform. Even with millions of dollars available for development, programming AI to understand context and intent is very hard to do. Fully autonomous translation solutions are some ways off, but that doesn’t mean AI/ML cannot reduce the workload today. It can.</p>
<p>Through analysis of millions of films and TV shows combined with the cultural knowledge of individuals from nearly 200 countries, a two-step human and AI/ML process can provide the detailed insights needed to identify content that any country or culture may find objectionable. In “culturalization,” this cultural roadmap is then used in the localization process to ensure story continuity, avoid cultural missteps and obtain global age ratings &#8212; all of which reduce post-production time and costs without regulatory risk.</p>
<p>Audiences today have more content choices than ever before. Winning in the global marketplace means content creators have to pay more attention to their audience, not just at home but in international markets.</p>
<p>The fastest path to success for content creators and streaming platforms is working with companies that understand local audiences and what matters to them so their content is not lost in translation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Biliti Electric, a startup founded less than a year ago, wants its electric tuk tuks to become a common sight in densely packed cities in the United States.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three-wheeled, open-cabin, all-electric delivery vehicles known as the GMW Taskman</span> are already being used in Asia and Europe, Biliti founder and CEO, Rahul Gayam said during a press conference Wednesday at the LA Auto Show. The vehicles, which are manufactured by GMW Electric in India and exported to Europe, Japan and other markets, have already made more than 12 million deliveries over 20 million miles, according to Gayam. The company has sold around 1,400 Taskman vehicles to date.</p>
<p>Now, the company is aiming to break into the U.S. market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236614" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The vehicle, which made its North American debut at the LA Auto Show, is meant to be a functional electric delivery vehicle that&#8217;s easy to charge and has plenty of cargo space despite its smaller size.</p>
<p>The GMW Taskman, which costs $8,000, looks just like a tuk tuk or auto rickshaw you see in other parts of the world and it&#8217;s designed to be used as a fleet vehicle that tackles the last-mile delivery challenges that large Amazon, UPS and FedEx vans and trucks sometimes struggle with in densely populated cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236770" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TaskmanSolar01.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236770" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236770 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TaskmanSolar01.jpg" alt="Biliti Electric taskman solar tuk tuk" width="1600" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TaskmanSolar01.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TaskmanSolar01.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TaskmanSolar01.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TaskmanSolar01.jpg?resize=768,518 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TaskmanSolar01.jpg?resize=680,459 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TaskmanSolar01.jpg?resize=1536,1037 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TaskmanSolar01.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2236770" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Biliti Electric</p></div></p>
<p>The Taskman can travel up to 110 miles on a single charge, can hold up to 1,500 pounds of payload and has roughly 64.6 square feet of cargo space, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/biliti-electric-launches-gmw-taskman-vehicle-301427223.html">according to the company</a>. The vehicle can be charged either on a home&#8217;s standard 110-volt power that takes up to seven hours or on 220-volt power for a faster 3.5 hours. Since most fleets don&#8217;t want to have that kind of downtime, Biliti offers a free, swappable battery pack option for fleets that the company says can be swapped in as little as one minute using a scissor lift.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also offers an optional solar panel set up where three sides of the cargo area, equipped with solar panels, swing up like gullwing doors to become flat to the sky and absorb solar radiation to recharge the battery. Biliti says that a full charge from the solar panels takes roughly 3.5 to 4 hours in ideal conditions. Gayam said that most of these vehicles will be deployed in the tropical areas between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn where the sun hits the earth most directly for the longest periods.</p>
<p>Gayam&#8217;s comments at the LA Auto Show suggest the company is targeting e-commerce and retail giants like Amazon and Walmart. And while there appears to be some headway — the vehicle has been ground tested in the U.S., EU, Japan, U.K., UAE and India with companies like Amazon, Walmart (Flipkart), Ikea and Zomato — its likely that its first customers will be smaller commercial operations.</p>
<p>Biliti&#8217;s pitch, regardless of the size of the customer, is to solve for last-mile delivery. A recent $400 million PIPE investment commitment from Luxembourg-based investor GEM Global Yield will provide some of the capital needed to hit its goal.</p>
<p>Getting goods that final mile is a challenge that plagues crowded cities around the world and significantly contributes to congestion, global warming and increased accidents. When a small package or item needs to make its way from the delivery hub to individual locations, it&#8217;s often loaded onto a smaller vehicle with a collection of other items going to the same area. That last mile can be both a logistical and environmental nightmare and companies like Amazon, FedEx and UPS all struggle with it, often opting to use the local U.S. Postal Service as a way to get goods to consumers and businesses.</p>
<p>Biliti&#8217;s vehicles could provide one answer. However, there are limitations. The vehicle can only reach speeds of about 25 miles per hour, which means they&#8217;ll need to stick to inner cities and away from parkways, divided highways and obviously interstates.</p>
<p>Gayam said the vehicles will be able to be registered in states like California by January.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The idea for Sono Motors, the company that wants to power every electric vehicle using solar power, started nine years ago in a Munich basement when two entrepreneurial 18-year-olds starting spitballing solutions to society&#8217;s dependence on fossil fuels. Jona Christians and Laurin Hahn, Sono Motors&#8217; co-founders, weren&#8217;t that into cars, but they recognized how much transportation contributes to the burning of fossil fuels and thought that would be a good place to start.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came up with a vision to integrate solar on every vehicle and thought, Okay, what do we need for that?&#8221; Hahn told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>They started on the construction of a solar electric vehicle pre-prototype to prove that renewable energies can help solve the transportation emissions problem, and by 2015, they had a working model. The following year, Christians and Hahn brought on creative director Navina Pernsteiner to co-found the business and establish Sono Motors as a company and brand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236195" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>On Wednesday, Sono Group, the parent company to Sono Motors, went public. It opened for trading on the Nasdaq at $20.06 after the IPO was initially priced at $15, but shares hit a high of $38.74 before the market closed.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s path to market is twofold. It has secured 16,000 preorders of the Sion, the company&#8217;s first solar electric vehicle, at an average down payment of $3,000. The compact, five-door, family-friendly hatchback, which will cost $28,700, should make it to consumers by the first half of 2023. Sono is also working with companies to integrate its solar technologies into other vehicles. At the start of this year, Sono announced that it would license its solar body panel technology to other companies and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/sono-motors-plans-to-license-the-tech-that-powers-its-solar-electric-car/">named electric autonomous shuttle company EasyMile</a> as its first customer.</p>
<h2>The Sion</h2>
<p>The Sion is expected to have a range of 190 miles using a 54 kwH lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery, supplied by China&#8217;s BYD, that is considered to be more sustainable because it doesn&#8217;t have manganese, nickel or cobalt — precious metals that have a high environmental and ethical impact. While the car can be charged via a wall box, Sono reckons the sun, which drip feeds energy into the battery whenever it&#8217;s shining, can handle most of your daily commute.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Germany, for example, the average commuting range is 10 miles per day,&#8221; Christians told TechCrunch. &#8220;And with our unique technology we can cover per week 112 kilometers (~70 miles) on average just by solar, and that covers a lot of the daily commute so you don&#8217;t have to recharge the car so often. We have four times more range in our car compared to other electric vehicles with the same battery size but without solar integration. And that&#8217;s why we see this technology [having] such a great potential to bring EVs [to] the masses.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The aluminum frame is covered in solar panels that are composed of over 248 integrated cells, according to the company, and the car will be equipped with <a href="https://sonomotors.com/en/press/press-releases/sono-motors-launches-bidirectional-wallbox/">onboard bidirectional charging</a>, which would allow a consumer to use energy stored in the battery to power their homes or other electronic devices via the wall box. This feature, along with ride-sharing and car-sharing, will be enabled by the Sono app, which also acts as a digital key.</p>
<p>Most of the preorders for the vehicle have come from Europe, where the market launch will take place. 90% of those orders come from Germany or &#8220;German-speaking countries&#8221; and the remaining 10% comes from countries like the Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy and Sweden, where the vehicles will be manufactured. Sono has partnered with National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS) to produce the vehicles in its former Saab factory. Christians says the factory should have capacity for 43,000 cars per year, with roughly 260,000 vehicles to be produced over seven years.</p>
<h2>&#8220;One base&#8221; vehicle platform</h2>
<p>Like many other automakers (GM, Arrival), Sono is developing a &#8220;one base&#8221; vehicle platform that it hopes to build future models on top of. The Sion is the first, but the company is also looking into producing a crossover passenger vehicle and a cargo van for last-mile delivery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We intend to use modular systems in the Sion, including the powertrain, chassis, thermal unit and certain electronics,&#8221; reads Sono&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840416/000110465921135375/tm212911-10_f1a.htm">filing</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &#8220;These modular systems can also be used for other car types without any, or only minor, modification.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Solar technology integration and licensing</h2>
<p>Sono&#8217;s solar technology has been engineered to enable both integration into other vehicles, as well as licensing for a range of vehicle architectures, like buses, trucks and last-mile vehicles. The company says it has already shipped pre-production samples to customers and has signed over 10 letters of intent and commercial contracts to explore strategic use cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;The transport and logistics industries in particular are very focused on total cost of ownership, where our solar integration can reduce running cost significantly,&#8221; reads the SEC filing. &#8220;We have several patents granted or within the filing process protecting our proprietary technology. Additionally, we have up to four years of advanced development ahead of who we believe to be our relevant competitors thanks to the patents, the testing of a large number of different polymer materials and the several relevant components for full solar integration, such as power electronics, especially the MCU.&#8221;</p>
<p>The MCU is Sono&#8217;s &#8220;maximum power point tracker central unit,&#8221; which the company says solves the issue of uneven sunlight exposure due to solar cells being mounted on different parts of the exterior.</p>
<p>Sono also thinks over half of the vehicles sold in 2030 will be suitable for solar retrofitting, including a third that are suitable for solar integration. Solar production prices have gone down and efficiency of solar cells has increased in recent years, which could have an impact on the ranges of EVs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Additionally, the steep increase in electric vehicle sales and the relatively slower increase in charging stations will create a bottleneck for the adoption of electric vehicles on a larger scale,&#8221; the company wrote in its filing. &#8220;We believe that even within the next few years, people living in apartments without private access to charging will be reluctant to buy electric vehicles due to uncertainty they will be able to find relevant charging options.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Can Sono deliver?</h2>
<p>Outsourcing production to NEVS is one of Sono&#8217;s self-described &#8220;key differentiators&#8221; in its strategy to produce the car efficiently and in a way that&#8217;s scalable. The others are doing only B2C sales, thus eliminating brick and mortar stores; no need for steel stamping because of the aluminum space frame; and no paint job because of the solar panels. But NEVS is a tricky one to rely on. The company is owned by the Chinese firm Evergrande, a company that has $88 billion in outstanding debt and is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/evergrande-china-crisis-11632330764">threatening a global financial crisis</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;NEVS has been our production partner since 2019 and we have been in close exchange ever since and currently remain so,&#8221; said Christians. &#8220;The production of the Sion is currently not affected by the restructuring. Facility preparations for pre-series production, planned in 2022, and Sion series production, planned for the first half of 2023, are running according to plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sono Motors is working on some backup plans, just in case. Plan A is still to manufacture the Sion at NEVS, but the company is exploring alternative scenarios and options, including the use of available capacities of other European contract manufacturers, according to Christians.</p>
<p>That said, <a href="http://motorauthority.com/news/1133902_sweden-s-nevs-seeks-new-owner-in-light-of-parent-company-evergrande-s-financial-woes">NEVS is looking for a new owner,</a> so maybe it&#8217;ll be alright for Sono in the end, but the startup probably can&#8217;t afford production delays. In 2018, Sono had 7,000 preorders that were meant to make it to customers by 2019. Those orders were postponed until 2021. If Sono doesn&#8217;t start delivering and scaling soon, it&#8217;ll face more than just reputation issues.</p>
<p>At $3,000 per preorder, Sono has about $48 million in the bank. But that alone won&#8217;t be able to get the Sion to production, and Sono is already hurting for cash. During the first half of the year, the company lost about $29 million, according to the SEC filing, with net losses resulting in an accumulated deficit of $123 million. The company said it would &#8220;continue to incur losses and depend on external financing in the foreseeable future at least until we commence material deliveries of the Sion and the time when we significantly scale our operations, including the monetization of our solar technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luckily, this IPO gave the company a nice cushion to get its Sion to production. The company raised $150 million by going public, money that will be used to develop the Sion with a focus on the next prototype generation made from serial components, according to the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoom is great and all, but talking to a lot of two-dimensional humans on computer screens is hardly the future we were all dreaming of. <a href="https://www.portlhologram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PORTL</a> agrees, and under the catchy slogan &#8220;if you can&#8217;t be there, beam there,&#8221; has carved out a new slice of the market, where you can holographically teleport your image to anywhere in the world. The company just announced that it teleported a 220-foot stack of $20 bills from a number of investors&#8217; bank accounts to its own. <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2812000000%2F20%29+dollar+bills+thickness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yes, $12 million dollars in $20 dollar bills is around 220 feet tall</a>. We can only presume that the participants in the investment round &#8212; led by <a href="https://truecapitalmgmt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">True Capital</a> &#8212; chose to wire the money instead of showing up with a steamer trunk worth of cash.</p>
<p>“CEOs, brands, universities, as well as crypto artists, are all using PORTL to connect and communicate in entirely new ways. PORTL is going to change the way we work, learn and play forever,” said David Nussbaum, founder, inventor and CEO of PORTL. &#8220;We’re very lucky to have investors who see the vision as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>PORTL currently employs a team of around 40, half of whom are on the engineering side. The company has sold around 100 full-size PORTLs (called the Epic), and has a number it is renting out for more ad hoc installations and campaigns, as well. In addition, the company is about to release its PORTL Mini, which is a much smaller device designed for desktop use. To date, the product has found itself a diverse set of use cases for its full, human-size volumetric 4K resolution holographic projection product. PORTLs can be found in more than 20 countries around the world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236639" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Right now, it&#8217;s being used by educators. We&#8217;re in the University of Central Florida, so educators can train future healthcare providers how to treat and diagnose patients remotely. It&#8217;s also being used in sports stadiums so athletes can come and talk to the fans. And it is being used as a communications tool by lots of companies right now,&#8221; explains Nussbaum. &#8220;Several of the world&#8217;s largest retailers have purchased PORTLs for pilot programs. Imagine walking into a store, and walking up to a PORTL. There&#8217;s no mannequin, but instead you can choose any article of clothing in the store, shown on a virtual mannequin with your body size and shape. We are also used as virtual assistants, corporate communications and much more. In entertainment, we are finding success with our rentals. We have Netflix, HBO, etc. &#8212; they hire us to put a PORTL inside of their booth at a tradeshow to draw a crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236698" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nov21-09.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236698" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2236698" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nov21-09.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nov21-09.jpg 5445w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nov21-09.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nov21-09.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nov21-09.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nov21-09.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nov21-09.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nov21-09.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nov21-09.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2236698" class="wp-caption-text">Quavo and Marshawn Lynch in PORTL Epics, with David Nussbaum, PORTL&#8217;s CEO and founder, in the foreground. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> PORTL</p></div></p>
<p>In the year since the seed round, PORTL collected a slew of rewards and accolades. Reuters named PORTL the No. 1 innovation at Mobile World Congress 2021 Barcelona, and more recently, the company was shortlisted for three of the CES Innovation Awards for 2022. With the fresh $12 million injection of cash, the company is eager to start growing more aggressively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing Tim Draper on for our seed round was a huge win &#8212; he is a legend in the &#8216;getting things right&#8217; space. He has a very high winning percentage, and when he said &#8216;you&#8217;re the next one,&#8217; it unlocked a lot of things for us. Getting Tim made it a lot easier to get everybody else, because he&#8217;s such a master,&#8221; said Nussbaum. &#8220;Tim Draper came back for our Series A, which further helped galvanize the round. True Capital came in at the tail end of the previous round. For our Series A, they came back and led the round.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The fundraising sets the company up for the next part of its growth. PORTL&#8217;s CEO has some grand plans for what happens next, which he shared when I challenged him to imagine a world 10 years from now, where everything goes to plan for the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be a PORTL Mini in every home. There will be a PORTL Epic &#8212; the large-sized one &#8212; in every conference room. I believe PORTL is not just a communications platform, this is a broadcast channel. I believe in 10 years there will be a future where we&#8217;re changing the way people broadcast, communicate and, yes, even travel. I think there&#8217;s going to be one in every train station and airport and retail location, on every coffee table and every medical center, every school and conference room,&#8221; Nussbaum shares his vision. &#8220;We&#8217;re designing hardware, but we are really a software and technology company that uses the hardware as a way of receiving. And because of our Series A and future rounds, we&#8217;ll be able to put this money invested into the technology and push the boundaries of what is possible. The stuff you saw in Star Trek will be here  a lot sooner than we all believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>As with most companies raising a round of finance, the company is going on a hiring spree, both on the engineering and the sales/operations side of the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was about a year ago when a business partner told me I needed to fly to LA to see PORTL&#8217;s technology right now. So, I did, and I knew I was staring into the future. I kept going down to LA for PORTL demos, and each time, I would bring someone new with me to see it. Dante Exum was first to see it, and then RGIII. I then introduced it to Quavo and he called me the next day and said &#8216;I want to drop our next album by being live in different cities, and at the same time.&#8217; PORTL made that happen. I knew the way we communicate and consume content was going to change forever,&#8221; said True Capital Management co-founder and CEO Doug Raetz. &#8220;Our clients love technology &#8212; and especially technology that they believe in and would use personally. I thought they would all get excited about this, and indeed they all did. Once I learned about the incredible team behind PORTL, and the vision to scale the business, I was all in.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the early 2000s, most business-critical software was hosted on privately run data centers. But with time, enterprises overcame their skepticism and moved critical applications to the cloud.</p>
<p>DevOps fueled this shift to the cloud, as it gave decision-makers a sense of control over business-critical applications hosted outside their own data centers.</p>
<p>Today, enterprises are in a similar phase of trying out and accepting machine learning (ML) in their production environments, and one of the accelerating factors behind this change is MLOps.</p>
<p>Similar to cloud-native startups, many startups today are ML native and offer differentiated products to their customers. But a vast majority of large and midsize enterprises are either only now just trying out ML applications or just struggling to bring functioning models to production.</p>
<p>Here are some key challenges that MLOps can help with:</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s hard to get cross-team ML collaboration to work</h2>
<p>An ML model may be as simple as one that predicts churn, or as complex as the one determining Uber or Lyft pricing between San Jose and San Francisco. Creating a model and enabling teams to benefit from it is an incredibly complex endeavor.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The MLOps space is in its early days today, but it has massive potential because it allows organizations to bring AI to production environments in a fraction of the time it takes today.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In addition to requiring a large amount of labeled historic data to train these models, multiple teams need to coordinate to continuously monitor the models for performance degradation.</p>
<p>There are three core roles involved in ML modeling, but each one has different motivations and incentives:</p>
<p><strong>Data engineers:</strong> Trained engineers excel at gleaning data from multiple sources, cleaning it and storing it in the right formats so that analysis can be performed. Data engineers play with tools like ETL/ELT, data warehouses and data lakes, and are well versed in handling static and streaming data sets. A high-level data pipeline created by a data engineer might look like this:</p>

<p><strong>Data scientists:</strong> <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">These are the experts who can run complex regressions in their sleep. Using common tools like the Python language, Jupyter Notebooks and Tensorflow, data scientists take the data provided by data engineers and analyze it, which results in a highly accurate model. Data scientists love trying different algorithms and comparing these models for accuracy, but after that someone needs to do the work to bring the models to production.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Short-form video apps have seen major successes, like TikTok, as well as dramatic failures, like Quibi. Now, a new app called <a href="https://www.marmelapp.com/snax?shortlink=presslaunch&amp;pid=Press&amp;c=Launch">Snax</a> wants to offer a twist on the popular vertical video format by giving users a way to not just watch mini-movies on their mobile devices but also interact with them. The subscription streaming service in Snax includes a growing catalog of original movies that combine traditional storytelling elements with interactive gaming. Users may be asked to solve a puzzle to help move the story forward, look for clues in a murder mystery scene, make a choice for the characters in a &#8220;Choose Your Own Adventure&#8221;-type mode, engage with 360-degree video elements and more.</p>
<p>The idea for this new type of interactive movie experience comes from the Paris-based app developers at <a href="https://www.notion.so/marmelapp/Mission-Culture-98e927d4192c4008856ac951690aba6a">Marmelapp</a>, co-founded by Alan Keiss, Stéphane Fort and Jérôme Boé. To date, the company has launched 15 apps totaling over 30 million downloads and generates double-digit millions (in euros) per year across its apps.</p>
<p>Marmelapp&#8217;s more recent titles include the party game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picolo-party-game/id1001473964">Picolo</a> and the text-based &#8220;Choose Your Own Adventure&#8221;-style app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blaze-make-your-own-choices/id1454233880">Blaze</a>. The latter actually served as the starting point for Snax, we&#8217;re told.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We really enjoyed [Blaze] and got some great feedback. We developed and published 75 original stories on there,&#8221; explains Snax&#8217;s Head of Content James Davies. &#8220;That was actually quite a lot content because, with all the branching paths, we had multiple endings,&#8221; he notes. The team later realized that Blaze could be a lot more fun if it included more than just text &#8212; like mini-films to go along with its stories. They initially thought to try to incorporate that concept into Blaze, but it became too complicated.</p>
<p>&#8220;It became pretty clear to us that it needed to be a separate project,&#8221; Davies says. That&#8217;s how, around 18 months ago, Snax began its development.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236650" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236650" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2236650" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236650" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snax</p></div></p>
<p>Today, the app features a collection of bite-sized movies (hence the name &#8220;Snax&#8221;) that are meant to be watched as vertical videos. Each episode lasts about three to five minutes long and includes stopping points where the user is meant to engage with the content in some way. They may need to solve a puzzle or a brain teaser. They may need to make a choice or find a hidden item in the room. They may need to text with a character. And so on. (Don&#8217;t worry, if you&#8217;re stumped, there is a &#8220;hint&#8221; option.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Users will sometimes do more than just tap on a choice. For example, in one murder mystery movie, you&#8217;re presented with a text box where you write in your answer, freeform. To make this feature work, Snax developed a database of possible answers and their potential misspellings so it would be able to determine when the user got it right.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236652" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236652" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2236652" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236652" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snax</p></div></p>
<p>The movies themselves are also higher-production quality than you might expect from an entertainment app like this.</p>
<p>Snax explains its seven-person team handles script development and adding the interactive features but works with professional filmmakers and partnered production companies to create the video content. Currently, these shoots cost in the ballpark of $100,000 euros per project, but Snax is working to streamline production costs by filming more series back-to-back with the same team on different scripts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236648" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236648" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2236648" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236648" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snax</p></div></p>
<p>The filmmakers don&#8217;t share in the subsequent subscription revenue the app generates but are paid upfront. At launch, Snax is charging $4.99/week, $8.49/mo or $47.99/year for its subscription service. (You can watch a couple of episodes for free to try it out, though).</p>
<p>The company began by offering Snax in France earlier this year but just introduced the app to English-speaking audiences in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia in October. For now, the app features French movies that are dubbed in English, but the long-term strategy is to now start producing content in the English language as well as Spanish.</p>
<p>Since its launch, about half of the Snax user base is now in an English-language market and the team expects this to rise to as much as 90% in the near future.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236658" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236658" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2236658 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236658" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snax</p></div></p>
<p>Snax users tend to be young, in the 18- to 24-year-old age demographic and evenly split between male and female. So far, Snax has found that U.S. users, in particular, seem to be more engaged with talking about and sharing the app, and with the app&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>&#8220;We noticed that American men and women are a lot more engaged in the content than French users &#8212; the uptake of people completing episodes or completing stories … is considerably higher than it has been in France,&#8221; says Davies. &#8220;That means we need to be producing things for a North American audience.</p>
<p>While some of its earlier movies were with unknown actors, Snax is now ramping up production with higher-profile stars in France, including France&#8217;s third-largest YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NormanFaitDesVideos">Norman</a>, actor and comedian <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ludovik">Ludovik</a> and actor Bastien Ughetto. It plans to do more of this as it expands in the U.S.</p>
<p>Snax is now working on adding more variety to its interactions to make them more exciting and more involved. It&#8217;s also further developing its own internal software used for formatting its scripts.</p>
<p>Marmelapp plans to spin out Snax as its own company in 2022 and may consider fundraising at that time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse announced yesterday that closed captioning is now rolling out for iOS. This essential accessibility feature has been long missed from the live audio app. Without these live transcriptions, which were already the norm for competitors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-spaces-will-be-available-for-web-including-accessibility-features/">Twitter Spaces</a>, Clubhouse had rendered itself unusable to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Now, Clubhouse can reach a broader audience.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">closed captioning is here for iOS! update your app now to see it in action in live rooms.</p>
<p>here&#39;s a lil&#39; example, in case you need convincing&#8230; <a href="https://t.co/v2poAjE2Pl">pic.twitter.com/v2poAjE2Pl</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236613" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Clubhouse (@Clubhouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse/status/1461117758624600071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;We currently support 13 languages for captions, with more on the way. These 13 languages include: English, Cantonese, Mandarin Chinese, Yue Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, Turkish,&#8221; a Clubhouse representative told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>One user <a href="https://twitter.com/PamFR/status/1461158253866323968">reported on Twitter</a> that Spanish live captioning worked in one room, but in another, the Spanish speech was transcribed as English gibberish. An engineer at Clubhouse <a href="https://twitter.com/juberti/status/1461193729918713860">replied</a> that this means the language detection might not have worked, so it seems that the app is still learning how to distinguish among non-English languages in beta.</p>
<p>Clubhouse has rolled out a number of features recently like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/clubhouse-announces-wave-making-it-easier-to-start-casual-private-rooms/">Wave</a>, which makes it easier to start a conversation with a friend, replays for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/">asynchronous</a> listening and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/clubhouse-record-room-replay/">recorded rooms</a>. Recorded rooms help the app compete with startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/callin-david-sacks-social-podcasting-app-launches-and-announces-a-12m-series-a-round/">Callin</a> and <a href="https://spacepod.studio/">Space Pod</a>, which seek to help creators turn live audio recordings into widely distributed podcasts. But live captioning has been a glaring omission since the app&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/">initial bout</a> of popularity. Clubhouse doesn&#8217;t have an estimate of when closed captioning will roll out on Android, but hopefully it won&#8217;t be long.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

New <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-appoints-kevin-lynch-car-division-223033138.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">project leader Kevin Lynch</a> wants the very first model to drive itself, the insiders said.</p>
<p>The company is reportedly speeding up its plans to match. Where Apple had recently targeted a launch in five to seven years, the sources said it was now aiming for 2025, or just four years. The plan is believed to be &#8220;fluid,&#8221; however, and revolves around Apple completing its full autonomous system on time. Apple supposedly finished much of the &#8220;core work&#8221; on the car&#8217;s processor.</p>
<p>Tipsters also suggested Apple had an &#8220;ideal&#8221; interior in mind with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-ioniq-seven-concept-self-driving-ev-213020775.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">lounge-like seating</a> for passengers, a touchscreen infotainment system in the middle and no steering wheel or pedals. An emergency takeover mode has been under discussion, the sources added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236677" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple declined to comment. The new priority could help a project that has seen its share of setbacks, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-hires-doug-field-204511159.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">departing executives</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-and-kia-are-no-longer-talking-to-apple-about-an-autonomous-ev-083235132.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">skittish partners</a>. The company could match or beat incumbent car manufacturers planning to offer full or near-full autonomy around the same time, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-id-buzz-robotaxi-2025-121050899.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1">such as VW</a>. However, full self-driving has many challenges, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-self-driving-cars-new-york-city-130044539.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1">difficult-to-predict traffic</a> and weather problems like snow. It wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if Apple had to delay the car, or at least ask drivers to take over in certain conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To software developers, the process of creating a hardware product can seem distinctly 1980s. Even in the most high-tech of work flows, there are tons of error-prone and potentially expensive manual, steps including spreadsheets, confusion and a general feeling of the will to live sagging away through the musty, solder-stained floorboards of the hardware development shop. Along comes <a href="https://www.durolabs.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duro</a> and the $4 million the company just raised, in an attempt to bring some agile methodology sanity to a <em>final-bill-of-materials.top-assembly.final.final.final.final.no-really-final-this-time.xls</em> world.</p>
<p>Duro&#8217;s fundraising round was led by <a href="https://www.bonfirevc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B2B SaaS investors Bonfire Ventures</a>, with follow-on money from <a href="https://riot.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hard-tech investors Riot Ventures</a>. The new funding will be used to expand sales and marketing teams and to further develop Duro’s product lifecycle management (PLM) solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a former electrical engineer. For 20 years I designed and manufactured products &#8212; IoT, Drones, telecom equipment, wearables, cleantech, you name it. I got frustrated with how much of my time was being spent managing the most fundamental elements of hardware development: CAD files, your bill of materials and your supply chain data,&#8221; explains Duro&#8217;s CEO Michael Corr. &#8220;There&#8217;s a product category called Product Lifecycle Management &#8212; or PLM &#8212; which is meant to be a receptacle for that information for centralizing and managing it. It includes revision control, and you use it with your own teams, as well as sharing it with your contract manufacturers. And yet none of the tools I used were actually saving time or actually providing value at the end of the day. It&#8217;s all done so manually and is so process-driven that it was often easier to just use spreadsheets. That&#8217;s still the prevalent technology today, because the established tools are just so damn complicated and prone to error, and they&#8217;re not actually providing value.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236260" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With an axe to grind against the status quo, co-founders Michael Corr and Kellan O’Connor developed Duro as a cloud platform to centralize all product data and remove the friction of connecting disparate teams and tools. The goal is transparency and giving everyone from the product teams, the engineering teams and the suppliers and manufacturing teams access to the most accurate and most recent data at all times.</p>
<p>&#8220;To simplify things a little, the hardware industry is dominated by a bimodal culture. You have the older generation that came into the workforce in the 80s and 90s, who established these toolsets that we have today. Meanwhile, there is a gap &#8212; young engineers were more interested in learning web, mobile and app development, as it was so much more in vogue. There wasn&#8217;t a continuation of young engineers entering the hardware space,&#8221; Corr outlines the market landscape where Duro is staking out its territory. &#8220;But now they&#8217;re coming back. Hardware has proven itself to be a sexy product. IoT happened, and the cost of developing hardware came down drastically. Now what we are seeing is a wave of a younger generation of engineers that&#8217;s entering the workforce. They are the ones that Duro is going after. They are used to the culture from software development, and they have different standards for the software they use.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, where SaaS, GitHub and dev/ops processes completely changed how software is delivered on an ongoing basis, Duro wants to take similar mechanics and invite the hardware folks to join the current millennium.</p>
<p>&#8220;GitHub did an excellent job of proving that it can be done. You can have a single cloud-hosted source of your source code control, and then you build an ecosystem of tools and people and tasks around it. And everyone&#8217;s always pointing to GitHub. In the hardware industry, traditionally, that hasn&#8217;t been the case. You have multiple teams, doing their disparate responsibilities: electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, procurement, manufacturing, etc. Because there hasn&#8217;t been a concept of centralizing it, everybody has their own copy of the data,&#8221; explains Corr. &#8220;Everybody has their own separate copy of the bill materials, for example, and that creates a problem. It creates this additional necessity of overhead to manage all those communication channels and making sure that everybody has the latest copy.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’re incredibly excited to partner with Duro, which is bringing a fresh solution to a big market dominated by old companies. When a startup like Duro lowers the barrier to entry for a whole new set of users, it positions them to get the lion’s share of that new addressable market,&#8221; said Jim Andelman, co-founder and managing director at Bonfire Ventures. &#8220;Customer affinity for Duro’s platform is off the charts: it’s clear to us that this is the PLM solution of choice for engineering-driven businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the product itself, the company is innovating on its business model, taking a leaf out of the SaaS playbook.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of friction in software sales for hardware in the past. Very expensive applications, driven by user-license business models. And there are rarely trials available &#8212; if you want to use it, you just have to pay for and just accept what you get. So Duro innovates a little bit there too. We have three subscription packages. The starter package allows companies who know that spreadsheets are not a good solution and want to get into properly managed data, centralized and controlled environments. The Pro version works right out of the box, without the complex configuration and setup needed by other products. It&#8217;s designed for teams who are at the cusp of doing its first round of production, and want to do proper revision control interface with their suppliers,&#8221; explains Corr. &#8220;Our enterprise package is more the expansive package for teams that have outgrown those lower two tiers, or that are just more established and they have existing workflows.</p>
<p>The starter package is $450 a month or $5,400 a year. The Pro package weighs in at $750 per month or around $9,000 per year. The enterprise package is a little bit more open ended, depending on the needs of the customer. The Duro team told me that they have contracts ranging from $25,000 to $100,000, depending on how the software is configured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given our extensive experience investing in full-stack businesses, we know that issues surrounding data continuity are synonymous with hardware manufacturing and weigh heavily on the industry,&#8221; said Will Coffield, co-founder and general partner at Riot Ventures. &#8220;We love Duro’s approach to modernizing hardware design/development, using automation to replace manual processes and connect teams to information for intelligent and efficient collaboration.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Belkin has a new 3-in-1 wireless charger that&#8217;s tailor-made for iPhone and Apple Watch owners, and that also provides MagSafe 15W charging speeds for iPhone 12 and 13, along with fast charging for the latest Apple Watch 7 series. Belkin also introduce a new standalone portable fast charger for Apple Watch that includes an integrated USB-C cable and also offers fast charge compatibility for Series 7 models.</p>
<p>The Belkin &#8220;<a href="https://www.belkin.com/us/p/p-wiz016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BOOST↑CHARGE PRO 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad</a>,&#8221; which is too much of a mouthful and will henceforth be referred to as the 3-in-1 charger, has a MagSafe 15W wireless charger for your iPhone, as mentioned. It also includes a standard Qi-compatible wireless charging pad that you can use to power up your AirPods, and there&#8217;s an adjustable Apple Watch charging puck that supports fast charging, as mentioned above. The adjustability of the Watch puck is a nice touch, giving you freedom to charge either lying flat or upright in Apple Watch&#8217;s &#8220;nightstand mode,&#8221; and there&#8217;s a clever switch underneath that allows you to tweak the height of the stand to perfectly fit Apple Watch models new and old, as well as a side variety of Apple Watch cases if that&#8217;s your thing.</p>
<p>The stand is covered in a rubberized silicone so you don&#8217;t need to worry about inadvertently scratching any of your gadgets as you fumble in the night, and it&#8217;s all powered by just a single cord that plugs into an included 40W power adapter. I&#8217;ve been using this for about a week now, and can confidently say it&#8217;s the best option out there for a one-cord, max speed bedside charging solution for Apple fans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236583" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s $149.95, sold via both Belkin&#8217;s own website and Apple&#8217;s, and goes on sale starting today.</p>
<p>The Belkin &#8220;<a href="https://www.belkin.com/us/p/p-wiz015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BOOST↑CHARGE PRO Portable Fast Charger</a>&#8221; (again, terrible, so let&#8217;s just call it the Watch charger) is an awesome alternative to Apple&#8217;s own little standalone pillow charger for Apple Watch. Thanks to the integrated cable it&#8217;s super portable for travel, and again features adjustability to fit various Watch models and cases, as well as offering both flat and upright nightstand charging. Plus, you get the fast charging feature if you have a Series 7. Definitely the charger to beat when it comes to dedicated Apple Watch kit.</p>
<p>The Watch charger is just $59.95, which is a steal relative to Apple&#8217;s own dedicated magnetic charging dock, and also is available to order starting today at both Belkin.com and Apple.com</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An electric vehicle is, essentially, just &#8220;software on wheels&#8221;, and requires lots of moving parts, not physical but, of course, virtual. That software needs to continually optimize the performance, efficiency and safety of the EV it’s running. But a problem has arisen: Not enough auto-makers unpack their software for others to help improve it. So, the more this embedded automotive software is de-coupled from the underlying electronic hardware, the more this optimization can take place, and the more efficient vehicles can become. That has important implications for things like battery range and performance overall.</p>
<p>This is part of the reason why U.K.-based <a href="https://eatron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eatron</a>, which makes this &#8220;intelligent automotive software&#8221;, has managed to attract an $11 million Series A funding round led by the U.K.&#8217;s MMC Ventures.</p>
<p>Also participating was Aster Capital and Vietnamese Carmaker VinFast. Eatron has previously collaborated with VinFast on its range of electric cars. The startup also has a strategic partnership with the Hirschvogel Group from German, which invested $1.5 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236589" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s technology enables OEMs and Tier-1s to de-couple automotive software from its hardware for the purposes of battery management, intelligent motion control and advanced driver assistance. This has the effect of increasing supplier choice for OEMs and reducing cost, risks and time to market, says the company.</p>
<p>Part of the Series A funding will be used to expand the platform with additional partnerships for third-party software modules and semiconductor and hardware component suppliers. It will also grow its sales teams in Germany, India and USA.</p>
<p>Dr Umut Genc, co-founder and CEO at Eatron, said: “Mobility and automotive in particular, is in the middle of a dramatic transformation and as part of this change needs to become a software-driven industry. An intelligent automotive software platform, embedded at the edge and connected to the cloud, will play a critical role in this transformation.”</p>
<p>Mina Samaan, investor at MMC Ventures, said: “We have seen many software businesses building interesting algorithmic concepts to support OEMs, but none have had the expertise to meet the regulatory, security and safety requirements for automotive production. Eatron is the exception. Its software has been built from the ground up to be automotive grade and has the potential to drive the battery and autonomy features in hundreds of thousands of vehicles in the coming years.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
