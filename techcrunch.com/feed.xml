										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London and Barcelona based audio-as-a-service SaaS startup <a href="https://www.aflorithmic.ai">Aflorithmic</a> has scooped up $1.3 million in seed funding from <a href="https://crowdmedia.com">Crowd Media Holdings</a>, an Australia-based company focused on influencer-based &#8216;social commerce&#8217; and marketing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taking a 10% stake in Aflorithmic, per a <a href="https://www.thesentiment.com.au/crowd-media-adds-voice-cloning-for-immersive-celebrity-experiences-in-ai-deal/">press release</a>, where it says the strategic investment is aimed at enabling it to offer FaceTime conversations with celebrities through &#8220;best-in-class voice cloning technology&#8221;.</p>
<p>Two year old Aflorithmic may not have chosen a name that trips off the tongue but it&#8217;s all about speech and audio. It&#8217;s built a platform that offers fully automated, scalable audio production by using AI-driven synthetic media, (&#8220;ethical&#8221;) voice cloning, and audio mastering &#8212; which can be delivered to people&#8217;s ears via websites, mobile apps, smart speakers and so on via its APIs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Text in beautiful audio out&#8221; is its pithy slogan.</p>
<p>Sample clips on its website illustrate the personalization element with synthesized (robot-voiced) voice overs greeting a named customer before plunging into the detail of whatever content it&#8217;s been programmed to deliver.</p>
<p>Some of Aflorithmic&#8217;s current customers are using its tools to create audio books for kids, for personalized narration of wellness/nutrition programs and even a robot butler concierge service for hotel guests, to name a few. Its business thesis is that demand for audio far outstrips the ability of studio-produced human-spoken voiceovers to deliver.</p>
<p>Hence it reckons synthesized media will be needed to plug the demand gap &#8212; serving up infinite permutations of a voice track, each one personalized to a particular customer of the brand or enterprise.</p>
<p>At the same time, the popularity of podcasts and live-voice streaming shows no sign of abating &#8212; speaking to the staying power of audio in a video-heavy era.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elon Musk busts Clubhouse limit, fans stream to YouTube, he switches to interviewing Robinhood CEO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/embed/#?secret=jhNVJIMwVh" data-secret="jhNVJIMwVh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Aflorithmic&#8217;s new investor, Crowd Media Holdings, has rather more ambitious designs on what its tools can help it do &#8212; and talks about &#8216;completely reshaping the way consumers engage in ecommerce&#8217;.</p>
<p>The specific driver for its investment in Aflorithmic (aka ALFR) is a plan to blend synthesized voice with video to let fans engage in &#8220;immersive&#8221; video chats with simulated versions of their favorite celebrities.</p>
<p>Taking a stake in the audio startup to partner on that project helps it de-risk that plan, it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;ALFR brings the audio tech that will replicate a celebrity’s accent, tone and mannerisms as if the celebrity were on the other end of a call,&#8221; Crowd Media writes, noting that &#8220;the actual content&#8221; the (future) cloned celebrity will sweetly whisper to your face will be &#8220;driven by&#8221; its own AI-driven chatbot technology &#8212; based on drawing on a knowledge base of answers built up from responding to more than 180M user-submitted questions (&#8220;via text-only mediums&#8221;).</p>
<p>Turning all that text into soothing synthesized voice is where Aflorithmic comes in. While the video piece of the cloned celebrity plan entails 3D imaging &#8212; with the tech for that being provided by three other synthetic media firms (UK-based Forever Holdings, digital human makers Zoe01 and Uneeq).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deepfake video app Reface is just getting started on shapeshifting selfie culture&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/deepfake-video-app-reface-is-just-getting-started-on-shapeshifting-selfie-culture/embed/#?secret=0AmOZcikmY" data-secret="0AmOZcikmY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>More broadly, Crowd Media says it will be integrating Aflorithmic’s technology into other of its social commerce applications, including its AI-driven chatbot (CM8) &#8212; which is targeted at customer service use cases across sectors like marketing, education, and health sectors.</p>
<p>For its part, Aflorithmic says it will be using the new funding for R&amp;D for its API audio-production engine, voice cloning, and talent acquisition.</p>
<p>It offers its API-based audio-as-a-service to a range of customers &#8212; noting use-cases such as &#8220;hyper-personalized newsletters and podcasts&#8221; and voice cloning for marketing applications.</p>
<p>It also touts a &#8220;vast&#8221; voice library for customers to choose a robot speaker. But it also lets them record a snippet of their own voice to create personalized audio content through its voice cloning AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;Users can compose professional-quality pieces including music and complex audio engineering, then deliver the final product to any device or platform such as websites, mobile apps, or smart speakers &#8212; all without any previous production experience,&#8221; it writes.</p>
<p>Commenting on the funding in a statement, Timo Kunz, co-founder, and CEO at Aflorithmic, said: “We are excited to learn from Crowd’s experience in empowering companies to reach mass markets, and are pleased to accompany them as they define the future of social commerce. We believe audio creation as we know it is making way for automated, scalable, dynamic audio experiences &#8212; and companies like ours are at the forefront.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Synthetic audio production has a seemingly endless range of functions &#8212; the potential within marketing applications alone is mindblowing,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Imagine Kim Kardashian being a personal shopper for each of her 200M followers, or Lewis Hamilton explaining why YOU personally need the new Pirelli P Zero Rosso. All of this is just around the corner with our tech.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alforithmic&#8217;s other two co-founders are Peadar Coyle and Björn Ühss.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s claim of &#8220;ethical&#8221; voice cloning points to the challenges inherent for all companies working on  commercial tools to power the production of synthesized media.</p>
<p>While a cloned celebrity might just sound like a bit of fun, there is huge potential for misuse and abuse via individual voice cloning &#8212; from phishing scams and identity theft to emotional manipulation and blackmail.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.aflorithmic.ai/company#ethics">ethics section</a> of its website Alforithmic offers a brief nod to the risks in &#8220;making personalized audio scalable&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;With great innovation comes great responsibility,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;We are committed to ethical, fair, transparent AI following the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-artificial-intelligence-ethics-and-safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK</a>´s and <a href="https://ai.bsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AIHLEG_EthicsGuidelinesforTrustworthyAI-ENpdf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Union’s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence</a>. All our work and voice models and algorithms are only trained on and with the full compliance and approval of the individual data owner.&#8221; (We&#8217;ve asked for more details on how it prevents misuse of the voice cloning tech.)</p>
<p>On the competitive front, the startup points to Descript, which raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/descript-raises-30m-to-build-the-next-generation-of-video-and-audio-editing-tools/">$30M round just last month </a>&#8212; and acquired another voice cloning startup, Lyrebird, back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/descript-audio/">2019</a> &#8212; although its tools cover both video and audio vs Alforithmic being more fully focused on automating the entire audio production process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most Indians <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/slice-raises-6m-to-help-young-indians-pay-digitally-and-build-credit-score/">can&#8217;t access credit from formal financial institutions</a> because they don&#8217;t have a credit score of any form to prove their creditworthiness.</p>
<p>As an alternative, they look at informal institutions such as pawn shops or more recently, apps that offer loans without any paperwork but could <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-loan-apps-india-deaths">charge interest rates as high as 1,000%</a> and threaten anyone in your phone&#8217;s contact list in case of delays in repayment.</p>
<p>(Google caught wind of this recently, and last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/google-cracks-down-on-personal-loan-apps-in-india-following-abuse-and-outcry/">removed hundreds of such apps from the Play Store in India</a>. But it wasn’t until several people committed suicide in the country in an attempt to save themselves from embarrassment from family, colleagues and society.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Then there&#8217;s gold.</p>
<p>For generations, Indians across the socio-economic spectrum have preferred to stash their savings &#8212; or at least a part of it &#8212; in the form of gold. In fact, such is the demand for gold in India &#8212; Indians stockpile more gold than citizens in any other country &#8212; that the South Asian nation is also the world’s third-largest importer of this precious metal.</p>
<p>They use this gold not only as a saving instrument, which protects them from the ups-and-downs of the financial market, but also as an asset against which they could get credit. However, selling off your gold in the form of jewellery or otherwise, has a stigma attached to it &#8212; one is so broke that they had to pawn off their last asset of financial security.</p>
<p>Keeping this gold locked in homes &#8212; according to estimates by the World Gold Council, Indians have stashed <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53590846">25,000 tons of gold</a>, whose value today is over $1.4 trillion &#8212; is also dragging the economy. Monetizing even a third of it can add 2% to the GDP growth rate, analysts say. Banks and other financial institutions love gold as it&#8217;s a great secure asset whose value has only grown over the decades.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/deepakabbot">Deepak Abbot</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nitinmisra">Nitin Misra</a>, two former executives of Paytm, India’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">most valuable startup</a>, believe that this problem can be solved by digitally transforming lending against gold.</p>
<p>New Delhi has made several efforts, too, to get stashed gold back in circulation through initiatives such as the <a href="https://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=110">gold monetization scheme</a>, but it hasn&#8217;t had much success with it so far.</p>
<p>The core challenge with convincing people to part ways with their gold is that it&#8217;s an emotional asset, said Misra and Abbot in an interview with TechCrunch. Gold jewellery is a show of strength and pride in India, and families pass on their reserve to future generations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Irrespective of your state, religion, community, in India, gold has a certain auspicious sentiment attached to it. You worship it. Even when tax concession and premium price is offered to someone, they can&#8217;t fathom the idea of their necklaces and other jewellery being melted and going away,&#8221; said Misra.</p>
<p>The other challenge is that even when someone absolutely needs to sell their gold, which is often their last resort, to attend a family emergency or other urgent and unavoidable cause, the process of selling it is an awkward and embarrassing experience for many because of the stigma of pawning their family&#8217;s precious property.</p>
<p>In recent years, a handful of firms and startups &#8212; in collaboration with banks &#8212; have attempted to remove this stigma by visiting the customer at their doorstep to some success.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2108697" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="641" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Abbot and Misra, pictured above, think they have a better approach and broader idea.</p>
<p>Many people in India keep their gold stash and other precious items in a safe locker at a bank that can charge as high as $65 a month for this service. (Banks require customers to pay the fee annually, however.) There are some downsides to using a bank&#8217;s locker: Accessing this locker is a long-process and can easily take half of your day, if not more. There&#8217;s also no insurance protection on items people keep in the locker. Customers are also required to put up a security deposit of a few hundred dollars to avail this service &#8212; and, there is also a long-waiting period before people can even avail this service.</p>
<p>Through their newfound startup <a href="https://indiagold.co/">indiagold</a>, Abbot and Misra are offering customers a similar locker service for as little as $1.36 a month, which also includes full insurance coverage. The idea, the duo explained, is to make it easier and convenient for people to secure their previous metal reserve.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sign up on indiagold app, our agents come to your house, inspect and weigh the gold, and put it in a tamper proof bag. We also attach an RFID sticker to the bag, which once scanned, can detect if there was any attempt to open it. They then put the bag inside a steel box, which is locked by the customer with their fingerprint. And all of this is being captured through a body camera by one of our agents, which is streaming the feed in real-time to the customer as they leave the premise to the designated vault location,&#8221; said Misra.</p>
<p>With crime rates going up, very few people bark at the idea of securing their jewelries and especially when they know that their property is being insured, the duo said. Once they have deposited their gold stash with indiagold, the startup displays the real-time value of their property and offers a line of credit that could be accessed within seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine if the customer doesn&#8217;t want a loan, but should they ever need it, they have a zero-touch option available. They know that their gold is secured in a locker with their fingerprint, so their jewellery is not going to be melted or broken. If they ever need a line of credit, they can avail it in 30 seconds without talking to anyone, or even having someone quietly visit their home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they have deposited multiple jewellery items, they can avail loan against just some of them. Say if the person knows that they need to use some necklace in an event soon, they can take a loan against other items in that case. And we charge at max 1% interest rate on the loan,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>This is just part of the problem that indiagold, which kickstarted its operation late last year, is trying to address.</p>
<p>It has built a platform that determines the credit worthiness of its customers, and provides APIs to banks and other lenders who are trying to reach this untapped market.</p>
<p>The startup, which is currently operational in Delhi-NCR, recently raised $2 million in a financing round led by Leo Capital, with participation from high-profile investors including Kunal Shah of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/india-cred-raises-81m-buys-back-1-2m-shares-from-employees/">Cred</a>, Amrish Rau of PineLabs, Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal of Snapdeal, Ashneer Grover and Bhavik Koladiya of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/bharatpe-raises-75m-to-help-indian-merchants-accept-digital-payments-and-secure-working-capital/">BharatPe</a>, Miten Sampat of Cred and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/indias-mx-player-expands-to-us-uk-and-other-markets-in-international-push/">MX Player</a>, Sameer Mehta of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/indian-electronics-and-lifestyle-brand-boat-raises-100-million-from-warburg-pincus/">Boat</a>, Ashish Sharma of Innoven Capital, Ankit Agarwal of Alteria Capital, Rahul Soota of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/indias-30-year-old-mymoneymantra-raises-15m-to-scale-its-financial-services-marketplace/">MyMoneyMantra</a>, Ramakant Sharma of Livspace, and Blume Founders Fund.</p>
<p>“We think this is the only way this huge market can really be addressed, and now we are beginning to scale our efforts,” said Misra.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We talk a lot these days about the future of work and the proliferation of new and better tools for distributed workforces, but companies focused on developing fleet management software &#8212; even if they have not really been viewed as &#8220;tech startups&#8221; &#8212; have been working on this problem for many years already. Today, one of the older players in the field is announcing its first significant round of investment, a sign both of how investors are taking more notice of these B2B players, and how the companies themselves are seeing a new opportunity for growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://bigchange.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BigChange</a>, a UK startup that builds fleet management software to help track and direct jobs to those on the go whose &#8220;offices&#8221; tend to be vehicles, has closed a round of £75 million ($102 million at today&#8217;s rates). U.S. investor <a href="https://www.greathillpartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Hill Partners</a>.</p>
<p>The company has built a business by tapping into the advances of technology to build apps for field service engineers and those back at the mothership who run operations and help manage their jobs, workers who in the past might have used phone calls, paperwork and lots of extra round trips between offices and sites in order to run things.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I founded BigChange to revolutionise mobile workforce management and bring it into the 21st century. Our platform eliminates paperwork, dramatically cuts carbon, creates efficiency, promotes safer driving and means that engineers are spending less time on the roads or filling out forms and more time completing jobs,&#8221; said founder and CEO Martin Port in a statement. &#8220;We are incredibly excited to partner with Great Hill and leverage their successful track-record scaling vertical and enterprise software companies both in the UK and overseas.”</p>
<p>BigChange said that Great Hill&#8217;s stake values the company at £100 million (or $136 million). <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/private-equity-sale-is-big-change-for-entrepreneur-martin-port-b63wd2w2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One report</a> points to part of that funding being a secondary transaction, with Port pocketing £48 million of that. The company has been around since 2012 and appears to be profitable. It has raised very little in funding (around $2 million) before this, at one point trying to raise an angel round but cancelling the process before it completed, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/156589-30/company/profile#general-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filings tracked by PitchBook</a>.</p>
<p>As the technology industry continues to become essentially a part of every other industry in the world, this <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">deal is notable as a sign of how its</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> boundaries are expanding and getting more blurred. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">BigChange is not a London startup, nor from the Cambridge or Oxford areas, nor from Bristol or anywhere in the south. It&#8217;s from the north, specifically Leeds &#8212; a city that has an impressive<a href="https://www.seedtable.com/startups-leeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> number of startups in it</a> even if these have not had anything like the funding or attention that startups in cities and areas in the South have attracted. (One eye-catching exception is the online store <a href="http://pharmacy2u.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pharmacy2U</a>: the Leeds startup has been <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/57772-09/company/profile#investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backed</a> by Atomico, BGF and others: given the interest of companies like Amazon to grow in this space, it&#8217;s likely one to watch.)</span></p>
<p>One of the big themes in technology right now is how a lot of the action is getting decentralised &#8212; a result of many of us now working remotely to stave off the spread of Covid-19, many people using that situation to reconsider whether they need to be living in any specific place at all, and subsequently choosing to relocate from expensive regions like the Bay Area to other places for better quality of life.</p>
<p>There are of course other cities like Manchester, Edinburg, Cardiff and more in the U.K. with technology ecosystems (just as there have been across many cities in the U.S. for years). But when one of these, this time out of Leeds, attracts a significant funding round, it points to the potential of something similar playing out in the U.K., too, with not just talent but more money going into regions beyond the usual suspects.</p>
<p>The other part of the decentralisation story here focuses on what BigChange is actually building.</p>
<p>Here, it&#8217;s one of the many companies that have dived into the area of building apps and larger pieces of software aimed not at &#8220;knowledge workers&#8221; but those who do not sit at desks, are on the move, and tend to work with their hands. For those who are on the road, it has apps to better manage their jobs and routes (which it calls JourneyWatch). For those back in the dispatch part of the operations, it has an app to track them better and use the software to balance the jobs and gain further analytics from the work (sold as JobWatch). These work on ruggedised devices and lean on SaaS architecture for distribution, and there are some 50,000 people across some 1,500 organizations using its apps today, with those customers located around the world, but with a <a href="https://www.bigchange.com/recommendations/customer-success-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large proportion of them in the U.K. itself</a>.</p>
<p>BigChange is not the only company targeting workers in the field. We covered a significant funding round for another one of them out of North America, Jobber, which builds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">software for service professionals</a>, just last month. Others tapping into the opportunity of bringing tech to a wider audience beyond knowledge workers include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/hover-secures-60m-for-a-3d-imaging-platform-used-to-assess-and-fix-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hover</a> (technology and a wider set of tools for home repair people to source materials, make pricing and work estimates, and run the administration of their businesses) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/gosite-snags-40m-to-help-smbs-bring-their-businesses-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoSite</a> (a platform to help all kinds of SMBs — the key factor being that many of them are coming online for the first time — build out and run their businesses). Others in this specific area include <a href="http://klipboard.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Klipboard</a>, <a href="http://azuga.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azuga</a>, <a href="http://servicetitan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceTitan</a>, <a href="http://servicemax.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceMax</a> and more.</p>
<p>You might recognise the name Great Hill Partners as the PE firm that has taken majority stakes in a range of media companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/great-hill-partners-acquires-gizmodo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gizmodo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/04/ziff-davis-acquired-by-former-time-exec-vivek-shah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ziff Davis</a> (way back when) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/private-equity-firm-great-hill-partners-acquires-stock-media-service-storyblocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Storyblocks</a>, and backed companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/06/the-realreal-ropes-in-50-million-in-new-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Real</a> and <a href="https://www.greathillpartners.com/media/great-hill-partners-and-charlesbank-capital-partners-lead-535-million-private-placement-in-wayfair" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>. In this case, the company was attracted by how BigChange was being adopted by a very wide range of industries that fall under &#8220;field service&#8221; as part of their workload.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike niche players that focus on smaller customers and specific sub-verticals, Martin and his accomplished team have built a flexible, all-in-one platform for field service professionals and operators,&#8221; said Drew Loucks, a partner at Great Hill Partners, in a statement. &#8220;BigChange’s technology is differentiated not only by its ability to serve commercial and residential clients of nearly any scale or vertical, but also by its award-winning product development and customer service capabilities.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a year since I covered <a href="https://www.manomano.fr">ManoMano</a>, the French e-commerce platform focused on DIY, home improvement and gardening products. And 2020 has been a successful years as the company’s gross merchandise volume doubled to €1.2 billion ($1.45 billion at today’s rate).</p>
<p>ManoMano’s sales are also accelerating as the company reported a 50% increase in 2019 gross merchandise volume compared to 2018.</p>
<p>When it comes to “softer” metrics, the company now attracts 50 million unique visitors per month, which represents a 70% year-over-year increase. There are 7 million active clients on the platform — that’s a 100% increase.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to France, ManoMano is operating in Spain, Italy, Germany, the U.K. and Belgium. In 2021, the company plans to double down on Northern Europe (Germany and the U.K.) and improve the experience for both merchants and customers.</p>
<p>France still represents 60% of the company’s sales volume. And the company is currently profitable on this market if you look at this segment independently from the rest of the company.</p>
<p>While ManoMano operates a marketplace, it also offers a fulfillment service for third-party retailers. The company is also growing nicely on the professional segment with its <a href="https://www.manomano.fr/pro">ManoManoPro</a> vertical.</p>
<p>The startup has raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/01/manomano-raises-125-million-for-its-home-improvement-e-commerce-platform/">$125 million</a> in 2019 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/manomano-raises-139-million-for-its-home-improvement-e-commerce-platform/">$139 million</a> in 2020. It is still actively hiring and growing the team. There are currently 650 employees and the company could work with 1,000 people at the end of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Relationships can be messy, including between startup founders and their venture investors. But in a case that takes messy to an extreme, an insurtech company in Santa Monica, Calif. called <a href="https://www.sureapp.com/">Sure</a> is alleging that its Series A investor used privileged information to launch a very similar, New York-based startup called <a href="https://boostplatform.io/">Boost</a>.</p>
<p>Sure further assets that the venture firm &#8212; 29-year-old <a href="https://www.iacapgroup.com/">IA Capital Group</a> of New York &#8212; has continued to &#8220;harass&#8221; Sure over information rights that it is no longer entitled to receive, given its conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>As why he thinks there&#8217;s still interest in his company, Sure&#8217;s founder and CEO, Wayne Slavin, suggests that it&#8217;s because Sure&#8217;s growth is outpacing that of Boost. &#8220;We&#8217;ve grown headcount almost 50% through COVID,&#8221; says Slavin. Sure now has annual recurring revenue in the &#8220;double digit millions&#8221; and is profitable, he adds, hinting that Boost has not fared as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Andy Lerner, a managing partner with IA Capital who has been with the firm since 1995, disputes Sure&#8217;s characterization of events. &#8220;It&#8217;s very important [to note] that we did not invest knowingly in two companies that were direct competitors,&#8221; he said earlier today when asked about Sure&#8217;s claims.</p>
<p>Alex Maffeo, a former investor with IA Capital Group who sat on Sure&#8217;s board before incubating Boost inside the venture firm, then leaving to become its CEO, said in response to Sure&#8217;s claims: &#8220;We have no knowledge of the situation between Sure and IA Capital, nor do we receive any information about any of the companies in IA&#8217;s portfolio. I haven&#8217;t worked at the firm for almost four years now, and Boost has been focused on the same mission to power insurtech startups and other digital distribution partners from the start. We have always and continue to wish Wayne and his team nothing but the best as both of our companies thrive in our respective lanes.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what went so awry here? The conflict between the two sides dates back to nearly 2017, when IA Capital led an $8 million Series A round for Sure. More specifically, it wrote the company a $2 million check from a fund whose sole limited parter is the insurance giant Prudential.</p>
<p>Lerner says that at the time, Sure was a &#8220;mobile insurance distributor,&#8221; one that was focused on items in transit, including, &#8220;flight insurance, smart phone insurance, baggage insurance.&#8221; Slavin says this is false, however. He says Sure &#8212; which sells its software as a service to large companies like Tesla, Intuit, Mastercard, and other customers that use its technology to run their digital insurance programs &#8212; had already begun working instead on an embedded insurance API strategy soon after its seed round closed in 2015.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That Boost offers the same service today could be coincidence, but Slavin doesn&#8217;t think so. </span>In fact, according to both sides, a rift began to emerge soon after IA Capital, which invests solely in insuretech startups, began working on an internal program called &#8220;Project Boost&#8221; led by Maffeo. The original idea, says Slavin, was for this company to offer insurtech startups the capital needed to quickly bring new insurance products to market, and for it to raise $40 million toward this end. When a big round didn&#8217;t materialize, IA Capital and Maffeo pivoted and with seed funding from IA Capital, Maffeo resigned as an investor and joined what became Boost Insurance as CEO.</p>
<p>The crux of the problem, says Slavin, is that without discussing these moves with Sure, Boost quickly began to &#8220;drift in our lane.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Slavin, this was especially worrisome given that Maffeo had spent almost a full year on the Sure board and understood its prospects, some of the intricacies of its tech, and what was on its roadmap. Unsure of how to fight back, it decided with its board to invoke a provision of its investment documents with IA Capital that at least enabled it to stop providing IA Capital with the same level of information to which it was entitled earlier. By late 2019, it stopped sending IA Capital anything at all.</p>
<p>That hasn&#8217;t sat so well with Lerner, who maintains that Sure and Boost &#8220;are not that similar,&#8221; and that, in any case, because &#8220;once in a while they overlap,&#8221; his firm hopped off the board when Sure closed its Series B round in 2018, a $12.5 million financing led by the publicly traded insurance holding company W. R. Berkley.</p>
<p>More, says Lerner, after some &#8220;back and forth,&#8221; IA Capital agreed to accept a more bare-bones &#8220;income statement and balance sheet, so we [could] value and report on Sure to our LPs every quarter. We didn&#8217;t ask for any sensitive information or technical information or who its customers are. We basically just wanted financial information to do our audit and value our stake . . . and Sure said they wanted to send us zero information.&#8221;</p>
<p>With some animus now on both sides, what happens from here is the biggest question.</p>
<p>Slavin suggests he was willing to quietly endure the bad governance &#8220;nightmare that we&#8217;re living and that [IA Capital] just won&#8217;t acknowledge,&#8221; he says. But a surprise letter from IA Capital&#8217;s attorneys a few days before this past Christmas &#8212; one that asked for private shareholder information &#8212; went too far, he says.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, he wrote to all of Sure&#8217;s shareholders and told them about such these behind-the-scenes wranglings for the first time. Through Sure&#8217;s attorney, Evan Bienstock of Fenwick &amp; West, the company also told IA Capital that if its investor, Prudential, wants more information about Sure, Sure will provide it to the insurance giant directly. (Prudential did not respond to a request for comment this afternoon.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I probably should have stood up to the bully sooner,&#8221; says Slavin. &#8220;But it&#8217;s really hard when, as the founder, you know you might need that reference check. You might need that gatekeeper to help you along, even though they&#8217;re not necessarily looking out for the interests of the company and the interests of the other shareholders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lerner meanwhile suggests it&#8217;s all been a big misunderstanding, that IA Capital didn&#8217;t realize there was a potential conflict until Boost was &#8220;already well underway.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that IA Capital wants to &#8220;have a great relationship with [Sure]. We regret that there&#8217;s a dispute. We just want them to send us the minimal information so we can audit and do our report to our LPs in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Said Lerner: &#8220;I think we&#8217;re reasonable, and we wanted to work things out. They&#8217;re an insuretech that seems to be doing well, and we&#8217;re a large insuretech VC, and we could certainly be helpful to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked why IA Capital doesn&#8217;t simply sell its shares to existing shareholders, or let Sure buy them back in order to resolve the situation, Lerner claimed his venture firm would be willing to sell its shares, but he said it would first &#8220;need some information to evaluate what&#8217;s a fair price.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alas, Slavin, who says Sure has bumped up against Boost twice recently to win recent deals, says he doesn&#8217;t see how that happens at this point. Too much damage has been done. Besides, he says, &#8220;Andy can discern revenue run rates from a financial statement; he can figure out how big our contracts are based on what he’s asking.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it drags on for all parties.</p>
<p>Sure has raised $23.1 million in funding to date, including from Menlo Ventures and ff Venture Capital.</p>
<p>Boost has meanwhile raised $17 million, including from Coatue, Greycroft, and Tusk Venture Partners.</p>
<p>Slavin says that IA Capital owns less than 5% of Sure. Lerner today declined to say how much of Boost that IA Capital owns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, Quadpay. These are some of the big global players in the buy now, pay later (BNPL) movement. They allow shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees, and have become more prominent due to how the pandemic accelerated e-commerce market growth around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit card companies have filled in this gap for a long time. But the problem is credit cards rely on exorbitant fees, leading people to debt in the long run. While the pandemic left many jobless, it taught millennials and Gen Zers &#8212; a growing demographic with more than $200 billion in spending power &#8212; the hard way of sorting out their debt issues. In turn, a number of them have become debt-averse and increased their demand for better financing options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/buy-now-pay-later-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 poll carried out by Motley Fool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surveyed 1,800+ people on why U.S. consumers use BNPL services. From the survey, 39% of the respondents said they used BNPL services to avoid paying credit card interest rates, while 16.3% said they don&#8217;t like to use credit cards and 14% said their credit cards were maxed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To millennials, there’s no incentive to own a credit card these days. A shift of preference to buy products on credit at the point-of-sale is on the rise; </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200922005066/en/Buy-Now-Pay-Later-Digital-Spend-Led-by-Klarna-PayPal-Afterpay-to-Double-by-2025-Reaching-680-Billion---Kaleido-Intelligence"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$680 billion will be spent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by global consumers using online POS finance or BNPL over e-commerce channels by 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, as established players continue to have thousands of merchants and millions of users on their platforms, BNPL services are just picking up in Africa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a continent where debit cards (not credit) are prevalent, the upcoming players are primarily lending companies who have found a way to assess their customers&#8217; credit risk via technology. Gathering data from partnerships with merchants, they use consumers&#8217; shopping habits and purchasing power to drive their BNPL ambitions.</span></p>
<h2>How these platforms assess credit risk</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Nigerian digital bank Carbon </span><a href="https://blog.getcarbon.co/spread-payments-on-purchases-at-zero-interest-with-carbon-zero/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced Carbon Zero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a product that lets customers purchase electronics and gadgets while paying in small installments at a 0% interest rate. However, before a purchase is made, a percentage of the total cost is paid upfront. After that, customers can pay the remaining price over six months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different reasons why such services hardly exist on the continent. For one, the country&#8217;s </span><a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/01/06/digital-lenders-need-data/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit infrastructure is still a work in progress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and most of its citizens have limited purchasing power. So how does Carbon plan to assess risk? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company started in 2012 as a digital lender. But it has since grown to become one of the country&#8217;s few digital banks providing different financial services to its more than 659,000 customers. With extensive experience and a track record of providing loans to Nigerians (in 2020, its loan disbursement volume was $63 million), Carbon has found itself in pole position to enter the buy now, pay later market with Carbon Zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We do not believe that a firm without a track record of lending can provide a similar service, except they have a significant amount of capital to burn. Carbon has been lending in Nigeria for nearly 10 years, so we have a lot of credit history of our customers, and we believe we can assess new customers very well,&#8221; Chijioke Dozie, the company&#8217;s CEO, told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZQM0pKmbuw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/">Nigerian digital bank Carbon hit $240M in payments processed last year, up 89% from 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigerian digital bank Carbon hit $240M in payments processed last year, up 89% from 2019&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/embed/#?secret=ZQM0pKmbuw" data-secret="ZQM0pKmbuw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dozie says Carbon Zero hopes to be the embodiment of the promise made to its customers years ago to embed finance in their everyday purchase. But there&#8217;s a benchmark to who these customers are. According to the company, Carbon Zero can only be accessed by customers who earn at least ₦200,000 ($500) monthly, representing a small amount of the population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case of finding a market need and product-market fit was slightly different for Egyptian digital lending platform </span><a href="https://shahry.app/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shahry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2019, co-founders </span><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/elrakabawy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sherif ElRakabawy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Mohamed Ewis, while running Yaoota &#8212; Egypt&#8217;s largest shopping engine and price comparison website &#8212; noticed that one of the most frequent requests they got from users was the option to buy products and pay for them later. Simultaneously, the Egyptian pound was experiencing devaluation against the dollar, thereby causing inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders launched Shahry targeting the underbanked part of its young population to pay for products in installments, going head to head with the banks that offered similar services, albeit via credit cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re currently the only buy now, pay later app in Egypt that offers a fully online service with no physical friction or paperwork from signing up to product home delivery,&#8221; the CEO ElRakabawy told TechCrunch.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Shahry’s model does not require a down payment, it does require that users apply for virtual credit through their mobile app, which they use to buy products from Arab e-commerce giant Souq. The company determines creditworthiness using algorithms and a credit risk review based on customer data. The company is also working on an AI model for fully automated instant decisions.</span></p>
<h2>Partnering with merchants and raising capital to compete</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the vertical, BNPL helps merchants drive sales, increase conversion rates and improve transaction sizes at decent percentages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On how it makes money, Shahry takes interests and commission fees from merchants &#8212; a method Carbon Zero adopts. Via Souq, Shahry has Amazon as an online partner, and ElRakabawy says the company plans to onboard hundreds of brick and mortar, and online, merchants later this year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Carbon Zero launched with merchants that are top distributors of authentic electronics and gadgets in Nigeria. Although these merchants sell competing products, Dozie says Carbon doesn&#8217;t control the prices. The company is only concerned with financing the products as other necessities like product pricing, fulfilment and logistics is between the merchant and the customer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have told merchants it&#8217;s in their best interest to provide the best pricing as we will not favour any merchant over the other. Customers can choose which Zero merchant they want to use, and they will vote with their wallet,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To embark on a BNPL journey, a company must have a functioning credit system and a large war chest. This is why the likes of Affirm and Klarna have raised billions, and Afterpay millions, of dollars in investments. While Shahry and Carbon don&#8217;t have those amounts to burn, they will make do with what they have, as is usual with most African startups &#8212; case in point, despite raising just $650,000 in pre-seed investment last year, Shahry claims to have been experiencing double-digit month-on-month growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But ElRakabawy reckons that financing these transactions have put a strain on the business even though the company is yet to scratch the surface of what could be achieved in the Egyptian market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The market is huge and still mostly underserved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The demand is so big that we&#8217;re currently only capped by the amount of loan capital we can disburse.&#8221; In the coming months, the company plans to close a second round of funding from new and existing investors to meet the growing demand for its service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbon might be looking to do the same as the company gears up for a Series B in the foreseeable future. However, what is top of mind for Dozie is not fundraising; it is how to tailor the buy now, pay later service, which has become a global phenomenon, to a harsh market like Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We see a lot of potential in the Nigerian market for Carbon Zero. We do not believe we can blindly copy other BNPL players like Affirm or Klarna because they operate in markets that have an established offline and online retail market,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Carbon Zero will not only adapt to its environment to offer payment experience in the retail space</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> but also in other areas where customers need to spread payments &#8212; in travel, education, and healthcare.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Until now <a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/">General Catalyst</a> has been better known as a US VC which makes occasional forays into European territory. But that changes with the news today that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-bischoff-65394828/">Chris Bischoff</a>, an experienced London-based investor, joins as Managing Director of its new London office.</p>
<p>Bischoff brings with him an extensive track record of investment across the US and Europe, participating in the fund-raising for Avito, Babylon, Betterment, Cedar, VillageMD, Livongo and Cityblock Health, among others. He joins from the role of senior investment director at venture and growth fund <a href="https://www.kinnevik.com/">Kinnevik AB</a> where he led several investments most notably in the healthcare realm but also participated in deals alongside General Catalyst in companies such as Livongo (now Teladoc, NYSE: TDOC) and Cityblock.</p>
<p>In a statement, Bischoff said: “I’ve known and greatly admired GC for many years and have successfully partnered with the team on multiple occasions. I am strongly aligned with their purpose, approach, and culture, so this is a natural step.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>General Catalyst is no stranger to Europe, having invested most recently in British used-car startup Cazoo, FinTech as a Service company Rapyd, and Collective, an online back office platform. It’s also an investor in Bloom &amp; Wild, and most recently it led a $44M Series B funding into Multiverse, founded by Euan Blair (former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair’s eldest son). It’s also a long-time investor in food delivery startup Deliveroo.</p>
<p>Last year it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/general-catalyst-just-announced-2-3-billion-in-new-capital-commitments-across-three-funds/">secured</a> $2.3 billion in capital commitments across three funds: a $600 million early-stage fund, a $1 billion growth fund for companies with $10 million-plus in annual revenue and a $700 million “endurance fund” to back large companies doing more than $100 million in sales.</p>
<p>In a statement Hemant Taneja, managing partner, General Catalyst said: “Having invested alongside and worked with Chris as a fellow director, I know firsthand that he shares our commitment to backing and building enduring companies with the potential to materially improve the lives of many.”</p>
<p>Bischoff will be adding to the firm’s bench of healthcare investors given its involvement in Livongo, Cityblock, Oscar, Color and Ro Health, among others.</p>
<p>General Catalyst accelerated its interest in European and Israeli tech companies when managing director Adam Valkin joined from Accel Partners in London, bringing with him plenty of European savvy.</p>
<p>Valkin and Bischoff will run the deals in Europe and Israel, and no doubt more efficiently, now that GC has Bischoff with his feet under a desk in London, even if for the time being that will be a home office desk.</p>
<p>Valkin said: “Europe and Israel have unequivocally become major centers for global-scale innovation, and having Chris on the ground here is a huge asset for our firm. I have known Chris for many years and have observed his talent as an investor, his outstanding portfolio, and importantly, his reputation as a trusted partner for ambitious founders.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Accel, Valkin led investments in Gocardless, Flywire, and Spotify, and then joined General Catalyst in 2013 to build out the New York office.</p>
<p>In an interview, he told me: “In 2015 GC started looking into Europe in a more serious way… perhaps a little bit more opportunistically at that point. We invested in a number of European companies like Brainly in Poland and Fiverr in Israel. And then 2016 was sort of a big year for us because we led both a series A of Lemonade out in Israel, and a growth round and Deliveroo in the UK.”</p>
<p>He said GC decided to get a little bit more organised about Europe, and spent a lot more time with founders there, gradually ramping up its activity.  “So, our European journey essentially began, five, six years ago. And we&#8217;ve become very active there, both in the UK in Europe as well as Israel. The big question for us was when would it make sense to have a team on the ground. And we actually got to know Chris about five years ago, in the context of what we were doing in Europe, and also just as a really important growth stage investor in Europe.”</p>
<p>Bischoff added: “ If you look at what GC has done in Europe, it really is across both consumer and enterprise, and across the sector. I’ve done quite a bit in healthcare, obviously, a bit in FinTech and consumer which are pretty large sectors in Europe… it&#8217;s not narrowly focused in Europe. The intention is to bring the full set of GC’s capabilities to Europe, and across sectors.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.cajoo.eu">Cajoo</a>, a new French startup that has raised a $7.3 million (€6 million) funding round. The company wants to make it easier to order groceries from your phone and receive them 15 minutes later. It is launching in Paris today.</p>
<p>“I left Bolt around mid-August and I’m launching a company with two co-founders focused on 15-minute deliveries,” co-founder and CEO Henri Capoul told me. Thanks to his experience at Bolt, he probably knows a thing or two about logistics and operating a marketplace at scale. Guillaume Luscan and Jeremy Gotteland are the two other co-founders.</p>
<p>What makes Cajoo different from what’s out there? In France, there’s no Instacart or pure player in the grocery delivering space. Instead, many supermarket chains already offer deliveries. You can order from their website or app and get your groceries the next day or two days later.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some retailers are trying to speed things up a bit, such as Carrefour with its <a href="https://livraisonexpress.carrefour.fr">Livraison Express</a> service and Monoprix with <a href="https://courses.monoprix.fr">Monoprix Plus</a>. Amazon can also deliver some groceries through its <a href="https://primenow.amazon.fr">Amazon Prime Now</a> sub-service. It can take 30 minutes, an hour or even two hours before receiving your order though.</p>
<p>But people want things <em>now</em>, as the success of Deliveroo, Uber Eats and others has shown. I think impatience is unsustainable because of unit economics, labor laws, the impact on small shops and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars/">cities</a>. And yet, it seems likely that there’s enough demand for Cajoo.</p>
<p>The startup wants to differentiate itself with a full-stack approach. Cajoo operates its own micro-fulfillment centers. It has its own inventory of products. It manages the fleet of delivery people as much as possible. And, of course, it sells directly to customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://glovoapp.com">Glovo</a> offered grocery deliveries from your local grocery store. But the company pulled back from the French market a few weeks ago. It seems like it couldn’t generate big enough margins by buying from stores directly. In Spain, Glovo focuses on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/spains-glovo-inks-real-estate-tie-up-to-add-more-dark-stores-for-speedy-urban-delivery/">its own dark stores</a>.</p>
<p>On Cajoo, you’ll find anything you could find in a local grocery store — pasta, shampoo, candies, you name it. You’ll be able to order wine, beer and snack —&nbsp;Uber proved that it can be a lucrative segment with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/uber-is-buying-alcohol-delivery-service-drizly-for-1-1b/">acquisition of Drizly</a> for $1.1 billion.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wI49XAvFU9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/uber-is-buying-alcohol-delivery-service-drizly-for-1-1b/">Uber is buying alcohol delivery service Drizly for $1.1B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber is buying alcohol delivery service Drizly for $1.1B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/uber-is-buying-alcohol-delivery-service-drizly-for-1-1b/embed/#?secret=wI49XAvFU9" data-secret="wI49XAvFU9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And it is launching today in Paris in the 9th arrondissement and around. Overall, Cajoo thinks it’ll require ten micro-fulfillment centers to cover Paris and it’s going to take a few months.</p>
<p>Cajoo is also benefiting from the current economic crisis as there are a ton of empty stores, empty garages, small warehouses that are currently waiting for a new owner.</p>
<p>“The differentiating factor of our model is that we offer products at market price. It’s the same price as a Monoprix or Carrefour Express store with delivery fees under €2,” Capoul said.</p>
<p>The company doesn’t plan to generate most of its revenue from delivery fees. Those are minimum fees so that you don’t order one item at a time. Instead, the company will get margins from products themselves, like any retailer.</p>
<p>Frst and XAnge are leading the seed round with the two co-founders of Chauffeur-Privé (later rebranded as Kapten) also participating.</p>
<p>I asked about the company’s plans when it comes to delivery staff. As <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/france/2020/07/22/la-moitie-des-livreurs-frichti-sans-papiers-bientot-regularises_1794907/">Gurvan Kristanadjaja reported for Libération</a> last year, there are some serious issues with contractors working for food delivery companies in France. For instance, a significant portion of Frichti’s delivery people were illegal immigrants. Some riders on Deliveroo or Uber Eats also <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/france/2020/11/03/loue-un-compte-uber-eats-100-euros-par-semaine-enquete-sur-la-livraison-en-sous-location_1804321/">rent their accounts</a> to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Capoul told me that it is going to hire some employees to handle deliveries and give them electric bikes. But the company will also work with partners — both contracting companies and freelancers.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to have the same standards as Deliveroo or Uber Eats. Recruiting the right delivery people, making sure that they have work permits are important topics,” Capoul said. Each micro-fulfillment centers will also have a restroom and a place to wait for the next order.</p>
<p>It’s going to be important to see whether Cajoo manages to keep high standards over the long run as the service gets more popular. At least, the service is starting with the right mindset.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While China bans cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings, the government is set to <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2020/01/blockchain-in-china-a-solution-in-need-of-a-problem/">leverage the underpinning technology</a> &#8212; often without the decentralized part. Blockchain, for instance, could help track the shipment of luxury goods and authenticate court evidence. In the process of adopting blockchain applications in its own interest, China also wants to become a world leader of the new technology.</p>
<p>Last year, an ambitious, government-backed<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-26/china-backed-crypto-guru-wants-to-unify-the-world-s-blockchains"> blockchain infrastructure network</a> launched in China. The <a href="https://www.bsnbase.com/p/main/serviceNetworkDesc?type=BSNIntroduction">Blockchain-based Service Network</a>, or BSN, acts as an operating system for blockchain programs so developers won&#8217;t have to design a framework from the ground up. Importantly, it&#8217;s <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">part of the country&#8217;s goal to set industry standards and build the underlying infrastructure for blockchain applications worldwide.</span></p>
<p>The brains behind BNS are the <a href="http://www.sic.gov.cn/Column/595/0.htm">State Information Center</a>, an affiliate to China&#8217;s top economic and reform planner, the country&#8217;s credit card processing giant UnionPay, telecoms carrier China Mobile, and a little-known Beijing-based startup called <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/meet-red-date-the-little-known-tech-firm-behind-chinas-big-blockchain-vision">Red Date</a> which cut its teeth building smart city technology in China.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are two main types of blockchains: permissionless, which is public, decentralized and transparent; and permissioned, which is operated by one or multiple stakeholders of a given industry, respectively called private and consortium blockchains.</p>
<p>BSN is designed as a global infrastructure to support both consortium and public blockchains, it says in a <a href="http://kb.bsnbase.com/webdoc/view/PubFile4028813e70be89020170c30825450171.html">white paper</a> published last March. &#8220;Just as with the internet, the BSN is also a cross-cloud, cross-portal, cross-framework global infrastructure network.&#8221;</p>
<p>An English version of the website is <a href="https://bsnbase.io/">available</a> for dApp developers, and major public chains like Ethereum, EOS, Tezos, NEO already have nodes on the network.</p>
<p>Now BNS is working on the more private part of its infrastructure. This week, it announced it will roll out a permissioned version of Cosmos. Introduced in 2019, Cosmos is a network comprised of many independent blockchains and calls itself the &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/17/welcome-to-the-hub-of-all-hubs/">internet of blockchains</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The development work for the Cosmos-based chain is done by Bianjie, a Chinese blockchain startup, and the permissioned chain is named after the city Wenchang in China&#8217;s southernmost Hainan Province, <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-12/05/c_138605932.htm">home to China&#8217;s first blockchain pilot zone</a>.</p>
<p>The intentions of the Wenchang Chain are to provide a &#8220;public infrastructure network that allows the low-cost development, deployment, operation, maintenance and regulation of consortium blockchain applications,&#8221; Bianjie said in an announcement.</p>
<p>Global developers can now deploy their dApps on the Wenchang Chain via BSN, which makes their dApps concurrently compliant with Chinese regulations, a Bianjie spokesperson explained via email.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this way, it&#8217;s possible for their dApps to gain a large number of Chinese users and enter the Chinese market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wenchang Chain is intended not just for enterprise services but also business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer programs. For example, Uptick, a consumer-facing e-ticketing dApp, will soon become the first dApp to launch on the permissioned chain, according to the Bianjie spokesperson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.storyblok.com/">Storyblok</a>, a ‘headless’ CMS for developers and marketers to deliver content, has raised an $8.5 million Series A funding round led by Mubadala Capital, alongside existing Storyblok investors firstminute capital and 3VC. </p>
<p>The Austria-founded company’s platform counts Pizza Hut, Adidas, UPC, Greggs, Decathlon and others among its roster of clients, alongside many thousands of solo developers that use its CMS. That means it&#8217;s currently powering more than 60,000 projects, it says.</p>
<p>Storyblok says its CMS provides ‘highly customizable content blocks and visual editing tools’ in n contrast to other headless CMS solutions which are flexible for developers but might be less so for actual editors to edit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dominik Angerer, Co-Founder and CEO of Storyblok, said in a statement: “The marketing world is in a state of transition. Fragmented channels and rapidly changing consumer behavior as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic have made it much more challenging to efficiently and quickly keep brand messaging consistent across multiple platforms. On paper, headless CMS technology solves a lot of these problems, but in practice, most platforms are only geared towards developers, which makes them incredibly difficult for non-technical people to use. Storyblok’s solution marries the needs of both editors and developers, which has given us a unique position in the market and resulted in rapid growth.”</p>
<p>Fatou Bintou Sagnang, director at Mubadala Capital said: &#8220;In a vast but relatively homogenous market, Storyblok has impressed us with a truly differentiated product that resonates with small and large enterprises. The organic traction is proof of the customer love from both developers and marketers.”</p>
<p>Competitors to Storyblok include ContentStack, Contentful, Sitecore, Adobe Experience Manager and Prismic.</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch Angerer said: “A lot of headless CMS platforms are easily integrated into legacy systems but when it comes to actually using them on a daily basis marketers or other editors find them incredibly difficult to use. In  practice, they end up having to go back to their IT or developer teams to sort out problems or make major changes which ends up wasting the time and money that headless CMS&#8217;s perport to save.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile Premier League (MPL) has raised $95 million in a new financing round, just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/20/indian-mobile-gaming-platform-mobile-premier-league-raises-90-million/">five months after it secured $90 million</a> as the two-and-a-half-year-old Bangalore-based esports and gaming platform looks to grow in international markets.</p>
<p>The new $95 million round, a Series D, was led by Composite Capital and Moore Strategic Ventures and gave the Indian startup a post-money valuation of $945 million, it said. (MPL was valued at about $465 million in its previous financing round in September, TechCrunch had reported.) Base Partners, RTP Global, SIG, Go-Ventures, Telstra Ventures, Founders Circle and Play Ventures also participated in the round, which brings its total to-date raise to $225.5 million.</p>
<p><a href="http://mpl.live/">MPL</a>, which counts Times Internet among its backers, operates a pure-play gaming platform that hosts a range of tournaments. The app, which has amassed more than 60 million users in India and 3.5 million users in Indonesia, also serves as a publishing platform for other gaming firms. MPL, which does not develop games of its own, hosts about 70 games across multiple sports on the app today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“As we grow our presence and expand, this fresh round of funds will help us focus on our core value propositions &#8212; a robust platform with the best features for gamers and onboarding the best eSports titles. The esports community in India is thriving, and we believe this is the perfect time to take Indian-made games to the world as well as help Indian gamers get recognized for their talent,” said Sai Srinivas, co-founder and chief executive of MPL, in a statement.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup also offers fantasy sports, a segment that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation/">taken off in many parts of India in recent years</a>. Because fantasy sports is only one part of the business, the coronavirus outbreak that shut most real-world matches has not impeded the startup’s growth in recent quarters.</p>
<p>MPL&#8217;s growth is especially impressive because its app is not available on the Play Store. Google, whose Android operating system powers 99% of all smartphones in India, does not permit fantasy sports apps on Play Store in the world second largest internet market.</p>
<p>“We’re competing with battle-hardened, decade old companies with much, much deeper pockets but it’s incredible what the young team has achieved over the past couple of years. When we were on the Play Store, a couple of years back, MPL was the fastest app to reach a 1M DAU ever in India!” <a href="https://twitter.com/AbhishekMadhavn/status/1307903328429289474">tweeted</a> Abhishek Madhavan, SVP of Marketing at MPL, last year.</p>
<p>“We signed Virat Kohli (pictured above), when we were a 3-month old company! When we got out of the Play Store, we were told growth will be very very hard to come by, every single marketing metric would fall.”</p>
<p>The startup said it will deploy the fresh capital to organize more esports tournaments in the country and accelerate its international expansion this year. The startup recently organized College Premier League, which saw participation of more than 13,000 gamers from over 100 colleges.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with the MPL team and support their continued growth. As an industry leader in the gaming market, we believe the company will continue to innovate and drive the evolution of eSports, both in India and internationally,” said Kanush Chaudhary, Managing Director, Composite Capital, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gajigesa.com/">GajiGesa</a>, a fintech company that offers Earned Wage Access (EWA) and other services for workers in Indonesia, has raised $2.5 million in seed funding. The round was co-led by Defy.vc and Quest Ventures. Other participants included GK Plug and Play, Next Billion Ventures, Alto Partners Multi-Family Office, Kanmo Group and strategic angel investors.</p>
<p>The company was founded last year by husband-and-wife team Vidit Agrawal and Martyna Malinowska. Agrawal was <a href="https://medium.com/@mdwarriorsasia/ubers-first-employee-from-asia-vidit-agrawal-1660405a81b2">Uber’s first employee in Asia </a>and has also served in leadership positions at Carro and Stripe. Malinowska led product development at Standard Chartered’s SC Ventures and alternative credit-scoring platform LenddoEFL.</p>
<p>About<a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/future-of-marketing/machine-learning/all-eyes-e-money-race-reach-180m-unbanked-indonesians/"> 66% of Indonesia&#8217;s 260 million population is &#8220;unbanked,&#8221;</a> which means they don&#8217;t have a bank account and limited access to financial services like loans. Agrawal and Malinowska decided to launch GajiGesa in Indonesia because Malinowska worked with many unbanked workers while at LenddoEFL. While at Uber, Agrawal also worked with drivers across Southeast Asia whose average earnings were $250 USD a month (excluding Singapore), and he said the top issue they face was harassment by money lenders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;These hardworking Indonesians had no fair or formal sources for easy access to capital. Further, the most common reason for borrowing was short-term liquidity issues,&#8221; Agrawal told TechCrunch. &#8220;But workers were forced to borrow either long-term, high ticket size loans or short-term loans with exorbitantly high-interest rates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having immediate access to earned wages, instead of waiting for a semi-monthly or monthly paycheck, can help alleviate financial stress and make it easier for workers to manage their income and handle emergencies. Companies that have started instant payment services for workers in other countries include <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-payroll-on-demand-pay-instant-payments">Square</a>, London-based startup Wagestream and Gusto.</p>

<p>Since launching in October 2020, GajiGesa has added over 30 employers on its platform, serving tens of thousand of workers in total. It integrates into a company&#8217;s existing human resources management and payroll systems. Workers can get earned wages immediately, track earnings, pay bills, buy prepaid cards and access financial education resources through an app.</p>
<p>GajiGesa does not charge interest rates or require collateral, since all its users are pre-approved by their employers. Companies decide to charge fees or offer GajiGesa as part of their benefits packages, and also get access to analytics that can help them create targeted incentives or new benefits for their workforce.</p>
<p>During COVID-19, Agrawal said the startup has &#8220;seen insatiable demand and support for GajiGesa’s EWA solution from employers. This is partly attributed to the various challenges employers are facing due to the effects of COVID-19, but our platform is designed to support employers and employees in the long-term. The value of EWA and the other services we offer is not limited to the pandemic.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://grab.com">Grab</a>, the Southeast Asian ride-hailing and on-demand delivery giant, announced a program to increase access to COVID-19 vaccinations today. Its goal is to have all of its employees, as well as driver and delivery partners, vaccinated by 2022 (excluding people who are medically unable to receive shots). Grab also said it will work with governments to provide information about vaccines through its app, and is in discussions to provide last-mile vaccine distribution, and transportation to and from vaccination centers.</p>
<p>The company currently has operations in eight Southeast Asian countries: Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Grab joins a growing roster of private companies around the world that have offered to help governments with their vaccination programs. In the United States, these include tech companies like Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and Epic. Meanwhile, China’s largest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, is pledging $10 million to support vaccination programs in 13 countries.</p>

<p>In a statement, Russell Cohen, Grab’s group managing director of operations, said, &#8220;The quicker we can achieve herd immunity, the sooner our communities and economies can start to rebuild. Public-private partnership has been critical in taking on some of the pandemic’s biggest battles, and this collaboration should continue.&#8221;</p>

The company will also extend its Group Prolonged Medical Leave insurance policy to cover income lost by drivers as a result of potential side effects from getting vaccinated. Employees and immediate family members will have any costs not covered by national programs paid for by Grab.</p>
<p>In terms of vaccine education, the Grab app will prominently display information from governments and health authorities, and run user surveys to help them understand public sentiment about COVID-19 vaccines. The company says its app has been downloaded more than 214 million times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remote video podcasting is surprisingly still something of a Wild West these days. Given the massive sums of money currently being pumped into the category &#8212; not to mention the fact that pretty much all podcasting became remote podcasting in 2020 &#8212; you’d expect there to be a more unified solution. Many still continue to rely on catchall teleconferencing software to get the job done (full disclosure: I’ve been recording my podcasts on Zoom during the pandemic).</p>
<p>It’s not for lack of trying of course. A number of companies are vying to become the Zoom or Skype of remote podcasts, including, notably, Zencastr. SquadCast is another big name in the space. The company claims a pretty big footprint, though, again, its primary competitors are still non-specialized video calling apps.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pirZNYmmg4E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While those platforms are generally reliable and ubiquitous, they do have their drawbacks: namely recording quality. SquadCast’s big selling point has been higher-quality recording than those services where sound is something of an afterthought. This week, the Oakland-based company is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210203005275/en/SquadCast%E2%80%99s-Video-Collaboration-Podcasting-to-Increase-Reach-and-Grow-Shows">adding video recording to the mix</a>.</p>
<p>“We were on an upward trajectory before COVID, but demand during the pandemic has resulted in over 280% growth in both revenue and customer acquisition,” CEO Zachariah Moreno said in a release. &#8220;Since Video recording is our most requested feature by current, past, and prospective customers, it was the natural next step to continue to move the needle in virtual recording for podcast professionals.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform is adding the feature for existing customers starting this quarter. The latest beta version of the software records video locally as separate files at 720p. Once the recording is over, it will convert the files into MP4 or WebM.</p>
<p>SquadCast&#8217;s version 3.0 beta with Studio Quality Video Recording consumer plans start at $40/month up to $300/month. Zencastr began rolling out its own video recording feature in beta over the summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify again signaled its interest in developing new ways to monetize its investments in podcasts. In the company&#8217;s <a href="https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2021/Spotify-Technology-S.A.-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-2020/default.aspx">fourth-quarter earnings</a>, chief executive Daniel Ek suggested the streaming media company foresees a future where there will be multiple business models for podcasts, including, potentially, both ad-supported subscriptions and à la carte options.</p>
<p>The company, which also revealed its podcast catalog has grown to now 2.2 million programs, said it&#8217;s seen increasing demand for the audio format in recent months.</p>
<p>For example, 25% of Spotify&#8217;s monthly active users now engage with podcasts, up from 22% just last quarter. Podcast consumption is also increasing, with listening hours having nearly doubled year-over-year in the fourth quarter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, podcasts on Spotify&#8217;s platform are available to both free and paid users and are monetized with ads. This is still a key focus for the company &#8212; Spotify even recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">acquired</a> a podcast hosting and monetization platform, Megaphone, to help make streaming ad insertion technology available to its third-party publishers while also growing its targetable podcast inventory.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Cb8af2ZJbi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">Spotify buying podcast hosting and ad company Megaphone for $235M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spotify buying podcast hosting and ad company Megaphone for $235M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/embed/#?secret=Cb8af2ZJbi" data-secret="Cb8af2ZJbi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Spotify recently put its feelers out about different means of monetizing podcasts, too.</p>
<p>Late last year, for instance, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552822/spotify-podcast-subscription-service-survey">the company was spotted running a survey</a> that asked its customers if they would be willing to pay for a standalone podcast subscription, and if so what would it look like and how much would it cost?</p>
<p>At the time, the survey offered a few different concepts.</p>
<p>At the low end, a subscription could offer ad-supported exclusive episodes and bonus content for $3 per month. This would be similar to Stitcher Premium, which today provides exclusives from top shows and other bonus episodes. But Spotify&#8217;s suggested version included ads, while Stitcher Premium is ad-free.</p>
<p>A middle option suggested a plan that would be even closer to Stitcher Premium, with exclusive shows and bonus material but no ads. This even matched Stitcher Premium&#8217;s price of $5 per month. And at the high-end, subscribers could get early access to ad-free interviews and episodes for $8 per month.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like the premium podcast plan would be ad-free and some mix of exclusive extra content at price points somewhere between $3-$8. <a href="https://t.co/ArK8xYg0CM">pic.twitter.com/ArK8xYg0CM</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Andrew Wallenstein (@awallenstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/awallenstein/status/1324746116160577536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A survey, of course, is only meant to gauge consumer demand for such a subscription, and doesn&#8217;t indicate that Spotify has a new product in the works. (Spotify said the same when asked to comment on the news at the time.)</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s clear that investors also want to know what Spotify is thinking when it comes to recouping its sizable investments in podcasts.</p>
<p>Asked if Spotify thought customers would be willing to pay for podcasts, Ek <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4403058-spotify-technology-s-spot-ceo-daniel-ek-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript">on the earnings call</a> responded that he believed there were several new models that could be explored.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we’re in the early days of seeing the long-term evolvement of how we can monetize audio on the internet. I’ve said this before, but I don’t believe that it’s a one-size-fits-all,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I believe, in fact, that we will have all business models, and that’s the future for all media companies &#8212; that you will have ad-supported subscriptions and à la carte sort of in the same space, of all media companies in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you should definitely expect Spotify to follow that strategy and that pattern,&#8221; Ek added, more definitively.</p>
<p>The answer seemed to indicate that Spotify is considering some of the ideas in that recent survey &#8212; of getting consumers to pay for some podcasts, instead of accessing them all for free or having them bundled into their music subscription.</p>
<p>Of course, that would change the meaning of the word &#8220;podcasts,&#8221; which today refers to freely distributed, serialized audio programs that get distributed via RSS feeds.</p>
<p>If Spotify chooses to paywall podcasts behind subscriptions or à la carte payments, then they&#8217;re no longer <em>really</em> podcasts &#8212; they&#8217;re a new sort of premium audio program.</p>
<p>This is an area where Spotify has plenty of room to grow, considering the significant investment it has made in podcasts over the years. To date, that&#8217;s included buying up content producers like Gimlet Media, The Ringer and Parcast, as well as signing top creators like Joe Rogan, Addison Rae, Kim Kardashian West, DC Comics, Michelle Obama and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, among others. Spotify also bought podcast tools like Anchor and other ad technology and hosting services.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="R41eJRXjgN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/spotify-signs-the-joe-rogan-experience-to-an-exclusive-multi-year-deal/">Spotify signs &#8216;The Joe Rogan Experience&#8217; to an exclusive multi-year deal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spotify signs &#8216;The Joe Rogan Experience&#8217; to an exclusive multi-year deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/spotify-signs-the-joe-rogan-experience-to-an-exclusive-multi-year-deal/embed/#?secret=R41eJRXjgN" data-secret="R41eJRXjgN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The advantage with podcasts is that Spotify has the ability to monetize them in multiple ways at once &#8212; with ads and subscriptions or direct payments, if it chose. And, of course, there are no licensing fees or royalties to contend with, as with streaming music.</p>
<p>Spotify could also adjust the podcast payments model as needed to fit its different geographies and the way customers around the world prefer to consume and pay for podcast content.</p>
<p>None of this thinking was about near-term launches, Ek also clarified.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it’s early days, though, to specifically kind of look at how that could play out,&#8221; he said, talking about how the different models could take shape. &#8220;But, obviously, if that were to be the case, that revenue profile would be different than how we do music.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The California Supreme Court today shot down the lawsuit filed by a group of rideshare drivers in California and the Service Employees International Union that alleged Proposition 22 violates the state&#8217;s constitution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are disappointed in the Supreme Court’s decision not to hear our case, but make no mistake: we are not deterred in our fight to win a livable wage and basic rights,&#8221; Hector Castellanos, a plaintiff in the case, said in a statement. &#8220;We will consider every option available to protect California workers from attempts by companies like Uber and Lyft to subvert our democracy and attack our rights in order to improve their bottom lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suit argued Prop 22 makes it harder for the state’s legislature to create and enforce a workers’ compensation system for gig workers. It also argues Prop 22 violates the rule that limits ballot measures to a single issue, as well as unconstitutionally defines what would count as an amendment to the measure. As it stands today, Prop 22 requires a seven-eighths legislative supermajority in order to amend the measure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’re thankful, but not surprised, that the California Supreme Court has rejected this meritless lawsuit,&#8221; Jim Pyatt, a rideshare driver who advocated for Prop 22 and worked with the Yes on 22 campaign, said in a statement. &#8220;We’re hopeful this will send a strong signal to special interests to stop trying to undermine the will of voters who overwhelmingly stood with drivers to pass Proposition 22. The ballot measure was supported by nearly 60 percent of California voters across the political spectrum including hundreds of thousands of app-based drivers. It’s time to respect the vast majority of California voters as well as the drivers most impacted by Prop 22.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Uber, Lyft and other companies have said they have their eyes on pursuing Prop 22-like legislation elsewhere. Given Uber and Lyft’s anti-gig-workers-as-employees stance, it came as no surprise when Uber and Lyft separately said they would pursue similar legislation in other parts of the country and the world.</p>
<p>Lyft, for example, has created external organizations that push for the independent contractor classification. Two of those organizations are <a href="https://twitter.com/independent_il?lang=en">Illinoisans for Independent Work</a> and <a href="https://ny4independentwork.com/">New Yorkers for Independent Work</a>. Illinoisans for Independent Work was established in June and funded by Lyft with $1.2 million, <a href="https://www.elections.il.gov/CampaignDisclosure/ItemizedDebts.aspx?FiledDocID=eUDnXycc0bZji1aAIn595w%3d%3d">according to committee filings</a>. The <a href="https://www.elections.il.gov/CampaignDisclosure/CommitteeDetail.aspx?ID=rHhufRntQEXyDkciM0QCNQ%3d%3d&amp;T=637424244424180521">stated purpose</a> of the committee is “to support candidates who share the ideology of our organization and the value of independent work.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon/">But as we&#8217;ve previously discussed</a>, the implementation of Prop 22 doesn&#8217;t mark the end of the battle for some gig workers to achieve employee status. There is a concerted effort to keep organizing this year, and getting ready to fight back wherever the next legislative battle emerges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Myanmar&#8217;s new military government has ordered local telecom firms to temporarily block Facebook until February 7 midnight, days after the military seized power in the Southeast Asian nation in a military coup.</p>
<p>Several users on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/myanmar/">Myanmar subreddit</a> reported moments ago that Facebook was already inaccessible on their phones, suggesting that internet service providers had already started to comply with the order, which demanded compliance by midnight Wednesday. (It&#8217;s about 4.30 am Thursday in Myanmar at the time of writing.)</p>
<p>Myanmar&#8217;s new government alleges that Facebook is contributing to instability in the country and in its order has cited a section of the local telecom law that justifies many actions for the greater benefit of public and state.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>NetBlocks, which tracks global internet usage, <a href="https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1357078197989474305">reports</a> that MPT, a state-owned telecom operator that commands the market, has blocked Facebook as well as Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp on its network. Telenor, one of the four telecom operators in the country, said it has expressed &#8220;grave concerns regarding breach of human rights&#8221; but has complied with Myanmar&#8217;s junta order.</p>
<p>A Facebook spokesperson said the company was &#8220;aware that access to Facebook is currently disrupted for some people.&#8221; The spokesperson added: &#8220;We urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with their families and friends and access important information.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The move comes after days of unrest in Myanmar, where earlier this week <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-politics-idUSKBN2A00VK">military took control of the country</a> and declared a state of emergency for a year after detaining civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratically elected leaders of her ruling National League for Democracy. Following the coup, citizens in many parts of Myanmar had reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/internet-connectivity-drops-in-myanmar-after-the-military-detains-aung-san-suu-kyi-and-other-leading-politicians/">facing internet and cellular outages for several hours</a>.</p>

<p>Facebook, which has become synonymous with the internet for citizens in Myanmar, has long been blamed for not doing enough to curb the spread of misinformation that prompted real-world violence in the country.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/facebook-still-isnt-taking-myanmar-seriously/">human rights report</a> in 2018 said that Facebook was used to &#8220;foment division and incite offline violence&#8221; in Myanmar, home to over 54 million people. Later in the same year, Facebook executives agreed that they hadn&#8217;t done enough.</p>
<p>BuzzFeed News <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tasneemnashrulla/facebook-takes-stand-myanmar-coup">reported</a> this week that Facebook executives have now pledged to take proactive content moderation steps in Myanmar, which they termed as &#8220;Temporary High-Risk Location.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, Andreessen Horowitz founder Marc Andreessen announced that social media product veteran Sriram Krishnan will be joining the firm as their latest general partner.</p>
<p>Krishnan, whose previous roles include stints at Snap, Facebook and Twitter, has gained a higher profile in recent weeks from his recurring audio show &#8220;The Good Time Show&#8221; on Clubhouse. His recent talk with Tesla CEO Elon Musk was something of a watershed moment for the audio chat platform driving plenty of new attention to the budding app.</p>
<p>This announcement follows a report in <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/37008f">The Information</a> regarding the hire earlier this week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Krishnan&#8217;s hire comes at an interesting point for Andreessen Horowitz, the firm is at the center of plenty of chatter among media circles regarding their &#8220;go direct&#8221; content strategy. At the same time, a16z and its leadership have played an increasingly hard-nosed role in driving a broader backlash against tech media in recent years among founders and tech enthusiasts in their orbit. Krishnan has spent much of the past couple years building out his flirtations with &#8220;tech optimism&#8221; content with his interview newsletter &#8220;The Observer Effect<em>,&#8221;</em> his Clubhouse show and his prolific Twitter usage.</p>
<p>Broader &#8220;tech pessimism&#8221; among media outlets has, I think, partially been owed to a swift and outspoken shift in thinking regarding the societal responsibilities of social media platforms to more aggressively moderate the content they are surfacing on a global scale. Some of the partners at a16z, a Facebook backer, have been among the more vocal in pushing back on these critiques even as the executives at their portfolio companies have seemed more amenable to shift their thinking.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/02/03/sriram-krishnan/">blog post</a>, Andreessen notes that Krishnan will be joining the firm&#8217;s consumer team to invest in areas that include social.</p>
<p>Krishnan, well-regarded in tech circles, may play an important role at the firm as they approach more social investments in a world where the effects of rapidly scaled consumer platforms have become more understood. The firm and its partners have been throwing their full support behind Clubhouse in an aggressive push to promote the platform, flexing the firm&#8217;s celebrity connections and influence along the way as the platform quickly picks up millions of new users. Krishnan&#8217;s direct operator roles engaging with the product struggles of building platforms that responsibly scale will likely be an asset as the firm faces increased competition across an increasingly frothy venture market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The idea of a virtual concert tour might seem tailor-made for the pandemic, but musician Todd Rundgren said he&#8217;s actually been thinking about something like this for years.</p>
<p>Rundgren told me that he&#8217;d become frustrated with our &#8220;collapsing&#8221; air travel system — exacerbated by hurricanes and climate change — that increasingly left him &#8220;sitting somewhere, unable to get to my next gig.&#8221; So he was already convinced that he needed to &#8220;start imagining other ways&#8221; to reach audiences.</p>
<p>But it was in the context of COVID-19 that Rundgren finally decided to make it happen, with his <a href="https://nocapshows.com/artist?name=toddrundgren">Clearly Human Tour</a> kicking off on February 14. He&#8217;d been planning for a traditional tour, but the dates kept getting pushed back due to the pandemic, until he finally told the organizers, &#8220;You have to let me do this. I can&#8217;t be committed to you and go two years without touring.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rundgren and his band will be performing entirely from Chicago, where they&#8217;ll play songs from across his career, as well as the entirety of his album &#8220;Nearly Human.&#8221; But the tour is taking place virtually across 25 U.S. cities, starting in Buffalo on February 14 and ending on March 22 in Seattle.</p>
<p>Rundgren said he found this more appealing than the idea of performing &#8220;one show and then blast it out to everybody.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="INCrLl5Wzu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/spotify-adds-virtual-event-listings-to-its-app/">Spotify adds virtual event listings to its app</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spotify adds virtual event listings to its app&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/spotify-adds-virtual-event-listings-to-its-app/embed/#?secret=INCrLl5Wzu" data-secret="INCrLl5Wzu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;People plan weeks or months in advance for this particular event, it attracts people from all over the metropolitan area or a particular region,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a social event as much as anything else, and that&#8217;s what we are trying to do with the localization.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means performing live shows at 8 p.m., according to whatever the local time zone might be. Rundgren said the band will also try to &#8220;self-hypnotize&#8221; to get into the proper spirit: &#8220;We&#8217;ll dress all the walls with posters, sports team memorabilia &#8230; We&#8217;ll get food flown in from familiar local eateries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other features include virtual meet and greets with local fans, as well as placing video screens around the concert venue to display virtual audience members. (There are a limited number of in-person tickets for sale as well, but obviously those attendees will need to be in Chicago.)</p>
<p>The concerts will be geofenced, although Rundgren said the approach has evolved — it&#8217;s less about limiting the Buffalo concert to Buffalo attendees, and more about enforcing geographic restrictions based on Rundgren&#8217;s contractual obligations. Or as he put it, &#8220;It&#8217;s less about enclosing an audience, and more about fencing them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rundgren is staging the tour with support from <a href="https://nocapshows.com">NoCap</a>, the livestreaming concert startup <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9414054/cisco-adler-donavon-frankenreiter-launch-concert-livestream-platform-nocap">founded by musicians Cisco Adler and Donavon Frankenreiter</a>. NoCap has been around for less than a year, and Adler said that while it sold 700 tickets for its first show, it&#8217;s now selling &#8220;30, 40, 50 thousand tickets&#8221; per show. And he predicted that virtual concerts won&#8217;t be going away when the pandemic ends.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are all these underserved markets that you can visit once every five years, if that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The future of this becomes a hybrid model.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, he noted that televising sports has only made them &#8220;bigger and more global.&#8221; Similarly, when Adler was thinking about livestreaming concerts, he said, &#8220;I didn’t look at it as: How do we build a Band Aid and help everyone through this gap? It was more: How do we build a bridge to the other side of what music can be?&#8221;</p>
