										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LinkedIn earlier this month unveiled a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/linkedin-is-launching-its-own-25m-fund-and-incubator-for-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new push around creators</a> to bring more original content (and engagement) to its platform, but that&#8217;s not the only effort they are making to bring more activity to its networking site. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that LinkedIn is also running a test around events &#8212; specifically, paid events.</p>
<p>We were first passed code related to the events test via a source who asked to remain anonymous: the code pointed to LinkedIn selling tickets, as well as those organizing the events having a dashboard where they could monitor how those sales are going, how much they are earning, and of course then run the events themselves. A LinkedIn spokesperson confirmed the information to us:</p>
<p>“Amid the changing world of work and transition to a nearly all remote workforce, LinkedIn Events has seen a surge in growth, with 21 million people attending an Event on LinkedIn in 2020,&#8221; said Nicole Leverich, LinkedIn spokesperson. &#8220;We continue to learn from member and customer feedback and test new ways to improve the experience. As part of this, we are exploring options for payment in the Events product based on feedback from event organizers.”</p>
<p>From what we understand this is part of a bigger overhaul the company is looking to make around video and audio services, so these are likely going to anchor the events service, which will all be rolled out in the coming weeks and months. <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005239/en/Hopin-Announces-LinkedIn-as-Latest-Strategic-Investor-and-Partner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn was announced in June of this year as an investor in Hopin</a>; but it&#8217;s not clear if Hopin &#8212; which was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210805005315/en/Hopin-Raises-450-Million-to-Accelerate-Platform-Expansion-and-Continue-to-Build-the-Future-of-Experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last valued at $7.75 billion</a> in its most recent, August funding round &#8212; will be involved in this.</p>
<p>LinkedIn has been working in and around events for years, starting with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/linkedin-gets-physical-debuts-new-events-hub-for-people-to-plan-in-person-networking-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Events hub that it first debuted in 2019</a>, before the days of the pandemic and with a focus on in-person get-togethers. Some months into the Covid-19 pandemic it formalized some of the ways that it was being used in more virtual events scenarios with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/linkedin-ads-polls-and-live-video-based-events-in-a-focus-on-more-virtual-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of online polls and video events</a> aimed at virtual engagement.</p>
<p>Because of this and its place as a social network for those professionally networking, LinkedIn already had a strong, and pretty natural, association with events &#8212; both larger industry expositions or conferences as well as smaller affairs. It&#8217;s used by a number of big events to manage log-ins for attendees; people share content from events on LinkedIn; and those who go to conferences use it to continue their networking after they have engaged in person (or these days, virtually). So it makes sense for LinkedIn the business to consider how and if they could be a more proactive, central participant in that process, owning and hosting the experience themselves, and maybe making a bit of money out of it in the process.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update this as we learn more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Satellite manufacturing company <a href="https://www.terranorbital.com/">Terran Orbital</a> said Monday it would open the world’s largest space vehicle manufacturing facility on Florida’s Space Coast at a cost of $300 million.</p>
<p>The 660,000 square-foot factory will be capable of producing “thousands of different types of space vehicles per year,” including one thousand complete satellites and over one million satellite components per year, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Terran Orbital was founded in 2013, the same year that it acquired nanosatellite developer Tyvak, but has maintained a low profile since. In 2017, Lockheed Martin took <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/29/lockheed-martin-takes-a-strategic-stake-in-nanosatellite-company-terran-orbital/">a small stake</a> in the company. While Terran operates a 128,000 square-foot facility in Irvine, California, CEO and co-founder Marc Bell told TechCrunch in a recent interview that Terran doesn’t disclose its current manufacturing capacity or how many satellites it has built.</p>
<p>Terran Orbital is a contract manufacturer that designs, builds and engineers satellites, primarily for the U.S. government. Bell said around 95% of Terran’s work is related to NASA and the Department of the Defense, and he declined to specify any of the company’s commercial customers.</p>
<p>The company will also be developing its own satellite constellation, Bell added. These satellites will use a type of synthetic aperture radar that will be capable of capturing images even through clouds or other weather events that impact visibility, like thunderstorms. Terran said it will start launching these satellites at the end of 2022.</p>
<p>It’s anticipated that the facility will be completed in 2025 and should generate around 2,100 jobs at an average wage of $84,000. The facility is being built in partnership with Space Florida, the state’s aerospace development authority, who is providing the conduit financing.</p>
<p>The announcement marks the latest boost for Florida’s Space Coast, which is already home to facilities owned by SpaceX, Blue Origin, Redwire and others. Last year, over 1,200 satellites were launched into space, more than double the amount that were sent to orbit the previous year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Ignore the compliments; Sharma was merely trying to bait <a href="https://twitter.com/jrichlive">Jeff</a> and me into engaging with his question. Which worked, as you can tell.</p>
<p>Sharma is someone with quite a lot of experience with both technology cycles and capital flows, so he&#8217;s not asking the generic question &#8212; he wants us to go a level deeper on the concept. So, let&#8217;s poke at the interest rate/tech valuations conversation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One reason why startups are able to raise as much money as they are &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">record sums, recall</a> &#8212; is today&#8217;s low interest rate environment.</p>
<p>Interest rates are slim around the world, which means that money is <em>cheap</em>. Cheap money means that you can hire capital for not a lot of cost. Coinbase, for example, is <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2021/Coinbase-Announces-the-Upsize-and-Pricing-of-2.0-Billion-of-Senior-Notes-for-General-Corporate-Purposes-Including-Product-Development-and-Potential-MA/default.aspx">raising $2 billion in debt</a> at the moment that will come due in two tranches. The first, due in 2028, will yield 3.375%, while the second half, due in 2031, will yield 3.625%. Coinbase raised its target from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion thanks to investor interest. Money is inexpensive, so Coinbase is stacking a bunch of it on its side of the table from investors unable to find lower-risk, higher-yield places to stash their capital.</p>
<p>Cheap money means that you can&#8217;t expect much from loaning out your funds; bond yields are garbage today for that reason, which is great for companies like Coinbase and less great for capital pools in search of yield. Those same buckets of cash have gone fishing in other locales hoping for more profit per dollar, including the venture capital market. Ample capital has allowed venture capitalists to raise ever-larger funds, more quickly, and has allowed non-traditional investors to crowd into the startup market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A good chunk of the unicorn boom is predicated on this cheap money moment we find ourselves in.</p>
<p>But nothing lasts forever, and with the U.S. government getting <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/23/heres-what-will-happen-when-the-feds-tapering-starts-and-why-you-should-care.html">ready to start closing the taps on market-stimulating bond-buying</a>, and eventually raising the domestic cost of money by boosting the target range for the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFEDTARU">Federal Funds Rate</a>, there is an expectation that certain assets will begin to lose some of their luster.</p>
<p>If money becomes more expensive, capital can make more money hiring itself to others; therefore, venture investing will become less attractive from a risk/reward perspective &#8212; again, in theory. At the same time, the stock market may reprice itself. Rock-bottom interest rates have led investors to buy up shares in growth-oriented companies because those firms were expected to have more valuation upside than similar investments into slower-growing companies were expected to post.</p>
<p>This particular trend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/what-happens-to-high-flying-startups-if-the-pandemic-trade-flips/">hit its zenith last summer</a>, when a number of industries were kneecapped by early-COVID restrictions and software stocks offered a way to still hunt yield through the prism of corporate <em>revenue growth, </em>payable not in a regular coupon disbursement but via market value accretion.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>In very broad terms, rising rates <em>should</em> make pouring capital into venture capital funds less attractive simply by making competing asset allocations more enticing. And rising rates may make the value-through-growth trade of public stocks less attractive as other shares cycle back into prominence.</p>
<p>There are technical explanations for the latter portion of our argument. Here are a few from the Sharma Twitter thread:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2208653" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.06.07-PM.png?w=595" alt="" width="595" height="101" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.06.07-PM.png 595w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.06.07-PM.png?resize=150,25 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.06.07-PM.png?resize=300,51 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.06.07-PM.png?resize=50,8 50w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2208654" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.05.57-PM.png?w=585" alt="" width="585" height="240" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.05.57-PM.png 585w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.05.57-PM.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.05.57-PM.png?resize=300,123 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.05.57-PM.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></p>
<p>But Sharma is not really after <em>that</em> set of answers. He is instead questioning conventional wisdom. <em>Why should it really be true</em>, he&#8217;s asking, <em>that tech stocks like Amazon and Salesforce will be worth less when rates rise &#8212; are they really worth less?</em> In the Sharma worldview, rising software and e-commerce total addressable market has made those two companies worth more than was previously anticipated; why should those gains go away if money gets more expensive?</p>
<p>We have to move not in absolutes, but in basis points, to get the argument here. Interest rates, when they do change, will change slowly. It doesn&#8217;t seem likely that many governments are going to rapidly spin the crank on the price of money. Changes will come gradually, and with caution.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pKHPhgMNpP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/">Introducing TechCrunch+, advice and analysis to help startups get ahead</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Introducing TechCrunch+, advice and analysis to help startups get ahead&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/embed/#?secret=pKHPhgMNpP" data-secret="pKHPhgMNpP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So aside from <em>sentiment</em> shifts that might lead to related asset price alterations, or wind up being more extreme than structural evolution, we shouldn&#8217;t really expect much change to the key dynamics of the market today when rates <em>begin</em> to rise. Or, more simply, a 25-basis-point change to the Fed target rate (0.25%) won&#8217;t mean much by itself unless more hikes are expected in a regular, rapid fashion.</p>
<p>The value of Amazon and Salesforce <em>probably</em> shouldn&#8217;t change much when the price of money <em>starts</em> to creep higher. If rates manage to hit 5%, then, sure, Amazon&#8217;s market cap will probably decline in relation to the value of other assets, but that&#8217;s more a comparative shift than a demand that Salesforce et al lose value.</p>
<p>Sharma is arguing the base case with a wink. He&#8217;s a software bull. But his question does raise a good point for us to chew on: When the underlying factors responsible for part of the boom in the value of software and the wave of investment into software do change, how quickly will valuations change? (Put another way, when what&#8217;s driving relative price appreciation of growth-oriented revenues compared to other assets and dollars flowing into SaaS changes, how fast will the results of those factors shift?)</p>
<p>Those anticipating a dramatic repricing of tech valuations by initial, incremental shifts to the price of money, I reckon, are expecting a bit more of an exclamation point than they will actually read.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/what-could-stop-the-startup-boom/">why The Exchange wrote the following the other week</a>, when discussing the current startup boom and its potential durability:</p>
<blockquote><p>But what we do think is possible to say with some certainty, or at least more than when a rebalancing of capital in the larger economy may occur, is that it will take a somewhat large shunt to knock the startup game off its current footing. Product demand coupled with funding interest is a killer combination for driving investment decisions — there’s capital chasing yield, and high-growth companies looking for capital. It’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O59JNz7rdIU">match made in heaven</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, many investors we’ve spoken to during this reporting cycle have been bullish about the quality of founders and startups they have the option of investing in. There’s not only market demand and capital, but what’s being built to answer the first with the help of the second is pretty good, at least in the view of the folks writing seven-, eight- and nine-figure checks to the startups in question.</p></blockquote>
<p>All business cycles cycle. All things that go up eventually lose some altitude. But the appetite for startup shares and tech shares more broadly won&#8217;t come back to Earth at 1 g. Instead, a more lunar-gravity descent seems more likely. Pending something new, of course.</p>

		Brett Lovelady is the founder of <a href="https://www.astrostudios.com/">Astro Studios</a>, now a part of PA Consulting, a design-driven company that empowers designers and strives to capture the value of design in the product, brand, experience and company creation process. 	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Around 90% of startups ultimately fail, and the reasons leading to failure are well known: Undercapitalization, scaling challenges, lack of a competitive advantage or realistic IP. However, what about the 10% that succeed? What did they do to beat the odds?</p>
<p>To create a pathway for market success, startups need two essential assets groups: venture capital and creative capital.</p>
<p>Venture capital is formed of the financial and operational assets invested in a new, unproven business enterprise. Creative capital comprises the design and development assets that bring an ingenious idea to life.</p>
<p>Venture capital gets the most attention, but it’s creative capital that can ultimately last longer and potentially become more valuable.</p>
<p>Billion-dollar unicorns like Airbnb, Lynda.com (now LinkedIn Learning), Square, YouTube, Byju’s and Pinterest have benefited from “creative” founders who were physical and digital product designers, educators, developers and visualizers. These companies found great success by creating and amplifying stories and visualizations to spark interest.</p>
<p>Venture capital usually arrives after rigorous assessments and due diligence cycles are completed. However, when creative capital is developed and applied before venture capital, it helps speed up these assessments and analysis of a company’s concept, often accelerating product deployment, reducing founders’ dilution and improving valuations.</p>
<h2>So what is creative capital?<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Depending on your industry, creative capital is defined as a mix of strategic assets that may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target audience insights and data.</li>
<li>Visualizations of products, services, experiences, etc.</li>
<li>Branding, naming and communication systems.</li>
<li>Product design and engineering prototypes.</li>
<li>Preliminary development cost projections.</li>
<li>Network partner sourcing and introductions.</li>
<li>Future product extensions and roadmaps.</li>
<li>Digital content, platforms and setup.</li>
<li>IP identification and development.</li>
<li>Advisory expertise for investors.</li>
</ul>
<p>These assets are almost always created to combine with business planning and introduction purposes, eventually helping companies bring their ideas to life.</p>
<h2>Why creative capital?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile spyware is one of the most invasive and targeted kinds of unregulated surveillance, since it can be used to track where you go, who you see and what you talk about. And because of its stealthy nature, mobile spyware can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/stalkerware-apps-google-ads/">be nearly impossible</a> to detect.</p>
<p>But now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">one Y Combinator-backed startup</a> is building an app with the aim of helping anyone identify potential <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">mobile spyware</a> on their phones.</p>
<p>Malloc, a Cyprus-based early-stage company, made its debut with <a href="https://www.mallocprivacy.com/mallocproducts/">Antistalker</a>, an app that monitors the sensors and apps running on a phone — initially for Android only — to detect if the microphone or camera is quietly activated or data transmitted without the user&#8217;s knowledge. That&#8217;s often a hallmark of consumer-grade spyware, which can also steal messages, photos, web browsing history and real-time location data from a victim&#8217;s phone without their permission.</p>
<p>The rising threat of spyware has prompted both <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211876">Apple</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#mic-camera-indicators">Google</a> to introduce indicators when a device&#8217;s microphone or camera are used. But some of the more elusive and more capable spyware — the spyware typically used by governments and nation states — can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security/">slip past the hardened defenses</a> built into iOS and Android.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Malloc says Antistalker comes in. Malloc&#8217;s co-founders Maria Terzi, Artemis Kontou and Liza Charalambous built the app around a machine learning (ML) model, which allows the app to detect and block device activity that could be construed as spyware recording or sending data.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208536" style="width: 1090px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208536" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2208536 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208536" class="wp-caption-text">Malloc co-founders Liza Charalambous (left), Maria Terzi (middle), Artemis Kontou (right). <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Malloc/supplied</p></div></p>
<p>Terzi, who specializes in ML, told TechCrunch that the startup trained its ML model using known stalkerware apps to help simulate real-world surveillance. Machine learning helps to improve the app&#8217;s ability to detect a broad range of new and previously unknown threats over time, rather than relying on the more traditional methods of scanning for signatures of known spyware apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already know applications that are spyware. Why don&#8217;t we use their behavior to train a machine learning model that will then be able to recognize new spyware?&#8221; Terzi told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The ML model runs on the device to be more privacy-preserving than sending data to the cloud. Malloc said it collects some anonymized data to improve the ML model over time, to help the app to detect more threats as they emerge on users&#8217; devices.</p>
<p>The app also looks for anomalous app activity, like bursts of data sent by apps that haven&#8217;t been used for days, and allows the user to look at which apps have accessed the microphone and camera and when.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bet that&#8217;s already catching the eyes of investors, with the startup securing close to $2 million from Y Combinator and the Urban Innovation Fund.</p>
<p>Terzi said the company has more than 80,000 monthly active users — and growing — since it launched earlier this year, and plans an enterprise offering to help companies protect their employees from surveillance threats. The company is also planning to launch an iOS app in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Car enthusiasts have a history of electric-car hesitancy. While some are fully on board with electrification and hybridization, there are still some petrol holdouts, especially at the rarified and pointy end-of-the-price spectrum like Lamborghini.</p>
<p>The push for electrification and hybrid powertrains poses a significant challenge to the carmaker known for creating striking, bespoke containers for some of the most powerful gasoline engines in the world, and there&#8217;s a small sense of reluctance about it from Lamborghini&#8217;s top brass.</p>
<p>Lamborghini has said it will shift all models to hybrid powertrains by 2024 and already announced one hybrid model, the exceedingly limited run Lamborghini Sián FKP 37 and the Countach LPI 800-4. By next year, the first production (i.e., not limited run) vehicle with a hybridized powertrain will be released, though Lamborghini is still mum on what exactly that will look like. While other supercar makers like Ferrari, McLaren and Porsche continue to make both production and limited run vehicles with hybrid powertrains, Lamborghini is one of the last supercar companies to get into the game.</p>
<p>Lamborghini hopes to leverage its loyal customers to innovate around the future of their iconic super sports cars.</p>
<h2>The future of fuel for Lamborghini</h2>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, we are super niche &#8212; and make up a very small part of the CO2 equation. But we want to do our part,&#8221; Andrea Baldi, the new North American CEO of Lamborghini said at a recent launch event for one of the last gas-powered Huracáns that Lamborghini will release, the Huracán STO. &#8220;The shift to hybrid, electric and alternative powertrains is forcing us to rethink performance and we&#8217;re not sure that electrification is the long-term direction to move in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether we release a fourth model with a hybrid or electric powertrain or find a solution for internal combustion that uses a different kind of fuel, we&#8217;re still learning. We need to deliver on a common target: Emotion and the authentic Lamborghini experience,&#8221; Baldi says.</p>
<p>He wouldn&#8217;t elaborate on specifics around the kind of fuel or technology the company might employ but Lamborghini CTO Maurizio Reggiani did allude to some interesting research that could point to a fully electrified Lamborghini in the future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Hybrid powertrains are the next frontier where we are sure we can innovate,&#8221; Reggiani said separately. &#8220;We exist because we have unique DNA. We are engineering emotion and there is some research we&#8217;re doing with the Polytechnic University in Milan on how physical events like vibration, for example, can impact the flow of emotion.&#8221; It&#8217;s possible to see a world where the physical effects of an ICE engine are simulated by gyroscopes and audio tracks.</p>
<p>Technically, Lamborghini&#8217;s factory in Sant&#8217;Agata Bolognese has been carbon neutral since 2015, Baldi says, but the 1,800-person company is part of the much larger, and much more carbon-emitting VW Group. Yet, despite its low volume of vehicles and a concerted push from the Italian government to exempt automakers like Lamborghini and Ferrari from the coming combustion engine ban, Lamborghini is being forced to move toward an alternative-fuel future.</p>
<p>Baldi says that one in 11,000 vehicles in the world is a Lamborghini, which is tiny compared to a massive automaker like Toyota or Honda. &#8220;Hybridization and electrification offer the opportunity to expand the future of emotion for the Lamborghini owner. You&#8217;re buying a dream. The majority of customers are looking for a car that expresses their success,&#8221; Baldi says. Yet, no matter how much Lamborghini customers want their combustion engines to continue well into the future, the time for those engines is coming to a close.</p>
<h2>Building a direct customer connection</h2>
<p>Meeting customer demands has always been at the heart of the Lamborghini brand and the company is leveraging its loyal owners to determine the future model direction as it works toward a 50% reduction in CO2 starting in 2025. The recent launch of the already sold out Countach LPI 800-4 at Pebble Beach is an example of how Lamborghini is using its customer base to create a new, high-demand product with a hybrid powertrain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t just create vehicles in a vacuum. The whole customer experience has enriched the bonds we have with our customers,&#8221; Baldi said. &#8220;The special project we did with the Countach &#8212; that was an exercise of trust directly between the company and the customer. We had 1-to-1 meetings as if they were friends and that helped inform what we did with Countach. Building that vehicle was an emotional decision and it was a good business case.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the advent of COVID and resulting limits on travel, factory visits were largely halted during 2020, but Lamborghini was ahead of the game having launched a digital platform called Unica, back in 2018, that allowed them to deliver the specialized customer contact and service that owners expect. The app can be downloaded to a smartphone and owners gain access to exclusive events, launches and social media. In order to sign up, you have to provide the VIN of your Lamborghini and your certificate of ownership.</p>
<p>The app has opened up the possibility of direct sales between the company and consumers, as a result. &#8220;Direct sales is where we need to explore. We are in an age of acceleration, and we want to have a direct relationship with customers. The question is how much can we expand the direct touch with customers?&#8221; Baldi said. &#8220;To ensure a sense that the value of the car will be preserved means we have to have high-touch customer relationships. The average wait for a car is currently more than a year, right now. The wait time is selling these cars and the value is preserved because we have direct contact with customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latest Lamborghini model, the Huracán STO, a street homologated race car, is currently sold out until 2022 and comes with added connectivity via the Unica app and the vehicle. The system allows owners to record lap times, throttle and brake input, steering angle and video of laps on a track and upload the data to the app. There, owners can share their information with other Lamborghini owners, their friends, the company or their race coaches to continue to improve their performance. It becomes a sort of elite social network for Lamborghini owners and offers the company a way to connect in more direct ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;Customers demand the right context to experience a Lamborghini,&#8221; Baldi said. &#8220;Supersport cars are expanding. If we can offer these experiences in auto lifestyle and motorsport, and expand to more high touch, customers will stay within the brand.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When sister duo Claudia and Carolina Recchi were first building <a href="https://www.edsights.io/">EdSights</a>, they used a big guiding question.</p>
<p>“In a perfect world [where] we somehow had a magic wand that allowed us to collect the data on whatever we want on our fingers, what would we want to know to prevent [college] students from dropping out?,” Claudia said. The co-founder’s first few years were spent understanding data points, whether it was helping connect students to the right resources or simply hearing their concerns and communicating them to decision-makers. They landed on using a chatbot as a service that could both effectively check in with college students and collect data in a timely way.</p>
<p>The chatbot got a deep injection of vulnerability amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, the startup began selling its services to universities in search of better ways to retain and engage students, especially as the pandemic locked down campus’ and left students more alone than ever.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Last year, EdSights&#8217; product was defined by its chatbot. Branded under the guise of a school’s mascot, the chatbot would send personalized questions and messages to students to understand their biggest stresses. It then would connect them to university resources ranging from financial aid to food and security services. EdSights sold the service to universities in search of better ways to retain and engage students, especially as the pandemic disrupted basic communication across the world.</p>
<p>The startup announced today that it has raised a $5 million Series A led by Album VC, the same firm that led early investments in Podium, Andela and Degreed. Other investors in the round include Lakehouse, Good Friends, Chegg CEO Dan Rosensweig and GSV Ventures’ Deborah Quazzo. With the new cash, EdSights’ total known capital raised to date is $8 million.</p>
<p>The new money isn’t without momentum. EdSights declined to share specific numbers, but shared that it sports 6x annual revenue growth. It also landed 70 customers, which can be colleges, institutions or universities, which is up from 16 last May. Co-founder Carolina Recchi, who built the company alongside her sister Claudia, said that their company is “very close to being profitable” and would be if they chose to stop hiring additional people. She estimates that EdSights will hit profitability in 14 months given these new growth goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>A constant challenge for EdSights is if it can spark action based off of the visibility that it provides. Universities notoriously deal with red tape, which could halt new initiatives or fast deployment, which could hurt how EdSights&#8217; return of investment plays out. The co-founders positioned a counterargument, saying that the student body data will help universities spend smarter on resources that students demand, and cut costs on newly irrelevant services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Universities are inefficient about how much money they spend, so I think we&#8217;re really uncovering when that happens,&#8221; Carolina said. &#8220;And I think that&#8217;s really why data is important&#8230;it&#8217;s the next phase of optimizing higher ed.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the startup doesn&#8217;t plan to just consult. Eventually, EdSights wants to start providing in-demand services such as mental health specialists, financial resources and career readiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you reach a certain level of scale and actually understand, what do we do about the areas in which the institution cannot help?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Is there someone else that can? And can that be us?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re changing the name of our membership product to TechCrunch+. We’re doing so for a few reasons but mainly because you know and trust TechCrunch to bring you the best alpha possible in the startup ecosystem. We also feel that the work the team is doing to provide our subscribers with a <em>more</em>, <em>better </em>and<em> deeper </em>signal isn’t “extra.” It’s table stakes to serve our kind of informed and dedicated audience.</p>
<p>Some TechCrunch+ updates will be rolling out on the site today, with more coming in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>TechCrunch+ provides advice and analysis to help startups. By joining, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Discover how successful startups operate through deep-dive interviews with founders and investors.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Spot trends and opportunities with market analysis, investor surveys and topical newsletters.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Get expert advice on fundraising, growth and management from experienced entrepreneurs.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Improve your pitch skills with live weekly coaching and Q&amp;A sessions, and watch replays on demand.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Browse TechCrunch distraction-free with a lighter ad experience.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Save 20% on TechCrunch event tickets (annual members only).</li>
</ul>
<p>Join TechCrunch+ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond the logo and name change, we&#8217;ve also expanded our offering to support more locations around the world. Within the next quarter, we hope to have access available in most major startup ecosystems on the planet and soon, everywhere.</p>
<p>TechCrunch+ includes more membership types than we had in 2019. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/08/how-to-claim-a-student-discount-for-extra-crunch/">Student, military and government discounts are available</a>, plus we also offer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/save-25-with-extra-crunch-group-membership/">group memberships</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we&#8217;ve improved our integration with our events business. Our weekly video series, Extra Crunch Live, is now a free product, and it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/check-out-the-amazing-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-cru-ahem-techcrunch-live/">has been renamed TechCrunch Live</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A few highlights from the event series include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/pilot-ceo-waseem-daher-tears-down-his-companys-60m-series-c-pitch-deck/">Pilot CEO Waseem Daher tears down his company’s $60M Series C pitch deck</a></li>

<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/vise-ceo-samir-vasavada-and-sequoias-shaun-maguire-break-down-the-art-of-the-pitch/">Vise CEO Samir Vasavada and Sequoia’s Shaun Maguire break down the art of the pitch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The response for the event has been positive and we want to bring the event series to more readers. While attendance for TechCrunch Live will be free, VOD will remain behind the paywall. VOD from other TechCrunch events like Disrupt will also stay behind the paywall. Expect further integration and activation opportunities with TechCrunch+ when events (hopefully) return to in-person in 2022.</p>
<p>Our customer support email has been changed to <a href="mailto:plus@techcrunch.com">plus@techcrunch.com</a>, and we have a new Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/techcrunchplus">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to all current members for supporting us. We hope to make the transition as seamless as possible.</p>
<p>A special thanks to the staff here at TechCrunch and the new TechCrunch+, who have built a product that has remained relevant and vital in a radically changing and challenging landscape. Here’s to the next phase of TechCrunch!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency company <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> is announcing a handful of new features. While the company is better known for its exchange that lets you convert USD into various cryptocurrencies, Coinbase wants to expand its consumer services so that you use the platform for different use cases with more financial services.</p>
<p>First, the company will soon <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/now-get-your-paycheck-deposited-into-coinbase-116fe1d073ce">launch</a> direct deposit in the U.S. This way, customers will be able to deposit a portion of their paycheck into Coinbase. Coinbase app users can find their current payroll company or employer and update paycheck allocation from there. The most extreme users will probably choose to deposit 100% of their paycheck into their Coinbase account.</p>
<p>Once the money hits your Coinbase account, you can choose what the company is supposed to do with your dollars. You can just keep everything in USD or you can choose to convert everything to a cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Users can choose any of the crypto assets available on the platform. This feature alone is particularly useful if you want to set up recurring buys without even having to think about it.</p>
<p>But direct deposit makes more sense when you realize that Coinbase also has its own <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/card">debit card</a> powered by <a href="https://www.marqeta.com">Marqeta</a>. It’s a Visa debit card that works with Apple Pay and Google Pay. It&#8217;s all about getting money in and out of your Coinbase account.</p>
<p>From the Coinbase app, you can choose the source wallet for your card transactions. Every time you make a purchase, Coinbase converts your crypto assets to USD with a 2.49% transaction fee.</p>
<p>Card transactions are also eligible to rewards. Current rewards include 1% back in DAI, ETH, DOGE or BTC, 4% back in GRT, XLM, AMP or RLY. So you spend a lot in transaction fees and you earn a bit in rewards.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Starting now, users can also choose to spend USD directly. In that case, there are no fees involved with card transactions. The company has been testing the Coinbase Card for a while, it’ll be available to everyone starting next month.</p>
<p>Coinbase is already an important financial app for millions of people in the U.S. Now that the company owns that relationship, it makes sense that it is adding new services to increase usage. That’s why Coinbase will also change the tabs in its mobile app with four new tabs —&nbsp;‘Assets’, ‘Trade’, ‘Pay’ and ‘For You’. And maybe some users will end up using the Coinbase app a bit more and their bank app a bit less.</p>

YouTube has acknowledged the situation on its <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-nbc-programming-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">official blog</a>, saying that it will drop its monthly price by $10 if the situation isn&#8217;t resolved and the content goes offline. If you&#8217;re a YouTube TV subscriber, you stand to lose NBC, USA Network, Golf Channel, Bravo, CNBC, Telemundo and <a href="https://youneedchannels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">eight other channels</a>.</p>
<p>According to YouTube, the dispute revolves around how much money its paying NBC Universal (NBCU) for its content. &#8220;For the duration of our agreement, YouTube TV seeks the same rates that services of a similar size get from NBCU so we can continue offering YouTube TV to members at a competitive and fair price,&#8221; the Google-owned service said. NBC said in a statement that it&#8217;s seeking &#8220;fair rates&#8221; from Google, adding that YouTube TV is &#8220;just days away from letting their contract expire.&#8221;</p>
<p>NBC Universal is trying to put some pressure on YouTube TV, <a href="https://youneedchannels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">asking users</a> to tweet at or chat with YouTube TV, or even switch providers. However, YouTube is saying that it will only renew &#8220;if NBCU offers us equitable terms&#8221; and said it would drop monthly prices by $10 from $64.99 to $54.99 while the channels are off the platform. It even encouraged users to sign up for NBC&#8217;s Peacock streaming service for $4.99 per month in order to retain NBCU content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re in countdown mode, folks. With just one month to go before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=5dayslefttosavepost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=5dayslefttosavepost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a>, the early-bird pass is living on borrowed time — five days to be precise. Take advantage of full event access at a discount price. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=5dayslefttosavepost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=5dayslefttosavepost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your pass</a> before the sale expires on <strong>October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong> and keep $100 in your wallet.</p>
<p>TC Sessions are known for their focused, deep dives into a specific tech sector, and this is our first time turning the spotlight on SaaS. The game is changing and expanding rapidly, and it’s the perfect time to examine where the next generation of SaaS startups is headed and what they’re creating.</p>
<p>You’ll hear from the industry’s leading voices — successful founders who scaled from startup to unicorn, CISOs offering advice about keeping the platforms safe and, of course, VCs sharing what characteristics they look for in SaaS products. Plus, real-world use cases and world-class networking.</p>
<p>Case in point: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/confluent-ceo-jay-kreps-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas-for-a-fireside-chat/">Jay Kreps</a>, the CEO and co-founder of Confluent, will join us for a conversation about processing massive amounts of streaming data in real time. He knows whereof he speaks — last year Confluent hit a $4.5 billion valuation and currently has a market cap of more than $17 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">Edna Conway</a>, the chief security and risk officer for Microsoft’s Azure, will join <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">Olivia Rose</a>, CISO and VP of IT and security at Amplitude, for a presentation called, <strong>SaaS Security, Today and Tomorrow</strong>. They’ll share their considerable expertise and explain what SaaS startups need to know about security now and in the future.</p>
<p>If fundraising’s on your mind don’t miss this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/sarah-guo-kobie-fuller-casey-aylward-headline-investor-panel-at-tc-sessions-saas/">panel discussion</a> with VCs Sarah Guo (Greylock), Kobie Fuller (Upfront Ventures) and Casey Aylward (Costanoa Ventures). All three possess a keen eye for SaaS startup success, and they’ll talk about what catches their attention.</p>
<p>Be sure to check <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">the event agenda</a> — we’re still adding to it — for lots more SaaS goodness.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And if you’ve never attended a TC Session, here’s what past attendees have told us about their experiences.</p>
<p>“TC Sessions: Mobility isn&#8217;t just an educational opportunity, it&#8217;s a real networking opportunity. Everyone was passionate and open to creating pilot programs or other partnerships. That was the most exciting part. And now — thanks to a conference connection — we’re talking with Goodyear&#8217;s Innovation Lab.” — Karin Maake, senior director of communications at FlashParking.</p>
<p>“Going to TechCrunch events, whether it’s Disrupt or the TC Sessions, helps me stay ahead of emerging trends, technologies and startups that affect the future of mobility.” — Rachael Wilcox, creative producer, Volvo Cars.</p>
<p>You have five days left to dive into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=5dayslefttosavepost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=5dayslefttosavepost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> at the early-bird price. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=5dayslefttosavepost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=5dayslefttosavepost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your pass</a> <strong>before prices go up October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>, and you’ll save $100.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok announced <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/1-billion-people-on-tiktok">in a blog post today</a> that 1 billion people use TikTok every month. That means that on this big rock in space that we call home, about one in seven-and-a-half people are regularly watching short-form videos of dancing, dangerous &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/tiktok-bans-viral-milk-crate-challenge-over-safety-concerns/">milk crate challenges</a>&#8221; and even actual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/tiktok-tests-a-learn-tab-to-showcase-education-and-how-to-videos/">educational content</a>.</p>
<p>For context, Facebook said that in June it had <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">2.9 billion monthly active users</a>, up 7% year over year. But TikTok&#8217;s growth is rapid &#8212; this new user data marks a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tiktok-hits-1-billion-monthly-active-users-globally-company-2021-09-27/">45% increase</a> in monthly active users since July 2020, when it had 689 million users. Plus, this July, TikTok became the first non-Facebook app to reach <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion">3 billion global downloads</a>, per app analytics firm SensorTower.</p>

<p>The competition that TikTok poses to Western tech giants is palpable &#8212; Instagram, owned by Facebook, has radically shifted its focus, declaring that it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-now-supports-60-second-videos-on-reels-its-tiktok-clone/">no longer a photo-sharing app</a>. Instagram is heavily promoting Reels, its TikTok clone, and even discussion forums like Reddit are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/reddit-is-quietly-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-button-on-ios/">enticed by the promise</a> of short-form video feeds. Instagram even advised creators that if they recycle watermarked TikToks as posts on Reels, the content will be <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLFMSunBRX1/">less discoverable</a>.</p>
<p>TikTok<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tiktok-hits-1-billion-monthly-active-users-globally-company-2021-09-27/"> said</a> that its biggest markets are in the United States, Europe, Brazil and Southeast Asia, even though its parent company ByteDance is headquartered in China. Of course, TikTok has faced severe regulatory threats in recent years &#8212; former President Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/biden-revokes-and-replace-trump-actions-targeting-tiktok-and-wechat-report/">attempted to block</a> U.S. business transactions with TikTok, and in India, home to 1.36 billion people, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/india-retains-ban-on-tiktok-uc-browser-and-57-other-chinese-apps/">TikTok has been banned</a> since last year.</p>
<p>Despite it all, TikTok continues to exhibit impressive growth. As recently as last month, TikTok parent ByteDance bought the VR hardware company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/tiktok-owner-bytedance-buys-a-top-virtual-reality-hardware-company/">Pico</a>, indicating a potential future expansion into VR. It&#8217;s not a coincidence that, all the while, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to turn his trillion-dollar platform into a &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">metaverse</a>&#8221; company. Anyone hungry for some popcorn?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Even if you are tired of IPOs, the direct listings from Amplitude and Warby Parker warrant your attention.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome to a two public-offering week. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/what-amplitudes-choice-to-direct-list-says-about-its-products-growth-and-value/">U.S software company Amplitude</a> is expected to post a direct-listing reference price this evening and begin trading tomorrow morning, per <a href="https://www.iposcoop.com/">publicly available</a> IPO calendars. Warby Parker is also set to <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/eyewear-maker-warby-parker-to-go-public-via-direct-listing-on-nyse-2021-08-24-0">direct list later</a> this week &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">more on its numbers here</a>.</p>
<p>Expect a raft of coverage from TechCrunch on both debuts.</p>
<p>Even if you are tired of IPOs, these two warrant your attention. The Amplitude debut is notable for its status as a direct listing that follows a large private-market fundraising. The company is pursuing a liquidity model that both leverages ample private fundraising and dodges pricing issues present in traditional IPOs that have irked many in the Silicon Valley chattering classes.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>And the Warby offering will help set &#8212; or correct &#8212; market sentiment regarding D2C companies; the unicorn isn&#8217;t even a technology company in the eyes of many. However, its DNA in e-commerce and venture-backed history keep it firmly in the TechCrunch wheelhouse, regardless. And it&#8217;s <em>also</em> pursuing a direct listing after raising private capital in recent quarters.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The two direct listings will help us figure out which side of the public-private divide is truly undervaluing startups. It&#8217;s either pesky bankers extracting unearned value from hardworking Silicon Valley types at graduation day, or it&#8217;s private-market investors irked that anyone else accretes upside from startups.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about how we&#8217;ll sort the matter.</p>
<h2>Raise, then direct list</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen a number of direct listings in recent years. Spotify is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/spotify-opens-at-165-90-valuing-company-at-30-billion/">perhaps the best remembered</a>. But Asana <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/asanas-strong-direct-listing-lights-alternative-path-to-public-market-for-saas-startups/">also went out via a direct listing</a>. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/wise-formerly-transferwise-confirms-direct-listing-on-the-lse-in-early-july-reportedly-at-a-6b-7b-valuation/">did Wise</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/can-squarespace-dodge-the-direct-listing-value-trap/">Squarespace</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups/">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">Roblox</a>.</p>
<p>Amplitude will also float without raising primary capital in its public debut. It raised a huge stack of funds earlier this year &#8212; $150 million at a valuation of just under $4.2 billion, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/amplitude-series-f--92399aff">per Crunchbase data</a>. This method of raising private capital and then direct listing decouples the traditional IPO, which combines a primary raise and a public flotation.</p>
<p>Another variation on the method is to direct list, later raising primary funds through a follow-on offering once the market has set what is perhaps a fairer price for the equity of the company in question. There is also work afoot to allow companies to direct list <em>and</em> raise primary capital, shifting pricing power from banks to public investors more directly. That final option is still more theory than applicable exercise.</p>
<p>So, unicorns that don&#8217;t want to pursue a traditional IPO can raise private funds before or after a direct listing in an attempt to get around the exorbitant first-day pops that some firms have recorded in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Roblox is an example of the raise-then-direct list method. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/roblox-files-to-go-public/">filed to go public</a> but shelved its IPO after seeing a few other companies storm out of the gate. The gaming company went on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/">raise private funds in early 2021</a>, and then direct list. Squarespace was similar: It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/squarespace-raises-300m-at-staggering-10b-valuation/">raised $300 million at a flat $10.0 billion valuation</a> (post-money) this March before direct listing in May.</p>
<p>This is the model that Amplitude and Warby Parker will test this week. The question it begs is simple: <em>Does raising private capital and then direct listing solve the pricing issue that traditional IPOs engender when bankers and institutional investors price the floating company at a lower value than what retail investors and others will pay for the same stock once it begins to trade?</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company will begin production of its first product offering, a variety of pork sausages, next year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berkeley-based cultured meat company <a href="https://newagemeats.com/">New Age Meats</a> announced Monday it raised $25 million in Series A funding that will enable the company to begin production of its first product offering, a variety of pork sausages, next year.</p>
<p>Hanwha Solutions of South Korea led the funding round and was joined by existing investors SOSV’s IndieBio, TechU Ventures, ff VC and Siddhi Capital.</p>
<p>CEO Brian Spears has a chemical engineering background and co-founded the company, which makes meat from animal cells, in 2018 after spending 12 years developing research laboratory and industry automation.</p>
<p>“We want to create a sustainable and humane process that delivers the same flavors, smell and experience in an affordable and accessible way,” he told TechCrunch. “Having the backing of Hanwha and our other investors, we can go after our mission to become the largest and most innovative meat company on Earth.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208247" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208247" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2208247" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg 5472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208247" class="wp-caption-text">Brian Spears speaking at Hello Tomorrow Singapore. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> New Age Meats</p></div></p>
<p>The Series A will enable the company to double its workforce, expand R&amp;D and build a 20,000-square-foot pilot manufacturing facility in Alameda. The investment follows $7 million of seed rounds previously raised from a group of backers including RXBAR founder Peter Rahal.</p>
<p>New Age Meats is starting with sausage because it is one of the foods that had the fastest way to market, but the company will eventually move into other meat categories like beef and chicken, Spears said.</p>
<p>He expects to be able to go to market in 2022, pending approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He also sees demand for products coming from markets that eat a lot of pork, like Asia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The cultured meat landscape is gaining new entrants as the technology has evolved. Spears said New Age is differentiating itself by concentrating on delivering on the experience for customers that like eating meat and doing it in a way that is scalable and affordable.</p>
<p>While Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat were some of the first in the meat alternative space, other companies have come into it with a focus on cultured meat and are also attracting venture capital; for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/animal-alternative-makes-a-platform-play-in-the-growing-market-of-cultured-meat/">Animal Alternative</a> and Eat Just’s Good Meat, which <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210920005307/en/GOOD-Meat-a-Division-of-Eat-Just-Inc.-Raises-267-Million-Adds-Former-USDA-Secretary-to-Advisory-Board">last week announced another $97 million</a> in funding.</p>
<p>Hanwha Solutions, which corresponded via email, said that its business mission aligned with New Age Meats and sees potential for growth in the cell-based pork market.</p>
<p>And, given worldwide efforts to address climate change, Hanwha “expected rapid market growth” in the food tech industry, particularly around cultured meat.</p>
<p>“Growing awareness for healthy food and animal rights will also fuel the demand,” the company said. “With its expertise in using cell technology to produce cultured meats, New Age Meats will help us expand our business horizon.”</p>

Now a startup that has built technology to make that process move faster and more efficiently is announcing a round of funding to address those enterprises&#8217; evolving needs. <a href="https://www.asteralabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astera Labs</a>, a fabless semiconductor company that builds connectivity solutions that help remove bottlenecks around high-bandwidth applications and help better allocate resources around enterprise data, has raised $50 million.</p>
<p>The Series C values the company at $950 million post-money, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>Fidelity Management and Research is leading the round with Atreides Management and Valor Equity Partners &#8212; two other new backers &#8212; also participating, and previous investors Avigdor Willenz Group, GlobalLink1 Capital, Intel Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures and VentureTech Alliance also participating.</p>
<p>Intel (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/intel-has-invested-132m-in-11-startups-this-year-on-track-for-300m-500m-in-total/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first invested in 2020</a>) is a strategic backer in this case, meaning a financial investor and significant customer. Sanjay Gajendra, Astera&#8217;s chief business officer, notes that the chip giant is collaborating with the startup to develop PCI Express and CXL (Compute Express Link) technology and products to &#8220;increase bandwidth, performance, and resource availability in next generation server and storage infrastructure.&#8221; With AI use cases being a central part of Intel&#8217;s next-generation growth strategy, these will be essential for building AI-based systems based on Intel&#8217;s processors, he said, adding that Aries Smart Retimers for PCIe are also featured in multiple reference designs and commercial platforms from Intel.</p>
<p>Other partners and customers include TSMC, Wistron, Samsung Electronics and Western Digital.</p>
<p>Prior to this, Santa Clara-based Astera had previously only raised $35 million in three years, which speaks to its own efficiency as a business, and the fact that it&#8217;s been generating healthy revenues already.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to join forces with Fidelity, Atreides, and Valor to cement our leadership position in intelligent cloud connectivity solutions and usher Astera Labs into the next growth phase of our company,” said Jitendra Mohan, CEO, Astera Labs, in a statement. “With this investment and increased collaboration with our manufacturing partners, we will rapidly scale our worldwide operations to satisfy incredible customer demand and launch multiple new product lines to solve the industry’s most pressing connectivity challenges.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest funding round, more specifically, is also coming on the back of what has been a relatively strong period for the company in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the shift it precipitated in migrations to the cloud among organizations.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;With a step-function increase in folks working/studying from home and relying on cloud-based SaaS/PaaS applications, the deployment of scalable hardware infrastructure has accelerated,&#8221; Gajendra said in an email to TechCrunch. He claims that solutions could provide up to double the bandwidth on the same infrastructure. &#8220;This has driven our sales demand from the world’s largest cloud operators by an estimated 25% to 30%.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Astera&#8217;s fabless approach is giving the company a faster route to scaling its technology and selling it on to more providers at a time when we are very much caught in a race for more bandwidth but also a finite amount of cost and resource for simply adding more capacity: this means that companies that are building solutions to improve the efficiency of systems that are already in place will continue to get a lot of attention from the market, and investors. This is an issue that extends to different aspects of enterprise IT: for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/firebolt-raises-127m-more-for-its-new-approach-to-cheaper-and-more-efficient-big-data-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebolt</a> is building architecture and algorithms to reduce the bandwidth needed specifically for handling big data analytics.</p>

<p>Avigdor Willenz is not only a founding investor in Astera Labs, but he was also one of the first to back other major processing startups, including Annapurna Labs (now owned by Amazon), Habana Labs (now owned by Intel) and many others. “Astera Labs has done a tremendous job in developing a portfolio of multiple innovative products that address critical needs of heterogeneous computing and composable disaggregation infrastructure,” said Willenz in a statement. For now, it looks like Astera is earmarked not as an exit but to stay the course to public company status, although the race for technology among the giants in the market may lead to a different outcome. “We are very pleased to see the strong execution track record and rapid value creation by Astera Labs, which has opened multiple options including an IPO in the future,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>“We are very excited with the growth and expansion of Astera Labs and remain highly optimistic about the long-term potential of the company,” added Stefan Dyckerhoff, MD at Sutter Hills Ventures and Board Member of Astera Labs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Space Force, the military branch spun out of the Air Force in December 2019, has announced its next batch of awards for projects related to next-gen rocket engine testing and upper-stage improvements.</p>
<p>The awards were granted by the Space Enterprise Consortium (SpEC), a program managed by the Space Force’s Space Systems Command. SpEC facilitates engagement between the U.S. Department and Defense and the space industry, by allowing its nearly 600 members to compete for contracts. The awards, which total $87.5 million, were granted to four launch companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue Origin, which will receive $24.3 million to develop cryogenic fluid management for the upper stage of the New Glenn rocket.</li>
<li>United Launch Alliance, which will get $24.3 million for uplink command and control for its new Vulcan Centaur two-stage heavy-lift rocket.</li>
<li>Rocket Lab, whose contract award is also $24.3 million, one of the highest in the company’s history. Those funds will go toward upper-stage development of the company’s forthcoming Neutron medium-lift rocket.</li>
<li>SpaceX, which will get $14.4 million for combustion stability analysis and testing of its Raptor rocket engine.</li>
</ul>
<p>SpaceX and ULA are already established launch providers for the U.S. government under the Space Force’s National Security Space Launch program. Both Rocket Lab and Blue Origin will be able to compete for the next series of launch procurement contracts in 2024. These latest contracts are a sign that the two companies are gearing up to submit their bids. (Blue Origin and Northrop Grumman lost to SpaceX and ULA in 2020.)</p>
<p>Regarding the new award, Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said in a statement that it is a “vote of confidence” in the Neutron rocket. “We’ve built a trusted launch system with Electron, and we’ll do it again with Neutron to continue providing unfettered access to space with our new heavier-lift vehicle.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K.&#8217;s competition watchdog has cleared Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of Kustomer, a maker of CRM tools.</p>
<p>The purchase was announced<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/"> last November</a> &#8212; with a price tag we reported as $1 billion &#8212; but is pending closing after facing regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>The U.K.&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an inquiry on the proposed merger this summer, at the end of July. The European Commission has also been digging into the implications of the deal, opening an investigation in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4021">August</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2kvsd8793q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/">Facebook buys Kustomer for $1B to expand into customer service tools</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook buys Kustomer for $1B to expand into customer service tools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/embed/#?secret=2kvsd8793q" data-secret="2kvsd8793q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6151a0da8fa8f5610b9c2208/Facebook.Kustomer_-_Summary_of_Phase_1_Decision_.pdf">summary</a> of its decision to greenlight Facebook&#8217;s latest bit of B2B shopping, the CMA said it looked at whether letting Facebook go ahead and scoop up the customer service software maker would dent competition by raising barriers to entry in the online display advertising market; whether Facebook might harm the competitiveness of customer service tools maker by limiting or degrading their access to its messaging channels; whether the tech giant might harm the competitiveness of other B2C messaging services by preventing them from integrating with Kustomer&#8217;s services; and whether Facebook could rely on cross-subsidizing from its online ads business to undercut competitors by offering Kustomer for free or on a freemium basis, thereby undermining the ability of others to compete.</p>
<p>For each concern (or &#8220;theory of harm&#8221;), the CMA goes on to explain that it was satisfied the acquisition did not meet the required bar of a &#8220;substantial lessening&#8221; of competition.</p>
<p>The small size of Kustomer appears to have helped allay concerns that letting Facebook assimilate the CRM maker might damage the wider market for such business tools.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The CMA considers that, even if some competitors would struggle to respond to Facebook offering Kustomer on a free or freemium basis, sufficient competitive constraints would remain,&#8221; the regulator writes in its conclusion on the last theory of harm, for example, adding that it &#8220;considers that the largest providers may be in a position to adopt a freemium model, or to develop a basic low-price CRM product targeted at small businesses, with the expectation that CRM revenues would increase as businesses’ needs grew&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most importantly, it is not necessary for other CRM providers to replicate the Merged Entity’s strategy in order to remain competitive,&#8221; it also writes. &#8220;While price is certainly an important dimension of competition, there are several other dimensions along which CRM providers could compete against the Merged Entity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the green light in a statement, a Facebook spokesperson sought to spin the clearance as a positive endorsement of the deal as a boon to competitors, writing: “We welcome the CMA’s decision, which shows that this deal is good for competition. The transaction will increase competition and bring more innovation to businesses and consumers in the dynamic and competitive CRM and business messaging spaces. More people will benefit from customer service that is faster, richer and available whenever and however they need it.”</p>
<p>While the CMA has decided there&#8217;s nothing to see here, the EU is still considering whether to clear Facebook-Kustomer. So the regulatory scrutiny continues.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s Kustomer buy could face EU probe after merger referral&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebooks-kustomer-buy-could-face-eu-probe-after-merger-referral/embed/#?secret=Ob9lmSmW05" data-secret="Ob9lmSmW05" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A Commission spokesperson had no comment on the CMA&#8217;s clearance &#8212; but confirmed its own &#8220;in-depth investigation&#8221; is ongoing, adding that there&#8217;s a provisional deadline of January 7, 2022, for EU regulators to take their own decision.</p>
<p>Despite the CMA&#8217;s relatively quick clearance of this particular Facebook purchase, the U.K. regulator does <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">continue to dig into competition concerns</a> attached to Facebook&#8217;s earlier acquisition of animated gif platform, Giphy.</p>
<p>After a finding of provisional concerns on Facebook-Giphy earlier this summer, it proposed remedies that could include ordering Facebook to unwind the acquisition &#8212; leading the tech giant to respond with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-fights-british-watchdog-retain-gif-maker-giphy-2021-09-08/">a stinging rebuttal of any harms</a>, earlier this month, accusing the regulator of making &#8220;fundamental errors&#8221; in its assessment of the competitive implications of that deal.</p>
<p>Regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech&#8217;s acquisitions in the region tends to focus on a fairly narrow consideration of competitive harms &#8212; such as how the CMA has looked at the Kustomer buy through the lens of the overall competitiveness of the CRM market.</p>
<p>However, in the Kustomer case, <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/questions-about-facebooks-acquisition-of-kustomer/">concerns</a> have also been raised about the privacy implications of letting adtech giant Facebook get its hands on the support service&#8217;s customer data given that the smaller company operates in sectors including <a href="https://www.kustomer.com/industry/healthcare/">the health sector</a> where it is likely to be processing sensitive information on behalf of its customers.</p>
<p>Back in February, for instance, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) raised a series of privacy concerns in a letter to Facebook &#8212; which it also <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/questions-about-facebooks-acquisition-of-kustomer/">published online</a>, querying what uses the tech giant would be making for customer data held by Kustomer and asking whether such data would be combined with any other data held by Facebook and Facebook-owned companies.</p>
<p>Months later the ICCL <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebooks-kustomer-buy-could-face-eu-probe-after-merger-referral/">said</a> it had not had any response from Facebook to the letter raising privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Despite Europe&#8217;s comprehensive data protection framework &#8212; which is supposed to help safeguard people&#8217;s digital information &#8212; competition watchdogs in the region rarely consider privacy implications as part of their assessments of digital markets.</p>
<p>And there have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power/">calls for more joined up working</a> between competition and privacy regulators in order to properly tackle the market effects and consumer harms that can flow from digital giants&#8217; command of other people&#8217;s information.</p>
<p>One outlier on this front is German&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office (FCO), which has been doing just that &#8212; in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/">pioneering case against Facebook&#8217;s superprofiling</a> (which is ongoing).</p>
<p>The FCO is <a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2021/23_07_2021_Facebook_Kustomer.html;jsessionid=56124766822035B0C7DD34AEA6AF42A1.2_cid362?nn=3591568">also looking at</a> whether Facebook&#8217;s plans to acquire Kustomer fall under the scope of German merger control rules.</p>

You&#8217;ll find the $5 tenders at Walmart and other major grocery chains starting in October, though only in select markets. Beyond expects to expand availability later this year.</p>
<p>The company says its tenders have 50 percent less saturated fat than ones made with actual chicken, and have no GMOs, antibiotics, hormones or cholesterol. Beyond uses faba beans rather than a soy-based recipe in its attempt to replicate the taste and texture of a chicken tender. It says you&#8217;ll be able to heat up the pre-cooked tenders in under 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Along with Walmart, Beyond&#8217;s tenders will be available at some Jewel-Osco, Safeway NorCal, Harris Teeter, Giant Foods and ShopRite stores at the outset. Meanwhile, Beyond says it&#8217;s increasing availability of its products at Walmart. It&#8217;ll bring Breakfast Sausage Patties to more than 1,300 additional stores, while more locations will offer Beyond Meatballs and Beyond Beef Crumbles.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy month in the plant-based meat alternative ecosystem. Beyond competitor Impossible started selling its &#8220;chicken&#8221; nuggets in restaurants <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-chicken-nuggets-130035016.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>a few weeks ago</ins></a>. Impossible also announced that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-foods-plant-based-pork-restaurants-us-hong-kong-singapore-233051113.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>restaurants will offer</ins></a> its version of ground pork in their dishes this fall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been an Extra Crunch summer. We&#8217;ve heard how to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/craft-your-pitch-deck-around-that-one-thing-that-can-really-hook-an-investor/">craft your pitch deck around the one thing that really hooks an investor</a>, and how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/how-retail-ziplines-series-a-pitch-deck-ticked-every-box-for-emergence-capital/">the industry experience of Retail Zipline&#8217;s Melissa Wong ticked every box for Emergence</a> when raising her Series A. And that&#8217;s just the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">tip of the iceberg</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also gotten a sneak peek at the Disrupt Startup Alley companies in our summer episodes of Extra Crunch Live: Startup Alley Edition.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more where that came from this fall. Without any further ado, check out the incredible speakers joining us on upcoming episodes of Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, we&#8217;re changing the name. Henceforth, ECL shall be known as TechCrunch Live. Here&#8217;s why: We realized that hanging out with TechCrunch in this context should be accessible to everyone. We interview startup founders and the investors that finance them to learn how the deal actually gets done, and we have folks in the audience pitch to get the expert feedback of our guests. Everyone should be able to benefit from that.</p>
<p>Because of that, we&#8217;re calling the series TechCrunch Live, as the live event hasn&#8217;t been an EC member perk for quite some time. Although the live portion is free upon registration, the video replays from TechCrunch Live will remain behind the paywall.</p>
<p>So, let me try that again.</p>
<p>Here are the upcoming speakers joining us on TechCrunch Live in October.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Nicole Quinn (Lightspeed Venture Partners) + Vlad Novakovski (Lunchclub)</h3>

Her portfolio includes Cameo, Zola, Goop, Calm and Haus Laboratories, among others. Hear Quinn and Lunchclub founder Vlad Novakovski talk through how they came together for the startup&#8217;s Series A, and get their feedback on your startup&#8217;s elevator pitch!</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>. I <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">also tweet</a>.</p>
<p>A few things this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram is pausing work on the kids-focused version of its social service. It claims that the product is the right thing to build, but that it wants to talk to folks about why, first. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/">TechCrunch has more here</a>.</li>
<li>Shares of Box are up this morning, after the company endured a period of time in the wilderness.</li>
<li>Google is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/26/google-lowers-its-cloud-marketplace-revenue-share-to-3percent-from-20percent.html">cutting its cloud app marketplace take rate</a> as marketplaces more broadly lose their ability to accrete economic value as middlepeople.</li>
<li>Spotify is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-kicks-off-campaign-to-win-more-advertisers-11632736800?mod=djemalertNEWS">spending to advertise its advertising solution</a> so that others can spend more money on Spotify.</li>
<li>Swiss startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/frontify-raises-50m-for-a-collaborative-cloud-platform-for-organizations-to-manage-and-use-their-design-and-brand-assets/">Frontify raises $50 million</a>, more than double its previous round&#8217;s size.</li>
<li>And from Sweden, EV company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/26/swedish-ev-maker-polestar-reportedly-preparing-to-go-spac-at-21b-valuation/">Polestar may go public via a SPAC</a>, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/e-motorcycle-maker-cake-closes-60m-round-to-scale-production-and-retail-sales/">EV company Cake raises $60 million</a>. Nice to see Sweden do so well in a key business category.</li>
<li>Tesla is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/the-station-tesla-rolls-out-its-fsd-beta-button-delivery-deals-heat-up-micromobility-evolves/">doing FSD stuff</a>, which confuses us.</li>
<li>And looking ahead, Amplitude will set a reference price this evening and direct list tomorrow. Warby Parker will set an IPO price tomorrow evening, and trade on Wednesday.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s that! Chat Wednesday!</p>
