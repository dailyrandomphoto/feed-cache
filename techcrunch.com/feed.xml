										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bangalore-based <a href="https://www.cred.club/">CRED</a> is kickstarting the new year on a high note.</p>
<p>The two-year-old startup, led by high-profile entrepreneur <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/kunal-shah-2" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="kunal-shah-2">Kunal Shah, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said on Monday it has raised $81 million in a new financing round and bought shares worth $1.2 million (about 90 million Indian rupees) from employees.</p>
<p>The Series C financing round, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/india-cred-raises-80-million-funding/">first reported by TechCrunch in late November</a>, was led by DST Global. Existing investors Sequoia Capital, Ribbit Capital, Tiger Global, and General Catalyst also participated in the round, and so did a few new names including Satyan Gajwani of Indian conglomerate Times Internet, Sofina, and Coatue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round gave <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cred-6ab0" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cred-6ab0">CRED <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; which operates an eponymous app to reward customers for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/india-cred-kunal-shah/">paying their credit card bill on time</a> and offers deals from interesting online brands &#8212; a post-money valuation of $806 million.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Shah said that about 10 percent of CRED’s captable is currently allocated to employees and those who held vested stocks were eligible to sell up to 50 percent of their shares back to the startup in its first ESOP liquidity program. &#8220;We believe that startups should think about creating wealth for every shareholder, including employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>CRED has nearly doubled its customer base to about 5.9 million in the past year, or about 20 percent of the credit card holder base in India. The startup said that the median credit score of its customer was about 830, and about 30 percent of its customer base today holds a premium credit card. (On a side note, more than 50 percent of CRED customers pay their bills using UPI.)</p>
<p>CRED is one of the most talked about startups in India, in part because of the scale at which its valuation has soared and the amount of capital it has been able to raise in such a short period.</p>
<p>One of the biggest questions surrounding CRED today is just how it makes money, given how most fintech startups in the country today &#8212; and there are many of them &#8212; are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">struggling to find a business model</a>.</p>
<p>Shah said CRED makes money by cross-selling financing products &#8212; for which it has a revenue-sharing arrangement with banks and other financial institutions &#8212; and levies a similar cut from merchants who are on the platform today. More than 1,300 brands including big names Starbucks, TAGG, Eat.Fit, Nykaa, and emerging premium direct-to-consumer brands such as The Man Company, Sleepy Cat, and Crossbeats have joined the platform in recent years.</p>
<p>Direct-to-consumer market in India is still in its nascent stage, though <a href="https://truegrit.substack.com/p/d2c-social-commerce-and-saas-three">some estimates</a> say it could be worth $100 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we were very deliberate to make D2C happen. It just so happened that in the early days when we offered rewards for D2C brands, they started to see huge traction,&#8221; he said, adding that CRED drove more than 30 percent sales for some brands.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that we were able to solve the discovery problem for customers. We are approaching this with themes &#8212; work-from-home and coffee &#8212; and it&#8217;s working out well. We are now playing matchmaking role between customers and brands that otherwise had to spend a lot of money in marketing.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the biggest propositions of CRED is that it has been able to court some of the most sought-after customers in India. Unlike many other startups and giants such as Google and Facebook, CRED is not going after the next billion users.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 20 million customers account for 90 percent of all online consumption in India. These are the customers we are focusing on,&#8221; said Shah, who previously ran financial services firm Freecharge and delivered one of the rare successful exits in the country. The core challenge in chasing customers in smaller cities and towns in India is that very few people have the financial capacity to buy things, Shah said.</p>
<p>For that model to work, the GDP of India &#8212; where the average annual income of an individual is about $2,000 &#8212; needs to grow. And for that, we need more participation from females, said Shah. Less than 10 percent of the female population in India are currently part of the workforce, compared to over 90 percent in China.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://twitter.com/sajithpai/status/1343953446030872576">interesting use case</a> for CRED today is that it could potentially license data about the traction D2C brands are seeing on its platform to venture firms, who could use it as a signal to inform their investment decisions.</p>
<p>Shah cautioned that the startup is &#8220;extraordinarily sensitive about data&#8221; but said the team is thinking about ways to help venture firms discover these firms. &#8220;We are planning to create a newsletter to showcase many of these brands to the investor world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>And finally, will CRED launch a credit card? &#8220;Will we cross-sell every product that banks today offer? The answer is yes,&#8221; said Shah, though he cautioned that the startup is in no hurry to supercharge its offerings and will likely engage with other players in the industry to enable these services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The battle is heating up between <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and its Chinese challenger Xpeng as the latter makes clearer its stance on the future of autonomous driving. Over the weekend, Xpeng, which counts Xiaomi and Alibaba among its investors, <a href="https://www.livoxtech.com/news/14">announced</a> that it will be using lidar sensors from Livox, a startup with closes ties to the Chinese drone giant DJI.</p>
<p>The choice of remote sensing technology lidar and a Chinese supplier reflects the complexities of the U.S.-China tech war. Tesla has accused Xpeng of alleged intellectual property theft, a claim that the Chinese electric vehicle maker repeatedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/19/china-ev-xpeng-500-million/">denied</a>. In a turn that surprises some industry experts, Xpeng <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329812658829324304?lang=en">said</a> it will be adding lidar to its mass-produced autonomous cars in 2021, a strategy that would differentiate it from Tesla. Having seen Xpeng&#8217;s announcement, Elon Musk scoffed that Xpeng lacks Tesla&#8217;s technology.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Musk has long dismissed the use of lidar in autonomous driving, calling the technology &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/anyone-relying-on-lidar-is-doomed-elon-musk-says/">expensive sensors that are unnecessary</a>.&#8221; Instead, Tesla relies on neural network training and camera-enabled visual recognition for its autonomous vehicles. Some Chinese players agree with Musk&#8217;s vision. Daimler-backed Momenta, for instance, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/momenta-robotaxis/">betting on</a> less expensive millimeter-wave radars and high-definition cameras.</p>
<p>Xpeng already utilizes several sources to collect data: camera, millimeter-wave radar, ultrasonic, among other sensors. The addition of lidar, it says, will &#8220;provide a greater level of safety redundancy,&#8221; which allows a self-driving car to continue operating even when the primary system component fails, &#8220;by allowing more accurate imaging of the road situation.&#8221; Lidar will also &#8220;enhance target detection, measurement accuracy, performance in low ambient light and other challenging perception conditions,&#8221; the company claims.</p>
<p>The choice of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/livox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="livox">Livox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is also intriguing. There are mature foreign options such as Velodyne and Luminar, but Xpeng&#8217;s pick is expected given the Chinese government&#8217;s push for technological autonomy in key industries. In China, Livox faces some strong opponents like <a href="https://www.hesaitech.com/en/about">Hesai</a>, which is backed by Bosch and Chinese search giant Baidu, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/robosense/company_financials">Robosense</a>, which has fundings from state-backed carmakers BAIC and SAIC.</p>
<p>Livox itself was founded as an &#8220;independent company&#8221; in 2016 through <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dji" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dji">DJI&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> internal incubation program, according to the startup&#8217;s own <a href="https://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-showcases-wide-product-portfolio-at-ces-2020">description</a>. One of its selling points has been to lower the price point of lidar, which the company claims is made possible by its unique<a href="https://www.livoxtech.com/news/4"> optoelectronic scanning method</a>.</p>
<p>The foray into autonomous driving is fitting as DJI has been pivoting to B2B businesses like agriculture drones. But the giant&#8217;s relationship with the lidar startup remains mystic, at least from the public viewpoint. Livox&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-showcases-wide-product-portfolio-at-ces-2020">company boilerplate</a> states it is &#8220;backed by DJI&#8217;s deep expertise in sensor innovation and hardware manufacturing&#8221; and its products are sold through <a href="https://store.dji.com/product/livox-horizon-lidar">DJI&#8217;s official retail store</a>. Other than that, it hasn&#8217;t addressed whether DJI holds any equity in it or has controlling power over its management.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Livox is &#8220;just a team within DJI, which was later positioned as a separate company&#8221; while enjoying access to DJI resources including manufacturing and supply chain &#8220;just like another product brand,&#8221; a person with knowledge of the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>One possible motive for Livox&#8217;s deliberate distancing from DJI is to avoid potential scrutiny from the U.S. government, which sees lidar as a key area in the tech war with China, the person said. DJI was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/dji-added-to-commerce-department-entity-list/">recently added</a> to the U.S. government&#8217;s trade blacklist, which has sanctioned other Chinese tech titans like Huawei and SenseTime from accessing key components from U.S. suppliers. Frank Wang, founder and chief executive of DJI, is also believed to want less public attention.</p>
<p>Livox and DJI couldn&#8217;t be immediately reached for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tmytek.com/">TMYTEK</a> recently raised a Series A+ round of about $10 million for products that make it easier to test 5G millimeter wave equipment. So far, the company’s clients include KDDI, NTT DoCoMo and research institutions. But the Taiwanese startup has aspirations to sell its own base stations, too, competing with well-established players like Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. TMYTEK plans to use its expertise, gleaned from helping other researchers develop 5G infrastructure, to create what its chief executive officer describes as a &#8220;complete 5G industrial chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its latest funding round was led by TMYTEK’s manufacturing partner Inventec, one of the largest OEMs in Taiwan, and brings the startup’s total funding so far to $13.3 million. Other investors included Taisic Materials, ITEQ, Tamagawa Electronics, and Taiwan’s National Development Fund. TMYTEK also recently took part in SparkLabs Taipei’s accelerator program.</p>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Su-Wei Chang told TechCrunch that it plans to raise a Series B next to develop and commercialize its base stations. To get ready for its base station business, TMYTEK recently joined the <a href="https://www.o-ran.org">O-RAN Alliance</a>, founded by some of the world’s biggest telecoms to create more interoperable mobile networks, in a bid to encourage the development of new technology and faster deployment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chang said TMYTEK’s base in Taiwan gives it a strategic advantage. 5G manufacturing is an important part of Taiwan’s economy, with exports <a href="https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2020/12/taiwan-telecom-industry-enters-5g/">reaching record highs during the second half of 2020</a>, thanks in part to demand for 5G-related equipment and technology for smartphones, autonomous vehicles and smart devices.</p>
<p>Chang studied at University of Massachusetts Amherst and when TMYTEK was founded six years ago, he was often asked why he didn’t stay in the United States, where it would have been easier to secure startup funding. But being in Taiwan puts the company closer to many important markets, including Japan, where 30% of its current business comes from, and gives TMYTEK a good foundation to expand into the U.S. and European market, he said.</p>
<p>It has also given the company a supply chain advantage. TMYTEK has manufacturing partners across Asia, including Inventec in Taiwan, and factories in Vietnam and Thailand, in addition to China. Chang said this means TMYTEK was not limited by the COVID-19 pandemic or the U.S-China trade war.</p>
<p>Before launching TMYTEK in 2014, Chang and co-founder Ethan Lin both worked at Academia Sinica, one of the top research institutions in Taiwan, where they focused on millimeter waves even though at the time most researchers were more interested in the mid-band spectrum.</p>
<p>But as more devices and applications began to crowd the 4G spectrum, mmWave became less niche. With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/qualcomm-launches-its-next-gen-5g-modem-and-mmwave-antenna">Qualcomm’s launch</a> of next-generation 5G mmWave hardware and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/qualcomm-announces-the-new-snapdragon-888-chip/">chips</a>, and more carriers launching mmWave coverage, mmWave is poised to become mainstream.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="V52tHQGoMT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/qualcomm-launches-its-next-gen-5g-modem-and-mmwave-antenna/">Qualcomm launches its next-gen 5G modem and mmWave antenna</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Qualcomm launches its next-gen 5G modem and mmWave antenna&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/qualcomm-launches-its-next-gen-5g-modem-and-mmwave-antenna/embed/#?secret=V52tHQGoMT" data-secret="V52tHQGoMT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Millimeter waves offer powerful signals with wide bandwidth and low latency, but drawbacks include difficulty traveling through obstacles like buildings. It also has a limited range, which is why millimeter waves need more base stations. Beamforming, which directs signals toward a specific device, and antenna array, or multiple antennas that work like a single antenna, are used to extend its coverage.</p>
<h2>Making mmWave development faster</h2>
<p>One of the main challenges for the millimeter wave market, however, is the lack of R&amp;D tools to speed up their development and time to market, resulting in higher costs and slower deployment.</p>
<p>To keep up with market opportunities, TMYTEK transitioned from design and manufacturing projects for clients to offering 5G-focused solutions like the BBox, which stands for &#8220;beamforming box.&#8221; The BBox was created after a professor at National Taiwan University told Chang that his team was working on antenna design, but didn’t have the resources to work on beamforming technology, too. It lets researchers create 16 beams and control the signal&#8217;s amplitude and phase with software, so they can test how it works with antennas and other hardware more quickly. TMYTEK claims the BBox can save researchers and engineers up to 80% in time and cost.</p>
<p>Chang said TMYTEK realized that if researchers at NTU, one of Taiwan’s largest research universities, needed a solution, then other labs did, too. So far, it has delivered 30 sets to companies including KDDI, NTT DoCoMo, Fujitsu, several Fortune 500 companies and research institutions.</p>
<p>While the BBox was created for antenna designers, the company also began exploring solutions to help other designers, including algorithm developers who want to test beam tracking, communicate with base stations and collect data.</p>

<p>For that scenario, TMYTEK created the XBeam, which is describes as a &#8220;total solution,&#8221; and is meant for the mass production phase, testing modules, smartphones and base stations before they are shipped. Traditional solutions to test modules rely on mechanical rotators, but Chang said this is more suited to the research and development process. The XBeam, which is based on the BBox, electronically scans beams instead. The company claims the XBeam is up to 20 times faster than other testing solutions.</p>
<p>TMYTEK created the XBeam’s prototype in 2019 and launched the commercialized version in November 2020.</p>
<p>The BBox and XBeam will help TMYTEK build its own base station business in two ways, Chang said. First, having its own solutions will allow TMYTEK to test base stations and bring them to market faster. Second, the startup hopes building a reputation on effective research and development tools will help it market its base stations to private and public networks. This is especially important to TMYTEK’s ambitions since their base stations will be up against products from major players like Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei.</p>
<p>“Our advantage at TMYTEK is that we’re doing the design and we have good partners for manufacturing. Inventec, our investor, is a top five manufacturer in Taiwan,” he said. “And TMYTEK also builds our own testing solution, so our value is that we can provide a total solution to our customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. Samsung’s next flagship is set to debut January 14. The company just confirmed earlier rumors surrounding the date for its next Unpacked event (virtually, of course). This one sports the name, &#8220;Welcome to the Everyday Epic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past year, mobile technology has taken center stage in everyday life as people are working remotely and spending more time at home,&#8221; the company writes. &#8220;The accelerated transition to a mobile-first world brings with it the need for devices that can transform everyday life into an extraordinary experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event’s timing is an interesting artifact of 2021’s wacky show scheduling, with the COVID-19 pandemic still very much being front of mind. Past Unpackeds were generally timed around Mobile World Congress. That show has been delayed until the summer, however, in hopes of returning to an in-person event. So Samsung has opted to kickstart sales a month or so earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, the event is a mere days after CES. Gone are the days a gadget journalist could take a few days to decompress after the year’s biggest hardware show. It also, perhaps, doesn’t bode well for Samsung’s announcements during CES itself (though the electronics giant has more than enough divisions to keep its presence at the show interesting).</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cGTjx0JV_0Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Another odd change this year is the fact that you can already reserve the S21, sight unseen. There’s little doubt it will be a solid phone, though there are plenty of questions around how the company will up the ante in the era of flagging smartphone sales. The leaks so far have been kind of underwhelming, though Samsung’s usually got a couple of fun surprises up its sleeve.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen enough of the Galaxy Buds Pro that they don’t qualify as a surprise, exactly. But the company has a solid enough track record with earbuds that there’s reason to be excited. The AirPods Pro competitors are are said to be priced at a reasonable $199.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/t-mobile" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="t-mobile">T-Mobile, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the third largest cell carrier in the U.S. after completing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/t-mobile-officially-completes-merger-with-sprint-ceo-john-legere-steps-down-ahead-of-schedule/">its recent $26 billion merger with Sprint</a>, ended 2020 by announcing its second data breach of the year.</p>
<p>The cell giant said <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/security-incident">in a notice buried on its website</a> that it recently discovered unauthorized access to some customers&#8217; account information, including the data that T-Mobile makes and collects on its customers in order to provide cell service.</p>
<p>From the notice: &#8220;Our cybersecurity team recently discovered and shut down malicious, unauthorized access to some information related to your T-Mobile account. We immediately started an investigation, with assistance from leading cybersecurity forensics experts, to determine what happened and what information was involved. We also immediately reported this matter to federal law enforcement and are now in the process of notifying impacted customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Known as customer proprietary network information (CPNI), this data can include call records — such as when a call was made, for how long, the caller&#8217;s phone number and the destination phone numbers for each call, and other information that might be found on the customer&#8217;s bill.</p>
<p>But the company said that the hackers did not access names, home or email addresses, financial data, and account passwords (or PINs).</p>
<p>A spokesperson for T-Mobile said the breach happened in early December, and affects about 0.2% of all T-Mobile customers — or approximately 200,000 customers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest security incident to hit the cell giant in recent years.</p>
<p>In 2018, T-Mobile said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/24/t-mobile-says-hackers-stole-customer-data-in-data-breach/">as many as two million customers</a> may have had their personal information scraped. A year later, the company confirmed hackers accessed records <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/more-than-1-million-t-mobile-customers-exposed-by-breach/">on another million prepaid customers</a>. Just months into 2020, T-Mobile <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/t-mobile-says-hacker-gained-access-to-employee-email-accounts-user-data/">admitted a breach</a> on its email systems that saw hackers access some T-Mobile employee email accounts, exposing some customer data.</p>

And it’s probably also fair to say that most of us have watched, sometimes with a metaphorical bucket of buttered popcorn, as companies crisis-comms their ways out of … crises. But most of us do not know what goes on behind the scenes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.getluckie.net/">Mark S. Luckie</a> has an idea. The digital strategist, journalist and author of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Journalists-Handbook-Mark-Luckie/dp/1450565603/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mark+luckie&amp;qid=1609629885&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-3">The Digital Journalist’s Handbook</a>” and “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/DO-U-Mark-Luckie-ebook/dp/B014TBNT9O/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mark+luckie&amp;qid=1609629885&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2">DO U</a>,” has written “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Valley-Girls-Mark-S-Luckie/dp/0578778564/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mark+luckie&amp;qid=1609629857&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">Valley Girls</a>,” a fictional portrayal of life behind the social curtain at popular tech company Elemynt. Particularly the journey of main character Kelsey Pace, as she navigates life as a communications manager for the company. Having worked in strategy and partnership positions at Facebook, Twitter and Reddit, Luckie tells us he was most interested in exploring how the actual conversations about diversity work inside of tech companies.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1238543" style="width: 498px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1238543" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1238543" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/photo1.jpg?w=300" alt="Valley Girls Author Mark S.

<p>“The most that people the most insight that people have is diversity reports, which of course are published from the tech companies, but not an idea of ‘Okay, what&#8217;s really going on?’ And so that&#8217;s what &#8216;Valley Girls&#8217; aims to explore &#8212; what&#8217;s really going on? How bad is diversity? What are the things that are happening or not happening? What is the employee attitude towards it? One of the big narratives is what are the contentions between employees and executives to actually furthering diversity within these companies?”</p>
<p>Tech watchers will read “Valley Girls” and perhaps be able to identify what company drama he is referring to when he mentions this Congressional hearing or that anonymous memo. This, Luckie says, was on purpose.</p>
<p>“It is a merging of the narratives. So yeah, anyone who follows tech or works around tech will be able to … say, ‘Okay, this reminds me of this, it reminds me of this.’ And because like I said, all these experiences are not isolated from each other. They&#8217;re woven into each other.”</p>
<p>With “Valley Girls,” Luckie says he wanted to explore the personal conflict that can emerge while working at one of these companies. He did that and more.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not a ton happened this week so I figured I’d use the time to look back on some of the more notable labor stories of 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h3><b>Gig workers vs. Uber, Lyft, Instacart et al.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California’s Proposition 22, backed by gig companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash, passed to ensure gig workers are classified as independent contractors. It was an important proposition that resulted in the yes side contributing north of $200 million to its efforts. But the fight isn’t over, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which you can read about here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><b>Amazon’s stumbles</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon faced a number of labor disputes throughout the year &#8212; many of them involving its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-faces-lawsuit-alleging-failure-to-provide-ppe-to-workers-during-pandemic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">warehouse workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7jz7b/amazon-employee-warns-internal-groups-theyre-being-monitored-for-labor-organizing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveillance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example: Christian Smalls, a former Amazon warehouse worker, was fired from Amazon in March after organizing a walkout at one of the company’s fulfillment centers in Staten Island. As a result, New York’s attorney general is investigating if Amazon violated federal worker safety laws and New York state’s whistleblower protections laws by firing Smalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smalls’ termination helped galvanize other warehouse workers who later formed an international organization to demand change inside Amazon’s warehouses. Organizers pointed to worker retaliation as one of the driving factors for the formation of Amazon Workers International. Meanwhile, Amazon executives reportedly discussed discrediting Smalls and making him the face of the organizing movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Amazon spokesperson previously told TechCrunch the company did not fire Smalls for organizing a protest. Instead, Amazon said it fired him for “putting the health and safety of others at risk and violations of his terms of employment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, Smalls filed a lawsuit against Amazon alleging the company failed to provide PPE to its workers.</span></p>
<h3><b>Tech workers unionize </b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/kickstarter-workers-vote-to-unionize/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kickstarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Glitch became two of the first tech companies to unionize. Kickstarter workers voted to unionize in February. A month later, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/online-code-collaboration-tool-glitch-votes-to-unionize/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workers at Glitch voted to unionize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, at least ten tech companies were actively looking to form unions, Grace Reckers, the lead northeast union organizer of OPEIU, told TechCrunch at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Employees are seeing that they don’t actually have control of how the products they make are being used,” she said. “Even though most of the messaging in Silicon Valley is about creating a better world for us, making our lives easier and innovating, it also moves under the philosophy of move fast and break things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Disclosure:</em> My partner works at Glitch and serves on the union’s bargaining committee.</span></p>
<h3><b>Pinterest finds itself under heavy scrutiny </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two former Pinterest employees, Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spoke out about racial and gender discrimination at the company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Shortly after, Pinterest’s former COO Francoise Brougher </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued the company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alleging gender discrimination. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/pinterest-settles-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-with-former-coo-for-22-5-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest settled the suit for $22.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Ozoma and Banks described to me a double standard in their experiences compared to Brougher’s. While Brougher received a $20 million payout, Ozoma and Banks received less than one year’s worth of severance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This follows the time-honored tradition in America where Black women come forward, blazing a trail, revealing injustice and white women coming in and reaping all the benefits of that,” Banks told me.</span></p>

Gebru sent that email after Google did not grant her permission to attach her and her colleagues&#8217; names to an AI ethics paper about language models. Gebru had previously sent her superiors an email, detailing that if they would not meet her specific conditions she would prepare to leave. Google proceeded to tell her it accepted her resignation and cut off her access to her work email. </span></p>

She also acknowledged that her drive for success and scaling quickly “came at the expense of a healthy and sustainable culture that matched our projected values, and workplace practices that made our team feel valued and respected.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That meant, Gelman said, The Wing “had not subverted the historical oppression and racist roots of the hospitality industry; we had dressed it up as a kindler [sic], gentler version.”</span></p>

<p>My big question for 2021, and the one that is on every startup&#8217;s mind, is how will a cataclysmic event such as a global pandemic show up in post-pandemic innovation? I think we’re in the early innings of seeing what ‘aha moments’ have materialized into companies. And we won’t know the pandemic’s true impact on our psyches until the dust settles and we have an opportunity to reflect.</p>
<p>We do know it will be fascinating to watch. In 2020, innovators and investors were forced to stand still, and witness cracks, fractures, and rubble in society in a way like never before. It was a humbling year that, for much of the tech community, was mostly spent inside, away, and alone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One reaction I’ve noticed so far &#8211; that isn’t necessarily new but comes with new weight &#8211; is a rush of innovation that focuses on reducing friction. Take trends like the rise of building in public or the unbundling of venture capital. Or remote work’s shift from enabling communication to now needing to enable passive and active collaboration. Apply the same idea to mental health, education, and fitness. Heck, we’re even seeing people take the Y Combinator format and apply it to anything that makes sense, from helping operators turn into investors to helping employees try to turn their side gig into a full-time company.</p>
<p>While these movements didn’t begin because of the coronavirus, they all seem to have a huge, pandemic-sized asterisk next to it.</p>
<p>It would be easy to dismiss these movements as small and inconsequential. But, as my colleague and fellow Equity co-host Danny Crichton <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/zfellows-offers-10k-to-stop-what-youre-doing-for-a-week-and-work-on-a-side-project/ ">pointed out this week</a>, “sometimes the most important changes in venture and startups more generally have come from lowering that last bit of friction to action.”</p>
<p>Lowering friction feels like the mantra we all need to enter 2021 with.</p>
<p>I already have hope that innovation will come from a more diverse set of people, whether it’s in a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/theres-no-hacker-house-geared-toward-undergraduate-women-so-they-created-one-of-their-own/ "> hacker house for undergraduate women</a> or a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/develop-for-good-student-volunteers/"> student-founded service that matches undergraduate students to non-profits</a>. So, as we enter the new year &#8212; and bear with me here &#8211; I urge you to be optimistic.</p>
<p>The last year in tech hasn’t left people exhausted and hopeless, it’s left them energized and ready.</p>

<h2><strong>Will second time be the charm for Qualtrics? </strong></h2>
<p>When <strong>SAP</strong> announced that <strong>Qualtrics</strong> was getting spun out in July, the full-circle moment made the Equity podcast crew<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/equity-shot-all-about-the-qualtrics-ipo/"> jump to our mics</a> with guesses around why. Now, months later, there’s a new S-1 filing, and more to color in. <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm</a></strong> broke down the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/equity-shot-all-about-the-qualtrics-ipo/">Utah-based unicorn’s numbers</a>, noting that it’s the second time Qualtrics has filed.</p>
<p>Will the second time be the charm that Qualtrics needs to actually go public this time around? I’ll let you make the call yourself once you sift through Alex’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/unpacking-qualtrics-brand-new-s-1-filing/"> analysis of the valuation and financials</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Miami, Substack, and Clubhouse</strong></h2>
<p>If those three words in a single subhed elicit a certain reaction from you, <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton"><strong>Danny Crichton</strong></a> has a bone to pick with you. He wrote a piece this week about tech’s cynicism around anything new, underscoring how<strong> Miami</strong>’s future as a tech hub, <strong>Substack</strong>’s future as a replacement for traditional journalism, and <strong>Clubhouse</strong>’s future as a social media disruptor have come under fire as expected.</p>
<p><em>The cynicism of immediate perfection is one of the strange dynamics of startups in 2020. There is this expectation that a startup, with one or a few founders and a couple of employees, is somehow going to build a perfect product on day one that mitigates any potential problem even before it becomes one. Maybe these startups are just getting popularized too early, and the people who understand early product are getting subsumed by the wider masses who don’t understand the evolution of products?</em></p>
<p>Danny’s argument is to give these companies a little more grace to execute on a vision they themselves are not even close to scratching the surface of. When it comes to holding specific decision-makers and businesses to a certain standard, I prefer a more fluid conversation. But I do agree that writing off a business because it hasn’t done everything correctly from the start can hurt progress. It’s easy to be grumpy, but why not choose to be an optimist?

<h2><strong>And some good news</strong></h2>
<p>Speaking of humbling moments and optimism, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahintampa?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Sarah Perez</a> wrote a piece this week about <strong>EarlyBird</strong>, an app that lets families and friends <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/earlybirds-new-app-lets-families-and-friends-gift-investments-to-children/">gift investments to children.</a> While Acorns and Stash have similar offerings, Earlybird is bringing a fresh UX play to financial literacy, freedom, and education. There’s a ton of work left to be done, hurdles to deal with, and giant unicorns to compete with. EarlyBird, however, is only weeks old so there’s much to watch out for.</p>
<p><strong>VP Caleb Frankel</strong>, now EarlyBird COO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/earlybirds-new-app-lets-families-and-friends-gift-investments-to-children/">explained the early inspiration</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This all started with a problem I experienced years ago when my beautiful baby niece was born. I found myself head over heels and spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on just the most ridiculous stuff — pretty much just junk gifts,” he says. “I wanted to have a larger impact in her life and something that she could really use when she grew up.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 204 billion total downloads and $120 billion in global consumer spend in 2019. Not including Chinese third-party app stores, iOS and Android users in 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/app-stores-to-see-130-billion-downloads-in-2020-and-record-consumer-spend-of-112-billion/">downloaded</a> 130 billion apps and spent a record $112 billion. In 2019, people <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/average-us-time-spent-with-mobile-in-2019-has-increased" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spent</a> three hours and 40 minutes per day using apps, rivaling TV.</p>
<p>Due to COVID-19, time spent in apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/app-stores-to-see-130-billion-downloads-in-2020-and-record-consumer-spend-of-112-billion/">jumped</a> 25% year-over-year on Android. Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week (after a week off for the holidays), we&#8217;re taking a look at holiday app store spending, how the Chinese gaming licensing rules have impacted the App Store, Apple&#8217;s move to ban a party app that could have helped spread COVID, and the collaborative musical created by TikTok users, among other things.</p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h2>Christmas Day app spending grows 35% year-over-year</h2>
<p>Global app spending didn&#8217;t seem to be impacted by the pandemic in 2020, <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-christmas-2020">according to data from Sensor Tower.</a> The firm reports that consumers spent $407.6 million in apps from the iOS App Store and Google Play on Christmas Day, 34.5% from the $303 million spent in 2019. The majority of the spending was on mobile games, up 27% year-over-year to $295.6 million. Tencent&#8217;s Honor of Kings led the games category, while TikTok led non-game apps with $4.7 million in spending on Christmas Day.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091741" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091741" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2091741" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="417" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png 1516w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091741" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>As in prior years, Apple accounted for the majority of the spending, or 68.4% ($278.6M) vs Google Play&#8217;s $129M. The spending was led by the U.S., who accounted for ~$130 million of the total</p>
<h2>Apple takes a stand on pandemic parties</h2>
<p>Apple&#8217;s App Store Review guidelines don&#8217;t specifically detail how the company will handle apps that could contribute to the spread of COVID-19, but Apple found a way to draw the line when it came to a social app that encouraged unsafe gatherings. This past week, Apple banned the app Vybe Together, which had allowed people to locate &#8220;secret&#8221; indoor house parties in their area, sometimes including those held in violation of state guidelines.</p>
<p>NYT reporter Taylor Lorenz first called attention to the problem with a <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1343994810714058753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1343995285869977600%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Ftech-policy%2F2020%2F12%2Fprivate-party-app-pulled-from-app-store-by-apple%2F">tweet</a>. The app had been posting to TikTok to gain attention, but its account has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vybe-together-tiktok-promote-nye-parties-amid-covid-19-2020-12">since been removed</a>. Following its removal, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22205298/apple-tiktok-vybe-together-pandemic-underground-party-app-removed">defended itself</a> by saying that it was <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_dimcevski/status/1344832455572922369">only meant for small get-togethers</a> and the founder <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/were-canceled-liberal-media-inside-020754388.html">lamented</a> being &#8220;canceled by the liberal media.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no good defense, really, for the unnecessary and ill-timed promotion of an app that encouraged people from different households to gather, which spreads COVID. And what the founder seemed to not understand, by nature of his recent tweets and statements on the app&#8217;s <a href="https://vybetogether.com/">website</a>, is that many cities and states also <em>already</em> <em>prohibit</em> small private gatherings of varying degrees, including those <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_dimcevski/status/1344832455572922369">he believes are fine</a>, like small parties in folks&#8217; &#8220;own apartments with people in your area.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. is coping with 346,000 COVID deaths, and in New York, where the app was promoting NYE parties,<a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/cuomo-nearly-74-of-new-covid-19-cases-linked-to-private-gatherings/34944141"> 74% of all COVID-19 cases</a> from Sept.-Nov. 2020 have been linked to private gatherings.</p>
<p>The media may have reported on what the app was doing, but ultimately the decision to &#8220;cancel&#8221; it was Apple&#8217;s. And it was the correct one.</p>
<h2>Apple removes 39K games from its China App Store.</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-china-games-idUSKBN2950P1">Apple on Thursday, Dec. 31, 2020 removed 39,000+ games from China App Store</a>. This was the biggest removal of games in a single day, Reuters reported, citing <a href="https://www.qimai.cn/zhuanlan/article/id/1489">data from Qimai</a>.</p>
<p>iOS games have long been required to obtain a Chinese gaming license in order to operate in the country, but Apple skirted this rule for years by hosting unlicensed titles even as Android app stores complied. Apple began to enforce the rule in 2020 and gave publishers a Dec. 31, 2020 deadline to obtain the license &#8212; a process that can be tedious and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Clearly, a large number of publishers were not able to meet the deadline. Included in the new sweep were Ubisoft&#8217;s Assassin’s Creed Identity and NBA 2K20. Qimai says only only 74 of the top 1,500 paid games remained following the removals. To date, Apple purged more than 46,000 titles from the China App Store, the report said.</p>
<h3>TikTok births a &#8220;Ratatousical&#8221;</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/12/29/ratatouille-tiktok-musical-stars/">The TikTok musical version of Ratatouille has become a real thing.</a> The pandemic forced a lot of creative types out of work in 2020, leading them to find new ways to express themselves online. On TikTok, this collective pent-up energy turned into a large-scale collaborative event: <a href="https://ratatousical.com/">a musical version</a> of Disney&#8217;s <em>Ratatouille</em>. (Or <em>Ratatousical</em>, as it was nicknamed.) TikTokers composed music, wrote lyrics and dialogue, choreographed dances, designed costumes, sets and more, as they worked together through the app.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Disney is allowing a charity version of this collaboration to become a real event without any interference or lawsuits. The <em>Ratatouille</em> musical <a href="https://ratatousical.com/">live-streamed on Jan. 1 at 7 p.m. Eastern,</a> and will be available via video-on-demand through Jan. 4, for a minimum $5 donation to The Actors Fund.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-9dH9FKqtI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent&#038;listType=playlist&#038;list=RD8CYCPVe9NIE' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The musical itself was lighthearted fun for a younger, Gen Z crowd. It also cleverly incorporated actual TikTok videos that featured the app’s well-known visual effects — like cloning yourself or the flashing colored lights typically associated with TikTok’s “you think you can hurt me” meme, for example. That made it more accessible and familiar to kids who had spent the past year being entertained via the internet.</p>
<p>TikTok users, of course, aren&#8217;t the only ones designing, creating and editing productions through remote and collaborative processes in 2020 &#8212; Hollywood itself has had <a href="https://www.protocol.com/hollywood-working-home-streaming-video">to reorient itself for remote work at a much larger scale</a>. TikTok was simply the platform of choice for theater kids looking for something to do.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the TikTok-based collaborative process that birthed this musical ultimately becomes a one-off event that arose from the pandemic&#8217;s impacts &#8212; including the ability for many creative people to devote time and energy on side projects, for example, due to shuttered productions and stay-at-home orders. Or perhaps in-app collaborations have a real future? Time will tell.</p>
<p>TikTok has already proven it can drive the music charts, fashion trends, and app downloads, so it can probably generate an audience for this production, as well. But the cynic may wonder if such an event would have been as popular and buzzworthy had it been some entirely original production, rather than one based on already popular and beloved Disney IP.  But you may as well watch &#8212; it&#8217;s not like you have any other plans these days.</p>

<li><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/21/epic-and-samsung-send-free-fortnite-care-package-with-jacket-galaxy-tab-s7-to-influencers">Samsung teams up with Epic Games on Apple battle over Fortnite</a>. Samsung and Epic Games worked together on the &#8220;Free Fortnite&#8221; marketing campaign, which recently involving sending packages to influencers that contained a Free Fortnite bomber jacket and Samsung Galaxy Tab S7. Fortnite was the Samsung Galaxy Store game of the year in 2020, and the store also distributes the Epic Games app which distributes the Fortnite updates. This is an odd move as Epic alleges the app stores leverage their power to engage in monopolistic practices, but this makes it clear that Samsung is offering them distribution. Apple has the right to set its own pricing for its services (and it recently lowered commissions for small businesses, too). But even if Epic Games is not the knight in shining armor one would hope for, its lawsuit could help set precedent. And regulators may still decide one day that Apple can&#8217;t dictate rules about how businesses operate outside its app store &#8212; meaning, they should have the right to collect their own payments, for example.</li>

The game doles out $100,000 to whoever can keep their finger on their smartphone the longest, via an app designed for this purpose. Last year, it was a four-way tie after 70 hours, and the prize money was divided. The new app introduces in-app challenges to dissuade cheating. YouTuber Mr. Beast rose to fame for his philanthropic-based viral videos and stunts. He has made sizable donations to people in need and those impacted by the pandemic. But this year, the otherwise silly game has a darker tone as it involves competitors who will likely be in more desperate situations.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/woman-vs-bumble-over-indoor-outdoor-bikini-photo-policy">Bumble uproar over indoor bikini and bra photos</a>. The dating app found itself in the middle of a small controversy this week when a woman who wanted to pose in her bra had her photos taken down. The company said its existing policy prohibits things like shirtless bathroom mirror selfies and indoor photos of people wearing swimsuits and underwear. Bumble&#8217;s policies were crafted in response to user data and feedback, but may also help to prevent adult sites from spamming with fake profiles. However, there&#8217;s still something weird about an app that markets itself as female-friendly telling a woman to go put some clothes on.</li>

The company &#8220;year on TikTok&#8221; in-app experience joins other personalized wrap-ups like the Top Nine for Instagram or Spotify&#8217;s Wrapped. It also introduces a floating, tappable button to connect users to the experience. This could pave way for other sorts of mini-applications in the future.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/style/clubhouse-app-influencers.html">Clubhouse power users invited to special club.</a> A select group of creators inside the already invite-only audio conversations app have now been given exclusive access to tools and private meetings with Clubhouse leadership and influencers. In one meeting, the creators discussed monetization strategies. The app grew to popularity amid the pandemic as people have been prevented from typical forms of networking, but it&#8217;s also struggled with moderation as conversations go off the rails.

Two U.S. judges had already stopped Trump&#8217;s E.O. from being carried out. U.S. District Court Judge Carl Nichols on Dec. 7 determined the Commerce Dept. had overstepped its authority, and declared the action &#8220;arbitrary and capricious.&#8221; The department said it would continue to pursue the ban, which it did this past week by filing the appeal. It&#8217;s still unclear what will happen to TikTok and this specific case the days to come when President-Elect Biden takes office, but many suspect it could be dropped as the new administration focuses on more pressing issues, like the COVID crisis.</li>

<p>This endless runner is BuzzFeed&#8217;s first mobile game, which makes it worth noting if not exactly recommending. The mental health-themed game, inspired by BuzzFeed&#8217;s animated series <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CIrDZVxDhVh/?utm_source=ig_embed">The Land of Boggs</a>, was created by BuzzFeed Animation Studios. In the game, characters try to avoid things like stress monsters and gremlins, which is a humorous take on the anxieties of 2020. However, early user reviews indicate the game&#8217;s controls are too difficult and complain the game is too hard to be fun. How stressful! $0.99 on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/run-boggo-run/id1544517293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BuzzFeed.RunBoggoRun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla</a> delivered 499,550 vehicles in 2020, a 36% increase over the previous year and just a few dozen short of hitting an historic and long-awaited milestone that CEO Elon Musk has been aiming for more than five years.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> reported Saturday that it produced 509,737 electric vehicles in 2020.</p>
<p class="Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x">Tesla was able to reach the 500,000-vehicle target by ticking up production and sales in the fourth quarter — a final push that has mirrored numerous other end-of-the-quarter efforts by the company. Tesla delivered 180,570 in the fourth quarter, setting a new quarterly record and 30% higher than the previous quarter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s production and sales figures were also driven by the launch of the Model Y, its mid-sized SUV, and a new factory coming online in China.</p>
<p>The fourth quarter and annual figures shows the rise in demand for its more affordable and newer models and waning interest in its flagship Model S sedan and Model X SUV. The company delivered 18,920 Model S and Model X vehicles in the fourth quarter and 57,039 for the year. Sales of the Model 3 and Model Y hit nearly 162,000 in the fourth quarter and 442,511 for the year. Tesla doesn&#8217;t break out sales figures for each model, instead combining its older vehicles into one bucket and its newer Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in another. The company also doesn&#8217;t provide regional sales figures.</p>
<p>Producing and selling more than 500,000 vehicles a year seemed unreachable for Tesla just a handful of years ago. But Musk has taken a bullish view of the company, noting in 2015 that he remained confident that Tesla would be producing half a million cars in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s five years from now,&#8221; Musk said at the time. &#8220;If you go five years in the past for Tesla, we were producing 600 cars per year—now we can produce 600 cars in three days. So I think going from here to 500,000 cars a year is a much smaller leap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk has reiterated that target periodically, including in January of last year when he noted that deliveries should comfortably exceed 500,000 units. Tesla didn&#8217;t adjust that forecast even as the COVID-19 pandemic upended the economy and forced the company, along with every other automaker, to temporarily pause production for several weeks last spring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Wonder Woman 1984&#8221; was released on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hbo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hbo">HBO <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Max on Christmas Day, where it quickly divided the hosts of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was predictable that Anthony — a fan of clunky-but-ambitious superhero sequels like &#8220;The Dark Knight Rises&#8221; and &#8220;Avengers: Age of Ultron&#8221; — enjoyed the film. Darrell, meanwhile, took the side of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wonder-woman-1984">most critics</a>, who found the movie exasperating and even, at times, mystifyingly bad.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise was Jordan, who disliked the first &#8220;Wonder Woman&#8221; and actually preferred the sequel, thanks in large part to Kristen Wiig&#8217;s portrayal of the villainous Cheetah.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Everyone agreed that there were plenty of problems, including some slipshod and confusing plotting, as well as a portrayal of Wonder Woman that&#8217;s defined entirely by her longing for Steve Trevor, the Chris Pine character who died at the end of the first film but returns here under mysterious circumstances.</p>
<p>But where Anthony found the overall arc of the film — rewriting the melancholy love story of &#8220;Superman II&#8221; as a parable about capitalism and climate change — and its big emotional moments to be surprisingly affecting, Darrell thought the entire final act was ludicrous, with some of the worst CGI ever seen in a big-budget film.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nasa" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nasa">NASA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> recently announced the astronauts who will be taking part in the Artemis missions, and among them is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/anne-c-mcclain/biography">Anne McClain</a>, who has spent 203 days in orbit and conducted two spacewalks on the ISS. With the space industry looking nothing like it did 10 years ago and new spacecraft and technologies on the rise, McClain share her thoughts about how she and other astronauts would be embracing the future.</p>
<p>Lt. Col. McClain&#8217;s time aboard the ISS spanned from December 2018 to June of 2019, meaning her ascent and descent were both aboard Russia&#8217;s Soyuz capsules, as astronauts have gotten to and from space since the Shuttle days. The Artemis missions, however, will use a variety of new launch vehicles and spacecraft. And while she didn&#8217;t get to fly a Dragon capsule, she did get to check one out while it was docked at the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so happy to have flown the Soyuz, because it is such a reliable, basic spacecraft — it&#8217;s almost like flying a piece of history — knowing I was going to be able to compare that to other vehicles to in the future,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I had the opportunity when I was on Space Station when DM-1 flew. And so, being able to float into that and look at their screens, their monitors, you notice right away that the technology has advanced to where it looks like the inside of a commercial airliner.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken were the first to pilot a Dragon in orbit, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/this-is-certainly-different-astronauts-on-controlling-the-dragon-spacecraft-via-touchscreen/">said afterwards that it was &#8220;certainly different,&#8221;</a> partly due to the reliance on touchscreens as primary interfaces for many spacecraft functions. McClain emphasized the difficulty of getting software to the point where it can be trusted with someone&#8217;s life.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8O5e1Sd3yf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/this-is-certainly-different-astronauts-on-controlling-the-dragon-spacecraft-via-touchscreen/">&#8216;This is certainly different&#8217;: Astronauts on controlling the Dragon spacecraft via touchscreen</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;&#8216;This is certainly different&#8217;: Astronauts on controlling the Dragon spacecraft via touchscreen&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/this-is-certainly-different-astronauts-on-controlling-the-dragon-spacecraft-via-touchscreen/embed/#?secret=8O5e1Sd3yf" data-secret="8O5e1Sd3yf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Most of the vehicles that we&#8217;re using now are very heavy on software — lots of touchscreens, not so much valves that were physically moving, it&#8217;s more like a software relay. But that adds a huge amount of complexity, because as your readers are probably well aware, approving software and the reliability of software is difficult,&#8221; she explained. 	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			We want to understand our systems well enough to be able to interact with them in ways that maybe they&#8217;re not directly designed to do.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	 &#8220;We&#8217;re always looking at the question of, when should a human be in the loop, and when should it be automated? And if it&#8217;s automated, how can we prove the software has reliability sufficient for human spaceflight? At some point you have to say, &#8216;You know what, if this happens, we&#8217;re going to put a human in the loop,&#8217; just so you&#8217;re not paralyzed by 10 years of software testing.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a pilot herself, McClain naturally has opinions on this, and like Hurley and Behnken, worked with SpaceX early on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was fortunate to work with Bob and Doug, advising SpaceX early on in their cockpit controls, and I think where they got, it&#8217;s a really incredible machine,&#8221; she said, while noting that the Orion and Starliner craft received similar attentions from experts like her.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1996397" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/fistbump.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1996397" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1996397" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/fistbump.gif" alt="" width="800" height="444" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1996397" class="wp-caption-text">Astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley bump fists to celebrate their history-making launch on SpaceX&#8217;s Crew Dragon.</p></div></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Yes, that company name has not built a spacecraft — but there are people in those halls that have built spacecraft. The talent that built the Space Shuttle and Space Station is spread out all over the commercial industry now.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	 Flexibility was chief among the desired aspects; If things go even a little off script, they need the tools to be flexible and not self-limiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, pilots, we always want options, right? Whatever happens, we want options. As much as we try to predict scenarios on the ground, we&#8217;re always keenly aware that something could happen that wasn&#8217;t predicted, and at that point&#8230; we want <em>options</em>,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We want to understand our systems well enough to be able to interact with them in ways that maybe they&#8217;re not directly designed to do. So it&#8217;s really important for me that the software doesn&#8217;t take options off the table. That&#8217;s one of the reasons why, at NASA, they look at the Apollo 13 case, when we had to use hardware and software and the vehicle in ways that we&#8217;d never predicted.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I asked whether it was different or strange to work with newer companies like Blue Origin, McClain pointed out that really, the only new thing there is the name.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1983053" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg" alt="CG Render of what Blue Origin and Lockheed's lunar lander is expected to look like." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked with these companies enough to know something, and that&#8217;s that yes, that company name has not built a spacecraft — but there are people in those halls that have built spacecraft. The talent that built the Space Shuttle and Space Station is spread out all over the commercial industry now, which is exactly what NASA wants to do. That is our human capital,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;The other thing I&#8217;m confident about is the way NASA partners with these companies, for test programs and design reviews, it&#8217;s extremely thorough. So by the time that rocket has me on top of it on a pad, I&#8217;m confident in in the checks and balances we have in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			That technology, it helps bring Earth up into the spaceship with us.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	Lastly I asked about whether any conveniences of modern consumer tech had made it more bearable to spend long periods of time in space, for instance the fairly recent capability to do video calls. McClain was quick to answer in the positive.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you said is exactly it. Imagine if we were in this pandemic and weren&#8217;t able to video chat — we&#8217;re already feeling disconnected from our loved ones. And you know, feeling disconnected is the same whether you&#8217;re on the other side of the country or you&#8217;re in space. So the ability for us to be able to see our parents&#8217; faces on the screen and talk to them, it really does wonders,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not just morale. You know, you start looking at six month, twelve month missions, it&#8217;s really maintaining the psyche, maintaining human mental health. So that technology, it helps bring Earth up into the spaceship with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>McClain is one of 18 astronauts who will take part in the missions leading up to the planned Moon landing. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis-team/">You can meet the rest here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sony" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sony">Sony <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said on Friday that it will launch the PlayStation 5 in India on February 2, suggesting improvements in the supply chain network that was severely impacted last year because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The Japanese firm said it will begin taking pre-order requests for the new gaming console in India, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, on January 12. The console will be available for pre-order from a number of retailers including Amazon India, Flipkart, Croma, Reliance Digital, Games the Shop, Sony Center, and Vijay Sales, the company said.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 is priced at Indian rupees 49,990 ($685), while the digital edition of the console will sell at Indian rupees 39,990 ($550). Xbox Series X, in comparison, is priced at $685 in India, and Xbox Series S sells at $480. Both the consoles launched in India in November.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, much like elsewhere in the world, Microsoft has been struggling to meet the demand for the new Xbox consoles in India. The Xbox Series X is facing so much shortage in the country that it&#8217;s not even easy to locate its page on Amazon India.</p>
<p>The announcement today should allay concerns of loyal PlayStation fans, some of whom &#8212; including, of course, yours truly &#8212; secured a unit from the gray market at a premium in recent months after India was not included in the first wave of nations for the PS5. Fans have also been frustrated at Sony and its affiliated partners for not offering clarification or providing conflicting accounts about the probable launch of the new gaming console in recent months.</p>
<p>In November, Sony suggested that it had delayed the launch of the PS5 in India due to local import regulations. Game news site The Mako Reactor <a href="https://themakoreactor.com/news/ps5-release-date-india-2021-launch-sony/20520/">reported</a> earlier this week that Sony is unlikely to offer warranty and after-sales support for PlayStation 5 accessories in India &#8212; as has been the case for several previous generations.</p>
<p>India is not yet a big market for full-fledged gaming consoles yet. According to industry estimates, Sony and Microsoft sold only a few hundred thousand units of their previous generation consoles in the country.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As 2020 comes to a long-awaited end, a series of filings indicate that venture capitalists are ending the year with fresh money. According to SEC paperwork, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/learncapital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="learncapital">Learn Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and USV have filed paperwork that shows the firms have raised new, multimillion-dollar funds.</p>
<p>If you’ve been paying attention to news this past year, it’s clear that much of venture capital isn’t just surviving 2020 &#8211; it’s flourishing through it. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/as-covid-19-era-drags-on-vcs-look-beyond-zoom-calls-for-due-diligence-and-sourcing/">Zoom investing</a>, it seems, is working just fine for cash-rich firms looking to double down on bets in categories from edtech to climate.</p>
<p>First up, New York-based USV submitted a pair of filings on late Thursday. The first filing shows that the firm has closed $151 million for USV Climate 2021, which one can assume is focused on climate-tech investments. As my colleague Jonathan Shieber has pointed out, climate tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other, more<a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001833921-20-000004/"> nebulous filing</a>, is the firm’s $22.4 million investment vehicle titled USV Bundled. It’s unclear what this is focused on, but a recent blog post suggests that the firm will continue to <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2020/12/hacking-education-2-0/">double down on its education investments.</a></p>
<p>Speaking of edtech, Learn Capital, an education-focused venture capital fund, filed paperwork indicating that it has closed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1797459/000179745920000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">$132 million in capital</a>. It plans to raise a total of $250 million for this fund, which will be the firm’s fourth investment vehicle to date. The edtech category has obviously been booming with interest, which also fueled Owl Ventures to close $585 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/owl-ventures-new-pair-of-funds-gives-edtech-a-585-million-boost/">new capital in September. </a></p>
<p>Finally, I’ll give an honorable mention to Lattice CEO Jack Altman’s New Years Eve filing, which shows that the executive <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1835920/000183592020000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">plans to raise $20 million</a> for a new fund. It’s unclear if this filing indicates <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/06/17/altman-brothers-launch-apollo-fund-to-back-startup-moonshots/?sh=62de3b5541eb">Apollo</a>’s next step, a venture fund started by the Altman brothers. The trio, beyond Jack, includes Max and Sam, the former president of Y Combinator who currently serves as the CEO of OpenAI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a strange year for sleep. For me, levels have fluctuated between too little and too much, but have – more often than not – tended toward the former. 2020 gave most of us no shortage of excuses for sleep deprivation, from personal stresses to larger societal concerns.</p>
<p>And, thankfully, the past few years have seen no shortage of technological solutions to the problem of sleeplessness. Of course, the underpinning issues can be hard to isolate and even harder to treat. There’s no silver bullet. That’s the lesson I keep relearning at this job – no single piece of technology is going to cure all of my ills. (I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s nothing that years of extensive and expensive therapy can&#8217;t fix.)</p>
<p>Sleep headphones are, in and of themselves, not an entirely new phenomenon. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bose" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bose">Bose <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> got into the space in earnest back in mid-2018, offering one of the more polished (and pricey) approaches to the category. The company went in an entirely different direction than, say, <a href="https://kokoon.io/">Kokoon</a>, which offers an over-ear solution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Sleepbuds are – as the name suggests – fully wireless earbuds. This second generation allows Bose to address some of the bigger issues with the original – include some major battery complaints. That was a pretty big strike against a $250 pair of headphones with, quite literally, one job.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The battery and connections complaints, I can state, off the bat, seem to have been addressed. The units I’ve been wearing to sleep off and on for a few weeks now haven’t had any major connection issues to speak of (assuming you keep your phone near your bed and all that entails), and the battery generally gets me through a full night bit a bit under 20% remaining. After you wake up, you toss them in the case and let them charge for the next several hours.</p>

<p>All told, the build is solid, as you’d expect/hope from the company name and accompanying price point. I really dig the design of these things, overall, from the illuminating metal charging case with its sliding lid to the earbuds themselves. As someone who finds the slightest irritants a major hurdle to falling asleep, I was pleasantly surprised by how unobtrusive the buds are. They slip on comfortably and stay flush with the ear, so nothing gets snagged. The soft and rubbery wings also do a great job keeping them in place.</p>
<p>The buds biggest limitation is actually by design. Like the originals, the Sleepbuds II only work with the included app. This is used to pair them, locate them and offers Bose’s library of music. The company generally does a good job curating its own sleep sounds, ranging from nature sounds like rain and wind to self-selected ambient tracks. I got in the habit of listening to the sounds of the ocean while reading <em>Moby Dick</em> each night. A pretty good way to fall asleep, all told.</p>
<p>I appreciate the decision to hamper the functionality to some degree – I suspect I would probably start listening to podcasts and TV shows on the thing, left to my own devices (so to speak). But I would love to see what the buds could do with, say, binaural beats or some other ambient selections. Ultimately, I think giving the consumer choice is ultimately a net positive.</p>
<p>That said, the headphones are well-tuned for their limited (but expanding) library of sounds. There’s no active noise canceling, but the passive cancelation of the buds themselves plus the on-board sound do a good job blocking out things like environmental noise or snoring. They’re probably no match for, say, construction noise, but do a good job with subtler barriers to sleep. They’ll also likely be a good choice for long flights, when we start doing those again.</p>
<p>There are a handful of headphones currently positioned for the sleep market, but Bose’s look to be the most polished package at the moment. The price will understandably be a barrier for many – and the limited sound library could be a dealbreaker for some. But if you have the money – and find getting and staying asleep tough – they’re well worth exploring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the Los Angeles-based extended reality data visualization company, <a href="https://badvr.com/">BadVR</a>, first heard that one of its earliest benefactors, Magic Leap, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/magic-leap-announces-layoffs-amid-covid-19-slowdown/">was about to shed 1,000 jobs and was fighting for its life</a>, the young startup was unfazed.</p>
<p>Despite the very public ties that BadVR had to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/magic-leap" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="magic-leap">Magic Leap, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as one of the enterprise applications on the platform, the startup was more insulated than other businesses from the pivot away from consumer-focused apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/my-experience-with-the-cares-act-was-frustrating-confusing-and-unfair/">The first step was finding money from the government&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program </a>to get more capital coming in and maintaining its headcount. Eventually, the company managed to land additional financing in the form of a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s the second grant that the company has taken from the NSF and is an example of how startups can turn to government funding for capital and avoid some of the pitfalls of fundraising from venture capital.</p>
<p>To be sure, even <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/magic-leap" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="magic-leap">Magic Leap&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> trip to the brink of collapse wouldn&#8217;t have been that bad for BadVR, which makes enterprise applications for extended reality devices.</p>
<p>What the Magic Leap story shows is that companies don&#8217;t need to take venture capital to make it. Indeed, as costs come down for equipment and remote work democratizes access to a country that&#8217;s still teeming with engineering talent, thrifty startups can get the capital they need from government sources and corporate innovation grants.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how BadVR got most of its $3.5 million in financing. Some money came from a grant from BadVR, while at least $1.25 million has come from the government in the form of two <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/national-science-foundation" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="national-science-foundation">National Science Foundation <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> cooperative agreements through the Small Business Innovation Research financing mechanisms.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091683" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091683" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2091683" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091683" class="wp-caption-text">A headset capture of BadVR’s climate change application, built for the Magic Leap One headset.<strong> Image Credit:</strong> <a href="https://badvr.com/">BadVR</a></p></div></p>
<p>BadVR uses virtual and augmented reality tools to visualize geospatial data for a range of government and commercial applications. The startup&#8217;s tech is already being used by big telecom companies to accelerate the planning and deployment of 5G networks. And, within the public safety sector, the company&#8217;s tech is used to improve situational awareness for first responders and to reduce training, staffing, and operational costs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Society has become aware of the power of data and the impact it has on our daily lives. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s critically important that we make the access of data easy to every organization, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regardless of technical skill level or background,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Suzanne Borders, the chief executive and f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ounder of BadVR, in a statement. </span></p>
<p>For Borders, the key to tapping government funding is all about proper advance planning. &#8220;Those take a long time,&#8221; Borders said. &#8220;When you get awarded them, you&#8217;re looking at a year&#8217;s worth of effort. [Our grant] was a testament to us planning for that about a year ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>These grants are typically milestone-based, so as long as BadVR was hitting its targets, it could be fairly assured that the money would be there.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“NSF is proud to support the technology of the future by thinking beyond incremental  developments and funding the most creative, impactful ideas across all markets and  areas of science and engineering,” said Andrea Belz, Division Director of the Division of  Industrial Innovation and Partnerships at NSF. “With the support of our research funds,  any deep technology startup or small business can guide basic science into meaningful  solutions that address tremendous needs.”  </span></p>
<p>Other government competitions are providing the company with additional non-dilutive cash and a chance to kcik the tires on new capabilities.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091680" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091680" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2091680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="568" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg 2878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=768,426 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=1536,852 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=2048,1136 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091680" class="wp-caption-text">A capture from BadVR’s augmented reality geospatial data environment, which allows users to visualize multiple live and historical datasets via overlays relevant to their environment. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> <a href="https://badvr.com/">BadVR</a></p></div></p>
<p>That has translated into traction for the company&#8217;s Augmented Reality Operations Center. The AROC is a new offering for the product that visualizes data for first responders. Through a challenge hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, BadVR was able to work with the Eureka, Mo. Fire Department to develop a prototype for a specific emergency situation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an evolution of an early product the company had developed where enterprises can create digital twins of their factories or stores in virtual reality and do a walk-through to examine different conditions.</p>
<p>The visualization work that BadVR does isn&#8217;t necessarily all geo-spatial. The company can take all kinds of data and integrate that into an environment that makes the data easier to see. Borders sees the company&#8217;s services extending into creating all kinds of collaborative environments for companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The system highlights things that are important to look at,&#8221; Borders said. &#8220;It&#8217;s virtualizing the data visualization experience and bringing it into an immersive environment &#8212; and building a more collaborative aspect to that experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic has forced businesses across the country to operate virtually, Borders said the demand for the kinds of. products her company is building &#8212; with the government&#8217;s help &#8212; has only increased.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s been due to increased demand for remote collaboration tools,&#8221; Borders said. &#8220;We’ve had increased interest in people across the board &#8212; but tools that have remote collaboration capabilities &#8212; and bring people together to one immersive data experience… those are taking off.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While much of what made 2020 such an absolute nightmare will still be with us on January 1 (sorry!), we will really, truly be leaving Adobe <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flash">Flash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and FarmVille behind as we enter the new year.</p>
<p>The end of Flash has been a long time coming. The plugin, which was first released in 1996 and once supported a broad swath online content, has become increasingly irrelevant in a smartphone-centric world: iPhones never supported Flash, and it&#8217;s been just over 10 years since Apple&#8217;s then-CEO Steve Jobs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/29/steve-jobs-tells-the-world-just-what-he-thinks-of-flash/">published an open letter</a> outlining the technology&#8217;s shortcomings.</p>
<p>Adobe has been planning for the end, announcing in 2017 that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/get-ready-to-say-goodbye-to-flash-in-2020/">phase out Flash by the end of this year</a>. Most web browsers have already stopped supporting Flash, and today is the official end date, with Adobe ending support itself — although there&#8217;s still one last &#8220;death of Flash&#8221; milestone on January 12, when the company will begin to block Flash content from playing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In related news, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zynga" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zynga">Zynga <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://zyngasupport.helpshift.com/a/farmville/?s=announcements&amp;f=important-announcement&amp;l=en">announced recently</a> that the end of Flash would also mean the end of FarmVille, since the game relies on the Flash plugin.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am so grateful for the amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/zynga?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@zynga</a> team behind <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FarmVille?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FarmVille</a>, and the hundreds of millions of FarmVille players over the years. 16/x</p>

<p>Like Flash, FarmVille feels like a remnant of a bygone internet era (a fact that makes me feel incredibly old, since I wrote plenty of words about both of them at the beginning of my career). <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Launched in 2009, FarmVille&#8217;s popularity <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/31/technology/farmville-zynga-facebook.html">paved the way for the ascendance of Zynga and of Facebook gaming</a>, but both Zynga and gaming have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/zynga-q3-earnings/">largely moved on</a>.</span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s co-founder and former CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/mark-pincus" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="mark-pincus">Mark Pincus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> commemorated the occasion with <a href="https://twitter.com/markpinc/status/1344742344948498432">a series of tweets</a> outlining the game&#8217;s early development (<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2009/08/07/zynga-buys-virtual-home-startup-myminilife/">spurred by the acquisition of startup MyMiniLife</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;FarmVille demonstrated that a game could be a living, always-on service that could deliver daily surprise and delight, similar to a favorite TV series,&#8221; Pincus wrote. &#8220;Games could also connect groups of people and bring them closer together.&#8221;</p>
<p>And just in case there are any FarmVille fans reading this story, don&#8217;t worry: you can still play FarmVille 2: Tropic Escape, FarmVille 2: Country Escape right now, and FarmVille 3 is still coming to mobile. Today is just the final day for the original game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the last day of 2020, New York City’s Metro Transit Authority announced that it <a href="https://www.pix11.com/news/local-news/mta-milestone-omny-rollout-to-be-completed-thursday-al-putre-interview">has finished its roll out</a> of contactless payment systems. With the addition of a final stop in Brooklyn, every MTA subway station and bus in the five boroughs now sports the OMNY “Tap and Go” system.</p>
<p>We got an early demo of the Grand Central terminals when the project rollout began last May. The system involves a major infrastructure overhaul as the transit authority looks beyond the iconic Metro Card to mobile payment systems from vendors like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Google, Samsung and Fitbit – allowing users to use smartphones and smartwatches to swipe their way through the turn style.</p>

<p>The MTA had expected to finish the project by October – though COVID-19 put the kibosh on those plans along with so much else. The goal was pushed back to December, and it appears it&#8217;s been met with no time to spare.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join us for a major announcement about the rollout of OMNY, our state-of-the-art payment system that will replace MetroCard completely in 2023.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>MetroCards are sticking around for the time being – though the MTA expects they will be phased out at some point in 2023. Part of the transition involves the arrival of the OMNY Card, which use the new technology but function similarly to MetroCard. A reduced far version of the card is set to arrive for riders who qualify at some point in 2021. The new readers are also coming to the Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I edited hundreds of stories in 2020, so choosing my favorites would be an exercise in futility.</p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;ve tried to gather a sample of Extra Crunch stories that taught me something new. (Which means this top 10 list betrays my ignorance, a humbling admission for a know-it-all like myself.)</p>
<p>While narrowing down the field of candidates, I realized that we&#8217;re covering each of the topics on this list in greater depth next year. We already have stories in the works about no-code software, the emergence of edtech, proptech and B2B marketplaces, to name just a few.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some readers are skeptical about paywalls, but without being boastful, Extra Crunch is a premium product, just like Netflix or Disney+. I know: We&#8217;re not as entertaining as a historical drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II or a space western about a bounty hunter.</p>
<p>But, speaking as someone who&#8217;s worked at several startups, Extra Crunch stories contain actionable information you can use to build a company and/or look smart in meetings — and that&#8217;s worth something.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a very happy new year.</p>

<p>Managing Editor Danny Crichton spearheaded the development of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/the-techcrunch-list/">The TechCrunch List</a> earlier this year to help seed-stage founders connect with VCs who write first checks.</p>
<p>The TechCrunch List has no paywall and contains details and recommendations about more than 400 investors across 22 verticals. Once it launched, Danny crunched the data to pick out 11 investors for which &#8220;founders were particularly effusive in their praise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm uses his weekday column The Exchange to keep a close eye on &#8220;private companies, public markets and the gray space in between,&#8221; but one effort stood out: An overview of six API-based startups that were &#8220;raising capital in rapid-fire fashion&#8221; when many companies were trying to find their COVID-19 footing.</p>
<p>For me, this was particularly interesting because it helped me better understand that an optimal pricing structure can be key to a SaaS company&#8217;s initial success.</p>

<p>Two stories about the advent of no-code/low-code software that we ran in July take the third and fourth position on this list.</p>
<p>I have been a no-code user for some time: Using Zapier to send automated invitations via Slack for group lunches was a real time-saver in the pre-pandemic days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enterprise expenditure on custom software is on track to double from $250 billion in 2015 to $500 billion in 2020,&#8221; so we&#8217;ll definitely be diving deeper into this topic in the coming months.</p>

<p>In 2018, B2B marketplaces saw an estimated $680 billion in sales, but that figure is expected to reach $3.6 trillion by 2024.</p>
<p>As companies shifted their purchasing online, these platforms are adding a range of complementary services like payment management, targeted advertising and logistics while also hardening their infrastructure.</p>

<p>Reporter Lucas Matney spoke to Caryn Marooney in August at TechCrunch Early Stage about how startup founders who hope to expand their reach need to do a better job of connecting with journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;People just fundamentally aren’t walking around caring about this new startup,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Actually, nobody does.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who&#8217;s been on both sides of this equation, I most appreciated her advice about focusing on &#8220;simplicity and staying consistent&#8221; when it comes to messaging.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don’t let the complexity of your intellect cloud what needs to be simple,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>According to Miura-Ko, a co-founding partner at Floodgate, startups can only reach this stage when their business model, value propositions and ecosystem are in balance.</p>
<p>Using lessons learned from her portfolio companies like Lyft, Refinery29 and Twitch, this article should be required reading for every founder. As one commenter posted, &#8220;I read this thinking, &#8216;<strong><em>I need to add some slides to my deck!&#8217;</em></strong>&#8221;</p>

<p>Although we posted this in April, each of these forecasts seem spot-on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Future of work: promoting intimacy and trust.</li>
<li>Healthcare IT: telemedicine and remote patient monitoring.</li>
<li>Robotics and supply chain.</li>
<li>Cybersecurity.</li>

<p>I&#8217;ve always found the concept of total addressable market (TAM) hard to embrace fully — the arrival of a single disruptive company could change an industry&#8217;s TAM in a week.</p>
<p>However, several factors are combining to transform the construction industry: high fragmentation, poor communication, a skilled labor shortage and a lack of data transparency.</p>
<p>Startups that help builders manage aspects like pre-construction, workflow and site visualization are making huge strides, but because &#8220;construction firms spend less than 2% of annual sales volume on IT,&#8221; the size of this TAM is not at all speculative.</p>

<p>As a bonus, I&#8217;m including a TechCrunch op-ed written by insurtech founder Kevin Henderson that describes the myriad challenges he has faced as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Some of the discussions about the lack of diversity in tech can feel abstract, but his post describes its concrete consequences. For starters: he&#8217;s <strong>never</strong> had an opportunity to pitch at a VC firm where there was another Black person in the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black founders have a better chance playing pro sports than they do landing venture investments,&#8221; says Henderson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank Group is reportedly investing $200 million to bail out <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/katerra" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="katerra">Katerra, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a startup that had hoped to remake the construction industry with a vertically integrated approach, according to a report in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-agrees-to-200-million-bailout-of-katerra-11609366612?mod=hp_lista_pos3">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>Katerra&#8217;s shareholders reportedly approved the new investment on Wednesday, with the new lifeline from SoftBank coming on top of roughly $2 billion that the Japanese technology conglomerate had already committed to the venture.</p>
<p>Funds for the bailout, which will save Katerra from bankruptcy, will be coming from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 1, the Journal quoted Katerra chief executive Paal Kibsgaard as telling company shareholders in a message.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the funding, the SoftBank-financed financial services firm, Greensill Capital, is cancelling around $435 million in debt in exchange for a 5% stake in the company, according to the Journal&#8217;s reporting.</p>
<p>This new bailout actually marks the second time that SoftBank has stepped in to dole out $200 million to Katerra this year alone.</p>
<p>In May, when Kibsgaard, the former head of oil services developer <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/schlumberger" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="schlumberger">Schlumberger, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was brought in to fix the company&#8217;s finances, SoftBank poured $200 million into the company so Kibsgaard could right the ship there, according to the Journal&#8217;s reporting.</p>

<p>Katerra has raised multiple hundreds of million dollar rounds from the Japanese technology conglomerate since its launch in 2015. Back in 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/24/construction-startup-katerra-gets-865m-in-softbanks-latest-mega-round/">when the company closed on $865 million in financing</a>, Katerra was claiming bookings for $1.3 billion worth of commercial and residential projects ranging from hospitality to student housing. That&#8217;s a large number, but a fraction of the $1 trillion spent on construction in the month of November 2018 alone, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>

<p>Katerra has been hit by delays and cost overruns on some projects, while the COVID-19 pandemic delayed others. And irregularities that the company discovered in accounting practices also added to headaches, according to the Journal.</p>
<p>Despite its missteps, Katerra is on track to make serious cash this year, with revenue between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, according to details Kibsgaard gave to the Journal.</p>
