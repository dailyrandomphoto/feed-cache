										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While we&#8217;ve written about attempts to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/iab-cookie/">build alternatives to cookies that track users across websites</a>, Google says it won&#8217;t be going down that route.</p>
<p>The search giant had already announced that it will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">phasing out support for third-party cookies in its Chrome browser</a>, but today it went further, with David Temkin (Google&#8217;s director of product management for ads privacy and trust) writing in <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/">a blog post</a> that &#8220;once third-party cookies are phased out, we will not build alternate identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web, nor will we use them in our products.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We realize this means other providers may offer a level of user identity for ad tracking across the web that we will not — like [personally identifiable information] graphs based on people’s email addresses,&#8221; Temkin continued. &#8220;We don’t believe these solutions will meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions, and therefore aren’t a sustainable long term investment.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean ads won&#8217;t be targeted at all. Instead, he argued that thanks to &#8220;advances in aggregation, anonymization, on-device processing and other privacy-preserving technologies,&#8221; it&#8217;s no longer necessary to &#8220;track individual consumers across the web to get the performance benefits of digital advertising.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fUZ9knBNUe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two years</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two years&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/embed/#?secret=fUZ9knBNUe" data-secret="fUZ9knBNUe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As an example, Temkin pointed to a new approach being tested by Google called Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC), which allows ads to be targeted at large groups of users based on common interests. He said Google will begin testing FLoCs with advertisers in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Temkin pointed out that these changes are focused on third-party data and don&#8217;t affect the ability of publishers to track and target their own visitors: &#8220;We will continue to support first-party relationships on our ad platforms for partners, in which they have direct connections with their own customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, however, that the Electronic Frontier Foundation has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/google-claims-almost-no-change-in-ad-revenue-from-targeting-proposals-in-its-privacy-sandbox-but-privacy-upside-less-clear/">described FLoCs</a> as &#8220;the opposite of privacy-preserving technology” and compared them to a &#8220;behavioral credit score.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while cookies seem to be on the way out across the industry, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">currently investigating Google&#8217;s cookie plan</a> over antitrust concerns, with critics suggesting that Google is using privacy as an excuse to increase its market power. (A similar criticism has been <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-eric-seufert-about-apple-facebook-and-mobile-advertising/">leveled against Apple</a> over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">upcoming privacy changes in iOS</a>.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As demand for cloud native applications is growing, <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/">Yugabyte</a>, makers of the cloud native, open source YugabyteDB database are seeing a corresponding rise in demand for their products, especially with large enterprise customers. Today, the company announced a $48 million Series C financing round to help build on that momentum.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round with participation from Greenspring Associates, Dell Technologies Capital, Wipro Ventures and 8VC. Today&#8217;s round comes on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/yugabyte-lands-30m-series-b-as-open-source-database-continues-to-flourish/">the startup&#8217;s $30 million Series B</a> last June, and brings the total raised to $103 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>Kannan Muthukkaruppan, Yugabyte co-founder and president, says the startup saw a marked increase in interest in both the open source and commercial offerings in 2020 as the pandemic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/the-cloud-infrastructure-market-hit-129b-in-2020/">pushed many companies to the cloud</a> faster than they might have gone otherwise, something many startup founders have pointed out to me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The distributed SQL space is definitely heating up, and if anything over the last six months almost in every vector in terms of enterprise customers &#8212; from Fortune 500 companies across financial, retail, ISP or telcos &#8212; are putting Yugabyte in production to be the system of record database to meet some of their business critical services needs,&#8221; Muthukkaruppan told me.</p>
<p>In addition, he&#8217;s seeing a similar rise in the level of interest from the open source version of the product.&#8221;Similarly, the groundswell on the community and the open source adoption has been phenomenal. Our Slack [open source] user community quadrupled in 2020,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That kind of momentum led to the increased investor interest, says co-founder and CTO Karthik Ranganathan. &#8220;Some of the primary reasons to go and even ask for funding was that we realized we could accelerate some of this stuff, and we couldn&#8217;t do that with the original $30 million we had raised,&#8221; he said. The original thinking was to do a secondary raise in the $15-20 million, but multiple investors expressed interest in participating, and it ended up being a $48 million round when all was said and done.</p>
<p>Former Pivotal president Bill Cook came on board as CEO at the same time they were announcing their last funding round in June and brought some enterprise chops to the table. It was his job to figure out how to expand the market opportunity with larger high-value enterprise clients. &#8220;And so the last six or seven months has been about that, dealing with enterprise clients on one hand and then this emerging developer led cloud offering as well,&#8221; Cook said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Grafana Labs launches observability stack for enterprise customers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/grafana-labs-launches-observability-stack-aimed-at-enterprise-users/embed/#?secret=DpMmkp66LS" data-secret="DpMmkp66LS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company has a three tier offering that includes the open source YugabyteDB. Then there is a fully managed cloud version called Yugabyte Cloud, and finally there is a self-managed cloud version of the database called Yugabyte Platform. The latter is especially attractive to large enterprise customers, who want to be in the cloud, but still want to maintain control of their data and infrastructure, and so choose to manage the cloud installation themselves.</p>
<p>The company started last year with 50 employees, doubled that to this point, and now expects to reach 200 by the end of this year. As they add employees, the leadership team is cognizant of the importance of building a diverse and inclusive workforce, while recognizing the challenges in doing so.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s work in progress as always. We&#8217;ve added diversity candidates right along the whole spectrum as we&#8217;ve grown but from my perspective it&#8217;s never sufficient, and we just need to keep pushing on it hard, and I think as a leadership team we recognize that,&#8221; Cook said.</p>
<p>The three leaders of the company have been working together remotely now since the announcement in June, and had only met briefly in person prior to the pandemic shutting down offices, but they say that it has gone smoothly. And while they would obviously like to meet in person again when the time is right, the momentum the company is experiencing shows that things are moving in the right direction, regardless of where they are getting their work done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open source software is at the core of&#8230; well, practically everything online. But while much of it is diligently maintained in some ways, in others it doesn&#8217;t receive the kind of scrutiny that something so foundational ought to. $1.3 million worth of grants were announced today, split among 13 projects looking to ensure open source software and development is being done equitably, sustainably, and responsibly.</p>
<p>The research projects will look into a number of questions about the way open source digital infrastructure is being used, maintained, and otherwise affected. For instance, many municipalities rely on and create this sort of infrastructure constantly as the need for government software solutions grows, but what are the processes by which this is done? Which approaches or frameworks succeed, and why?</p>
<p>And what about the private companies that contribute to major open-source projects, often without consulting one another — how do they communicate and share priorities and dependencies? How could that be improved, and with what costs and benefits?</p>
<p>These and other questions aren&#8217;t the type that any single organization or local government is likely to take on spontaneously, and of course the costs of such studies aren&#8217;t trivial. But they were deemed interesting enough (and possibly likely to generate new approaches and products) by a team of experts who sorted through about 250 applications over the last year.</p>

<p>The grantmaking operation is funded and organized by the Ford Foundation, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Open Society Foundations, Omidyar Network, and the Mozilla Open Source Support Program in collaboration with the Open Collective Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a dearth of funding for looking at the needs and potential applications of free and open source infrastructure. The public interest issues behind open source have been the missing piece,&#8221; said Michael Brennan, who&#8217;s leading<a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/the-latest/news/major-philanthropies-tackle-inequality-by-strengthening-how-open-source-code-is-developed-and-maintained/"> the grant program at the Ford Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The president of the foundation [Darren Walker] once said, &#8216;a just society relies on a just Internet,&#8217; &#8221; he quoted. &#8220;So our question is how do we create that just Internet? How do we create and sustain an equitable Internet that serves everyone equally? We actually have a lot more questions than answers, and few people are funding research into those questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even finding the right questions is part of the question, of course, but in basic research that&#8217;s expected. Early work in a field can seem frustratingly general or inconclusive because it&#8217;s as much about establishing the scope and general direction of the work as it is about suggesting actual courses of action.</p>

<p>&#8220;The final portfolio wasn&#8217;t just about the &#8216;objectively best&#8217; ones, but how do we find a diversity of approaches and ideas, and tackle different aspects of this work, and also be representative of the diverse and global nature of the project?&#8221; Brennan said. &#8220;This year we also accepted proposals for both research and implementation. We want to see that the research is informing the building of that equitable and sustainable infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://opencollective.com/di-grants">You can read the full research abstracts here</a>, but these are the short versions, with the proposer&#8217;s name:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are COVID data infrastructures created and transformed by builders and maintainers from the open source community? &#8211; <em>Megan Finn (University of Washington, University of Texas, Northeastern University)</em></li>
<li>How is digital infrastructure a critical response to fight climate change? &#8211; <em>Narrira Lemos de Souza</em></li>
<li>How do perceptions of unfairness when contributing to an open source project affect the sustainability of critical open source digital infrastructure projects? &#8211; <em>Atul Pokharel (NYU)</em></li>
<li>Supporting projects to implement research-informed best practices at the time of need on governance, sustainability, and inclusion. &#8211; <em>Danielle Robinson (Code for Science &amp; Society)</em></li>
<li>Assessing Partnerships for Municipal Digital Infrastructure &#8211; <em>Anthony Townsend (Cornell Tech)</em></li>
<li>Implement recommendations for funders of open source infrastructure with guides, programming, and models &#8211; <em>Eileen Wagner, Molly Wilson, Julia Kloiber, Elisa Lindinger, and Georgia Bullen (Simply Secure &amp; Superrr)</em></li>
<li>How we can build a “Creative Commons” for API terms of Service, as a contract to automatically read, control and enforce APIs Terms of service between infrastructure and applications? &#8211; <em>Mehdi Medjaoui (APIdays, LesMainteneurs, Inno3)</em></li>
<li>Indian case study of governance, implementation, and private sector role of open source infrastructure projects &#8211; <em>​Digital Asia Hub</em></li>
<li>Will cross-company visibility into shared free and open source dependencies lead to cross-company collaboration and efforts to sustain shared dependencies? &#8211; <em>​Duane O&#8217;Brien</em></li>
<li>How do open source tools contribute towards creating a multilingual internet? &#8211; <em>Anushah Hossain (UC Berkeley)</em></li>
<li>How digital infrastructure projects could embrace cooperatives as a sustainable model for working &#8211; ​<em>Jorge Benet (Cooperativa Tierra Común)</em></li>
<li>How do technical decision-makers assess the security ramifications of open source software components before adopting them in their projects and where can systemic interventions to the FOSS ecosystem be targeted to collectively improve its security? &#8211; <em>Divyank Katira (Centre for Internet &amp; Society in Bangalore)</em></li>
<li>How can African participation in the development, maintenance, and application of the global open source digital infrastructure be enhanced? &#8211; <em>Alex Comninos (Research ICT Africa (RIA) and the University of Cape Town)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The projects will receive their grants soon, and later in the year (or whenever they&#8217;re ready) the organizers will coordinate some kind of event at which they can present their results. Brennan made it clear that the funders take no stake in the projects and aren&#8217;t retaining or publishing the research themselves; they&#8217;re just coordinating and offering support where it makes sense.</p>
<p>$1.3 million is an interesting number. For some, it&#8217;s peanuts. A startup might burn through that cash in a month or two. But in an academic context, a hundred grand can be the difference between work getting done or being abandoned. The hope is that small injections at the base layer produce a better environment for the type of support the Ford Foundation and others provide as part of their other philanthropic and grantmaking efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At a time when e-commerce is exploding due in large part to the pandemic, a business that helps any online merchant ship goods to a consumer in one or two days is going to be in demand. <a href="https://deliverr.com/">Deliverr</a> is a startup that fits that bill, and today the company announced a $170 million financing round.</p>
<p>The round breaks down to $135 million Series D financing led by Coatue. The remaining $35 million comes in the form of a convertible note led by Brookfield Technology Partners. Existing investors Activant Capital, 8VC and GLP participated in both parts of the investment. In less than four years, the company has raced from from rounds A to D, raising $240 million along the way.</p>
<p>Deliverr co-founder and CEO Michael Krakaris says it has been a rapid rise, but that his business requires a lot of capital. &#8220;It has been this really kind of crazy journey, and we&#8217;ve been growing very fast, but also this space is very capital intensive, and it&#8217;s a winner-take-all market where you gain efficiency at scale. You know scale is what makes your model highly defensible in this space,&#8221; Krakaris told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The way Deliverr works is it uses software to determine how to get goods to warehouses in parts of the country where they are needed. It then uses these warehouses&#8217; fulfillment departments to help pick and pack the order. The software then finds the fastest and cheapest delivery method and it gets shipped to customers with a two-day delivery guarantee. They are also ramping a next-day delivery product to expand the business.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Coupa Software snags Llamasoft for $1.5B to bring together spending and supply chain data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/coupa-software-snags-llamasoft-for-1-5b-to-bring-together-spending-and-supply-chain-data/embed/#?secret=ZDUQw8xPO2" data-secret="ZDUQw8xPO2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Deliverr doesn&#8217;t actually own any warehouses. It rents out space, and part of the challenge of building this business is establishing relationships with those warehouses and working out a business arrangement, one that is still evolving as the company grows. &#8220;A year ago, I would have said we typically wanted to be 5-10% of a warehouse&#8217;s business. There are cases now where we are 100% of these warehouses&#8217; businesses. We&#8217;ve grown to that level,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Krakaris says that the pandemic raised major challenges for the company. Just setting up a relationship with new warehouses could require driving long distances because getting on a plane would mean quarantining when they landed. In some instances there were shortages of items. In others, COVID would shut down all of the warehouses in a given region, forcing the executive team to make a set of business adjustments on the fly, but this constant crisis mentality also helped them learn how to shift resources quickly, a lesson that is highly useful in this business.</p>
<p>The company started 2020 with 50 people and have added 100 employees since. They plan to double that this year, although that is variable depending on how the year goes. He say that another challenge is that he has done this hiring during COVID, and has never met a majority of his workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, I&#8217;ve never met more than half the company in person, but I&#8217;m try to be as open as I can and learn about everyone, and we hold events to try and get to know everybody, but obviously it&#8217;s not like being together in person,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/brave/">Brave</a>, the privacy-focused browser co-founded by ex-Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich, is getting ready to launch an own-brand search engine for desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>Today it&#8217;s announced the acquisition of an open source search engine developed by the team behind the (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/cliqz-pulls-the-plug-on-a-european-anti-tracking-alternative-to-google-search/">now defunct</a>) Cliqz anti-tracking search-browser combo. The tech will underpin the forthcoming Brave Search engine &#8212; meaning it will soon be pitching its millions of users on an entirely &#8216;big tech&#8217;-free search and browsing experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the hood, nearly all of today’s search engines are either built by, or rely on, results from Big Tech companies. In contrast, the Tailcat search engine is built on top of a completely independent index, capable of delivering the quality people expect but without compromising their privacy,&#8221; Brave writes in a press release announcing the acquisition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Tailcat does not collect IP addresses or use personally identifiable information to improve search results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cliqz, which was a privacy-focused European fork of Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox browser, got shuttered last May after its majority investor, <a href="https://www.burda.com/de/news/cliqz-schliesst-bereiche/">Hubert Burda Media</a>, called time on the multi-year effort to build momentum for an alternative to Google &#8212; blaming tougher trading conditions during the pandemic for forcing it to pull the plug sooner than it would have liked.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZmhXeylP5h"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/cliqz-pulls-the-plug-on-a-european-anti-tracking-alternative-to-google-search/">Cliqz pulls the plug on a European anti-tracking alternative to Google search</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cliqz pulls the plug on a European anti-tracking alternative to Google search&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/cliqz-pulls-the-plug-on-a-european-anti-tracking-alternative-to-google-search/embed/#?secret=ZmhXeylP5h" data-secret="ZmhXeylP5h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The former Cliqz dev team, who had subsequently been working on Tailcat, are moving to Brave as part of the acquisition. The engineering team is led by Dr Josep M Pujol &#8212; who is quoted in Brave&#8217;s PR saying it&#8217;s &#8220;excited to be working on the only real private search/browser alternative to Big Tech&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tailcat is a fully independent search engine with its own search index built from scratch,&#8221; Eich told TechCrunch. &#8220;Tailcat as Brave Search will offer the same privacy guarantees that Brave has in its browser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brave will provide the first private browser+search alternative to the Big Tech platforms, and will make it seamless for users to browse and search with guaranteed privacy. Also, owing to its transparent nature, Brave Search will address algorithmic biases and prevent outright censorship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brave getting into the search business is a reflection of its confidence that privacy is becoming mainstream, per Eich. He points to &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; growth in usage of its browser over the past year &#8212; up from 11M monthly active users to 26M+ &#8212; which he says has mirrored the surge in usage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/">earlier this year</a> seen by the (not-for-profit) e2e encrypted messaging app Signal (after Facebook-owned WhatsApp announced a change to its privacy policies to allow for increased data-sharing with Facebook through WhatsApp business accounts).</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to see even greater demand for Brave in 2021 as more and more users demand real privacy solutions to escape Big Tech’s invasive practices,” he added in a statement. “Brave’s mission is to put the user first, and integrating privacy-preserving search into our platform is a necessary step to ensure that user privacy is not plundered to fuel the surveillance economy.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brave web browser adds native support for peer-to-peer IPFS protocol&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/brave-web-browser-adds-native-support-for-peer-to-peer-ipfs-protocol/embed/#?secret=G9kfiLhe8y" data-secret="G9kfiLhe8y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Brave Search will be offered as a choice to users alongside a roster of more established third parties (Google, Bing, Qwant, Ecosia etc) which they can select as their browser default.</p>
<p>It will also potentially become the default (i.e. if users don&#8217;t pick their own) in future, per Eich.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to support &#8216;open search&#8217; with multiple alternative engines,&#8221; he confirmed. &#8220;User choice is a permanent principle at Brave. Brave will continue to offer multiple alternative choices for the user’s default search engine, and we think our users will seek unmatched privacy with Brave Search. When ready, we hope to make Brave Search the default engine in Brave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked how the quality of Tailcat-powered results vs Google Eich described it as &#8220;quite good&#8221;, adding that it &#8220;will only get better with adoption&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google’s &#8216;long tail&#8217; is hard for any engine to beat but we have a plan to compete on that front too, once integrated into the Brave browser,&#8221; he told us in an email interview, arguing that Google&#8217;s massive size does offer some competitive opportunities for a search rival. &#8220;There are aspects where Google is falling behind. It is difficult for them to innovate in search when that’s the main source of their revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are risk-averse against experimenting with new techniques and transparency, while under pressure from shareholders to tie their own businesses into scarce search engine results page (SERP) area, and pressure from search engine optimization (SEO).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On questions such as censorship, community feedback, and algorithmic transparency, we think we can do better from the get-go. Unlike other search engines, we believe that the only way to make big improvements is to build afresh, with the know-how that comes from building,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The option of using Bing (as other search offerings do) instead of building the index exists but it will get you only as far as Bing in terms of quality (and as with such offerings, you’ll be wholly dependent on Bing).&#8221;</p>
<p>Brave is aiming for general availability of Brave Search by the summer &#8212; if not late spring, per Eich. Users interested in testing an early iteration can sign up for a <a href="http://brave.com/search">waitlist here</a>. (A test version is slated as coming in &#8220;the next few weeks&#8221;.)</p>
<p>The name Tailcat is unlikely to be widely familiar as it was an internal project that Cliqz had not implemented into its browser before it was shut down.</p>
<p>Eich says development had been continuing at Burda &#8212; &#8220;in order to develop a full-fledged search engine&#8221;. (When the holding company a<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">nnounced the shuttering of Cliqz, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.burda.com/en/news/cliqz-closes-areas-browser-and-search-technologies/">last April</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, it stated that Cliqz&#8217;s browser and search technologies would be shut down but also said it would draw out a team of experts &#8212; to work on technical issues in areas like AI and search.)</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Cliqz offered the SERP-based search engine but had not implemented Tailcat in its browser yet,&#8221; said Eich. &#8220;After Cliqz shut down last April, a development team at Burda continued to work on the search technology under the new project name Tailcat in order to develop a full-fledged search engine. The team hoped to find a long-term home for their work to continue their mission, and are thrilled to be part of Brave.&#8221;</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition are not being disclosed &#8212; but we&#8217;ve confirmed that Burda is becoming a Brave shareholder as part of the deal.</p>
<p>“We are very happy that our technology is being used at Brave and that, as a result, a <u></u><u></u>genuine, privacy-friendly alternative to Google is being created in the core web <u></u><u></u>functions of browsing and searching,” said Paul-Bernhard Kallen, CEO of Hubert Burda Media, in a supporting statement. “As a Brave stakeholder we will continue to be involved in this exciting project.”</p>
<p>While Brave started out focused on building an alternative browser &#8212; with the idea of rethinking the predominate ad-funded Internet business model by baking in a cryptocurrency rewards system to generate payments for content creators (and pay users for their attention) &#8212; it now talks about itself as a pro-privacy &#8220;super app&#8221;.</p>
<p>Currently, the Brave Browser bundles a privacy-preserving ad platform (<a href="https://brave.com/brave-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/brave-ads/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614762976261000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFDcbQpFf8g4R6rFI_PNQzxTSX6Xw">Brave Ads</a>); news reader (<a href="https://brave.com/announcing-brave-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/announcing-brave-today/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614762976261000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEP8PfxyjoONyl1WWCwP2Kobv6hIA">Brave Today</a>); and offers a <a href="https://brave.com/brave-and-guardian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/brave-and-guardian/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614762976261000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXFbjYtVmgW1GlCTqqRiX7lVFRZg">Firewall+VPN service</a> &#8212; which it will be further adding to with the forthcoming search engine (<a href="http://brave.com/search">Brave Search</a>), and a privacy-preserving video-conferencing service (<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/brave-together">Brave Together</a>) that&#8217;s also in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The unifying brand proposition for its &#8216;super app&#8217; is a pledge to provide users with genuine control over their online experience &#8212; in contrast to mainstream alternatives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost by default, open-source developers get very little insight into who uses their projects. In part, that&#8217;s the beauty of open source, but for developers who want to monetize their projects, it&#8217;s also a bit of a curse because they get very little data back from these projects. While you usually know who bought your proprietary software &#8212; and those tools often send back some telemetry, too &#8212; that&#8217;s not something that holds true for open-source code. <a href="https://about.scarf.sh/">Scarf</a> is trying to change that.</p>
<p>In its earliest incarnation, Scarf founder Avi Press tried to go the telemetry route for getting this kind of data. He had written a few successful developer tools and as they got more popular, he realized that he was spending an increasingly large amount of time supporting his users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120117" style="width: 361px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210217_204403624.MP_2-1.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120117" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2120117" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210217_204403624.MP_2-1.jpeg" alt="Scarf founder Avi Press" width="351" height="423" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210217_204403624.MP_2-1.jpeg 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210217_204403624.MP_2-1.jpeg?resize=124,150 124w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210217_204403624.MP_2-1.jpeg?resize=249,300 249w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210217_204403624.MP_2-1.jpeg?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2120117" class="wp-caption-text">Scarf co-founder and CEO Avi Press (<strong>Image Credits:</strong> Scarf)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This project was now really sapping my time and energy, but also clearly providing value to big companies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s really what got me thinking that there&#8217;s probably an opportunity to maybe provide support or build features just for these companies, or do something to try to make some money from that, or really just better support those commercial users.&#8221; But he also quickly realized that he had virtually no data about how the project was being used beyond what people told him directly and download stats from GitHub and other places. So as he tried to monetize the project, he had very little data to inform his decisions and he had no way of knowing which companies to target directly that were already quietly using his code.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were working at any old company &#8212; pushing code out to an app or a website &#8212; if you pushed out code without any observability, that would be reckless. You would you get fired over something like that. Or maybe not, but it&#8217;s a really poor decision to make. And this is the norm for every domain of software &#8212; except open source.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120118" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.01.10-PM-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120118" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2120118 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.01.10-PM-1.png" alt="" width="480" height="504" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.01.10-PM-1.png 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.01.10-PM-1.png?resize=143,150 143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.01.10-PM-1.png?resize=286,300 286w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.01.10-PM-1.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2120118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Scarf</p></div></p>
<p>That led to the first version of Scarf: a package manager that would provide usage analytics and make it easy to sell different versions of a project. But that wasn&#8217;t quite something <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20768365">the community</a> was ready to accept &#8212; and a lot of people questioned the open-source nature of the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;What really came out of those conversations, even chatting with people who were really, really against this kind of approach &#8212; everyone agrees that the package registries already have all of this data. So NPM and Docker and all these companies that have this data &#8212; there are many, many requests of developers for this data,&#8221; Press said, and noted that there is obviously a lot of value in this data.</p>
<p>So the new Scarf now takes a more sophisticated approach. While it still offers an NPM library that does phone home and pixel tracking for documentation, its focus is now on registries. What the company is essentially launching this week is a kind of middle layer between the code and the registry that allows developers to, for example, point users of their containers to the Scarf registry first and then Scarf sits in front of the Docker Hub or the GitHub Container Registry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You tell us, where are your containers located? And then your users pull the image through Scarf and Scarf just redirects the traffic to wherever it needs to go. But then all the traffic that flows through Scarf, we can expose that to the maintainers. What company did that pull come from? Was it on a laptop or on CI? What cloud provider was it on? What container runtime was it using? What version of the software did they pull down? And all of these things that are actually pretty trivial to answer from this traffic &#8212; and the registries could have been doing this whole time but unfortunately have not done so.&#8221;</p>
<p>To fund its efforts, Scarf recently raised a $2 million seed funding round led by <a href="http://wave.capital/">Wave Capital</a>, with participation from 468 Capital and a number of angel investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the startups raising capital in Mexico are focused on financial inclusion, aiming to level the playing field in a country that is largely unbanked and has a burgeoning middle class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such company, <a href="https://minu.mx">minu</a>, a Mexico City-based, pay-on-demand startup, announced Wednesday that it has raised $14 million in a Series A round of funding led by FinTech Collective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors VEF, XYZ Ventures, and FJ Labs, as well as DocuSign founder Tom Gonser and Gusto CFO Mike Dinsdale also participated in the financing. Existing backers QED, Next Billion Ventures, and Village Global also put more money in the company. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing &#8212; which included $2.5 million in debt from Banco Sabadell Mexico &#8212; brings minu’s total raised since its 2019 inception to a total of $20 million.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founders Nima Pourshasb, Rafa Niell, and Paolo Rizzi were driven to build out a pay on demand offering in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really think the lack of financial health is one of the key drivers slowing the potential and productivity of Mexican society,” Pourshasb said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minu aims to solve the employee liquidity gap between paychecks in an effort to help people see reduced financial stress and avoid expensive loans. The company offers 24&#215;7 instant access to employees’ earned wages for a $2 fixed withdrawal fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, minu has over 100 large enterprise clients including TotalPlay, Telefonica, Scotiabank, OfficeMax, Rappi, Adecco, Manpower, Cap Gemini, and public sector clients such as the Electoral Institute of the State of Mexico. It saw its transaction volume and revenue grow by 18 times in 2020, albeit from a small base. The company declined to reveal hard revenue figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minu operates under the premise that the liquidity gap is profound in Mexican society. An estimated 70% of workers live from paycheck to paycheck with </span><a href="https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/ingresos-de-las-familias-mexicanas-cae-a-un-promedio-de-16-536-pesos-al-mes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">average wages of $550/month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, noted Pourshasb. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And only 37% of Mexicans over 15 years old </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/12/10/mexicans-lack-access-to-credit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a bank account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to recent World Bank stats.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2120193 alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AppShot1.png" alt="" width="422" height="877" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AppShot1.png 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AppShot1.png?resize=72,150 72w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AppShot1.png?resize=144,300 144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AppShot1.png?resize=327,680 327w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AppShot1.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some people are continuously getting loans &#8212; at very high interest rates &#8212;  to cover recurring expenses such as food and transport,” Pourshasb said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minu’s first product offers instant, 24-7 access to earned wages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is money that is already earned,” Pourshasb said. “Our users have an app to see how much is available and if they need those funds, they can instantly receive them.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s distribution model is B2B so it works alongside large enterprises to offer access to the wages as a benefit for employees. Businesses are attracted to that model, Pourshasb explained, because they don’t have to pay for it or change their payroll process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We integrate with payroll so the process is automated and there’s no added work for them,” he added. “It also doesn’t affect cash flows. These are upfront funds so if someone withdraws money, it gets deducted from payroll.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some employers do subsidize the cost of the transaction fee for employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, minu says it will use its fresh capital to boost its headcount of 60 as well as expanding its offering to include financial education, savings, smart spend and insurance products. The company also plans to expand outside of Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carlos Alonso Torras, who leads Latin America investing for New York-based FinTech Collective, believes that minu leverages “a strong combination of an exceptional founding team and auspicious macro trends.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see the company&#8217;s current product as the basis for a platform that will offer an array of necessary financial products to a very underserved demographic,” he wrote via email. “Minu is already creating a moat vis a vis competitors via deep integrations, high client satisfaction and a broadening financial wellness offering. As the early mover in a market whose characteristics are conducive to the success of pay on demand, the immediate growth potential is remarkable, and Minu is uniquely positioned to excel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment marks the firm’s fifth in Mexico.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Overall, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech Collective says it seeks and backs entrepreneurs “who are rewiring how money flows through the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Due to COVID, we are seeing a pandemic stricken world where hundreds of millions of people are facing greater financial instability, and we believe that fintech has a vital role to play in accelerating the emergence of a spending middle class underserved by traditional financial systems,” Torras added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintechs in Mexico have been busy. Last week, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stori raised </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/stori-raises-32-5m-to-build-mexicos-credit-card-for-the-masses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $32.5 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> round with the goal of “becoming Mexico’s leading credit card issuer for the rising middle class.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in February, Flink </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/accel-backs-mexican-startup-flinks-effort-to-bring-investing-to-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $12 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series A led by Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm Accel.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last night <a href="https://www.hioscar.com/">Oscar Health</a>, a tech-enabled medical insurance provider, priced its IPO <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210302006207/en/Oscar-Health-Inc.-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $39 per share</a>. The final price came in $1 per share above its raised IPO guidance; Oscar Health had originally targeted a $32-$34 per-share IPO price.</p>
<p>Some 37,041,026 shares were sold at $39, including 36,391,946 offered by the company itself. Not counting shares reserved for the company&#8217;s underwriters &#8212; more on those <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1568651/000119312521066182/d107550ds1mef.htm">here</a> &#8212; Oscar Health found at least $1.44 billion worth of demand for its equity at $39 apiece. More than 98% of the funds from the aggregate share sale went to the company&#8217;s accounts.</p>
<p>For backers Thrive Capital, Founders Fund, Formation 8, CapitalG, Fidelity, Alphabet, Coatue, Tiger Global and others, the day is a financial coup.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nuCvWpHuJa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/oscar-health-raises-ipo-price-as-coupang-releases-bullish-debut-valuation/">Oscar Health raises IPO price as Coupang releases bullish debut valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Oscar Health raises IPO price as Coupang releases bullish debut valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/oscar-health-raises-ipo-price-as-coupang-releases-bullish-debut-valuation/embed/#?secret=nuCvWpHuJa" data-secret="nuCvWpHuJa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But just how well did the company&#8217;s private backers do? To know that, we have to calculate what the company is worth at $39 per share. Oscar sold more shares in its debut than its final S-1/A filing expected, making its ensuing share count slightly tedious to calculate. However, the company&#8217;s simple IPO valuation appears to be just over $7.92 billion at its IPO price. IPO investing group Renaissance Capital calculates the company&#8217;s fully-diluted valuation, a figure that counts some additional shares, including that have been earned through options that have yet to be exercised, for example, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/78674/Health-insurer-Oscar-Health-prices-upsized-IPO-above-the-upwardly-revised-r">at $9.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar Health&#8217;s IPO has been a success from several perspectives. From a fundraising viewpoint, the company raised more than it may have initially expected to, comparing its final price point against its initial range. From a valuation perspective, the company is now worth a multiple of its last-known private valuation, some $3.2 billion set during its 2018 Series G, per <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>. The company did raise more private capital between that round and its IPO, but we lack valuation figures for those deals.</p>
<p>The company will begin trading this morning in a notable test for insurtech, and the sub-niche of medical insurtech. TechCrunch&#8217;s prior notes on the company&#8217;s IPO valuation aside, the bidding public have repriced Oscar Health.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli fraud prevention startup Identiq has raised $47 million at Series A as the company eyes international growth, driven in large part by the spike in online spending during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The round was led by Insight Partners and Entrée Capital, with participation from Amdocs, Sony Innovation Fund by IGV, as well as existing investors Vertex Ventures Israel, Oryzn Capital, and Slow Ventures.</p>
<p>Fraud prevention is big business, which is slated to be worth $145 billion by 2026, ballooning by eightfold in size compared to 2018. But it&#8217;s a data hungry industry, fraught with security and privacy risks, having to rely on sharing enormous sets of consumer data in order to learn who legitimate customers are in order to weed out the fraudsters, and therefore.</p>
<p>Identiq takes a different, more privacy-friendly approach to fraud prevention, without having to share a customer&#8217;s data with a third-party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before now, the only way companies could solve this problem was by exposing the data they were given by the user to a third party data provider for validation, creating huge privacy problems,&#8221; Identiq&#8217;s chief executive Itay Levy told TechCrunch. &#8220;We solved this by allowing these companies to validate that the data they’ve been given matches the data of other companies that already know and trust the user, without sharing any sensitive information at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>When an Identiq customer — such as an online store — sees a new customer for the first time, the store can ask other stores in Identiq&#8217;s network if they know or trust that new customer. This peer-to-peer network uses cryptography to help online stores anonymously vet new customers to help weed out bad actors, like fraudsters and scammers, without needing to collect private user data.</p>
<p>So far, the company says it already counts Fortune 500 companies as customers.</p>
<p>Identiq said it plans to use the $47 million raise to hire and grow the company&#8217;s workforce, and aims to scale up its support for its international customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Games company Zynga has been on an acquisition tear the last several years to beef up its activity in particular in mobile and casual-puzzle games, spending over $3 billion to pick up a range of startups across Europe (specifically Turkey and Finland) in the process. Today, however, it&#8217;s taking a turn towards more immersive, highly graphic cross-platform experiences. The company has announced that it is acquiring San Francisco&#8217;s <a href="https://www.echtragames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echtra Games</a>, the role-playing game publisher behind <a href="https://www.torchlight3.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Torchlight III</a>, which is available on Steam, XBox One, PS4 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>The team will be working on releasing a new title in partnership with Zynga&#8217;s NaturalMotion studio, the company said. No other details on that were released for now.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. It&#8217;s also not clear who backed Echtra, if anyone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Echtra is in some ways a classic example of a gaming startup built out of a burning idea, rather than cold, calculated moneymaking &#8212; perhaps the best kind of company you can have.</p>
<p>Max Schaefer, the co-founder and CEO, had previously been at Runic Games, the developer of the original Torchlight series, as well as Diablo and others. Runic was shuttered by its owner, Perfect World, and so in 2016, Shaefer went on to form a new company, Echtra, with some of his Runic colleagues and others in the industry because he saw more life left in the franchise.</p>
<p>That perhaps didn&#8217;t play out as well as Echtra had hoped, though. After the game exited early access into general availability, it received <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/torchlight-3-review-a-disappointing-and-dreary-return" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mixed reviews</a>, some of the criticism leveled at <a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/torchlight-3/interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how the game was built</a>, and some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight3/comments/kl1svr/bug_on_tutorial_quest_from_a_humble_seed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because of bugs</a>.</p>
<p>The plan will be to bring on Echtra&#8217;s team and expertise, potentially to continue building the franchise, but more generally to help Zynga build out more of a footprint in cross-platform games, and also gaming technology, in particular around tools built on Unreal Engine, the platform of choice at the moment for RPG and other immersive applications.</p>
<p class="p3">“Max and his team at Echtra Games are responsible for some of the most legendary game properties ever created, and they are experts in the action RPG genre and cross-platform development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m excited to welcome the Echtra Games team into the Zynga family,” said Frank Gibeau, Chief Executive Officer of Zynga, in a statement. “This acquisition will be instrumental in growing our iconic licenses and brands from mobile to PCs and consoles, while helping to further expand Zynga’s total addressable market.”</p>
<p class="p3">&#8220;Echtra Games is delighted to be joining the Zynga family,” added Max Schaefer. “We share Zynga’s vision that cross-platform play is an essential part of the future of RPGs and interactive entertainment and are eager to apply our vast experience and talents to this effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gaming has been one of the bright spots in the last year &#8212; no surprise, since people are spending so much more time indoors and at home because of the pandemic. Zynga, as a consequence of that, has also been on a roll in recent times, with its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210210005120/en/Zynga-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth quarter earnings</a>, released last month, beating analyst expectations. Its revenues of $616 million are the highest ever quarterly bookings posted by the company. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/zynga-q4-earnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acquisitions are major part of its strategy</a> these days, the company said at the time.</p>
<p>Going for more immersive RPG titles outside of mobile is an ambitious and potentially more expensive undertaking and is a very notable swerve away from the company&#8217;s acquisitions in recent years, which have included a majority stake in Turkey&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rollic for $228 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peak</a> for $2.1 billion, 80% of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/zynga-to-acquire-small-giant-games-the-maker-of-empires-puzzles-for-700m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Giant Games</a> for $718 million; and Gram Games for $299 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix said on Wednesday it will roll out 41 Indian films and shows this year, its biggest annual roster of Indian content to date, as the American giant makes further push to win subscribers in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The streaming giant, which committed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/06/netflix-earmarks-420m-to-fight-disney-in-india/">spending about $420 million on locally produced Indian content</a> in 2019 and 2020, is this year spending significantly more on the new Indian catalog, which is three times larger than the past two years combined.</p>
<p>The new titles feature high-profile Indian actors and directors including Madhuri Dixit, Karan Johar, Manoj Bajpayee, R. Madhavan, Raveena Tandon, Neena Gupta, and Dhanush.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new roster includes “Bombay Begums,” which follows stories of five women across generations wrestling with desire, ethics, and personal crises, “Decoupled,” a comedy by writer Manu Joseph on India and marriage, and a second season of Emmy-winning drama “Delhi Crime.”</p>
<p>Also in the list are comedy specials that have become immensely popular on streaming services in India. Netflix said comedians including Sumukhi Suresh, Aakaash Gupta, Rahul Dua, and Prashasti Singh &#8212; all of whom have participated in comedy shows by Amazon Prime Video &#8212; will have shows on the streaming service this year.</p>
<p>Kota Factory (a still from which is pictured above), a show that debuted on YouTube about a group of students preparing to compete to get into the prestigious engineering colleges, will stream its second season on Netflix later this year. The Viral Fever, the producer of the show, had <a href="https://blog.unacademy.com/our-very-own-kota-factory-becomes-the-most-loved-web-series-of-2019-14d50df4481">collaborated with Indian edtech startup Unacademy</a>, for the first season of the show.</p>
<p>Dice Media’s “Little Things”, which also began its life as native advertisement for a few firms but has since grown into its own show, is getting a fourth season this year.</p>
<p>“Our upcoming lineup features more variety and diversity than we have seen before. From the biggest films and series, to gripping documentaries and reality, and bold comedy formats. We are taking our next big leap in India to bring you more than 40 powerful and irresistible stories from all corners of the country,” said Monika Shergill, Vice President of Content at Netflix India.</p>
<p>“This is just a taste of the films and series to come. We are so excited to share these rich and diverse stories from the best and brightest creators and talent from India to the world,” said Shergill.</p>

Madhavan and Surveen Chawla in a still from Netflix&#8217;s upcoming show &#8220;Decoupled.&#8221; (Netflix)</p></div></p>
<p>Netflix’s growing catalog in India comes as Bollywood, which churns out more movies than any other film industry, struggles to deliver big hits as theatres across the country report low footfall amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Last year, the Indian film industry <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/amazon-prime-video-to-globally-premiere-7-indian-movies-as-theaters-remain-closed/">began releasing some movies directly on streaming services</a> even as some key players are still resisting the idea.</p>
<p>Widely influential director and producer Karan Johar said at Netflix’s virtual press conference that streaming services are increasingly reaching the level of scale in India that the next “Kuch Kuch Hota Hai” &#8212; one of the biggest Indian blockbuster films, and also one directed by Johar &#8212; can release directly on Netflix.</p>
<p>Thanks to the availability of some of the world’s cheapest mobile data and proliferation of low-cost Android smartphones, more than half a billion Indians came online in the past decade, much of it in the last five years.</p>
<p>YouTube reaches <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">more than 450 million internet users in India</a>, TechCrunch reported in January. (India’s IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad corroborated the figure at a press conference last month.) Disney’s Hotstar has amassed over 30 million paying subscribers in India. Media consulting firm MPA estimates that Netflix has about 5 million subscribers in India, a figure that has grown in recent years as the streaming service inked a deal with India’s largest telecom operator Jio Platforms.</p>
<p>Netflix&#8217;s growing focus on India also comes at a time when New Delhi is getting more involved with the nature of content on on-demand streaming services. Until now Netflix and other streaming services have operated in India without having to worry too much about censorship. But that’s changing, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new rules announced by India last week</a>.</p>
<p>“The category classification of a content will take into account the potentially offensive impact of a film on matters such as caste, race, gender, religion, disability or sexuality that may arise in a wide range of works, and the classification decision will take account of the strength or impact of their inclusion,” the new rules state.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/amazon-issues-rare-apology-in-india-over-drama-series/">issued a rare apology to viewers in India</a> on Tuesday after some people &#8212; including lawmakers with governing Bhartiya Janata Party &#8212; objected to some scenes from its political mini-series &#8220;Tandav.&#8221; Netflix, itself, has faced some heat, too. A police case was filed against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/police-case-filed-against-netflix-executives-in-india-over-a-suitable-boy-kissing-scene/">two top executives of Netflix</a>, including Shergill, after some people objected to scenes of the show &#8220;A Suitable Boy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sometimes the smallest innovations can have the biggest impacts on the world&#8217;s efforts to stop global climate change. Arguably, one of the biggest contributors in the fight against climate change to date has been the switch to the humble LED light, which has slashed hundreds of millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions simply by reducing energy consumption in buildings.</p>
<p>And now firms backed by Robert Downey Jr. and Bill Gates are joining investors like Amazon and iPod inventor Tony Fadell to pour money into a company called <a href="https://turntide.com/">Turntide Technologies</a> that believes it has the next great innovation in the world&#8217;s efforts to slow global climate change &#8212; a better electric motor.</p>
<p><a href="https://ironman.fandom.com/wiki/Arc_Reactor#:~:text=The%20Arc%20Reactor%20was%20a,as%20it%20kept%20on%20improving.">It&#8217;s not as flashy as an arc reactor</a>, but like light bulbs, motors are a ubiquitous and wholly unglamorous technology that have been operating basically the same way since the nineteenth century. And, like the light bulb, they&#8217;re due for an upgrade.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Turntide’s technology and approach to restoring  our planet will directly reduce energy consumption,” said Steve Levin, the co-founder (along with Downey Jr. ) of <a href="https://www.footprintcoalition.com/">FootPrint Coalition Ventures</a>. </span></p>
<p>The operation of buildings is responsible for 40% of CO2 emissions worldwide, Turntide noted in a statement. And, according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), one-third of energy used in commercial buildings is wasted. Smart building technology adds an intelligent layer to eliminate this waste and inefficiency by automatically controlling lighting, air conditioning, heating, ventilation and other essential systems and Turntide&#8217;s electric motors can add additional savings.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why investors have put over $100 million into Turntide in just the last six months.</p>

<p>The company, led by chief executive and chairman Ryan Morris is commercializing technology that was developed initially at the Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Turntide&#8217;s basic innovation is a software controlled motor, or switch reluctance motor, that uses precise pulses of energy instead of a constant flow of electricity. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a conventional motor you are continuously driving current into the motor whatever speed you want to run it at,&#8221; Morris said. &#8220;We’re pulsing in precise amounts of current just at the times when you need the torque… It&#8217;s software defined hardware.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>The technology spent eleven years under development, in part because the computing power didn&#8217;t exist to make the system work, according to Morris.</p>
<p>Morris was initially part of an investment firm called Meson Capital that acquired the technology back in 2013, and it was another four years of development before the motors were actually able to function in pilots, he said. The company spent the last three years developing the commercialization strategy and proving the value in its initial market &#8212; retrofitting the heating ventilation and cooling systems in buildings that are the main factor in the built environment&#8217;s 28% contribution to carbon dioxide emissions that are leading to global climate change.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our mission is to replace all of the motors in the world,&#8221; Morris said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He estimates that the technology is applicable to 95% of where electric motors are used today, but the initial focus will be on smart buildings because it&#8217;s the easiest place to start and can have some of the largest immediate impact on energy usage. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The carbon impact of what we’re doing is pretty massive,&#8221; Morris told me last year. &#8220;The average energy reduction [in buildings] has been a 64% reduction. If we can replace all the motors in buildings in the US that’s the carbon equivalent of adding over 300 million tons of carbon sequestration per year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Downey Jr.&#8217;s Footprint Coalition, and Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy Ventures and the real estate and construction focused venture firm Fifth Wall Ventures have joined the Amazon Climate Fund, Tony Fadell&#8217;s Future Shape, BMW&#8217;s iVentures fund and a host of other investors in backing the company.</p>
<p>The company has raised roughly $180 million in financing including the disclosure today of an $80 million investment round, which closed in October.</p>
<p>Buildings are clearly the current focus for Turntide, which only yesterday announced the acquisition of a small Santa Barbara, Calif.-based building management software developer called Riptide IO. But there&#8217;s also an application in another massive industry &#8212; electric vehicles.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Two years from now we will definitely be in electric vehicles,&#8221; Morris said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our technology has huge advantages for the electric vehicle industry. There’s no rare earth minerals. Every EV uses rare earth minerals to get better performance of their electric motors,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;They&#8217;re expensive, destructive to mine and China controls 95 percent of the global supply chain for them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not use any exotic materials, rare earth minerals or magnets.. We&#8217;re replacing that with very advanced software and computation. It&#8217;s the first time Moore’s law applies to the motor.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation has taken the enterprise world by storm, by providing a set of tools for those doing repetitive, volume-based tasks to use software to remove some of that labor to let those people focus on more complicated tasks. Today a startup that&#8217;s taken some of that ethos and is applying it to more individualized work &#8212; that of salespeople &#8212; is announcing some funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dooly.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dooly</a>, a Vancouver, Canada-based startup that has built a set of AI-based tools that automate the busywork that goes into updating data in their sales software, and namely Salesforce &#8212; has picked up $20 million in funding to build out its business, which to date has picked up a number of customers among the sales teams of enterprise-focused software companies. They <a href="https://www.dooly.ai/resources/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include</a> Airtable, Asana, Intercom, Contentful, Vidyard, BigCommerce, Liftoff and CrowdRiff.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Its aim is to make sales software more useful for salespeople by eliminating the work that goes into inputting data into those systems.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Really they’ve just created a mountain of virtual filing cabinets,&#8221; Kris Hartvigsen, Dooly&#8217;s founder and CEO, said in an emailed interview with me. &#8220;Filing cabinets just wait for drawers to be opened &#8212; or in the case of enterprise software, reports to be pulled and data to be input. We know people are capturing information across the business and our job is to make sure that the people and systems across the business have a better, faster, more far-reaching way of staying informed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The funding is being announced today, but it was actually raised in two tranches that had not previously been disclosed. A $3.3 million seed round was led by boldstart ventures and also included BoxGroup. Its $17 million Series A, meanwhile, was led by Addition, with boldstart and BoxGroup again participating, along with Battery Ventures, Mantis (representing musicians The Chainsmokers), and SV Angel.</p>
<p>Alongside the VCs, there are a number of interesting strategic individual investors, too. Daniel Dines and Brandon Deer of UIPath (the RPA connection clearly is not one that I&#8217;m imagining!); Allison Pickens, the ex-COO Gainsight; Zander Lurie of SurveyMonkey); Jay Simons, ex-CEO of Atlassian); Harry Stebbings, and other unnamed investors are all also involved. Ed Sim of Boldstart is joining Dooly’s board of directors with this announcement.</p>
<p>The challenge that Dooly has been built to solve is that while there are a lot of tools out there now to help salespeople source leads, manage the progress of their sales, give them advice and other helpful material to supplement their charm and the basic strength of a product, manage customers once they&#8217;ve signed on, and so on, all of them still require something important to work: a time commitment from salespeople to keep them updated with information. Ironically, the more tools to help them that are built, the more time salespeople need to spend feeding them data.</p>
<p>Even more ironically, one of the big daddies of the problem &#8212; the somewhat overweight Salesforce &#8212; has published figures (cited by Dooly) that say salespeople spend just 34% of their time selling. The rest (minus trips to get coffee to stay caffeinated) seems to be about data entry.</p>
<p>The idea with Dooly is that you turn it on, connect it to what you are using &#8212; starting with Salesforce &#8212; and Dooly lets you make notes which it then organises and puts into the right places in the rest of your apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a salesperson starts using <span class="il">Dooly</span>, the &#8216;aha moment&#8217; is pretty immediate,&#8221; Hartvigsen said. &#8220;Whether they want to do quick pipeline edits or push their notes to Salesforce, we don’t ask the user to learn any new patterns they aren’t familiar with, we just automate a bunch of things they hate doing, often comparing those traditional chores to clerical work.&#8221; For example, he notes, when they sync a note, Dooly automatically updates any Salesforce with any contacts found in the meeting, update fields, add in to-do’s, log activities, push messages to the appropriate internal stakeholders on Slack, all in the same motion.</p>
<p>The product currently also integrates with <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Slack, G-Cal, and G-Drive, because, Hartvigsen said, &#8220;we see this as an area where there is the most immediate friction and an area that was in need of disruption.&#8221; He added that the plans is to add more integrations over time. &#8220;We see need to expand the solutions that anchor to our connected workspace, with our near-term focus being the systems that touch revenue teams,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The design of Dooly seems to be about investing a little in order to save more. On average people are using Dooly between 2.5 and 5 hours each day, but <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Hartvigsen </span>claims that right now the system helps people make up for more hours each week in lost productivity. Its pricing starts at $25 per user per month, going up depending on features and use.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are quite literally thousands of products out in the market today, and among them hundreds of strong ones, being built to help salespeople with different aspects of getting their jobs done. I&#8217;ve written about quite a few of them, and I&#8217;ve actually asked companies about whether they are tackling the very issue that Dooly has identified and is trying to fix.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They weren&#8217;t, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they won&#8217;t. Chief among them are companies like UiPath and Salesforce, which sit on different sides of this problem and could well move into it as they keep growing. (Having UiPath as a backer by way of its founder and a senior executive points to a relationship there, which is interesting.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the meantime, there have been some other interesting innovations using AI to improve the sales process, with companies like Pipedrive, Clari, Seismic, Chorus.ai and Gong all using natural language, machine learning, and big data analytics (itself helped by AI) to improve how sales get done.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The first thing we noticed when we met the Dooly team was the thoughtful design first approach to product that engendered tons of customer love. This love was inherent not only on popular ratings sites like G2 Crowd but also in the individual usage and viral adoption throughout companies with only one initial user,” said Ed Sim, Founder and Managing Partner at boldstart ventures in a statement. “Dooly is revolutionizing the note-taking experience for customer facing end users from sales to customer success to product.”</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"></li>
</ul>
<p>“Dooly is relentlessly focused on building a user-first experience for its customers to seamlessly create workflows and unlock new revenue opportunities,” said Lee Fixel, Founder of Addition, added. “We are thrilled to support Dooly as it continues to scale and enhance the sales function for more businesses.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When merchants launch their e-commerce businesses, they can easily manage the end-to-end operations in the early stages. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as they begin to grow, managing their own operations, from warehousing and logistics to delivery and cash collection, can become difficult. This</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can prevent them from scaling </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> despite having a steady inflow of demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, there&#8217;s a need to offload some of this workload. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where e-commerce fulfillment services come in handy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://www.flextock.com/">Flextock</a>, one such company providing this service to businesses and consumers in Egypt, is announcing that it is part of Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter 2021 batch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Founded by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-mossaad-50903438">Mohamed Mossaad</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/enas-siam-18150115/">Enas Siam</a> in September 2020, the Egyptian company launched in stealth this January.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to COO Siam, the founders noticed that as e-commerce activities in the Middle East and North African regions accelerated due to the pandemic, merchants </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overwhelmed with the volume of orders they received</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We saw it as an opportunity to build a tech-enabled platform to be able to help anyone that wanted to grow their own independent brand or store,&#8221; she told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted them to focus on their products and marketing while leaving the supply chain and logistics bit to us, which we do through our end-to-end proprietary software</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mossaad, the company&#8217;s CEO, describes Flextock as a tech-enabled fulfillment provider. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When merchants sign up to the platform, they send their products to one of the company&#8217;s fulfillment centers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Flextock takes the whole catalog and tags the products for tracking purposes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, integration </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between Flextock and any online store they use, be it Shopify, WooCommerce, Wix and Odoo, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As orders </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Flextock packages and ships the products from the fulfillment center to the customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flextock doesn&#8217;t own any delivery vehicles, so to achieve this, the company partners with existing logistics companies in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model has helped the startup to create a marketplace for different last-mile delivery companies in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120227" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120227" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2120227 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="174" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg 1480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=300,77 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=768,196 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=680,174 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120227" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flextock</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s also a dashboard for these merchants to track each order, get more visibility into their shipping process and know how well their products sell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flextock makes money on a per-order basis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means the merchants on the platform pay a flat fee that changes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with respect to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the volume of products moved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mossaad says that since the company beta launched in January with more than 20 businesses, it has been growing 50% week-on-week</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across 28 cities in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, Flextock is the first end-to-end fulfillment service in Egypt. And in a market that will likely see more competition in the next couple of years, Mossaad thinks Flextock has the opportunity to become the market leader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind this rationale is that the six-month-old startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/22989">backed by Y Combinator</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and has also raised $850,000 which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the first part of its multi-million-dollar pre-seed round that will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> close</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sometime this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were able to very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">get the acceptance of YC given the size of the opportunity we are focused on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We believe that commerce is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to change in the Middle East and Africa, and Flextock is going to be at the forefront of powering this next generation of commerce,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders combine a wealth of corporate experience and a strong track record of scaling tech startups in the MENA region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In China&#8217;s cosmetics world, where foreign brands were historically revered, indigenous startups are increasingly winning over Gen-Z consumers with cheaper, more localized options. One of the rising stars is the direct-to-consumer brand Perfect Diary, which is owned by five-year-old startup Yatsen.</p>
<p>Yatsen impressed the capital market with a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yatsen-holding-limited-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering-301176851.html">$617 million initial public offering</a> on NYSE in November. Its flagship brand Perfect Diary consistently ranks among the top makeup brands by online sales next to giants like L’Oreal and Shiseido. Now the company is plotting another big move as it set out to buy Eve Lom, a 35-year-old skincare brand owned by British private equity firm, Manzanita Capital.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Yatsen, named after the father of modern China, Sun Yat-sen, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yatsen-to-acquire-prestige-skincare-brand-eve-lom-301238307.html">announced</a> it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Eve Lom, which is known for its cleanser. The deal is expected to close within the next few weeks and Manzanita will retain a minority stake in the business and serve as a strategic partner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The size of the deal wasn&#8217;t disclosed but Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/u-k-pe-firm-is-said-to-mull-sale-of-skincare-brand-eve-lom">reported</a> in February that Manzanita was looking to sell Eve Lom for as much as $200 million.</p>
<p>Perfect Diary rose to prominence in China by partnering with influencers who reviewed the brand&#8217;s lipsticks, eyeshadow palettes, foundation and other products on Chinese social commerce platforms like Xiaohongshu. It took advantage of its vicinity to China&#8217;s abundant cosmetics and packaging suppliers, many of whom also work with top international brands. The strategies have allowed Perfect Diary to offer affordable prices without compromising quality, and earn it the moniker, &#8220;Xiaomi for cosmetics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Growth has skyrocketed at Yatsen since its founding. Its gross sales more than quadrupled to 3.5 billion yuan ($540 million) in 2019 from 2018, thanks to an effective e-commerce strategy. But losses also ballooned. The company recorded a net loss of 1.16 billion yuan ($170 million) in the nine months ended September 2020, compared to a net income of 29.1 million yuan in the year before.</p>
<p>Yatsen has been on the hunt for potential acquisitions to diversify its product portfolio, as it noted in its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819580/000119312520282237/d57580df1.htm#rom57580_10">prospectus</a>. Through the Eve Lom marriage, the company hopes to &#8220;enrich our global brand-building capabilities and product offerings,&#8221; said Jinfeng Huang, founder and CEO of Yatsen in the announcement.</p>
<p>Yatsen has already embarked on international expansion, landing in Southeast Asia first where it is selling on e-commerce sites like Shopee. It said in the prospectus that it plans on &#8220;selectively cooperating with local partners to accelerate our international expansion and localize our product offerings.&#8221; In the competitive and entrenched makeup world, Yatsen&#8217;s overseas expedition is definitely a curious one to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a year where mass transit on airplanes, trains and buses has had lower traveler numbers in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, one of the startups hoping to pioneer a totally new approach to getting individuals from A to B &#8212; flying taxis &#8212; has raised some significant funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.volocopter.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volocopter</a>, a startup out of southern Germany (Bruchsal, specifically) that has been building and testing electric VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft, has picked up €200 million (about $241 million) in a Series D round of funding. Alongside its aircraft, Volocopter has also been building a business case in which its vessels will be used in a taxi-style fleet in urban areas. CEO Florian Reuter tells us that live services are now two years out for the two vehicle models it has been developing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are actually expecting to certify our VoloCity in around two years and start commercial air taxi operations right after,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Paris and Singapore are in pole position [as the first cities], where Paris wants to get have electric air taxis established for the 2024 Olympics. With our VoloDrone we expect first commercial flights even earlier than with our VoloCity.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To date, Volocopter has shown off its craft in flights in Helsinki, Stuttgart, Dubai, and over Singapore’s Marina Bay. In addition to Europe and Asia, it also wants to launch services in the U.S..</p>
<p>For some context, this is basically on track with what the company had previously projected: in 2019 &#8212; when Volocopter raised an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/08/volocopter-raises-55m-led-by-volvo-owner-geely-sets-3-year-timeline-for-its-flying-taxi-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial $55 million in funding</a> for its Series C (finally closed out at €87 million, around $94 million) &#8212; the company said it was three years away from service.</p>
<p>This latest (oversubscribed) Series D includes investments from a mix of financial and strategic backers. Funds managed by BlackRock; global infrastructure company Atlantia S.p.A.; Avala Capital; automotive parts behemoth Continental AG; Japan&#8217;s NTT via its venture capital arm; Tokyo Century, a Japanese leasing company; multiple family offices are all new investors, among others. Volocopter also said that all of its existing investors &#8212; that list includes Geely, Daimler, DB Schenker, Intel Capital, btov Partners, Team Europe, and Klocke Holding and more &#8212; also contributed to the round.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a big list, it&#8217;s somewhat intentional, as the task of what Volocopter is complex and requires a wide ecosystem of other players, said Rene Griemens, the company&#8217;s CFO.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting urban air mobility off the ground requires a full ecosystem that we are developing right now. Many of our strategic partners will support us on different aspects of the supply chain, scaling components, entering markets, improving operations amongst others. Most of them know certain aspects of our business model really well (eg. Japan Airlines for aviation, Atlantia for infrastructure),&#8221; he said. &#8220;Their investment is a reflection of their excitement about Volocopter as a leader in building the entire ecosystem of UAM, thereby giving credibility and comfort for purely financial investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that many of these companies have a very &#8220;hands-on partnership&#8221; with Volocopter. &#8220;DB Schenker, for example, is rolling out leading-edge heavily-load electric logistics drones together with us around the globe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has now raised nearly $390 million. We&#8217;re asking for an updated valuation, but for some context, <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/60585-58/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a> estimates its valuation now at $624 million.</p>
<h2>Moonshots and sunsets</h2>
<p>Founded in 2011, Volocopter has now been working on its idea &#8212; distinctive for its very wide circular design that sits where the rotor on a helicopter would be &#8212; for a whole decade, and in many regards it&#8217;s the classic idea of a moonshot in action.</p>
<p>It has yet to make any money, and the product that it&#8217;s building to do so is very groundbreaking &#8212; flying into completely unchartered territory, so to speak &#8212; and therefore ultimately untested.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the only one working on &#8220;flying taxi&#8221; concepts &#8212; there are other very well-capitalised companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/08/lilium-adds-35m-from-baillie-gifford-at-a-1b-valuation-for-its-electric-aircraft-taxi-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lilum</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-to-joby-aviation-shedding-its-last-moonshot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joby Aviation</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/kitty-hawk-ends-flyer-program-shifts-focus-to-once-secret-autonomous-aircraft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kitty Hawk</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/air-taxi-company-ehang-flies-autonomously-in-the-u-s-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eHang</a>.</p>
<p>However, all of these have faced various hurdles ranging from <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ehang-investor-alert-shareholder-lawsuit-050000521.html">investor lawsuits</a> to <a href="http://ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-12-29/vtol-aircraft-maker-morgan-files-bankruptcy">bankruptcies</a>, <a href="https://evtol.com/news/lilium-evtol-catches-fire/">accidents</a>, mothballed projects and divestments (perhaps most notably, Joby scooped up Elevate last year as Uber stepped away from costly moonshots).</p>
<p>And most importantly, none of them are flying commercially yet. With Volocopter (as with the others), investors have taken a long-term bet here on a concept and a team it believes can deliver.</p>
<p>For now, the company says that technology is no longer the barrier, and neither it seems are regulators, who are, in the pandemic, more focused on considering new approaches to old problems to improve efficiency and acknowledge that we might have to do things a little differently from now on, in the wake of new demands from public health, and the public.</p>
<p>In the case of VTOL craft, the promise has always been that they could bypass a lot of the issues with street congestion in urban areas, and provide a more environmental alternative to gas-guzzling, present-day transportation modes.</p>
<p>The challenge, on the other hand, has been determining the safety both of completely new devices, and also of the traffic and other systems that they would operate under. With the idea being that ultimately these craft would be autonomous, that adds another complex twist.</p>
<p>Interestingly, regulators in different markets that might have been more skeptical of new concepts seem to be more open to considering them differently now with the pandemic at hand. This has played out in other arenas, too, such as the electric scooter market in the UK, which saw a bump in activity after regulators long skeptical gave them a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/15/uk-lays-out-plans-for-legal-e-scooters-medical-drones-and-more-transportation-innovation-in-test-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provisional nod last year</a>, citing the need for more individualized transportation options in a pandemic-hit country.</p>
<p>Volocopter&#8217;s model is based around transporting one person or small parties, so in a sense might be attractive here too.</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren’t any major hurdles anymore in terms of the technology as such,&#8221; said Retuer. &#8220;It is now all about execution. EASA has defined what is necessary to get electric air taxis certified to the highest safety level in aviation. We have the best technology in the market to certify to EASA’s high safety standards and will keep our heads down to finalize the few remaining steps to certification.&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast, he said the other challenges that remain are those of any highly technical startup: &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Our largest challenge right now is talent acquisition,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are looking for the best talents worldwide and growing our team quickly now, so that we can accelerate on the technical and market development sides. Especially in the markets where we will open early routes, such as Paris, Singapore, China and Japan, we are going full speed in preparing everything necessary from digital infrastructure to landing sites, city approvals and more.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2021/01/03/e-commerce-boosts-the-logistics-sector-in-indonesia.html">rapid growth of e-commerce</a> in Indonesia, especially during the pandemic, is placing increasing demands on its supply chain infrastructure. But the country&#8217;s logistics industry is highly fragmented, with companies usually relying on multiple distributors for one shipment, and many warehouses are still concentrated around major cities. <a href="https://www.advotics.com/en/">Advotics</a> wants to help with software to make the whole supply chain easier to track, and recently closed a $2.75 million funding round led by East Ventures.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Boris Sanjaya, Hendi Chandi and Jeffry Tani, Advotics has now raised a total of $5.5 million and currently counts more than 70 clients, ranging from individual resellers to large corporations like Exxonmobil, Danone, Reckitt Benckiser, Sampoerna, Kalbe and Mulia Group.</p>
<p>According to research institution Statistics Indonesia, there are about 5 million small and medium-sized manufacturers in Indonesia. They use a supply chain with 15 million small to mid-sized distributors and about 288,000 large distribution companies. This fragmentation means higher expenses, with <a href="https://www.reportlinker.com/p05797252/Indonesia-Freight-and-Logistics-Market-Growth-Trends-and-Forecast.html?utm_source=GNW">Report Linker estimating</a> that logistics costs range between 25% to 30% of Indonesia’s gross domestic product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>To help make logistics more efficient for its clients, Advotics offers SaaS solutions to monitor almost their entire supply and logistics chain, from warehouse inventory to generating delivery routes for drivers. It includes a product digitalization feature that uses QR codes to track products and prevent counterfeiting, and tools for salespeople visiting retail stores, since that is still one of the most effective tools for manufacturers and importers to find customers.</p>
<p>The company’s new funding will be used to launch a online-to-offline system for SMEs and grow its sales team. The online-to-offline system will allow sellers to integrate inventory and sales from all of their channels, including brick-and-mortar, business-to-business and e-commerce.</p>
<p>Advotics is among several tech startups that are taking different approaches to tackle Indonesia’s logistics infrastructure. For example, Shipper <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/shipper-a-platform-for-e-commerce-logistics-in-indonesia-raises-5-million/">wants to give sellers access </a>to &#8220;Amazon-level logistics,&#8221; while Logisly is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/indonesian-logistics-platform-logisly-raises-6-million-series-a-to-digitize-truck-shipments/">focused on digitizing truck shipments</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Facebook Oversight Board (FOB) is already feeling frustrated by the binary choices it&#8217;s expected to make as it reviews Facebook&#8217;s content moderation decisions, according to one of its members who was giving evidence to a <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/0e460b4b-d83c-478c-ba8a-c2588adec3fa">UK House of Lords committee</a> today which <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is running an </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://committees.parliament.uk/work/745/freedom-of-expression-online/">enquiry</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> into freedom of expression online. </span></p>
<p>The FOB is currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/facebook-trump-oversight-board-public-comment/">considering</a> whether to overturn Facebook&#8217;s ban on former US president, Donald Trump. The tech giant banned Trump &#8220;indefinitely&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">earlier this year</a> after his supporters stormed the US capital.</p>
<p>The chaotic insurrection on January 6 led to a number of deaths and widespread condemnation of how mainstream tech platforms had stood back and allowed Trump to use their tools as megaphones to whip up division and hate rather than enforcing their rules in his case.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yet, after finally banning Trump, Facebook almost immediately referred the case to it’s self-appointed and self-styled Oversight Board for review — opening up the prospect that its Trump ban could be reversed in short order via an exceptional review process that Facebook has fashioned, funded and staffed.</p>

<p>Alan Rusbridger, a former editor of the British newspaper The Guardian — and one of 20 FOB members selected as an initial cohort (the Board&#8217;s full headcount will be double that) — avoided making a direct reference to the Trump case today, given the review is ongoing, but he implied that the binary choices it has at its disposal at this early stage aren&#8217;t as nuanced as he&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>“What happens if — without commenting on any high profile current cases &#8212; you didn’t want to ban somebody for life but you wanted to have a &#8216;sin bin&#8217; so that if they misbehaved you could chuck them back off again?&#8221; he said, suggesting he&#8217;d like to be able to issue a soccer-style &#8220;yellow card&#8221; instead.</p>
<p>“I think the Board will want to expand in its scope. I think we’re already a bit frustrated by just saying take it down or leave it up,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;What happens if you want to&#8230; make something less viral? What happens if you want to put an interstitial?</p>
<p>&#8220;So I think all these things are things that the Board may ask Facebook for in time. But we have to get our feet under the table first — we can do what we want.&#8221;</p>
<p>“At some point we’re going to ask to see the algorithm, I feel sure — whatever that means,&#8221; Rusbridger also told the committee. &#8220;Whether we can understand it when we see it is a different matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>To many people, Facebook&#8217;s Trump ban is uncontroversial &#8212; given the risk of further violence posed by letting Trump continue to use its megaphone to foment insurrection. There are also clear and repeat breaches of Facebook&#8217;s community standards if you want to be a stickler for its rules.</p>
<p>Among supporters of the ban is Facebook&#8217;s former chief security officer, Alex Stamos, who has since been working on wider trust and safety issues for online platforms via the Stanford Internet Observatory.</p>
<p>Stamos was urging both Twitter and Facebook to cut Trump off before everything kicked off, writing in early January: &#8220;There are no legitimate equities left and labeling won&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But in the wake of big tech moving <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">almost as a unit</a> to finally put Trump on mute, a number of world leaders and lawmakers were quick to express misgivings at the big tech power flex.</p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s chancellor called Twitter&#8217;s ban on him &#8220;problematic&#8221;, saying it raised troubling questions about the power of the platforms to interfere with speech. While other lawmakers in Europe seized on the unilateral action &#8212; saying it underlined the need for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/europe-seizes-on-social-medias-purging-of-trump-to-bang-the-drum-for-regulation/">proper democratic regulation of tech giants</a>.</p>
<p>The sight of the world&#8217;s most powerful social media platforms being able to mute a democratically elected president (even one as divisive and unpopular as Trump) made politicians of all stripes feel queasy.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s entirely predictable response was, of course, to outsource this two-sided conundrum to the FOB. After all, that was its whole plan for the Board. The Board would be there to deal with the most headachey and controversial content moderation stuff.</p>
<p>And on that level Facebook&#8217;s Oversight Board is doing exactly the job Facebook intended for it.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s interesting that this unofficial &#8216;supreme court&#8217; is already feeling frustrated by the limited binary choices it&#8217;s asked them for. (Of, in the Trump case, either reversing the ban entirely or continuing it indefinitely.)</p>
<p>The FOB&#8217;s unofficial message seems to be that the tools are simply far too blunt. Although Facebook has never said it will be bound by any wider policy suggestions the Board might make &#8212; only that it will abide by the specific individual review decisions. (Which is why a common critique of the Board is that it&#8217;s toothless where it matters.)</p>
<p>How aggressive the Board will be in pushing Facebook to be less frustrating very much remains to be seen.</p>
<p>“None of this is going to be solved quickly,” Rusbridger went on to tell the committee in more general remarks on the challenges of moderating speech in the digital era. Getting to grips with the Internet&#8217;s publishing revolution could in fact, he implied, take the work of generations &#8212; making the customary reference the long tail of societal disruption that flowed from Gutenberg inventing the printing press.</p>
<p>If Facebook was hoping the FOB would kick hard (and thorny-in-its-side) questions around content moderation into long and intellectual grasses it&#8217;s surely delighted with the level of beard stroking which Rusbridger&#8217;s evidence implies is now going on inside the Board. (If, possibly, slightly less enchanted by the prospect of its appointees asking it if they can poke around its algorithmic black boxes.)</p>
<p>Kate Klonick, an assistant professor at St John&#8217;s University Law School, was also giving evidence to the committee &#8212; having written an article on the inner workings of the FOB, published recently in the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/inside-the-making-of-facebooks-supreme-court">New Yorker</a>, after she was given wide-ranging access by Facebook to observe the process of the body being set up.</p>
<p>The Lords committee was keen to learn more on the workings of the FOB and pressed the witnesses several times on the question of the Board&#8217;s independence from Facebook.</p>
<p>Rusbridger batted away concerns on that front — saying “we don’t feel we work for Facebook at all”. Though Board members are paid by Facebook via a trust it set up to put the FOB at arm&#8217;s length from the corporate mothership. And the committee didn&#8217;t shy away or raising the payment point to query how genuinely independent they can be?</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel highly independent,” Rusbridger said. “I don’t think there’s any obligation at all to be nice to Facebook or to be horrible to Facebook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the nice things about this Board is occasionally people will say but if we did that that will scupper Facebook’s economic model in such and such a country. To which we answer well that’s not our problem. Which is a very liberating thing,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Of course it’s hard to imagine a sitting member of the FOB being able to answer the independence question any other way — unless they were simultaneously resigning their commission (which, to be clear, Rusbridger wasn’t).</p>
<p>He confirmed that Board members can serve three terms of three years apiece &#8212; so he could have almost a decade of beard-stroking on Facebook&#8217;s behalf ahead of him.</p>
<p>Klonick, meanwhile, emphasized the scale of the challenge it had been for Facebook to try to build from scratch a quasi-independent oversight body and create distance between itself and its claimed watchdog.</p>
<p>“Building an institution to be a watchdog institution — it is incredibly hard to transition to institution-building and to break those bonds [between the Board and Facebook] and set up these new people with frankly this huge set of problems and a new technology and a new back end and a content management system and everything,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Rusbridger had said the Board went through an extensive training process which involved participation from Facebook representatives during the &#8216;onboarding&#8217;. But went on to describe a moment when the training had finished and the FOB realized some Facebook reps were still joining their calls &#8212; saying that at that point the Board felt empowered to tell Facebook to leave.</p>
<p>“This was exactly the type of moment — having watched this — that I knew had to happen,” added Klonick. “There had to be some type of formal break — and it was told to me that this was a natural moment that they had done their training and this was going to be moment of push back and breaking away from the nest. And this was it.”</p>
<p>However if your measure of independence is not having Facebook <em>literally listening in on</em> <em>the Board&#8217;s calls</em> you do have to query how much Kool Aid Facebook may have successfully doled out to its chosen and willing participants over the long and intricate process of programming its own watchdog &#8212; including to extra outsiders it allowed in to observe the set up.</p>

<p>The committee was also interested in the fact the FOB has so far mostly ordered Facebook to reinstate content its moderators had previously taken down.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/facebooks-oversight-body-overturns-four-154522911.html">January</a>, when the Board issued its first decisions, it overturned four out of five Facebook takedowns &#8212; including in relation to a number of hate speech cases. The move quickly attracted criticism over the direction of travel. After all, the wider critique of Facebook&#8217;s business is it&#8217;s far too reluctant to remove toxic content (it only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/facebook-in-a-reversal-will-now-ban-holocaust-denial-content-under-its-hate-speech-policy/">banned holocaust denial last year</a>, for example). And lo! Here&#8217;s its self-styled &#8216;Oversight Board&#8217; taking decisions to <em>reverse</em> hate speech takedowns&#8230;</p>
<p>The unofficial and oppositional &#8216;Real Facebook Board&#8217; &#8212; which is truly independent and heavily critical of Facebook &#8212; pounced and decried the decisions as &#8220;shocking&#8221;, saying the FOB had &#8220;bent over backwards to excuse hate&#8221;.</p>

<p>&mdash; The Real Facebook Oversight Board (@FBoversight) <a href="https://twitter.com/FBoversight/status/1354813107164463113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Klonick said the reality is that the FOB is not Facebook&#8217;s supreme court &#8212; but rather it&#8217;s essentially just &#8220;a dispute resolution mechanism for users&#8221;.</p>
<p>If that assessment is true &#8212; and it sounds spot on, so long as you recall the fantastically tiny number of users who get to use it &#8212; the amount of PR Facebook has been able to generate off of something that should really just be a standard feature of its platform is truly incredible.</p>
<p>Klonick argued that the Board&#8217;s early reversals were the result of it hearing from users objecting to content takedowns &#8212; which had made it &#8220;sympathetic&#8221; to their complaints.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolute frustration at not knowing specifically what rule was broken or how to avoid breaking the rule again or what they did to be able to get there or to be able to tell their side of the story,&#8221; she said, listing the kinds of things Board members had told her they were hearing from users who had petitioned for a review of a takedown decision against them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that what you&#8217;re seeing in the Board&#8217;s decision is, first and foremost, to try to build some of that back in,&#8221; she suggested. &#8220;Is that the signal that they&#8217;re sending back to Facebook &#8212; that&#8217;s it&#8217;s pretty low hanging fruit to be honest. Which is let people know the exact rule, given them a fact to fact type of analysis or application of the rule to the facts and give them that kind of read in to what they&#8217;re seeing and people will be happier with what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or at least just feel a little bit more like there is a process and it&#8217;s not just this black box that&#8217;s censoring them.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his response to the committee&#8217;s query, Rusbridger discussed how he approaches review decision-making.</p>
<p>“In most judgements I begin by thinking well why would we restrict freedom of speech in this particular case — and that does get you into interesting questions,” he said, having earlier summed up his school of thought on speech as akin to the ‘fight bad speech with more speech’ Justice Brandeis type view.</p>
<p>“The right not to be offended has been engaged by one of the cases — as opposed to the borderline between being offended and being harmed,&#8221; he went on. “That issue has been argued about by political philosophers for a long time and it certainly will never be settled absolutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you went along with establishing a right not to be offended that would have huge implications for the ability to discuss almost anything in the end. And yet there have been one or two cases where essentially Facebook, in taking something down, has invoked something like that.”</p>
<p>“Harm as oppose to offence is clearly something you would treat differently,” he added. “And we’re in the fortunate position of being able to hire in experts and seek advisors on the harm here.”</p>
<p>While Rusbridger didn&#8217;t sound troubled about the challenges and pitfalls facing the Board when it may have to set the &#8220;borderline&#8221; between offensive speech and harmful speech itself &#8212; being able to (further) outsource expertise presumably helps &#8212; he did raise a number of other operational concerns during the session. Including over the lack of technical expertise among current board members (who were purely Facebook&#8217;s picks).</p>
<p>Without technical expertise how can the Board ‘examine the algorithm’, as he suggested it would want to, because it won&#8217;t be able to understand Facebook’s content distribution machine in any meaningful way?</p>
<p>Since the Board currently lacks technical expertise, it does raise wider questions about its function &#8212; and whether its first learned cohort might not be played as useful idiots from Facebook&#8217;s self-interested perspective &#8212; by helping it gloss over and deflect deeper scrutiny of its algorithmic, money-minting choices.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t really understand how the Facebook machine functions, technically and economically, how can you conduct any kind of meaningful oversight at all? (Rusbridger evidently gets that &#8212; but is also content to wait and see how the process plays out. No doubt the intellectual exercise and insider view is fascinating. &#8220;So far I&#8217;m finding it highly absorbing,&#8221; as he admitted in his evidence opener.)</p>
<p>“People say to me you’re on that Board but it’s well known that the algorithms reward emotional content that polarises communities because that makes it more addictive. Well I don’t know if that’s true or not — and I think as a board we’re going to have to get to grips with that,&#8221; he went on to say. &#8220;Even if that takes many sessions with coders speaking very slowly so that we can understand what they’re saying.”</p>
<p>“I do think our responsibility will be to understand what these machines are — the machines that are going in rather than the machines that are moderating,” he added. “What their metrics are.”</p>
<p>Both witnesses raised another concern: That the kind of complex, nuanced moderation decisions the Board is making won’t be able to scale &#8212; suggesting they’re too specific to be able to generally inform AI-based moderation. Nor will they necessarily be able to be acted on by the staffed moderation system that Facebook currently operates (which gives its thousand of human moderators a fantastically tiny amount of thinking time per content decision).</p>
<p>Despite that the issue of Facebook&#8217;s vast scale vs the Board&#8217;s limited and Facebook-defined function &#8212; to fiddle at the margins of its content empire &#8212; was one overarching point that hung uneasily over the session, without being properly grappled with.</p>
<p>“I think your question about &#8216;is this easily communicated&#8217; is a really good one that we’re wrestling with a bit,” Rusbridger said, conceding that he’d had to brain up on a whole bunch of unfamiliar “human rights protocols and norms from around the world” to feel qualified to rise to the demands of the review job.</p>
<p>Scaling that level of training to the tens of thousands of moderators Facebook currently employs to carry out content moderation would of course be eye-wateringly expensive. Nor is it on offer from Facebook. Instead it&#8217;s hand-picked a crack team of 40 very expensive and learned experts to tackle an infinitesimally smaller number of content decisions.</p>
<p>“I think it’s important that the decisions we come to are understandable by human moderators,&#8221; Rusbridger added. &#8220;Ideally they’re understandable by machines as well — and there is a tension there because sometimes you look at the facts of a case and you decide it in a particular way with reference to those three standards [Facebook’s community standard, Facebook’s values and “a human rights filter”]. But in the knowledge that that’s going to be quite a tall order for a machine to understand the nuance between that case and another case.</p>
<p>“But, you know, these are early days.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jack Abraham has a lot of confidence in what he&#8217;s building. Then again, you can&#8217;t be immodest or unsure of yourself if you&#8217;re going to bet exclusively on your own startups as an investor, which is precisely the model that Abraham&#8217;s San Francisco-based venture studio, <a href="https://atomic.vc/">Atomic<strong>,</strong></a> has followed since it was launched nine years ago.</p>
<p>It all started with $10 million of largely Abraham&#8217;s own money, capital he amassed by selling his first startup, a local shopping engine called Milo, to eBay in 2010, for $75 million. Abraham had dropped out of Wharton as an undergrad with $500,000 from a professor who believed that Abraham &#8212; whose father founded ComScore &#8212; would himself be a company-building machine.</p>
<p>The professor had good instincts. After selling Milo at age 24, Abraham spent more than three years building products inside of eBay and learning how to lead multiple teams before beginning to look outward, making angel bets, including on Uber and Pinterest, and, he says, spreading around some of his ideas. (Among these, he says, he &#8220;invented Postmates. I gave the founders literally the idea for the company; they were working on a B2B company at the time. I was fairly early on there; that helped spawn the whole food delivery thing.&#8221;)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He had so many ideas &#8212; hundreds, he says &#8212; that not long afterward, he created Atomic, later bringing on to the founding team Andrew Dudum, a Wharton peer who is also the son of entrepreneurs and who also <a href="https://thesign.al/andrew-dudum-cofounder-partner-at-atomic-2/">dropped out of college</a> to join the startup world. (Dudum&#8217;s first stop was a then-nascent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TokBox">startup</a> backed by Sequoia Capital.)</p>
<p>At first, Atomic worked on one company. The following year, it worked on two. By 2018, the outfit had built out a team that could handle many of the back-end functions that startups need to thrive, from recruiting to accounting, and launched 10 companies. Impressed investors gave the firm $150 million to create even more startups.</p>
<p>By then, Abraham and Dudum had brought in two other general partners: Chester Ng and Andrew Salamon. Salamon didn&#8217;t stay long, eventually launching his own venture studio, <a href="https://materialcompanies.com/#team">Material</a>, with Blue Apron founder Matt Salzberg in 2019. The same year, JD Ross, one of a handful of cofounders of the <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/opendoor-closes-at-31-25-on-first-day-of-trading/">newly public</a> company Opendoor, joined Atomic as a general partner.</p>
<p>The firm has picked up speed since. Indeed, at this point, Atomic has created &#8220;dozens&#8221; of startups &#8212; including roughly one per month last year, says Abraham. It also just closed on $260 million in new capital commitments, including from a prominent university that now serves as its anchor investor but would prefer not to be named publicly.</p>
<p>Citing &#8220;proprietary aspects&#8221; to the model, Abraham declines to explain how Atomic&#8217;s economics work, except to acknowledge that it operates in &#8220;more of a fund context instead of a holding company&#8221; where investors would essentially be buying stakes in Atomic itself.</p>
<p>Certainly, it&#8217;s easy to appreciate the enthusiasm of Atomic&#8217;s investors, including early backers like Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen. Abraham and Dudum are both compelling storytellers, as we&#8217;ve witnessed first-hand in interviewing them at different times. The firm is also starting to see some exits.</p>
<p>One of Atomic&#8217;s creations, the telehealth company Hims, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/telehealth-startup-hims-fell-in-its-public-trading-debut-and-thats-fine-with-its-ceo/">taken public</a> in January through a blank-check company in a deal that valued the company at $1.6 billion, and its shares have been rising since. As of this writing, the three-and-a-half-year-old outfit &#8212; run by Dudum, who is doing double-duty as Hims&#8217;s CEO and a general partner with Atomic &#8212; boasts a market cap of $2.9 billion.</p>
<p>Atomic also sold a voice-powered sales startup, TalkIQ, to the company Dialpad in 2018 for what Forbes reported at the time to be a &#8220;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2018/05/16/dialpad-buys-talkiq/?sh=4595ec8387d0">little under $50 million</a>.&#8221; TalkIQ had raised $22 million altogether.</p>
<p>More exits are coming, suggests Abraham. &#8220;There many companies we have that are now approaching the sort of growth and run rate where they have the ability to go public, even as soon as in the next year,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>One of those eventual prospects is <a href="https://www.replicant.ai/">Replicant</a>, an autonomous call center startup that has raised $35 million since its 2017 founding, including a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2020/09/10/replicant-series-a-call-center-voice-ai/?sh=2b040a9d4266">$27 million Series A round</a> led by Norwest Venture Partners back in September. Another Atomic startup, <a href="https://www.homebound.com/">Homebound</a>, a three-year-old home-building outfit that handles everything from financing to construction, has also enjoyed <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2020/01/16/she-almost-lost-her-home-in-californias-wildfires-instead-she-built-a-200-million-business">some momentum</a>, as well as attracted $53 million from investors.</p>
<p>Though Atomic prides itself on &#8220;pressure testing&#8221; its ideas, not every startup has been a hit with users. A photo-sharing app called Ever was turned off soon after <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/millions-people-uploaded-photos-ever-app-then-company-used-them-n1003371">NBC reported</a> that the photos people shared were used to train a facial recognition system &#8212; tech the company offered to sell to private companies, law enforcement and the military. (Ever was later refashioned into the enterprise company <a href="https://www.paravision.ai/">Paravision</a>.) A sleep-tracking specialist, Rested, that Salamon was running was also shut down.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ZenReach, a Wi-Fi marketing company that had collected at least <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zenreach">$94 million</a> from investors through 2018, laid off<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/zenreach-lays-off-20-of-staff-following-co-founders-departure-1519952702"> 20%</a> of its employees that same year. A CEO who&#8217;d been brought aboard by Abraham and who was previously an operating partner with Atomic, has since moved on to a role outside of Atomic&#8217;s sphere.</p>
<p>If not all of its ideas set the world on fire, Atomic has no shortage of others.</p>
<p>Asked about some of the areas where he sees the most opportunity to innovate, Abraham quickly ticks off &#8220;healthcare, finance, education, real estate, and other large industries where truthfully, when you&#8217;re inside them, you understand how broken they are, and they are broken up and down the entire stack.</p>
<p>&#8220;You study them,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and then you wonder how is this possible this happened.&#8221;</p>
