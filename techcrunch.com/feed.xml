										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK startup <a href="https://oviva.com/uk/en/">Oviva</a>, which sells a digital support offering, including for Type 2 diabetes treatment, dispensing personalized diet and lifestyle advice via apps to allow more people to be able to access support, has closed $80 million in Series C funding &#8212; bringing its total raised to date to $115M.</p>
<p>The raise, which Oviva says will be used to scale up after a &#8220;fantastic year&#8221; of growth for the health tech business, is co-led by Sofina and Temasek, alongside existing investors AlbionVC, Earlybird, Eight Roads Ventures, F-Prime Capital, MTIP, plus several angels.</p>
<p>Underpinning that growth is the fact wealthy Western nations continue to see rising rates of obesity and other health conditions like Type 2 diabetes (which can be linked to poor diet and lack of exercise). While more attention is generally being paid to the notion of preventative &#8212; rather than reactive &#8212; healthcare, to manage the rising costs of service delivery.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Lifestyle management to help control weight and linked health conditions (like diabetes) is where Oviva comes in: It&#8217;s built a blended support offering that combines personalized care (provided by healthcare professionals) with digital tools for patients that help them do things like track what they&#8217;re eating, access support and chart their progress towards individual health goals.</span></p>
<p>It can point to 23 peer-reviewed publications to back up its approach &#8212; saying key results show an average of 6.8% weight loss at 6 months for those living with obesity; while, in its specialist programs, it says 53% of patients achieve remission of their type 2 diabetes at 12 months.</p>
<p>Oviva typically sells its digitally delivered support programs direct to health insurance companies (or publicly funded health services) &#8212; who then provide (or refer) the service to their customers/patients. Its programs are currently available in the UK, Germany, Switzerland and France &#8212; but expanding access is one of the goals for the Series C.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will expand to European markets where the health system reimburses the diet and lifestyle change we offer, especially those with specific pathways for digital reimbursement,&#8221; Oviva tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Encouragingly, more healthcare systems have been opening up specific routes for such digital reimbursement, e.g., Germany for DiGAs or Belgium just in the last months.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far, the startup has treated 200,000 people but the addressable market is clearly huge &#8212; not least as European populations age &#8212; with Oviva suggesting more than <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">300 million people live with &#8220;health challenges&#8221; that are either triggered by poor diet or can be optimised through personalised dietary changes. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Moreover, it suggests, only &#8220;a small fraction&#8221; is currently being offered digital care.</span></p>
<p>To date, Oviva has built up 5,000+ partnerships with health systems, insurers and doctors as it looks to push for further scale by making its technology more accessible to a wider range of people. In the past year it says it&#8217;s &#8220;more than doubled&#8221; both people treated and revenue earned.</p>
<p>Its goal is for the Series C funding is to reach &#8220;millions&#8221; of people across Europe who need support because they&#8217;re suffering from poor health linked to diet and lifestyle.</p>
<p>As part of the scale up plan it will also be growing its team to 800 by the end of 2022, it adds.</p>
<p>On digital vs face-to-face care &#8212; setting aside the potential cost savings associated with digital delivery &#8212; it says studies show the &#8220;most striking outcome benefits&#8221; are around uptake and completion rates, noting: &#8220;We have consistently shown uptake rates above 70% and high completion rates of around 80%, even in groups considered harder to reach such as working age populations or minority ethnic groups. This compares to uptake and completion rates of less than 50% for most face-to-face services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about competition, Oviva names Liva Healthcare and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/noom-competitor-ourpath-rebrands-as-second-nature-raises-10m-series-a/">Second Nature</a> as its closest competitors in the region.</p>
<p>&#8220;WW (formally Weight Watchers) also competes with a digital solution in some markets where they can access reimbursement,&#8221; it adds. &#8220;There are many others that try to access this group with new methods, but are not reimbursed or are wellness solutions. Noom competes as a solution for self-paying consumers in Europe, as many other apps. But, in our view, that is a separate market from the reimbursed medical one.&#8221;</p>

<p>As well as using the Series C funding to bolster its presence in existing markets and target and scale into new ones, Oviva says it may look to further grow the business via M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;In expanding to new countries, we are open to both building new organisations from the ground up or acquiring existing businesses with a strong medical network where we see that our technology can be leveraged for better patient care and value creation,&#8221; it told us on that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amsterdam-based startup <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com">VanMoof</a> has raised a $128 million Series C funding round. The company designs and sells electric bikes that are quite popular in some markets. It now wants to become the world’s leading e-bike brand by iterating at a faster pace.</p>
<p>Asia-based private equity firm Hillhouse Investment is leading the round, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilliantans">Gillian Tans</a>, the former CEO of Booking.com, also participating. Some existing investors also put some more money on the table, such as Norwest Venture Partners, Felix Capital, Balderton Capital and TriplePoint Capital.</p>
<p>Today’s Series C represents a big jump compared to the company’s Series B. Last year, VanMoof <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/after-lockdowns-lead-to-an-e-bike-boom-vanmoof-raises-40m-series-b-to-expand-globally/">raised</a> a $40 million Series B. Overall, if you add it all up, the startup has raised $182 million in total.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with VanMoof’s e-bikes, TechCrunch reviewed both the most recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/review-handsome-and-nippy-new-vanmoof-e-bikes-could-be-the-shape-of-cities-to-come/">S3</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/vanmoof-x3-review-e-bike/">X3</a> models. On paper, they are identical. The VanMoof X3 features a smaller frame and smaller wheels.</p>

<p>What makes VanMoof different from your average e-bike manufacturer is that the company tries to control everything from the supply chain to the customer experience. VanMoof e-bikes are premium e-bikes that are primarily designed for city rides. The most recent models currently cost $2,298 or €2,198.</p>
<p>They feature an electric motor paired with an electronic gear shifting system. It has four gears and you don’t have to change gears yourself. All you have to do is jump on the bike and start pedaling.</p>
<p>Recognizable by their iconic triangular-shaped futuristic-looking frames, the S3 and X3 also come with hydraulic brakes, integrated lights and some smart features. There’s an integrated motion detector combined with an alarm, a GPS chip and cellular connectivity.</p>
<p>If you declare your bike as stolen, the GPS and cellular chips go live and you can track your bike in the VanMoof app. The company’s bikes are now also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/e-bikes-and-earbuds-among-the-first-third-party-hardware-to-support-apples-find-my-tracking/">compatible with Apple’s Find My app</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of relying exclusively on off-the-shelf parts, the company works with a small set of suppliers to manufacture custom components. This way, it can cut out as many middleperson as possible to bring costs down. It’s also a good competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Growing a company like VanMoof is a capital-intensive business. The company has opened retail stores and service hubs in 50 different cities around the world. While the company started in Europe, the U.S. is now the fastest growth market for VanMoof.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the startup plans to double-down on its current strategy. You can expect updated bikes with refined designs and more custom parts. You can expect more stores and service hubs around the world. And you can probably expect more online sales as well.</p>
<p>“It will help us get 10 million people on our bikes in the next five years,” co-founder and CEO Taco Carlier said in a statement. So far, there are 150,000 people using VanMoof bikes.</p>
<p>Today’s investment shouldn’t come as a surprise. The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated plans to transform European cities — and prioritize bikes over cars. Last year, TechCrunch’s Natasha Lomas and I wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars/">comprehensive overview</a> of key policy developments in four major cities — Paris, Barcelona, London and Milan. VanMoof is now benefiting from these policy shifts.</p>

<p>After a 17-hour marathon through nearly 200 startup pitches, the Equity team was fired up to get back on Twitter and chat through some early trends and favorites from the first day of Y Combinator&#8217;s demo party. We&#8217;ll be back on the air tomorrow, <a href="https://twitter.com/EquityPod">so make sure you&#8217;re following the show</a> on Twitter so you don&#8217;t miss out.</p>
<p>What did <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> chat about? The following:</p>
<ul>
<li>First impressions: We started by going through top-line numbers, geographic breakdown, and how the accelerator is doing when it comes to the representation of diverse founders. The last bit had a tiny bit of progress, but diversity continues to be an issue in YC&#8217;s batches — even as cohort size grows. We also chatted about what startups pitching can work on: like better mics, which are cheap and good.</li>
<li>Our early favorites: Metaphor, Lumify, Alex&#8217;s favorite duo Indian real estate plays, Akudo, Reframe and Playhouse.</li>
<li>And some <em>hmmm</em> moments, including our thoughts on Writesonic, which Natasha has a potentially paranoid theory on.</li>
</ul>
<p>TechCrunch has extensive coverage of the day on the site, so there&#8217;s lots to dig into if you are in the mood. More tomorrow!</p>

<p>The company has trained a machine learning algorithm to quickly and locally (that is, without using the cloud) recognize a person&#8217;s speech on one end and, on the other, output the same words with an accent chosen from a list or automatically detected from the other person&#8217;s speech.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196688" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196688" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196688" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Sanas desktop application." width="400" height="413" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg?resize=145,150 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg?resize=291,300 291w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg?resize=768,793 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg?resize=659,680 659w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2196688" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sanas.ai</p></div></p>
<p>It slots right into the OS&#8217;s sound stack so it works out of the box with pretty much any audio or video calling tool. Right now the company is operating a pilot program with thousands of people in locations from the U.S. and U.K. to the Philippines, India, Latin America and others. Accents supported will include American, Spanish, British, Indian, Filipino and Australian by the end of the year.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, the idea of Sanas kind of bothered me at first. It felt like a concession to bigoted people who consider their accent superior and think others below them. Tech will fix it … by accommodating the bigots. Great!</p>
<p>But while I still have a little bit of that feeling, I can see there&#8217;s more to it than this. Fundamentally speaking, it is easier to understand someone when they speak in an accent similar to your own. But customer service and tech support is a huge industry and one primarily performed by people outside the countries where the customers are. This basic disconnect can be remedied in a way that puts the onus of responsibility on the entry-level worker, or one that puts it on technology. Either way the difficulty of making oneself understood remains and must be addressed — an automated system just lets it be done more easily and allows more people to do their job.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not magic — as you can tell in this clip, the character and cadence of the person&#8217;s voice is only partly retained and the result is considerably more artificial sounding:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZTZ1T9VBa-Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>But the technology is improving and like any speech engine, the more it&#8217;s used, the better it gets. And for someone not used to the original speaker&#8217;s accent, the American-accented version may very well be more easily understood. For the person in the support role, this likely means better outcomes for their calls — everyone wins. Sanas told me that the pilots are just starting so there are no numbers available from this deployment yet, but testing has suggested a considerable reduction of error rates and increase in call efficiency.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good enough at any rate to attract a $5.5 million seed round, with participation from Human Capital, General Catalyst, Quiet Capital and DN Capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sanas is striving to make communication easy and free from friction, so people can speak confidently and understand each other, wherever they are and whoever they are trying to communicate with,&#8221; CEO Maxim Serebryakov said in the press release announcing the funding. It&#8217;s hard to disagree with that mission.</p>
<p>While the cultural and ethical questions of accents and power differentials are unlikely to ever go away, Sanas is trying something new that may be a powerful tool for the many people who must communicate professionally and find their speech patterns are an obstacle to that. It&#8217;s an approach worth exploring and discussing even if in a perfect world we would simply understand one another better.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[These startups made us do a double take, be it due to the size of the market opportunity, the ambition exhibited by the founding team or an idea that was just too clever to pass up.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Y Combinator kicked off its fourth-ever virtual Demo Day today, revealing the first half of its nearly 400-company batch. The presentation, YC’s biggest yet, offers a snapshot into where innovation is heading, from not-so-simple seaweed to a Clearco for creators.</p>
<p>The TechCrunch team stuck to its tradition of covering every single company live (but, you know, from home) so you’ll find all of the Day One companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">here</a>. For those who want a sampling of standouts, however, we’re also bringing you a host of our favorites from today’s one-minute pitch-off extravaganza.</p>
<p>As reporters, we’re constantly inundated with hundreds of pitches on a daily basis. The startups below caught our picky attention for a whole host of reasons, but that doesn’t mean other startups weren’t compelling or potential unicorns as well. Instead, consider the below to be a data point on which startups made us do a double take, be it due to the size of the market opportunity, the ambition exhibited by the founding team or an idea that was just too clever to pass up.</p>
<h2>Genei</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.genei.io/">Genei</a> is, dare I say, a refreshing mashup between robots and writers. The startup has a simple goal: Automatically summarize background reading so content creators can grab the top facts, attribute and move onto the next graf. Writing is innately an art, so I find Genei&#8217;s positioning as a tool for writers instead of a replacement out to take their jobs as smart. Better yet, it&#8217;s launching by targeting some of the hardest workers in our industry: freelance writers. These folks often have to balance consistent pitches, diverse assignments and tight deadlines for their livelihood, so I&#8217;d presume a sidekick can&#8217;t hurt. Down the road, I could totally see this startup playing the same role as a Grammarly: a helpful extension of workflows that optimizes the way people who write for a living, write. —<a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_"> Natasha</a></p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://apeiron-investments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apeiron-investments.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630527431147000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENFrB7mbhWgAfHKg-eIEG9HwhLgA">Apeiron Investment Group</a> &#8212; an investment firm started by German entrepreneur Christian Angermayer &#8212; led the Series A equity round, with <a href="https://elevat3.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://elevat3.vc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630527431147000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEciwAL09pa7gxw99Co7vg6NZxgpg">Elevat3 Capital</a> (another Angermayer firm that has a strategic partnership with Founders Fund and Peter Thiel) also participating. <a href="https://northwallcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://northwallcap.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630527431147000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHv74PQk-C1pUtFl44LSO9fUFtrMQ">North Wall Capital</a> was behind the debt portion of the deal. We have asked and Olsam is only disclosing the full amount raised, not the amount that was raised in equity versus debt. Valuation is also not being disclosed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Being an Amazon roll-up startup from London that happens to be announcing a fundraise today is not the only thing that Olsam has in common with Heroes. Like Heroes, Olsam is also founded by brothers.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sam Horbye previously spent years working at Amazon, including building and managing the company&#8217;s business marketplace (the B2B version of the consumer marketplace); while co-founder Ollie Horbye had years of experience in strategic consulting and financial services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Between them, they also built and sold previous marketplace businesses, and they believe that this collective experience gives Olsam &#8212; a portmanteau of their names, &#8220;Ollie&#8221; and &#8220;Sam&#8221; &#8212; a leg up when it comes to building relationships with merchants; identifying quality products (versus the vast seas of search results that often feel like they are selling the same inexpensive junk as each other); and understanding merchants&#8217; challenges and opportunities, and building relationships with Amazon and understanding how the merchant ecosystem fits into the e-commerce giant&#8217;s wider strategy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Olsam is also taking a slightly different approach when it comes to target companies, by focusing not just on the usual consumer play, but also on merchants selling to businesses. B2B selling is currently one of the fastest-growing segments in Amazon&#8217;s Marketplace, and it is also one of the more overlooked by consumers. &#8220;It&#8217;s flying under the radar,&#8221; Ollie said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The B2B opportunity is very exciting,&#8221; Sam added. &#8220;A growing number of merchants are selling office supplies or more random products to the B2B customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Estimates vary when it comes to how many merchants there are selling on Amazon&#8217;s Marketplace globally, ranging anywhere from 6 million to nearly 10 million. Altogether those merchants generated $300 million in sales (gross merchandise value), and it&#8217;s growing by 50% each year at the moment.</p>
<p>And consolidating sellers &#8212; in order to achieve better economies of scale around supply chains, marketing tools and analytics, and more &#8212; is also big business. Olsam estimates that some $7 billion has been spent cumulatively on acquiring these businesses, and there are more out there: Olsam estimates there are some 3,000 businesses in the U.K. alone making more than $1 million each in sales on Amazon&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>(And to be clear, there are a number of other roll-up startups beyond Heroes also eyeing up that opportunity. Raising hundreds of millions of dollars in aggregate, others that have made moves this year include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/suma-brands-raises-150m-to-acquire-more-third-party-brands-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suma Brands</a> [$150 million], <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/elevate-brands-banks-250m-to-roll-up-third-party-merchants-selling-on-amazons-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate Brands</a> [$250 million], <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perch</a> [$775 million], <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/factory14-raises-200m-to-jump-into-the-amazon-marketplace-roll-up-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factory14</a> [$200 million], <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrasio</a> [currently probably the biggest of them all in terms of reach and money raised and ambitions], <a href="https://heyday.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Razor Group</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellerX</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">[X2</a>], <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/benitago-group-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benitago</a>, Latin America’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valoreo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/founded-by-former-carousell-ovo-and-fave-execs-rainforest-raises-36m-to-aggregate-asia-pacific-amazon-marketplace-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainforest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Una Brands</a> out of Asia.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The senior team behind <span class="il">Olsam</span> is what makes this business truly unique,&#8221; said Angermayer in a statement. “Having all been successful in building and selling their own brands within the market and having worked for Amazon in their marketplace team &#8211; their understanding of this space is exceptional.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even as hundreds of millions of people in India have a bank account, only a tiny fraction of this population invests in any financial instrument.</p>
<p>Fewer than 30 million people invest in mutual funds or stocks, for instance. In recent years, a handful of startups have made it easier for users &#8212; especially the millennials &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">to invest</a>, but the figure has largely remained stagnant.</p>
<p>Now, an Indian startup believes that it has found the solution to tackle this challenge &#8212; and is already seeing good early traction.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/agNishchay">Nishchay AG</a>, former director of mobility startup Bounce, and <a href="https://twitter.com/misbahspeaks">Misbah Ashraf</a>, co-founder of Marsplay (sold to Foxy), founded Jar earlier this year.</p>
<p>The startup’s eponymous six-month-old Android app enables users to start their savings journey for as little as 1 Indian rupee.</p>
<p>Users on <a href="https://www.myjar.app">Jar</a> can invest in multiple ways and get started within seconds. The app works with Paytm (PhonePe support is in the works) to set up a recurring payment. (The startup is the first to use UPI 2.0’s recurring payment support.) They can set up any amount between 1 Indian rupee to 500 for daily investments.</p>
<p>The Jar app can also glean users’ text messages and save a tiny amount based on each monetary transaction they do. So, for instance, if a user has spent 31 rupees in a transaction, the Jar app rounds that up to the nearest tenth figure (40, in this case) and saves nine rupees. Users can also manually open the app and spend any amount they wish to invest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once users have saved some money in Jar, the app then invests that into digital gold.</p>
<p>The startup is using gold investment because people in the South Asian market already have an immense trust in this asset class.</p>
<p>India has a unique fascination for gold. From rural farmers to urban working class, nearly everyone stashes the yellow metal and flaunts jewelry at weddings.</p>
<p>Indian households are estimated to have a stash of over 25,000 tons of the precious metal whose value today is about half of the country’s nominal GDP. Such is the demand for gold in India that the South Asian nation is also one of the world’s largest importers of this precious metal.</p>

<p>“When you’re thinking about bringing the next 500 million people to institutional savings and investments, the onus is on us to educate them on the efficacies of the other instruments that are in the market,” said Nishchay.</p>
<p>“We want to give them the instrument they trust the most, which is gold,” he said. The startup plans to eventually offer several more investment opportunities, he said.</p>
<p>The founders met several years ago when they were exploring if MarsPlay and Bounce could have any synergies. They stayed in touch and, last year during one of their many conversations, realized that neither of them knew much about investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s when the dots started to connect,&#8221; said Misbah, drawing stories from his childhood. &#8220;I come from a small town in Bihar called Bihar Sharif. During my childhood days, I saw my family deeply troubled with debt because of poor financial decisions and no savings,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We both understand what a typical middle class family goes through. Someone who comes from this background never had any means in the past but their aspirations are never-ending. So when you start earning, you immediately start to spend it all,&#8221; said Nishchay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market needs products that will help them get started,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That idea, which is similar to Acorn and Stash&#8217;s play in the U.S. market, is beginning to make inroads. The app has already amassed about half a million downloads, the founders said. Investors have taken notice, too.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Jar announced it has raised $4.5 million from a clutch of high-profile investors, including Arkam Ventures, Tribe Capital, WEH Ventures, and angels including Kunal Shah (founder of CRED), Shaan Puri (formerly with Twitch), Ali Moiz (founder of <a href="https://stonks.com">Stonks</a>), Howard Lindzon (founder of Social Leverage), Vivekananda Hallekere (co-founder of Bounce), Alvin Tse (of Xiaomi) and Kunal Khattar (managing partner at AdvantEdge).</p>
<p>&#8220;Over 400 million Indians are about to embrace digital financial services for the first time in their lives. Jar has built an app that is poised to help them &#8212; with several intuitive ways including gamification &#8212; start their investment journey. We love the speed at which the team has been executing and how fast they are growing each week,&#8221; said Arjun Sethi, co-founder of Tribe Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>Transactions and AUM on the Jar app are surging 350% each month, said Nishchay. The startup plans to broaden its product offerings in the coming days, he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today Y Combinator kicked off the Demo Day cycle for its Summer 2021 cohort. The collection of early-stage startups on day one-of-two alone numbered in the hundreds, meaning that we had to assemble a team here at TechCrunch just to cover it all.</p>
<p>But before we get into notes on each company that presented, a few notes on the cohort itself. Per Y Combinator leadership, the 377 (!) startups in this cohort have founders from 47 different countries, and 37% of the founders in this cohort were from underrepresented groups (which YC&#8217;s Michael Seibel says the accelerator defines as Black, Latinx or female.)</p>
<p>The international breakdown of the batch parallels that of this past winter. Nearly 50% of YC startups are based outside of the United States, with India, U.K. and Mexico making up the largest part of that percentage.</p>
<p>What follows is a list of the 180+ companies in the order that they pitched, and our notes on each pitch. TechCrunch will follow up this post with a list of our favorites. So, enjoy the below and happy hunting to all the founders and investors!</p>
<p>(Oh, and if you&#8217;re somehow hungry for more, don&#8217;t worry: another equally huge batch is scheduled to present tomorrow.)</p>
<h2>Day One companies</h2>
<p><a href="https://endla.com/">Endla</a>: Software meant to increase production and reduce costs associated with oil/gas wells. The company says it can save about $40,000 per well per year.</p>
<p><a href="https://phykos.co/">Phykos</a>: Autonomously grows seaweed to capture carbon, selling offsets to companies to uphold their climate commitments. Built by GoogleX mechanical and software engineers.</p>
<p><a href="http://madeats.co/">MadEats</a>: MadEats is an online ghost kitchen food delivery service in the Philippines. It has built several major local restaurant concepts and is building affordable, high-margin brands to serve direct to consumers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.financialchoice.com/">Financial Choice</a>: Financial Choice wants to boost the yields that consumers can earn from their checking accounts. In today’s market, cash earns incredibly low yields at rest. So, Financial Choice wants to invest checking account funds, while preserving access for users for when they need their money. The startup claims to have reached $4.4 million AUM thus far. We’re curious about the tax implications of the model, but the concept of earning more yield from liquid holdings is attractive.</p>
<p><a href="https://atlas.kitchen/">Atlas</a>: This startup is building software to let restaurants in Southeast Asia move more operations online, aiming to help restaurants create a closer bond with consumers that food delivery platforms have pulled away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.withapollo.com/">Apollo</a>: A debit card that rewards users with stocks. Making purchases with the card earns the user a fractional share of a stock, plus &#8220;a chance to win&#8221; full shares.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.strivemath.com/">Strive Education</a>: With 3.7 million students in Asia, Strive Education uses 1:1 live classes to teach high school math through coding games. The company has $20,000 monthly recurring revenue and is growing 30% monthly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.plusidentity.com/">PlusIdentity</a>: A password manager for startups, focused first on a Slack app that hits the high points of enterprise-level options (Okta) and consumer apps (LastPass).

<p><a href="https://www.hitpayapp.com/">HitPay</a>: HitPay brings together two startup trends that have captured investor interest in recent quarters, namely no-code tooling and payments. The company wants to help SMBs in the South East Asian market accept payments from what it describes as a market that is fragmented. So far the company has reached $5.4 million in total payment volume (TPV) per month, a figure that yields $35,000 in monthly revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aoadx.com/">AOA Dx Inc.</a>: AOA is building blood tests that help detect ovarian cancer early when survival rates are much higher. The founding team has two successful exits in the health startup space behind them and their product has already shown early success in a 600-person patient study.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cococart.co/">Cococart</a>: An online store builder that claims to have a setup process 10x faster than Shopify. The team says they&#8217;re currently working with over 2,000 active merchants.</p>
<p><a href="https://metaphor.so/">Metaphor</a>: What’s the metaphor for taking on Google? Metaphor is a language-model-based search engine. With this technology, users can search by ideas; think queries like “one of the most promising startups in the health tech space is” or “a smart essay about love is” instead of relying solely on keywords.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinai.com/">Tinai</a>: Ninety percent of small businesses in Vietnam still keep at least some of their financial records using pen and paper. Tinai aims to help modernize this with a digital bookkeeping service — and after only six weeks they have 1,200 active merchants and are handling USD$1.8 million worth of transactions.</p>

<p><a href="https://turionspace.com/">Turion Space</a>: Space trash removal! It’s a well-known issue that the orbit around Earth is littered with crap of all sorts, junk that is circling the planet at high speeds. Turion Space wants to build spacecraft that can get that shit out of orbit, and it also wants to service satellites and mine asteroids. You have to start somewhere, we suppose. Space companies are hard to judge at this stage, but we can say that the TAM Turion is pursuing is, well, as big as the planet.</p>
<p><a href="https://cero.ai/">Cero</a>: The team at Cero is building software to help hospitals automate communications with patients over WhatsApp. The team has banked $95,000 in monthly revenue helping their customers communicate with more than 600,000 patients.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.momomedical.com/">Momo Medical</a>: With a growing elderly population worldwide, nurses in hospitals and long-term care facilities are stretched thin. Momo Medical has made an IoT-equipped bed sensor that tells nurses who is sleeping, who is rising, and who may be having trouble, all in one interface. The increase in productivity could help offset the worldwide nursing shortage. They&#8217;re already signing contracts and have $250,000 ARR.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196609" style="width: 1231px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196609" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196609 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/milky-way.jpg" alt="" width="1221" height="885" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/milky-way.jpg 1221w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/milky-way.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/milky-way.jpg?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/milky-way.jpg?resize=768,557 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/milky-way.jpg?resize=680,493 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/milky-way.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1221px) 100vw, 1221px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196609" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Milky Way AI</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://milkyway.ai/">Milky Way AI</a>: No, Milky Way AI is not building computer intelligence to scan the stars. Instead, it’s building computer intelligence to scan the <i>shelves</i>. Perhaps Milky Way refers to the candy bar, instead of the interstellar body. The startup has built a mobile app that allows CPG companies to scan shelves and check what goods are in stock. Per the startup, it has four brands working with it today wirth $11,000 in monthly revenue. And two new contracts that could push its revenues into the seven figures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slip.so/">Slip</a>: Slip is building a marketplace for top developers to create and monetize courses helping young coders hone their skills. The team is looking to get their product into the corporate learning space and get major tech companies providing their courses to employees.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mindfi.co/">MindFi</a>: A corporate wellness/mental health platform for companies in Asia, offering employees &#8220;microclasses,&#8221; guided exercises and assessments meant to help with mental well-being.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.deskimo.com/">Deskimo</a>: With employees fluidly moving from home to office to shared workspaces, hybrid work is a global trend. Deskimo aims to embrace that flexibility by aggregating managed office space into a single app and renting it out by the minute.

<p><a href="http://www.lumifyhub.com/">Lumify</a>: We’re all familiar with the concept of super apps for consumers. First popularized in Asia, they may bring together ride-hailing, food delivery, e-commerce and chat. But what about a super app for nurses? Lumify thinks the idea has legs. Its app can help nurses find whatever they need, from scrubs to shifts it claims. The company has generated $275,000 in revenue so far this year from a user base of 15,000 nurses. The concept makes sense. Nurses are busy, in demand and earn good wages; why not sell to them?</p>
<p><a href="https://crew.work/">Crew</a>: Crew is building a recruiting-centric CRM designed to make it easier to reach out to candidates. The company&#8217;s software is designed to help recruiters tackle proactive outreach with tooling designed for each part of the hiring process, keeping things streamlined and personalized.</p>

<p><a href="https://writesonic.com/">Writesonic</a>: AI-powered copywriting tool for marketing material. Launched in February, Writesonic hit $36,000 in monthly ARR through 100% organic user acquisition.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reprosent.com/">REPROSENT</a>: Cancer patients&#8217; daily symptoms could be crucial to understanding their needs and the effectiveness of treatment, but it can be hard to collect them regularly. Reprosent is an app for patient self-reported data that has seen over 80% daily use, providing a steady stream of helpful data for caregivers. They&#8217;re already signing up major care centers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getpinglend.com/">Pinglend</a>: This is an interesting company. Pinglend wants to let people pledge items and, in return, offer credit based on those assets. Per the company, its model will allow it to loan money to users at around 20% of the rate that pawn shops or payday lenders charge. The company has yet to launch, but as it is playing in a space rife with consumer abuse, it will have questions over its head as it proves out its model. The company wants to “graduate” its users to unsecured credit cards in time.</p>
<p><a href="https://appx.co.in/">AppX</a>: AppX has built a platform that helps social media creators build their own apps that play to their strengths and monetize their audiences better than personal websites do. The company started with educational creators and is looking to expand with gaming and fitness creators.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196612" style="width: 1314px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196612" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196612 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/caire.jpg" alt="" width="1304" height="617" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/caire.jpg 1304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/caire.jpg?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/caire.jpg?resize=300,142 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/caire.jpg?resize=768,363 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/caire.jpg?resize=680,322 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/caire.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1304px) 100vw, 1304px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196612" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Caire Health</p></div></p>

<p><a href="https://membo.ee/?lang=en">Membo</a>: A premium way to grocery shop. Membo is a next-day grocery delivery service in Europe that optimizes for freshness and quality, instead of 15-minute speed. The startup does $30,000 monthly GMV and makes money through a per-order commission fee.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.soraban.com/">Soraban</a>: Accounting firms aren’t the most futuristic office environments, and Soraban aims to modernize them with a back-office platform that brings them into the 21st century.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.abatable.com/">Abatable</a>: Robo-advising is old hat by this point, technology that has become table stakes for consumer investing services that focus on long-term holding. But Abatable wants to bring robo-advising into the carbon-removal game, creating portfolios that “focus on carbon removal.” Given the rising focus on more socially and environmentally conscious investing around the world, it’s a neat idea.</p>
<p><a href="https://varos.io/">Varos</a>: Varos helps companies understand how their performance stacks up against the competition by creating anonymized databases of customer data. The startup is tackling the $21 billion planning software market with a specific focus on marketing, product and finance teams.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usefriz.com/">Friz</a>: A bank specifically tailored for freelancers (focusing on South Asia and Southeast Asia), making it easier to get loans for those without fixed monthly paychecks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zensors.com/">Zensors Inc:</a> Google analytics for the physical world. The startup is a software-only AI solution that connects to security cameras dispersed around airports, transit hubs and stores — helping companies offer actionable advice to better the customer experience. Its software footprint currently impacts over 1 million people a week.</p>
<p><a href="https://kodda.mx/">Kodda</a>: Getting insurance in LatAm is a dated process, and Kodda aims to bring a Lemonade-like experience to the millions of people there. Users can sign up in 90 seconds and make claims in minutes; so far the company has 250 paying customers and it says not one has left.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/cache">Cache</a>: Gopuff is a big deal these days, having raised roughly eighty zillion dollars. But the Cache team thinks that there is still room in the on-demand market for convenience goods. The startup operates so-called “dark” stores to give goods to on-demand drivers. Dark stores in general are a hot commodity these days, thanks to rising delivery needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.akudo.in/">Akudo</a>: A neobanking startup in India geared toward providing teenagers with credit cards, hoping to help young people in the country manage their money in a smart way.

Personal trading can be complicated for employees at banks, law firms and crypto exchanges due to potential conflicts of interests and various other restrictions. Eventually, Argus wants to become an investment adviser for these employees — right now, it’s just starting by helping them not screw up.</p>
<p><a href="http://getcabal.com/">Cabal</a>: Cabal is a private workspace for founders, investors and advisers to update one another and organize things like equity distributions. Sure, you could do it in Slack or something, but this one is built with the startup and stakeholder crew in mind. Plus it&#8217;s cool to be able to say &#8220;join our Cabal.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://hedgehog.app/">Hedgehog</a>: Back to the robo-adviser theme, Hedgehog is an SEC-approved service that helps consumers buy crypto products. It claims to offer trades at the best possible price, and $70 million in AUM. Personalized crypto advice is a neat idea, given that mostly what we’re told on Twitter is either “hodl” or “go fuck yourself.” If Hedgehog can scale its AUM, Coinbase might swoop in with its checkbook.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.examedi.com/">Examedi</a>: Examedi is a home healthcare marketplace for Latin America helping consumers match with healthcare providers and take at-home medical exams on their own schedule. The company grew 160% in August.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.potion.ai/">Potion</a>: AI to help R&amp;D teams (starting with beauty companies) formulate their products, replacing processes that generally require lengthy trial-and-error with simulation.</p>
<p><a href="https://trii.co/">Trii</a>: Launched six months ago, Trii is a U.S. and local stock investment platform for retail investors in LatAm. Across its 30,000 users, the startup has processed more than $60,000 in transactions and has $10 million in assets under management. Trii looks to circumvent local brokers, who have high fees and required minimums, with $2 per trade fee and no required minimum.</p>
<p><a href="https://synder.com/">Synder</a>: E-commerce companies need to do accounting too, but as we&#8217;ve seen suggested by other companies, it&#8217;s not particularly easy or simple. Synder aims to automate as much as possible, looping in all the major sales platforms and doing the bean-counting magic every company needs to do to make sure they&#8217;re actually making money. With 3,900 customers already, it seems plenty of folks were waiting for something like this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oneschema.co/">OneSchema</a>: CSV imports can be a bit of a mess, and cleaning up data is a huge pain in the backside. OneSchema wants to hammer on both issues at the same time with a spreadsheet UI that can correct CSV data, in theory allowing customers to upload data with fewer errors. Excel holds up much of the modern world, and lots of folks stuck making Microsoft’s spreadsheet tool work for their needs could use some help. Let’s see if OneSchema can help.</p>

<p><a href="https://onebrief.com/">Onebrief:</a> Talk about purpose built. Onebrief is a tool built to help military headquarters with their joint planning needs, while keeping things presentation-ready in order to boot out PowerPoint. The company says it recently signed a $350,000 deal with a four-star military HQ.</p>
<p><a href="https://costcertified.com/">CostCertified</a>: CostCertified is building a marketplace for players in the residential construction world, allowing suppliers, contractors and consumers to connect inside a single platform, ensuring that estimates stay accurate and minimizing surprises.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.legion.health/">Legion Health</a>: A B2B marketplace that helps psychiatrists and therapists sell their time by the hour — which, as the company points out, lets these professionals take on extra hours while allowing hospitals and telehealth companies to scale considerably without more full-time headcount. Co-founder Yash Patel says that five weeks post-launch the company has already signed contracts (with groups like Sesame and Billings Clinic) worth $3 million in annual value.</p>
<p><a href="https://ahazou.com/">Ahazou</a>: A SaaS-platform for local businesses in LatAm bring businesses online through services such as payment processing, digital marketing and reviews. It is the latest startup aimed at helping local shops, from nail salons to painters, prepare for a post-COVID landscape. Over 16,000 companies pay for Ahazou’s software, resulting in $1.2 million in annual recurring revenue. Still, it’s just a drop in the bucket for what the team estimates will be a $4 billion market of local business in LatAm.</p>
<p><a href="https://senddots.com/">Dots</a>: If you&#8217;re a seller or service provider, the platform you sell on may very well not want to pay you in the way you want to be paid, whether that&#8217;s old-school ACH or instant transfer via Venmo or CashApp. Dots provides a single API to marketplaces that lets them pay out via any of those methods and more, simplifying the finances of everyone involved.</p>
<p><a href="https://palettehq.com/en">PaletteHQ</a>: If you haven’t worked in a sales team, you might not be aware of how the commission process works. It varies company to company, and can change based on evolving corporate goals and product releases. So managing a commission setup that sales folks can understand &#8212; and therefore find motivating &#8212; is complex. Palette wants to shake up the issue with software and has reached $10,000 in MRR thus far. Twist: Sales people selling sales-focused software to sales team leaders? Surely that’s an advantageous market perch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.inai.io/">Inai</a>: A no-code platform for handling payments globally. It hooks into your payment providers (like Stripe, Paypal), fraud tools (like Sift) and tax tools and wraps them all up in a easy to configure dashboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://artillery.io/">Artillery</a>: Pitched as a &#8220;modern load testing&#8221; platform, Artillery hammers your product with traffic (millions of requests per second originating across 13+ different regions) so there are no surprises later.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.breadcrumbs.io/">Breadcrumbs.io</a>: Analyzes customer and prospect data to help companies identify hidden revenue opportunities. The no-code scoring engine has attracted $185,000 in annual recurring revenue to help startups make sure they don’t leave any lucrative breadcrumbs behind. Non-obvious revenue may just pique investor interest, especially when it comes to serving their portfolio companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.protex.ai/">Protex AI</a>: Protex AI is a computer vision company that identifies dangers in industrial workplaces before they become a problem. Maybe that&#8217;s workers too close to dangerous processes, or a machine starting to fail or something catastrophic — catching them even a second or two earlier might avoid disaster. Their first install caught 60% more safety violations than human monitoring, an increase that might alone justify the company&#8217;s $25,000 per site fee.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.containiq.com/">ContainIQ</a>: An easy to install platform for monitoring Kubernetes events and metrics over time, with hooks like Slack support for alerting your team when things break.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.epsilon3.io/">Epsilon3, Inc.</a>: Built by a team with hundreds of rocket launches under their belt, Epsilon3 is an &#8220;operating system&#8221; for spacecraft launches (and other complex operations) — effectively taking the ridiculously complicated but too often still paper-based procedures/workflows and making them digital.</p>
<p><a href="https://hotglue.xyz/">Hotglue</a>: A developer tool designed to help create native SaaS integrations with data sources in minutes, aiming to help users sidestep jumping through development and maintenance hoops.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 31, 2021. Today the TechCrunch machine was busy covering the first day of Y Combinator’s Demo Day event, so expect to see all sorts of coverage on the site after this hits your inbox. We’ll bring you a recap in tomorrow’s edition, though we do have a first taste down below.</p>
<p>In Disrupt news, TechCrunch is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/kai-fu-lee-and-chen-qiufan-will-share-their-vision-of-our-ai-powered-future-at-disrupt/">bringing an AI investor and a science-fiction author together</a> and will have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/fundraising-for-your-startup-weve-got-you-covered-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">lots on deck for startups currently raising external capital</a>. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">Databricks is now worth $38B:</a> </strong>Data and AI unicorn Databricks confirmed its previously reported financing event today, raising $1.6 billion at a $38 billion valuation. TechCrunch spoke with the company’s CEO about what the money&#8217;s for, and we dug a bit more deeply into its revenue results. The <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/the-hyperactive-late-stage-market-should-keep-the-startup-investing-game-afoot/">late-stage market has been busy</a></strong>, but this Databricks round is big even by today’s venture standards.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/this-yc-summer-batch-features-the-largest-group-of-african-startups-yet/">More African startups than ever in YC batch:</a></strong> As we write, Demo Day is ongoing, so most of our first-day coverage will be finished too late to include. But we got a look at the African startups in the summer batch, and there are more than ever. Given <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">how active the African startup market is proving this year</a></strong>, we’re not surprised.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tiger-global-in-talks-to-make-apna-indias-fastest-unicorn/">Apna could be India’s next unicorn:</a> </strong>Focusing on upskilling Indian consumers, Apna could become a unicorn if a Tiger Global-led round comes to fruition. TechCrunch reports that the round could be worth $100 million at a valuation of more than $1 billion. Edtech in India remains one of the key startup narratives in recent years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Because this is the last day of August, we presume that the summer lull in funding events has come and gone. Not that we really noticed a downtick in volume, frankly, but all the same, expect things to get even crazier in the coming weeks. Here’s a sampling of the rounds that we covered today:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/uk-based-heroes-raises-200m-to-buy-up-more-amazon-merchants-for-its-roll-up-play/"><strong>$200M more to roll-up Amazon merchants:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Beyond Indian edtech companies, another trend that has raised nigh-infinite funds this year is startups raising capital to buy up smaller e-commerce merchants, often with a focus on those selling on Amazon. Heroes is the latest to raise capital for the concept, with the U.K.-based startup adding a few hundred million to its accounts in a single go.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/whoop-raises-another-200m-for-its-athlete-focused-fitness-wearable/"><strong>Whoop, the Peloton of Apple Watches, raises $200M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you are a fitness-wearable user, you may be familiar with Whoop. The company’s athlete-focused wristband has helped Whoop raise more than $400 million, now valuing the company at $3.6 billion. That’s many duckets for a fitness wearable. But as Whoop has a software fee bundled into its hardware &#8212; hence our Peloton analogy &#8212; it is not simply another hardware company.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/compounds-foods-brews-up-4-5m-to-make-coffee-without-beans/"><strong>Synthetic coffee is coming:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Maricel Saenz, the founder and CEO of Compound Foods, wants to create and sell coffee sans beans. Why? Well, climate change is making growing coffee beans harder, and the process is hard on the environment to boot. So why not just synthesize your morning java? I am willing to try this out, with the caveat that coffee is delicious so it’s going to take a little convincing for me to change my routines.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/borzo-a-delivery-startup-which-focuses-on-emerging-economies-raises-35m/"><strong>Borzo wants to bring on-demand to more markets:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Delivery service Dostavista is rebranding to Borzo, bringing its multicountry business under a single brand. The startup, per TechCrunch, was founded in 2012 and has a customer base of 2 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/quips-new-100m-round-will-usher-in-more-than-just-clean-teeth/"><strong>Former TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Alley company Quip raises $100M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Quip is best known as a toothbrush company, but it hit profitability last year, expanded its product line and landed nine figures in new capital. The company today offers a host of oral cleaning products as well as invisible teeth aligners.</li>
<li>To close out our startup coverage today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/peak-raises-75m-for-a-platform-that-helps-non-tech-companies-build-ai-applications/"><strong>Peak has raised $75 million to help non-tech companies build AI apps</strong></a>. The Manchester, England-based Peak wants to help companies that lack in-house AI talent apply the software technique to their own businesses. SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led the latest investment, which the company intends to use to scale its staff and hit up new markets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6 tips for establishing your startup’s global supply chain</h2>
<p>The barrier to entry for launching hardware startups has fallen; if you can pull off a successful crowdfunding campaign, you&#8217;re likely savvy enough to find a factory overseas that can build your widgets to spec.</p>
<p>But global supply chains are fragile: No one expected an off-course container ship to block the Suez Canal for six days. Due to the pandemic, importers are paying almost $18,000 for shipping containers from China today that cost $3,300 a year ago.</p>
<p>After spending a career spinning up supply chains on three continents, Liteboxer CEO Jeff Morin authored a guide for Extra Crunch for hardware founders.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’re clear-eyed about the challenges and apply some rigor and forethought to the process, the end result can be hard to match,&#8221; Morin says.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tiktoks-new-creator-marketplace-api-lets-influencer-marketing-companies-tap-into-first-party-data/"><strong>TikTok wants to help match influencers and brands:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the takeaway from our story today that TikTok’s “new Creator Marketplace API lets influencer marketing companies tap into first-party data.” Given how much we’ve read about astroturfing influencers, the concept makes sense. And TikTok wants its leading creators to make lots of money on its platform so they stick around. Expect to see more of this from other platforms in time.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/windows-11-launches-october-5/"><strong>Windows 11 launches October 5:</strong></a> As a Windows fan (and a macOS fan, for the record), I am somewhat hyped to try out the latest Windows build, though I worry if my CPU is sufficiently new. Regardless, the new code drops in early October, so the wait is nearly over.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/spotify-officially-launches-blend-allowing-friends-to-match-their-musical-tastes-and-make-playlists-together/"><strong>Now you can troll your friends on Spotify with your musical tastes:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Love music? Have friends that love music? And do you enjoy different music than your friends? Good news! Now you can create blended playlists with your team, so that you wind up with a playlist that pleases precisely no one.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[The total cost of the deal came to $1 billion, giving the Russian company 100% ownership over all four businesses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Russian internet and ride-hail giant Yandex has acquired Uber&#8217;s stake in its Self-Driving Group (SDG), as well as Uber&#8217;s indirect interest in Yandex.Eats, Yandex.Lavka and Yandex.Delivery. The total cost of the deal came to $1 billion, giving the Russian company 100% ownership over all four businesses.</p>
<p>Yandex SDG is an autonomous technology spinout from MLU B.V., the ride-hailing and food delivery joint venture Yandex formed with Uber in 2018 by merging Yandex.Taxi and Uber&#8217;s Russian operations. At the time, Uber had a 36.6% stake in the new company. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/yandex-spins-out-self-driving-car-unit-from-its-uber-jv-invests-150m-into-newco/">when SDG was spun out into a separate business</a>, Uber was left with an 18.2% stake in the company, which has just been bought out by Yandex. Yandex also purchased Uber&#8217;s 33.5% collective interest in Yandex&#8217;s food delivery service, last-mile logistics service and 15-minute convenience store delivery service.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, Yandex and Uber were reportedly considering an<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-28/yandex-uber-jv-in-talks-with-morgan-stanley-goldman-for-ipo"> IPO for their JV</a>, which Morgan Stanley estimated to be valued at around $7.7 billion. <span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;">Yandex says autonomous driving technology is &#8220;highly synergistic to the Yandex ecosystem, which includes ride-hailing, e-commerce and food-tech businesses.&#8221; It makes sense that the company would want to control all of that potential growth. Uber, which reported a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/how-uber-plans-to-rebound-from-massive-q2-losses-stemming-from-driver-incentives/">Q2 loss of $509 million before EBITDA this year</a>, might be looking to make a lucrative exit and refocus its priorities closer to home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;">&#8220;This acquisition will enable Yandex to further increase its capacity for strategic management and flexibility when it comes to self-driving technology,&#8221; a Yandex spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;It will unlock further growth potential for both Yandex and Yandex SDG, creating new sources of value for shareholders.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The acquisitions are part of a larger restructuring of the MLU B.V. and Yandex SDG joint ventures, according to <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001552781-21-000695/">Uber&#8217;s SEC filing on Monday</a>. They will happen in two stages. Stage 1, which is expected to close by the end of Q3 this year, will give Yandex a 4.5% interest in the newly restructured MLU, which will focus on mobility businesses like ride-hailing and car-sharing. This gives Yandex a total of 71% ownership in the JV, 2.8% of which is reserved for an employee equity incentive program. Uber&#8217;s total 18.2% stake in SDG is also expected to be sold during the first stage.</p>
<p>Stage 2, which is expected to close by the end of this year, includes the demerger of Yandex.Eats, Yandex.Lavka and Yandex.Delivery from MLU and subsequent acquisition of Uber’s interest in these businesses.</p>
<p>Yandex will also receive a two-year American call option to acquire the rest of Uber&#8217;s interest in MLU at a more or less fixed price of $1.8 billion, depending on agreed increases over the option period. This number will increase to $2 billion if exercised in 2023. The Russian company will also continue to use the Uber brand exclusively in Russia and other countries until August 2030.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yandex will also get an extension of the current license for the exclusive right to use the Uber brand in Russia and certain other countries until August 2030, assuming the exercise of the option. Yandex&#8217;s stock was up 5.16% on Tuesday at market close.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of Hollywood&#8217;s biggest talent agencies is getting into the NFT game.</p>
<p>Larva Labs, the creator of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/">CryptoPunks</a>, just signed with United Talent Agency (UTA) in a representation deal that will bring one of the earliest and most iconic NFT projects into the entertainment and branding worlds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that it is one of the first opportunities for an IP that fully originated in crypto-world to enter a broader entertainment space, and they earned it,&#8221; head of UTA Digital Assets Lesley Silverman<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/"> told The Hollywood Reporter</a>. &#8220;They really have hit the zeitgeist in a tremendous way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deal could see CryptoPunks popping up across film, TV, video games and other licensing areas. Larva Labs&#8217; other art projects, Meebits and Autoglyphs, will also be represented by UTA moving forward. The terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed.</p>
<p>As speculative investment in NFTs explodes, CryptoPunks remain one of the most recognizable — and valuable — pioneers in the space. Larva Labs launched 10,000 of the individual algorithmically generated pixelated figures on the Ethereum blockchain back in 2017.</p>
<p>To the untrained eye, and arguably to the trained eye too, CryptoPunks are just little pixelated portraits of different characters, some wearing pirate hats, others in aviator glasses smoking pipes. But to the crypto world, punks are a social signifier, communicating early investment into NFTs, personal style and, importantly, wealth.</p>
<p>The value of CryptoPunks skyrocketed from zero (they were initially given away for free) and now even the least expensive collectible punks run for hundreds of thousands of dollars, with the most valuable selling for millions. In May, a bundle of nine CryptoPunks sold for just under $17 million in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/cryptopunks-nft-bundle-goes-for-17-million-in-christies-auction/">auction run by Christie&#8217;s</a>. And last week, even Visa got in the game, spending $150,000 on CryptoPunk #7610, a digital illustration sporting a mohawk and green face makeup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It&#8217;s noteworthy that a traditional talent agency best known for representing A-list celebrities is getting into the NFT game, but it&#8217;s not the group&#8217;s first time getting its feet wet in the wild world of crypto. Earlier this month, UTA <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/">signed a company called Rally</a> that runs a platform that helps creators issue branded social tokens that fans can spend on merch and exclusive content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What do LinkedIn and Twitter have in common? They both introduced ephemeral story features that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">were pretty fleeting</a>. LinkedIn <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/linkedin-tells-advertisers-it-shutting-down-stories-videos/2361766">announced today</a> that it will suspend its Stories feature on September 30 and begin working on a different way to add short-form videos to the platform.</p>
<p>LinkedIn announced <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/update-marketing-linkedin-stories-whats-next-/?trk=public_post-content_share-article">the upcoming change</a> to warn advertisers who might have already purchased ads that would run in between Stories. Those will instead be shared on the LinkedIn feed, but users who promoted or sponsored Stores directly from their page will need to remake them.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>LinkedIn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/linkedin-launches-stories-plus-zoom-bluejeans-and-teams-video-integrations-as-part-of-wider-redesign/">introduced Stories</a> in September, around the same time that Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">rolled out</a> Fleets to all users before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">doing away</a> with the feature. This was part of a larger web and mobile redesign, which also added integrations with Zoom, BlueJeans and Teams to help professionals stay connected while working from home. But according to LinkedIn, these temporary posts didn&#8217;t quite work on the platform.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eyoUAVh3pz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">Fleet your last Fleet — the Twitter feature vanishes today</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;In developing Stories, we assumed people wouldn’t want informal videos attached to their profile, and that ephemerality would reduce barriers that people feel about posting,&#8221; wrote LinkedIn&#8217;s Senior Director of Product Liz Li in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-next-linkedin-stories-video-liz-li/">a blog post today</a>. &#8220;Turns out, you want to create lasting videos that tell your professional story in a more personal way and that showcase both your personality and expertise.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Li also noted that users want &#8220;more creative tools to make engaging videos.&#8221; While Stories included stickers and prompts, users wanted more creative functionality.</p>
<p>If LinkedIn is successful in its plans to create a short-form video feature, it would join platforms like Snapchat and Instagram that have built their own TikTok-like feeds. Sure, most users probably don&#8217;t post the same content on LinkedIn and their personal social media accounts, but there actually are some <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@erinmcgoff?lang=en">prominent TikTokers</a> sharing career advice, interview tips and resume guidance, so LinkedIn&#8217;s pivot to video might not be as weird as it seems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Can reading glasses actually be cool? A new eyewear company called <a href="https://www.cheeterzclub.com/">Cheeterz Club</a> thinks so. The startup is working to change the perception of reading glasses from being just cheap, disposable items you pick up from a rotating display rack at your local drug store to being something you&#8217;d actually be proud to wear. To do so, the company is designing its glasses with quality lenses and frames in a range of styles, while still keeping the pricing affordable.</p>
<p>The startup &#8212; whose name is a reference to the slang term for glasses, &#8220;cheaters&#8221; &#8212; was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferleefarrelly/">Jennifer Farrelly</a>, whose background includes work in advertising and sales at companies like Uber and Virool.</p>
<p>She said the idea to make a better set of readers came to her because she found herself frustrated by the current options on the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all started a few years ago. My friends were posting on social media these really depressing comments and posts like: &#8216;I&#8217;m old and turning into my parents, this is awful.&#8217; And I [thought to myself] why does it have to be like that? I feel just as young today as I did 10 years ago,&#8221; Farrelly explains. &#8220;Why are my friends and I feeling forced to feel old because of something that happens overnight?,&#8221; she says, of what felt like the sudden onset of middle age and the hardships it brings.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse, Farrelly says, is that when you finally make your way to the drugstore to pick out some reading glasses, all you&#8217;ll find are bad, plastic pairs that both look and feel cheap.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s even more demoralizing,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196490" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196490" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196490" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0119-Fashion-Tints-in-a-variety-of-frames.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0119-Fashion-Tints-in-a-variety-of-frames.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0119-Fashion-Tints-in-a-variety-of-frames.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0119-Fashion-Tints-in-a-variety-of-frames.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0119-Fashion-Tints-in-a-variety-of-frames.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0119-Fashion-Tints-in-a-variety-of-frames.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0119-Fashion-Tints-in-a-variety-of-frames.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0119-Fashion-Tints-in-a-variety-of-frames.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0119-Fashion-Tints-in-a-variety-of-frames.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0119-Fashion-Tints-in-a-variety-of-frames.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0119-Fashion-Tints-in-a-variety-of-frames.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0119-Fashion-Tints-in-a-variety-of-frames.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0119-Fashion-Tints-in-a-variety-of-frames.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196490" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cheeterz Club</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So Farrelly teamed up with a former Warby Parker and Pair Eyewear head of Product, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lee-zaro-4b88b05/">Lee Zaro</a>, to design a new line of more fashion-forward eyewear.</p>
<p>Zaro, who is based in the LA area, immediately saw the opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drugstore reading glasses are typically poor in quality, and can feel like they are designed with our parents in mind, leaving a huge unmet need for sophisticated eyewear options,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When Jennifer approached me to help design her first line of eyewear, I knew it was a brilliant idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>To differentiate itself from lower-end readers, Cheeterz Club glasses are made with 100% acetate and feature spring hinges and stainless steel. The lenses, meanwhile, offer more clarity than is often found in reading glasses.</p>

<p>Typically, ophthalmic plastic lens materials have an <a href="https://www.allentownoptical.com/abbe-value-interpretation/">Abbe value</a> &#8212; a measure of the degree at which light is dispersed or separated &#8212; between 30 and 58. The higher number offers better optical performance. Crown glass can have an Abbe value as high as 59, but polycarbonate readers (like <a href="https://www.warbyparker.com/eyeglasses/women">those</a> from Warby Parker, Farrelly notes) would have an Abbe value of 30. Cheeterz Club lenses, which are CR-39 lenses, are at at 58. This is a difference you can tell when trying the glasses on alongside your drugstore readers.</p>
<p>Cheeterz&#8217; lenses also offer 100% UVA/UVB protection, and are oil and water repellent. They can optionally be bought in one of eight fashion tints, from pink to blue, or in two sun shades. Consumers can also opt to add Blue Light coating to help with screen-induced eye fatigue or they can choose Progressive lenses, which combine distance vision with a reading lens.</p>
<p>Tints are an extra $10, Blue Light protection is $25 and Progressive lenses are $40.99 &#8212; lower than market rates.</p>
<p>At launch, Cheeterz Club offers 42 different styles ranging from traditional to the more modern, starting at $28.99.</p>
<p>Farrelly says finding the right price was key, because unlike regular glasses, consumers often buy multiple pairs of readers to leave around the house or car, pack in purses and bags, and so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I break something that costs me a couple hundred dollars, I&#8217;d be really upset about it,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But at a drugstore price of under $30, I can have them in all sorts of colors and different tints.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Farrelly, making the startup a success goes beyond bringing higher-quality reading glasses to market. It&#8217;s also about serving a demographic that often gets overlooked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Founders in their forties do not get representation, and it&#8217;s unfortunate. And there are also people in their forties and fifties that have disposable income and are looking for cute things. They&#8217;re spending so much money on facial creams and Botox,&#8221; she says, &#8220;but then you&#8217;re forced to put this really ugly pair of glasses on your face that make you feel bad about yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Cheeterz Club today is selling direct to the consumer, the company is talking to eye doctors, boutiques and others who may eventually resell for them, as more of a B2B model. It&#8217;s also testing selling on Amazon with one pair of Blue Light glasses.</p>
<p>Cheeterz Club plans to start discussing fundraising with seed investors later this fall.</p>
<p><em>Update, 8/31/21, 5:30 PM ET: Cheeterz Club incorrectly shared the number of frames available at launch. An earlier version of this article said it was 14, it&#8217;s actually 42, they said. We&#8217;ve updated with the new information. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A cybersecurity company says a popular smart home security system has a pair of vulnerabilities that can be exploited to disarm the system altogether.</p>
<p>Rapid7 found the vulnerabilities in the Fortress S03, a home security system that relies on Wi-Fi to connect cameras, motion sensors and sirens to the internet, allowing owners to remotely monitor their home anywhere with a mobile app. The security system also uses a radio-controlled key fob to let homeowners arm or disarm their house from outside their front door.</p>
<p>But the cybersecurity company said the vulnerabilities include an unauthenticated API and an unencrypted radio signal that can be easily intercepted.</p>

<p>Rapid7 <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/08/31/cve-2021-3927-67-fortress-s03-wifi-home-security-system-vulnerabilities/">revealed details</a> of the two vulnerabilities on Tuesday after not hearing from Fortress in three months, the standard window of time that security researchers give companies to fix bugs before details are made public. Rapid7 said its only acknowledgment of its email was when Fortress closed its support ticket a week later without commenting.</p>
<p>Fortress owner Michael Hofeditz opened but did not respond to several emails sent by TechCrunch with an email open tracker. An email from Bottone Reiling, a Massachusetts law firm representing Fortress, called the claims &#8220;false, purposely misleading and defamatory,&#8221; but did not provide specifics that it claims are false, or if Fortress has mitigated the vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Rapid7 said that Fortress&#8217; unauthenticated API can be remotely queried over the internet without the server checking if the request is legitimate. The researchers said by knowing a homeowner&#8217;s email address, the server would return the device&#8217;s unique IMEI, which in turn could be used to remotely disarm the system.</p>
<p>The other flaw takes advantage of the unencrypted radio signals sent between the security system and the homeowner&#8217;s key fob. That allowed Rapid7 to capture and replay the signals for &#8220;arm&#8221; and &#8220;disarm&#8221; because the radio waves weren&#8217;t scrambled properly.</p>
<p>Arvind Vishwakarma from Rapid7 said homeowners could add a <a href="https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308648">plus-tagged</a> email address with a long, unique string of letters and numbers in place of a password as a stand-in for a password. But there was little for homeowners to do for the radio signal bug until Fortress addresses it.</p>
<p>Fortress has not said if it has fixed or plans to fix the vulnerabilities. It&#8217;s not clear if Fortress is able to fix the vulnerabilities without replacing the hardware. It&#8217;s not known if Fortress builds the device itself or buys the hardware from another manufacturer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.makeheroes.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroes</a>, one of the new wave of startups aiming to build big e-commerce businesses by buying up smaller third-party merchants on Amazon&#8217;s Marketplace, has raised another big round of funding to double down on that strategy. The London startup has picked up $200 million, money that it will mainly be using to snap up more merchants. Existing brands in its portfolio cover categories like babies, pets, sports, personal health and home and garden categories &#8212; some of them, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/PremiumCare/page/CF3D13DB-DE1D-457F-86BD-EF5986D5D991?ref_=ast_bln"><span class="s1">PremiumCare</span></a> dog chews, the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Onco-Baby-Car-Mirror-Premium/dp/B01FCMV5RM/"><span class="s1">Onco </span></a>baby car mirror, gardening tool brand <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/page/0764177E-B460-461A-B000-C896EBB85411/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;store_ref=SB_A0464928EPHUJ1W9RJD&amp;pd_rd_plhdr=t&amp;aaxitk=c01483ea12dbbccd69c08bf355e6dc96&amp;hsa_cr_id=5310671600502&amp;lp_asins=B01EWSK0AU,B01CMFGCXO,B00ZY4XA9K&amp;lp_query=davaon&amp;lp_slot=auto-sparkle-hsa-tetris&amp;ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_lsi4d_logo&amp;pd_rd_w=wxK1s&amp;pf_rd_p=8f637300-b537-4bcc-bb94-5f850cdda3da&amp;pd_rd_wg=HcpfO&amp;pf_rd_r=CEXC1MN0CWMNV0JFEH1A&amp;pd_rd_r=a9b941a1-c997-4aca-a8a4-695caf6fce3d"><span class="s1">Davaon</span></a> and wooden foot massager roller <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TheraFlow-Massager-Relieve-Plantar-Fasciitis/dp/B00SMJIYNG/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=theraflow&amp;qid=1630405705&amp;sr=8-5"><span class="s1">Theraflow</span></a>, category best-sellers &#8212; and the plan is to continue building up all of these verticals.</p>
<p>Crayhill Capital Management, a fund based out of New York, is providing the funding, and Riccardo Bruni &#8212; who co-founded the company with twin brother Alessio and third brother Giancarlo &#8212; said that the bulk of it will be going toward making acquisitions, and is therefore coming in the form of debt.</p>
<p>Raising debt rather than equity at this point is pretty standard for companies like Heroes. Heroes itself is pretty young: it launched less than a year ago, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 2020</a>, with $65 million in funding, a round comprised of both equity and debt. Other investors in the startup include 360 Capital, Fuel Ventures and Upper 90.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;E-commerce roll-ups are the next wave of disruption in consumer packaged goods&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/e-commerce-roll-ups-present-the-next-wave-of-disruption-in-consumer-packaged-goods/embed/#?secret=m0QWglQELu" data-secret="m0QWglQELu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Heroes is playing in what is rapidly becoming a very crowded field. Not only are there tens of thousands of businesses leveraging Amazon&#8217;s extensive fulfillment network to sell goods on the e-commerce giant&#8217;s marketplace, but some days it seems we are also rapidly approaching a state of nearly as many startups launching to consolidate these third-party sellers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Many a roll-up play follows a similar playbook, which goes like this: Amazon provides the marketplace to sell goods to consumers, and the infrastructure to fulfill those orders, by way of <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fulfillment By Amazon</a> and its Prime service. Meanwhile, the roll-up business &#8212; in this case Heroes &#8212; buys up a number of the stronger companies leveraging FBA and the marketplace. Then, by consolidating them into a single tech platform that they have built, Heroes creates better economies of scale around better and more efficient supply chains, sharper machine learning and marketing and data analytics technology, and new growth strategies. </span></p>
<p>What is notable about Heroes, though &#8212; apart from the fact that it&#8217;s the first roll-up player to come out of the U.K., and continues to be one of the bigger players in Europe &#8212; is that it doesn&#8217;t believe that the technology plays as important a role as having a solid relationship with the companies it&#8217;s targeting, key given that now the top marketplace sellers are likely being feted by a number of companies as acquisition targets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;The tech is very important,&#8221; said Alessio in an interview. &#8220;It helps us build robust processes that tie all the systems together across multiple brands and marketplaces. But what we have is very different from a SaaS business. We are not building an app, and tech is not the core of what we do. From the acquisitions side, we believe that human interactions ultimately win. We don’t think tech can replace a strong acquisition process.&#8221;</p>

<p>Heroes&#8217; three founder-brothers (two of them, Riccardo and Alessio, pictured above) have worked across a number of investment, finance and operational roles (the CVs include Merrill Lynch, EQT Ventures, Perella Weinberg Partners, Lazada, Nomura and Liberty Global) and they say there have been strong signs so far of its strategy working: of the brands that it has acquired since launching in November, they claim business (sales) has grown five-fold.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Collectively, the roll-up startups are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to fuel these efforts. Other recent hopefuls that have announced funding this year include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/suma-brands-raises-150m-to-acquire-more-third-party-brands-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suma Brands</a> ($150 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/elevate-brands-banks-250m-to-roll-up-third-party-merchants-selling-on-amazons-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate Brands</a> ($250 million); <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perch</a> ($775 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/factory14-raises-200m-to-jump-into-the-amazon-marketplace-roll-up-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factory14</a> ($200 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrasio</a> (currently probably the biggest of them all in terms of reach and money raised and ambitions), <a href="https://heyday.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Razor Group</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellerX</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">X2</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/benitago-group-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benitago</a>, Latin America’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valoreo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/founded-by-former-carousell-ovo-and-fave-execs-rainforest-raises-36m-to-aggregate-asia-pacific-amazon-marketplace-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainforest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Una Brands</a> out of Asia. </span></p>

<p>The picture that is emerging across many of these operations is that many of these companies, Heroes included, do not try to make their particular approaches particularly more distinctive than those of their competitors, simply because &#8212; with nearly 10 million third-party sellers today on Amazon globally &#8212; the opportunity is likely big enough for all of them, and more, not least because of current market dynamics.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no secret that we were inspired by Thrasio and others,&#8221; Riccardo said. &#8220;Combined with COVID-19, there has been a massive acceleration of e-commerce across the continent.&#8221; It was that, plus the realization that the three brothers had the right e-commerce, fundraising and investment skills between them, that made them see what was a &#8216;perfect storm&#8217; to tackle the opportunity, he continued. &#8220;So that is why we jumped into it.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the case of Heroes, while the majority of the funding will be used for acquisitions, it&#8217;s also planning to double headcount from its current 70 employees before the end of this year with a focus on operational experts to help run their acquired businesses. </span></p>

Last time we checked in on the Boston-based company was in late-2019, when it raised $55 million. Now it’s back with a massive <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/whoop-raises-200-million-financing-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2-at-3-6-billion-valuation-301365153.html">$200 million raise</a>.</p>
<p>The Series F round brings Whoop’s total funding to nearly $405 million &#8212; a pretty massive investment for a company of its size. The round, led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2, puts the valuation at a jaw-dropping $3.6 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Additional investors include IVP, Cavu Venture Partners, Thursday Ventures, GP Bullhound, Accomplice, NextView Ventures and Animal Capital. They join a long list of former backers, including the National Football League Players Association, Jack Dorsey and a number of professional athletes.</p>
<p>The company’s targeting of athletes marks a strong contrast with leading consumer wearables like the Apple Watch and Fitbit. In fact, the company has a specific offering for sports teams, as well as solutions for businesses, healthcare and government/defense.</p>

<p>Whoop’s name made the rounds recently when Fitbit announced a “Daily Readiness Score” for the Charge 5, which many likened to the company’s more advanced analytics.</p>
<p>The company cites “rapid growth” in its membership offering over the past year as a motivation behind seeking additional funding. That was likely driven, in part, by the decision in 2019 to make the $500 wearable free, while focusing on a subscription service that starts at $18 a month for an 18-month membership (the shorter the membership, the more the monthly fee).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whoop is eying international expansion beyond the U.S. and using the massive influx of cash on R&amp;D for its hardware, software and analytics solutions. Money will also go toward expanding headcount, which is currently in excess of 500 (with nearly half of those employees having joined in the past year).</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to deepen our partnership with SoftBank as we grow internationally,&#8221; founder and CEO Will Ahmed said in a release. &#8220;While we have experienced amazing growth in the past year, the potential of our technology and the vast market for health monitoring remains largely untapped.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amsterdam-based challenger bank <a href="https://www.bunq.com">Bunq</a> is updating its service with a handful of new features. In addition to Dutch, German and French bank account numbers, existing and new users in Spain can now get a Spanish IBAN.</p>
<p>European IBANs are supposed to work across Europe. Your employer or internet provider can’t force you to get a local IBAN. And yet, that’s rarely the case. When you move to another European country, chances are the first thing you do is that you open a local bank account.</p>
<p>While European fintech companies have teamed up to create a lobbying effort called <a href="https://www.acceptmyiban.org">&#8220;Accept my IBAN&#8221;</a>, some challenger banks, such as Bunq, are adding the ability to get local bank account numbers as an intermediary fix. Bunq users can also choose to associate IBANs from multiple European countries with their account. You have to pay a one-time fee of €9.99 every time you add a new local IBAN.</p>

<p>Bunq is also drawing inspiration from <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a>, <a href="https://wise.com">Wise</a>, <a href="https://vivid.money">Vivid Money</a> and others as you&#8217;ll soon be able to receive, convert and hold other currencies. For instance, if you’re going to a non-Euro country for an internship, you will be able to receive your salary on your Bunq account. Bunq is starting with USD accounts with plans to add more currencies down the road.</p>
<p>Other new features include the ability to receive reminders the day before a direct debit occurs, a subscription view that lets you view current subscriptions and when they’re set to expire, an improved search feature and the ability to automatically accept direct debits and payment requests from your friends — make sure you set up a limit before enabling that feature.</p>
<p>Bunq recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/european-challenger-bank-bunq-raises-228-million-at-1-9-billion-valuation/">announced plans</a> to raise $228 million (€193 million) at a $1.9 billion valuation (€1.6 billion). The investment round hasn’t been approved by the Netherlands’ banking regulator just yet. Bunq is currently operating in 29 European markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apna, a 21-month-old startup that is helping millions of blue- and gray-collar workers in India upskill themselves, find communities and land jobs, is inching closer to becoming the fastest tech firm in the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market to become a unicorn.</p>
<p>Tiger Global is in advanced stages of talks to lead a $100 million round in <a href="https://apna.co">Apna</a>, according to four sources familiar with the matter. The proposed terms value the startup at over $1 billion, the sources said.</p>
<p>The round hasn&#8217;t closed yet, so terms of the deal may change, some of the sources cautioned.</p>
<p>If the round materializes, Apna will become the youngest Indian startup to attain the much-coveted unicorn status. The startup, which launched its app in December 2019, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/india-jobs-app-apna-raises-70-million/">valued at $570 million in its Series B financing round</a> in June this year. It will also be the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/apple-alum-jobs-app-apna-for-india-workers-raises-12-5-million/">third financing round</a> Apna would have secured in a span of less than seven months.</p>

<p>Tiger Global, an existing investor in Apna, didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment earlier this month. Apna founder and chief executive Nirmit Parikh, an Apple alum, declined to comment on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Indian cities are home to hundreds of millions of low-skilled workers who hail from villages in search of work. Many of them have lost their jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic that has slowed several economic activities in the world’s second-largest internet market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apna, whose name is inspired from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGKJBPFdUA" data-reader-unique-id="8">a 2019 Bollywood song</a>, is building a scalable networking infrastructure so that these workers can connect to the right employers and secure jobs. On its eponymous Android app, users also upskill themselves, review their interview skills and become eligible for more jobs.</p>
<p>As of June this year, Apna had amassed over 10 million users and was facilitating more than 15 million job interviews each month. All jobs listed on the Apna platform are verified by the startup and free of cost for the candidates.</p>
<p data-reader-unique-id="17">The startup has also partnered with some of India’s leading public and private organizations and is providing support to the Ministry of Minority Affairs of India, National Skill Development Corporation and UNICEF YuWaah to provide better skilling and job opportunities to candidates.</p>
<p data-reader-unique-id="17">The investment talks further illustrate Tiger Global&#8217;s growing interest in India. The New York-headquartered firm has made several high-profile investments in India this year, including in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/india-fintech-bharatpe-valued-at-2-85-billion-in-tiger-global-led-370-million-funding/">BharatPe</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/business-messaging-platform-gupshup-raises-240-million-from-tiger-global-fidelity-and-others/">Gupshup</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/indian-social-commerce-dealshare-raises-144-million-eyes-international-expansion/">DealShare</a>, Classplus, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/home-services-platform-urban-company-raises-255-million-at-2-1-billion-valuation/">Urban Company</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/tiger-global-backs-indian-crypto-startup-coinswitch-kuber-at-over-500m-valuation/">CoinSwitch Kuber</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">Groww</a>.</p>
<p data-reader-unique-id="17">More than two dozen Indian startups have become a unicorn this year, up from 11 last year, as several high-profile investors, including Tiger Global, SoftBank and Falcon Edge, have increased the pace of their investments in the world&#8217;s second most populous nation.</p>
<p data-reader-unique-id="17">Apna also counts Insight Partners, Lightspeed and Sequoia Capital among its existing investors.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Startups are hard work, but the complexities of global supply chains can make running hardware companies especially difficult. Instead of existing within a codebase behind a screen, the key components of your hardware product can be scattered around the world, subject to the volatility of the global economy.</p>
<p>I’ve spent most of my career establishing global supply chains, setting up manufacturing lines for 3D printers, electric bicycles and home fitness equipment on the ground in Mexico, Hungary, Taiwan and China. I’ve learned the hard way that Murphy’s law is a constant companion in the hardware business.</p>
<p>But after more than a decade of work on three different continents, there are a few lessons I’ve learned that will help you avoid unnecessary mistakes.</p>
<h2>Expect cost fluctuations, especially in currency and shipping</h2>
<p>Shipping physical products is quite different from &#8220;shipping&#8221; code — you have to pay a considerable amount of money to transport products around the world. Of course, shipping costs become a line item like any other as they get baked into the overall business plan. The issue is that those costs can change monthly — sometimes drastically.</p>
<p>At this time last year, a shipping container from China cost $3,300. Today, it’s <a href="https://fbx.freightos.com/freight-index/FBX01">almost $18,000</a> — a more than fivefold increase in 12 months. It’s safe to assume that most 2020 business plans did not account for such a cost increase for a key line item.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Shipping a buggy hardware product can be exponentially costlier than shipping buggy software. Recalls, angry customers, return shipping and other issues can become existential problems.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Similar issues also arise with currency exchange rates. Contract manufacturers often allow you to maintain cost agreements for any fluctuations below 5%, but the dollar has dropped much more than 5% against the yuan compared to a year ago, and hardware companies have been forced to renegotiate their manufacturing contracts.</p>
<p>As exchange rates become less favorable and shipping costs increase, you have two options: Operate with lower margins, or pass along the cost to the end customer. Neither choice is ideal, but both are better than going bankrupt.</p>
<p>The takeaway is that when you set up your business, you need to prepare for these possibilities. That means operating with enough margin to handle increased costs, or with the confidence that your end customer will be able to handle a higher price.</p>
<h2>Overorder critical parts</h2>
<p>Over the past year, many businesses have lost billions of dollars in market value because they didn’t order enough semiconductors. As the owner of a hardware company, you will encounter similar risks.</p>
<p>The supply for certain components, like computer chips, can be limited, and shortages can arise quickly if demand increases or supply chains get disrupted. It’s your job to analyze potential choke points in your supply chain and create redundancies around them.</p>

<p>Since 2013, Boston-based Toast has offered bars and eateries a software platform that lets them manage orders, payments and deliveries.</p>
<p>Over the last year, its customers have processed more than $38 billion in gross payment volume, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">Alex Wilhelm analyzed the company&#8217;s S-1 for The Exchange</a> with great interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toast was last valued at just under $5 billion when it last raised, per Crunchbase data,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;And folks are saying that it could be worth $20 billion in its debut. Does that square with the numbers?&#8221;</p>

<p>In August 2006, AWS activated its EC2 cloud-based virtual computer, a milestone in the cloud infrastructure giant&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really can’t overstate what Amazon was able to accomplish,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>In the 15 years since, EC2 has enabled clients of any size to test and run their own applications on AWS&#8217; virtual machines.</p>
<p>To learn more about a fundamental technological shift that &#8220;would help fuel a whole generation of startups,&#8221; Ron interviewed EC2 VP Dave Brown, who built and led the Amazon EC2 Frontend team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Most managers agree that OKRs foster transparency and accountability, but running a team effectively has different challenges when workers are attending all-hands meetings from their kitchen tables.</p>
<p>Instead of just discussing key metrics before board meetings or performance reviews, make them part of the day-to-day culture, recommends Jeremy Epstein, Gtmhub&#8217;s CMO.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strengthen your team by creating authentic workplace transparency using numbers as a universal language and providing meaning behind your team’s work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many founders must overcome a few emotional hurdles before they’re comfortable pitching a potential investor face-to-face.</p>
<p>To alleviate that pressure, Unicorn Capital founder Evan Fisher recommends that entrepreneurs use pre-pitch meetings to build and strengthen relationships before asking for a check:</p>
<p>“This is the ‘we actually aren’t looking for money; we just want to be friends for now’ pitch that gets you on an investor’s radar so that when it’s time to raise your next round, they’ll be far more likely to answer the phone because they actually know who you are.”</p>
<p>Pre-pitches are good for more than curing the jitters: These conversations help founders get a better sense of how VCs think and sometimes lead to serendipitous outcomes.</p>
<p>“Investors are opportunists by necessity,” says Fisher, “so if they like the cut of your business’s jib, you never know — the FOMO might start kicking hard.”</p>

<p>FischerJordan’s Deeba Goyal and Archita Bhandari break down the pandemic’s impact on alternative lenders, specifically what they had to do to survive the crisis, taking a look at smaller lenders including Credibly, Kabbage, Kapitus and BlueVine.</p>
<p>“Only those who were able to find a way through the complexities of their existing capital sources were able to maintain their performance, and the rest were left to perish or find new funding avenues,” they write.</p>

<p>Customer engagement software company Freshworks&#8217; S-1 filing depicts a company that&#8217;s experiencing accelerating revenue growth, &#8220;a great sign for the health of its business,&#8221; reports Alex Wilhelm in this morning&#8217;s The Exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most companies see their growth rates decline as they scale, as larger denominators make growth in percentage terms more difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studying the company&#8217;s SEC filing, he found that &#8220;Freshworks isn’t a company where we need to cut it lots of slack, as we might with an adjusted EBITDA number. It is going public ready for Big Kid metrics.”</p>
