										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With supply chains in the automotive industry continuing to be disrupted due to Covid-19, demand has <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-new-model-shortages-drive-near-record-demand-for-used-cars-12377702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surged</a> in the used-car market. Today, one of the startups that&#8217;s seeing a lot of growth as a result of that is announcing a big round of funding to further tap the opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cars24.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cars24</a>, a startup out of India that has built an app and website for selling used cars and motorbikes, has raised $400 million: a Series G of $300 million in equity and a further $100 million in debt. The fundraise is coming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/19/indias-cars24-a-used-vehicle-marketplace-raises-450m-at-a-1-84b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just three months after Cars24 last closed a round</a> &#8212; $450 million, with $340 million as a Series F and a further $110 million in debt &#8212; and as a mark of how heated the market is right now, Cars24&#8217;s valuation has nearly doubled in that short time: it&#8217;s now $3.3 billion, versus $1.84 billion three months ago.</p>
<p>Alpha Wave Global (which co-led the last round under its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/falcon-edge-closes-first-tranche-of-10b-fund-rebrands-as-alpha-wave-global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous brand</a>, Falcon Edge Capital) is leading this Series G, with participation from other existing investors. Cars24 is not disclosing who those investors are, but other backers include DST Global, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Alibaba, Tencent, Moore Strategic Ventures, Exor Seeds, Raptor Group and around 20 others.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249610" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Cars24 claims to have a 90% share of India&#8217;s used-car market, and it&#8217;s gotten there by way of technology. Its tools include a search engine for people to find vehicles (its wide inventory being one of the main unique selling points versus physical used-car lots); options for financing for the vehicle; and logistics software to subsequently organize and carry out vehicle deliveries to new owners. It also has built analytics to measure demand and calibrate pricing and make online assessments of vehicles. Cars24 currently has some 13 million monthly visitors to its site and has sold over 400,000 vehicles (both cars and motorbikes) to date.</p>
<p>Cars24 is not only on a scaling, but also a funding, tear: it additionally raised $200 million last December, putting the total raised in the last year to about $840 million. (And rumors of this latest round were circulating a couple of weeks ago.) It&#8217;s not the only one: a month ago, <a href="https://www.spinny.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spinny</a>, another startup in the used-car space <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/india-used-cars-platform-spinny-valued-at-1-75-billion-in-over-280-million-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $280 million</a>.</p>
<p>While Cars24 plans to work on increasing new customers against rival services, it will also be investing in more hooks to extend its engagement with those already using Cars24. These will include more financing options and centers for servicing vehicles before and after purchase. It will also be continuing to add more countries to its international footprint, with its next launches expected in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The primary use of the funding will be to continue to strengthen our presence in India, and in the countries where we have expanded,&#8221; said Gajendra Jangid, Cars24&#8217;s CMO, who co-founded the company with Vikram Chopra (the CEO), Mehul Agrawal and Ruchit Agarwal in Gurugram in 2015. Cars24 is active in some 200 cities in India, and it claims to have grown 50% in the last quarter, a record for the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A number of outsized startups have emerged in India with massive coffers of funding to grow domestically, with little in the way of international strategy. And with nearly 1.4 billion people, the world&#8217;s second most populous country after China, you can see why. Cars24, however, has followed a different playbook, exporting its model to several countries in the last year, starting with the UAE (July 2021), and then Australia and Thailand (both in October). It plans to add to that list with its next markets in Southeast Asia, Jangid confirmed.</p>
<p>Launching in more developed markets like Australia and UAE has seen Cars24 adjusting its approach based on different market factors, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Australia and the Emirates, it&#8217;s been about getting a good global supply of cars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because it&#8217;s hard to get new cars right now, that’s impacting pricing and demand for used vehicles.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its home market of India, car ownership still lingers in the single-percentage digits &#8212; somewhere between 2% and 3%, according to estimates &#8212; so in that regard, the only way is up. Indeed, as one of the most populated markets, which is rapidly developing, and which has jumped in with both feet into digital services and mobile apps, India represents a giant amount of potential that Cars24 is hoping to tap.</p>
<p>While Cars24 will continue to focus on bringing on new users, it&#8217;s also investing in infrastructure to extend how it works with those who are shopping on its platform. It has built out seven so-called Mega Refurbishment Labs around the country to assess and fix up cars destined for its platform. Sitting as a complement to the company&#8217;s otherwise all-digital approach to sourcing and selling vehicles, Jangid said the idea will be to make these labs a part of how the company also provides after-care to those who have purchased vehicles with the company. Longer term, he said, these would open up to all car owners. The company is also starting to build labs in other parts of the world to extend the proposition, with the first opening in Dubai.</p>
<p>The other area where the company is expanding its services is in the area of finance. Jangid said. He said Cars24 was the only player in its category with a banking license and it&#8217;s been using that to create payment schemes for customers. LIke car ownership itself, this represents another area of currently-underserved opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Less than 20% of used cars get financed, while more than 80% of new cars sold are financed, so you can see the huge gap,&#8221; Jangid said. He said that currently, more than 50% of its customer base is financing vehicle purchases by way of Cars24.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all smooth sailing for the company. Working in used vehicles, there are a number of inconsistencies in product, and the more Cars24 scales the harder it will be to ensure a <a href="https://twitter.com/Prince_Tushar_/status/1471793819951661056" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent customer experience</a> around that, too. We&#8217;ve seen other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/16/car-startup-beepi-sold-for-parts-after-potential-exits-to-fair-and-then-dgdg-broke-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used-car startups crash</a> over similar issues, so it will be worth watching whether Cars24 manages to navigate these challenges as it scales. It&#8217;s one area where building out the physical servicing centers might help.</p>
<p>“We are excited to back Cars24 yet again as they continue to cement their leadership positions across India, UAE, Australia and other international markets,&#8221; said Navroz D. Udwadia, co-founder and partner of Alpha Wave, in a statement. &#8220;CARS24&#8217;s robust competitive moats across in-house reconditioning, access to the widest assortment/supply and deep data science drive a delightful customer experience, and reflects in its best-in-class NPS. We believe this investment will help CARS24 fortify its moats even further and scale 10x from here over the next few years. We remain impressed by the team&#8217;s vision and execution, and are delighted to deepen our partnership with CARS24.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nigerian mobility tech startup Metro Africa Xpress Inc. (<a href="https://www.max.ng/">MAX</a>) is planning to enter more markets across Africa as it races towards formalizing the continent’s transportation sector after securing $31 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>The startup told TechCrunch that it will use the funding to enter Ghana and Egypt by the end of the first quarter of 2022, and other additional markets in Francophone, East and Southern Africa by the close of the same year. The funds will also be used to extend vehicle financing credit to over 100,000 drivers in the next two years.</p>
<p>MAX started out in 2015 as a delivery startup using motorcycles to fulfil customer orders before venturing into ride-hailing, and later into vehicle subscription and financing services – solutions it came up with based on the data from its first services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249693" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup introduced vehicle financing in 2018, and in just over two years, CFO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gbnjoya_bolt-partners-with-max-to-enable-vehicle-activity-6869219827521740800-HD1v/">Guy-Bertrand Njoya</a> told TechCrunch, the churn rate by drivers affiliated to them has crashed to “close to zero.”</p>
<p>“We spent time understanding drivers&#8217; operations and it became apparent to us that most of them don&#8217;t own the vehicles they use,” said Njoya.</p>
<p>“It became clear that the fundamental issue that drivers face is consistent access to vehicles. And that is when we realized that if we are to be successful at solving the challenge of mobility across the continent, we have to first address the issue of vehicle access.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1846045" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1846045" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1846045 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="700" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg?resize=680,476 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MAX.NG-Motorcycle-photo.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1846045" class="wp-caption-text">MAX currently designs and assembles its own line of electric motorcycles. <strong><em>Photo Credits</em></strong>: MAX.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MAX’s commercial bank partners now extend vehicle purchase loans to drivers, using data provided by the mobility company in credit risk assessment.</p>
<p>As part of its catalogue of services, MAX plans to build electric vehicle infrastructure in its new markets, with the intention of introducing EVs to its emerging clientele.</p>
<p>“It is another milestone in our journey to make mobility safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable by deploying high-performance technologies and operators. The investment will enable us to transform the lives of hundreds of thousands of drivers across the continent, accelerate international expansion, and continue our pioneering initiatives in the mobility space,” said MAX co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adetayobamiduro/?originalSubdomain=ng">Adetayo Bamiduro</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chineduazodoh/">Chinedu Azodoh</a> is the startup&#8217;s other co-founder.</p>
<p>Providing solutions to challenges around mobility has been at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/max-ng-raises-7m-round-backed-by-yamaha-and-pilots-evs-in-nigeria/">centre of MAX’s operations</a> such that the next puzzle it wanted to solve is that of growing driver earnings by reducing their operating costs.</p>
<p>The founders quickly realized that introducing electric vehicles would be the natural next step, and in 2019 MAX kickstarted their electric mobility journey. The company currently provides two, three and four-wheeler EVs to drivers through various leasing and financing options.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s an additional option that we wanted to provide to the drivers because what they care most about is making a decent living through increased income. For us, electric mobility is going to be a significant driver of that objective because EVs are today more cost-effective than their gas equivalents,” said Njoya.</p>
<p>MAX currently designs and assembles its own line of electric motorcycles. Njoya said they work with partners across the ecosystem, including Yamaha, a leading motorcycle manufacturer, to deliver their EVs.</p>
<p>“We work with Yamaha in the area of access to vehicles for the drivers, and in the access to finance. As a testament of the success of our work and partnership, Yamaha today has set up a dedicated driver vehicle financing entity for Africa against the backdrop of the work that we&#8217;ve been doing with them over the past couple of years,” said Njoya.</p>
<p>The latest funding round that was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock, which is making its first investment in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/didi-chuxing-expands-to-south-africa-to-take-on-bolt-and-uber/">African mobility space</a>. The UAE-based international venture capital firm, Global Ventures, also took part in the round, as did existing investors Novastar Ventures, and Proparco, the French development finance institution, through their Digital Africa initiative.</p>
<p>Njoya said the startup is working towards becoming the go-to vehicle subscription and financial services platform for millions of transport operators across the continent. They recently partnered with Estonian ride-hailing company Bolt in a lease-to-own arrangement that is set to enable 10,000 drivers under the platform in Nigeria acquire energy-efficient vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Razorpay has more than doubled its valuation to $7.5 billion from $3 billion in April as one of India’s largest fintech giants demonstrates fast growth and aggressively broadens its product offerings.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-headquartered startup, which is a market leader in payments processing in India, said Sunday evening it has raised $375 million in its Series F financing round. The new round, which brings more capital to the startup than all its other previous financings put together, was co-led by Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital and TCV.</p>
<p>Existing investors Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, GIC and Y Combinator also participated in the new round, said Razorpay, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/18/razorpay-160-million-raise-valuation-hits-3-billion/">raised over $740 million over the past seven years</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249675" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://razorpay.com">Razorpay</a> accepts, processes for – and disburses money to – small businesses and enterprises. It also operates a neobanking platform, through which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/razorpay-credit-card-current-account-neo-bank/">offers credit cards and working capital to businesses</a>. It also offers an international payments gateway that supports over 90 currencies.</p>
<p>Some of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/razorpay-100-million-billion-valuation-unicorn/">other offerings</a> include helping businesses with collating tax and compliance disbursements, generating payment links that can be shared via email or through instant messaging services, subscription plans with automated recurring transactions on various payment modes, and automatic reconciliation of incoming transactions using virtual accounts and UPI IDs.</p>
<p>The startup &#8212; whose offerings are similar to those of Stripe, the global payments giant that has little to no presence in India &#8212; has also entered a few nations in Southeast Asia in recent years.</p>
<p>Razorpay, which processes $60 billion in transactions annually (up from $5 billion in 2019), says it has amassed over 8 million businesses including Facebook, Swiggy, Cred, National Pension System, Indian Oil among its customers. Of the 42 startups that have become unicorns in India this year, 34 of them use Razorpay.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our payments business continues to keep getting stronger. In the last one and a half years, we have also been able to prove our thesis on neobanking and lending,” said Harshil Mathur, co-founder and chief executive of Razorpay, in an interview with TechCrunch this week.</p>
<p>“We want to ensure that when you start a company, and sign up with Razorpay, we do everything for you on the financial side – from opening a bank account to building payments and disbursals and salary payouts. You don’t have to step out and use multiple tools,” he added. As these businesses grow, Razorpay grows with them, he said.</p>
<p>Mathur and Shashank Kumar (co-founder of Razorpay) — pictured above — met at IIT Roorkee college. At the time, small businesses in India faced a myriad of challenges in accepting money digitally and existing payment processing firms weren’t focused on catering the needs of them.</p>
<p>At a $7.5 billion valuation, up from just a little over $1 billion last year, Razorpay is now one of India’s most valuable fintech startups. But getting to this stage hasn’t been easy.</p>
<p>The co-founders struggled to convince bankers to work with them in the initial years of the startup. The conversations were slow and the co-founders felt helpless explaining the same challenges to investors numerous times, they recalled in an earlier interview.</p>
<p>“Over the last seven years, we’ve tirelessly worked towards making Razorpay a technology and product company which is people-first. If there is one thing the Razorpay team has committed to doing since 2014, it is to never stop reinventing,” said Kumar.</p>
<p>The startup plans to continue to focus on expanding its product offerings and also hire over 600 people to fuel its growth in India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>But Razorpay, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/india-razorpay-launches-faster-checkout-feature-tops-60-billion-tpv/">introduced a feature that saves shoppers’ information</a> — password, card details, addresses — during their first purchase and prefills those when they transact with the same business or any other that also uses Razorpay to process its payments, is not looking to offer a consumer-focused neobanking service, Mathur said.</p>
<p>“We might do some consumer-focused stuff, but we want to stay away from pure consumer offerings for two reasons. We don’t see any huge value add that we can bring that other players in that ecosystem aren’t already offering, and also we don’t see anything significant that we can gain by entering that business,” he said.</p>
<p>Razorpay is also gearing up to become IPO-ready, he said, but noted that the startup won’t be exploring the public markets for at least two and a half years.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the leading online payments player in the rapidly accelerating Indian digital payments market, Razorpay has continued to innovate and blaze new trails,” said Deepak Ravichandran, General Partner at Alkeon Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>“With a broad set of products across payments, banking, and software that provide a seamless end-to-end experience for merchants (who have been historically underserved by legacy payment providers) and geographic expansion on the horizon, we are thrilled to be partnering with Harshil, Shashank and his team who have continued to execute on their vision. We could not be more excited for the journey ahead.”</p>

<p>As the information domain becomes an increasingly active and consequential realm of state competition, two countries have gone all in. Both China and Russia have developed sophisticated information strategies to advance their geopolitical interests, and their playbooks are evolving. No longer primarily relying on proxy troll farms to generate large quantities of polarizing content, the Kremlin has turned to military intelligence assets to carry out more targeted information operations designed to circumvent platform-detection mechanisms. And motivated by concern that it might be blamed for a pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than five million people worldwide, Beijing has become considerably less risk-averse in its use of “<a href="https://www.vox.com/22167626/china-wolf-warrior-twitter-online-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wolf warrior</a>” diplomats to push conspiracy theories online. To sustain its vision of a free and open internet, Washington must develop a <a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/linking-values-and-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategy</a> to push back.</p>
<h2>Moscow’s information manipulation playbook is evolving</h2>
<p>Russia, a declining power by many measures, seeks to compensate for its relative weakness through asymmetric means, by disrupting the institutions, alliances and domestic politics of its neighbors and geopolitical competitors in the near term. With little to lose and much to gain from public awareness of its activities, the Kremlin is <a href="https://theasanforum.org/the-interference-operations-from-putins-kremlin-and-xis-communist-party-forging-a-joint-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not particularly sensitive to attribution or concerned about repercussions</a>. And so, in order to keep the transatlantic community distracted, divided and unable to carry out a confident, coordinated foreign policy that could be detrimental to its interests, the Kremlin uses disinformation to stoke chaos and promote disorder.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248877" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

First, it regularly co-opts domestic voices and institutions within target societies in order to cast information operations as authentic advocacy, often by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/world/africa/russia-madagascar-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiding</a> trolls within a target population, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/world/europe/ukraine-russia-election-tampering-propaganda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renting</a> the social media accounts of local citizens or recruiting real activists to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/08/02/moment-when-facebooks-removal-alleged-russian-disinformation-became-free-speech-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stoke protests</a>. It does so partly to evade increasingly sophisticated platform-detection mechanisms and partly to exacerbate the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/how-the-kremlin-has-weaponized-the-facebook-files/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politicization of content moderation debates</a> within the United States.</p>
<p>Second, the Kremlin‘s disinformers recognize that they do not need to perpetuate an operation at scale in order to create the impression that they or others have, and that the impression alone is enough to sow doubt about the legitimacy of election results and exacerbate partisan discord. Moscow can thus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/us/politics/2020-election-hacking.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leverage</a> widespread concern about the potential for manipulation, particularly in an election context, to achieve its goals by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/russian-troll-farm-set-elaborate-social-media-trap-midterms-no-n933781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming</a> that manipulation <em>has</em> happened — even in the absence of a successful operation.</p>
<h2>Beijing is taking a page from Moscow’s playbook — and writing some of its own plays</h2>
<p>China, meanwhile, is a <a href="https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.gwu.edu/dist/1/2181/files/2019/03/Brandt_TWQ_44-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising power</a> with little to gain and much to lose from public awareness of its interference activities. Unlike Russia, it prefers a stable international order, but one that is more conducive to its interests than the current U.S.-led framework. As a result, its activities in the information domain are primarily geared toward promoting China’s image as a responsible global superpower and stifling criticism that would tarnish its prestige, while denting the appeal of democracy by casting the United States and its partners as ineffective and hypocritical.</p>
<p>For Beijing, pursuing these interests has entailed a three-pronged <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/how-chinas-wolf-warrior-diplomats-use-and-abuse-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategy</a> of piggybacking on the propaganda networks of other strongmen, manufacturing the appearance of popular support and co-opting conversations on its rights record. Lacking an influencer network of its own, China <a href="https://www.axios.com/grayzone-max-blumenthal-china-xinjiang-d95789af-263c-4049-ba66-5baedd087df4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regularly</a> relies on the constellation of alternative <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1197106045400895489" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thinkers</a>, many of them Western, that are a fixture of Russian propaganda. Highlighting the difficulty of generating support for pro-China positions on a platform Beijing has banned at home, China’s wolf warrior diplomats <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-publications/reply-all-inauthenticity-and-coordinated-replying-in-pro-chinese-communist-party-twitter-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regularly engage</a> with false personas on Twitter. And in order to push back on criticisms of its rights record, it attempts to co-opt discussions on the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang using <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/how-chinas-wolf-warrior-diplomats-use-and-abuse-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hashtag</a> campaigns and slick <a href="https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1310953195808731138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videos</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Autocrats align — but only sometimes</h2>
<p>Despite important differences in their long-term goals, Moscow and Beijing share multiple immediate objectives: denting the global prestige of democracy, weakening multilateral institutions and undermining democratic alliances. As a result, the two countries deploy several of the same tactics.</p>
<p>Both use “whataboutism” to paint the United States as hypocritical, particularly on issues of race. Both use clickbait content to generate large followings on Twitter, recognizing that an audience is a strategic asset. Both regularly traffic in multiple, often conflicting, conspiracy theories to cast doubt on official accounts of political events, evade blame for their activities and create the impression that there is no such thing as objective reality. Both operate extensive propaganda apparatuses that spread their preferred narratives.</p>
<p>They also deploy many of the same narratives. Both countries have worked to diminish confidence in the <a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/russia-china-iran-covid-vaccine-disinformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safety record</a> of certain Western COVID-19 vaccines and portray the United States and its allies as ineffective. That said, Russia is primarily focused on pushing divisive content that deepens polarization and diminishes trust in institutions and elites, all while pushing back on what it characterizes as anti-Russian bias in established media. China, for its part, is primarily interested in <a href="https://www.power3point0.org/2020/04/02/beijings-viral-disinformation-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighting</a> the <a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ASD-ASIA-EU-China-Coronavirus-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefits</a> of its governance model, while painting critiques of its rights abuses as hypocritical. Kremlin state media almost never cover Russian domestic politics. Moscow’s goal is to drive audiences away from the political West, not pull them toward Russia. For China, the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Much has been <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-05-03/china-and-russias-dangerous-convergence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made</a> about the state of cooperation between Russia and China in various domains of their respective competitions with the United States. Evidence suggests there is very little formal coordination of their information activities beyond largely symbolic <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d774e7851544d7a457a6333566d54/share.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreements</a> to distribute one another’s content. That is not entirely a surprise. Beijing doesn&#8217;t need to formally cooperate with Moscow in order to amplify Kremlin-promoted narratives or to emulate other successful elements of the Kremlin’s information strategy.</p>
<h2>What’s to come</h2>
<p>Both Russian and Chinese information strategies are <a href="https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.gwu.edu/dist/1/2181/files/2019/03/Brandt_TWQ_44-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolving</a>. Russia’s disinformation activities are becoming more targeted and harder to detect, while China is taking a more assertive, less subtle approach than before. For Russia, these changes appear to be driven by growing awareness of its activities since 2016, which simultaneously prompted the implementation of new platform policies and detection mechanisms and ushered in an era of partisan debates over election legitimacy that reverberate today. For China, changes to its information strategy seem to be primarily motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a global crisis of unique salience to its geopolitical standing that will continue to create opportunities for Beijing to test new approaches.</p>
<p>Recognizing these consequential changes to the way Russia and China approach the information domain, the United States needs a playbook of its own. A robust <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/08/02/how-democracies-can-win-information-contest-without-undercutting-their-values-pub-85058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategy</a> would include harnessing truthful information to highlight the failures of repressive rule, <a href="https://www.progressivecentre.uk/avoiding_the_trap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deploying</a> American cyber capabilities to prevent or impose costs on those who would conduct destabilizing disinformation campaigns and implementing legislation that would make platform transparency, particularly with trusted researchers, the norm. Finally, because it is good for democratic societies and creates challenges for their authoritarian competitors, the United States should more forcefully defend freedom of information worldwide.</p>
<p>In the consequential contest between democratic and authoritarian societies, autocrats have seized the initiative. This collection of measures represents a starting point for bold and responsible action to ensure that the United States regains it. To succeed, the U.S. and its democratic partners must act quickly.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden issued an executive order in July &#8220;promoting competition&#8221; in the U.S. economy. The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">order</a> calls out Big Tech specifically, stating that “today a small number of dominant Internet platforms use their power to exclude market entrants, to extract monopoly profits, and to gather intimate personal information that they can exploit for their own advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November, the U.S. Senate <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-senate-bill-would-limit-big-tech-mergers-2021-11-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> a bill targeting anti-competitive acquisitions among tech companies. There has not been a meaningful monopolization case in the United States for 20 years, but this recent momentum suggests that the current administration would like to make one stick.</p>
<p>To date, there is still too much gray area in the rules and ambivalence among citizens to enforce antitrust law, but with a few changes to the approach, good intentions may lead to new policy, penalties and even prosecution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248994" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the last century, antitrust regulation lost its teeth and its broader goals have been abandoned for a nebulous standard around “consumer welfare.&#8221; The acid test for antitrust established during the 1980s reduced everything to whether alleged antitrust actions resulted in higher consumer prices.</p>
<p>This attempt to distill antitrust into a single test of economic consequence has proven to be overly simplistic. Defenders of this singular consumer-price-based approach to antitrust evaluation cite falling prices in technology as indisputable evidence of prevailing fair competition.</p>
<p>Breaking up tech monopolies will not be easy, but it can be done with a three-pronged approach: blocking anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions, constituting data as market power to rewrite policy and driving public interest in the topic so that citizens can elect concerned antitrust policymakers.</p>
<h2>Killer M&amp;As</h2>
<p>In an era of easy money, with protracted periods of very loose monetary policy and highly inflated stock prices, buying off future competitors at inflated values is now part of the business playbook.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Examples abound in the tech world, and Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp are incontrovertible examples. Excessive regulation does kill innovation, but free markets depend on regulation to remain fair and free.</p>
<p>Current law stipulates that any deal valued at or above $92 million must be reported to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice for review, with few exceptions.</p>
<p>Given one of the stated intents of the Biden order is increased scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions, consumers may see more legal action taken by the government to block deals that &#8220;substantially lessen competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proposed bill that would block certain acquisitions is a good sign of recognition by both sides of the aisle that there is abuse, but the bar for offenders remains high, especially when the monopolization of data isn&#8217;t widely considered anti-competitive. The FTC and the DOJ will need to exercise their ability to enforce antitrust law against Big Tech, which it can better do with this new legislation.</p>
<h2>Data = money = market power</h2>
<p>Offering free products has turned out to be a surreptitious strategy for some tech giants to accumulate other assets — notably, personal information on their unwitting “free” customers — that has not just fed them inordinate profit streams in the multiple billions but also made these companies monopolists of exactly those assets. Search engine marketing and social media advertising were built exactly this way. Such digital assets are now rented out to all other companies as a tax on their marketing budgets — an overt example of market power.</p>
<p>We have unprecedented concentration in most industries, and companies in industries with rising concentration are actually investing less because they can more readily exercise their market power.</p>
<p>However, when the weather turns inclement, the fair-weather friends of self-correcting markets will readily change teams and support extraordinary market interventions, like the multiple actions taken by the Federal Reserve amid the pandemic to unabashedly prop up markets.</p>
<p>Welcomed in the Biden executive order is the encouragement to the FTC to establish new rules on online surveillance and the accumulation of users’ data. Our monopolist tech giants have framed the rules of this game for far too long already, indulging gullible legislators in laughable oaths of self-regulation.</p>
<p>Until mass collection and control of data are properly categorized as market power, the levers of justice will continue to favor Big Tech, not the consumer. New policy and law, in this case, will materialize only when public outcry forces legislators&#8217; hands.</p>
<h2>Changing the public narrative</h2>
<p>Consumers and citizens are largely those most affected by lax antitrust enforcement and loose policy. Whether by forfeiting personal data, overpaying for services or not being able to choose among products, monopolies violate consumers&#8217; welfare in one way or another. But is there anything they can do?</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s executive order is the direct result of increased public pressure around antitrust in this country. The same is true of the new Senate bill. Increasingly, private businesses are filing their suits against monopolies in state courts, filled with elected officials.</p>
<p>It may sound ridiculous now, but antitrust could become a leading topic on which politicians must stump. Meaningful antitrust policy reform will come from reformers, elected by the body politic, which is why voting for candidates based on their views of antitrust enforcement will be critical to changing the status quo.</p>
<p>We need stronger antitrust and privacy regulation now. The privacy and well-being of our citizens are at stake. Antitrust, like charity, must begin at home.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>As we entered 2021, I wrote about the big question on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/02/the-mad-rush-to-end-friction-in-2021/"> every startup’s mind for 2021:</a> How will a cataclysmic event such as a pandemic show up in post-pandemic innovation? Well, spoiler alert: We’re nearing the end of yet another pandemic year, and it seems like this state will be our world for longer than I’d like to predict. In other words, my question didn’t age well, and today, I’d like to pose a new one.</p>
<p>My question heading into 2022 is: How can the tech community sneak activation energy into startups, especially those built by historically overlooked founders, beyond capital? I’m not talking about hype machines or weekly luncheons on specific topics, I’m talking about more elusive services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249363" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In this cash-rich environment, I think entrepreneurs need more human resources than ever before when it comes to building their company. Don’t get me wrong, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/female-founders-are-making-a-buzzing-venture-backed-comeback/">the gender gap in fundraising</a> continues to be a blaring, embarrassing issue that venture needs to fix. But as we spotlight the need to get more checks to more founders, we also need to figure out how to keep those same founders in an increasingly competitive environment. After all, venture doesn’t fix all things — and in fact, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/the-inherent-tensions-within-venture-capital/">can even complicate the growth of a startup. </a></p>
<p>Activation energy can look different every day. This week, for example, I wrote about Z Fellows, an accelerator that pays people $10,000 to take a week-long break from their day job and flirt with finally building their startup idea.</p>
<p>The average age for a Z Fellow is 20 to 25 years old, meaning that the program has successfully convinced first-time founders to take a jump. Founder Cory Levy attributes interest to the program’s pre-requisite: You only have to take one week off from work.</p>
<p>“The best programs out there, whether that’s Y Combinator or the Thiel Fellowship, require this high commitment, big life decisions,” whether it’s dropping out of school or going full-time on an idea, Levy said. “Don’t do that; just kind of simulate what life would be like for a couple of days or a week: If you like it, great, if you don’t, no harm no foul.”</p>
<p>While Levy shows the importance of time, I think we’ll also see a growing importance for founders to lean on community and mental health support. For my full take on this topic, check out my TechCrunch+ column: More than another check, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/18/more-than-another-check-founders-need-activation-energy/">founders need activation energy. </a></p>

<p>It was an exhausting year, but it was one punctuated by a lot of learning (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/11/what-i-unlearned-about-startups-this-year/">and unlearning</a>) that will continue to shape how ideas turn into companies and realizations turn into thoughtful stories. That said, I’m excited to take a break so you won’t hear from Startups Weekly until the first full week of January.</p>

<h2>Company culture and trying to not be the &#8220;fool in the room&#8221;</h2>

<p>Mobility reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/rebeccabellan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebecca Bellan</a> recently published a nuanced interview with Ample co-founder John de Souza, who was born and raised in Ethiopia. The serial founder is building an electric vehicle battery swapping company, and as Bellan notes, the odds are against him thanks to a well-capitalized competitor. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/amples-john-de-souza-on-the-merits-of-b2b-company-culture-and-investors-who-get-it/">The entire interview is worth a read</a>, but I resonated most with his notes on culture, which is apparently a big focus for him even in the heart of a red hot sector.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: “</strong>The issue with growing companies, especially in the Valley, is that you have high turnover, and so trying to grow the company while you’re losing is really hard. If you can stem the people leaving you can grow the company very efficiently, and so we realize the way to keep people is not just to pay them to stay, but to create company culture,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/amples-john-de-souza-on-the-merits-of-b2b-company-culture-and-investors-who-get-it/">said de Souza.</a> This line stood out because it underscores what I think will be a massive conversation in 2022: internal communications at a company, and how the great resignation changed what employees want from their companies.</p>

<p>Notus! The early-stage startup wants to help other companies identify the best journalists and influencers to work with, based on a deep scan of the social web. They even used their own algorithm to target me for their funding round announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know</strong>: The startup confirmed that Alexis Ohanian’s 776 recently led a $1.25 million round, with participation of angels from Glossier and Tesla. Ohanian pointed out that “as the internet unbundled media, influence fragmented,” which, I’d argue, makes it harder than ever for a brand to reach and truly understand their audience. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/you-are-the-most-influential-person-we-know/">In our latest Equity podcast,</a> Alex, Mary Ann I spoke about Notus’ limitations despite the opportunity going forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">latest</a> year-end <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>. App Annie said global spending across iOS and Google Play is up to $135 billion in 2021, and that figure will likely be higher when its annual report, including third-party app stores in China, is released next year. Consumers also downloaded 10 billion more apps this year than in 2020, reaching nearly 140 billion in new installs, it found.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that was up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247883" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place, with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>Apple&#8217;s App Privacy Report is here</h3>
<p>Apps have been accused of quietly snooping on their users for some time. They collect data and reshare it with advertisers and other third parties, often without users&#8217; truly informed consent. Now the tables are turned in a sense, as users will finally be able to snoop on their apps, thanks to Apple&#8217;s new App Privacy Report feature, now available in iOS 15.2 and iPadOS 15.2. This app transparency feature lets an iOS user see what their apps are actually doing &#8212; including which apps are accessing the data and the sensors on your phone, as well as where that data is being shared. The latter is revealed through the feature&#8217;s ability to report with which third-party websites an app is communicating. Some of those may be for analytics purposes, but others may be adtech sites.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249412" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249412" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2249412" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios15-iphone13-pro-settings-privacy-app-privacy-report.png?w=336" alt="" width="336" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios15-iphone13-pro-settings-privacy-app-privacy-report.png 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios15-iphone13-pro-settings-privacy-app-privacy-report.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios15-iphone13-pro-settings-privacy-app-privacy-report.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios15-iphone13-pro-settings-privacy-app-privacy-report.png?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios15-iphone13-pro-settings-privacy-app-privacy-report.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249412" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To use the feature, you&#8217;ll head to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; App Privacy Report then switch it on. Over time, you&#8217;ll be able to see how apps accessed your data over the past seven days, complete with timestamps for its every action. While Apple should be applauded for making this information more transparent, there&#8217;s some concern that the report will leave users feeling less empowered, rather than more empowered. Sure, a favorite app may be contacting some odd-sounding domain, but what data exactly was shared? Would the user be okay with that data sharing if it were explained? If they&#8217;re not okay with it, what are they supposed to do to stop it, other than just uninstalling the app?</p>
<p>Apple seems to be betting on the fact that simply making this information public could push the app industry toward better behavior that&#8217;s more respectful of user privacy. But just like most users never read those long user agreements when installing software in the first place, it&#8217;s not clear to what extent this new feature will be adopted by mainstream users.</p>

<p>Google this week <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-android-12-go-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offered more details</a> about the new features and updates that will be available when the first devices running Android 12 (Go Edition) are launched in 2022. Designed for low-end smartphones, apps on Go Edition will launch up to 30% faster and with smoother animation, Google says &#8212; that means they&#8217;ll open instantly, instead of presenting users with a blank screen. The new SplashScreen API will help Android developers provide this consistently smooth experience when their users launch their apps.</p>
<p>The updated OS will also automatically save battery life and storage by hibernating apps that haven&#8217;t been used for extended periods of time. The Files Go app, meanwhile, allows users to recover files within 30 days so users can safely delete files when they need to free up space.</p>
<p>Other new features include guest profiles on the lock screen; offline sharing with nearby devices via Nearby Share; a privacy dashboard that shows app activity, permissions and access to sensors; a privacy indicator that alerts you when apps are using your mic or camera; the ability to select approximate location instead of precise location when sharing your information with apps; plus the ability to listen to the news, and translate on-screen content into your language from the screen where you find your recent apps.</p>
<p>Some of the new features were brought over from the main Android 12 OS to Go Edition, while others were designed for the needs of low-end smartphone users &#8212; a large market. Google says more than 200 million people actively use an Android (Go Edition) phone.</p>

<li><strong>Despite its troubles, Instagram has now surpassed 2 billion MAUs worldwide,</strong> according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/instagram-surpasses-2-billion-monthly-users.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report by CNBC</a> citing unnamed Meta employees as sources. The news (which smells a bit like a planned leak if we&#8217;re being honest) paints a picture of a company unaffected by the recent congressional scrutiny and whistleblowing. It&#8217;s like a quiet nod to Wall Street that while, &#8220;<em>sure</em>, <em>there are some bad things being said here, we&#8217;re still doing okay!</em>&#8221; Instagram passed the 1 billion user mark in June 2018 after eight years, but only took three years to hit 2 billion users, the report also noted. That&#8217;s growth that&#8217;s hard to ignore. It&#8217;s also notable given TikTok&#8217;s quick rise to the top of the charts, as it&#8217;s an indication that users aren&#8217;t necessarily abandoning one app for the other &#8212; Instagram is still retaining users and growing.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter adds an auto-captions feature to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/twitter-adds-auto-captions-feature-to-make-videos-more-accessible/">make videos more accessible</a></strong> on its platform. Captions have also become a popular way to watch videos without sound, and are common to TikTok-like feeds &#8212; such as the one Twitter is now testing.</li>
<li><strong>Rotten Tomatoes is the latest company to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/rotten-tomatoes-partners-with-tiktok-to-allow-users-to-link-to-ratings-reviews-and-more/">partner with TikTok on TikTok Jump</a></strong>, the third-party integration feature that allows creators to link out to other services &#8212; in this case, movie and TV trailers, reviews and other information. Previous TikTok Jump partners include Quizlet, Wikipedia, BuzzFeed and Jumprope.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft-owned career networking site LinkedIn <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/december/linkedin-s-new-app-to-help-professionals-in-china-find-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a new app in China</a> </strong>just months after sunsetting the local version of LinkedIn in the region. The <a href="https://mobile.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new app</a>, InCareer, is aimed at helping Chinese mainland professionals find jobs and companies locate great talent in China.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok said it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/tiktok-to-diversify-its-for-you-feed-let-users-pick-the-topics-they-want-to-avoid/">going to change its algorithm</a> to make sure people aren&#8217;t overconsuming harmful content</strong> &#8212; like things that could lead to eating disorders or depression. The changes come about after social companies, TikTok included, have been hauled in front of lawmakers to defend their apps&#8217; track record on user safety.</li>

<h3><strong>Government &amp; Policy</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>U.K. antitrust regulators said they&#8217;ve &#8220;provisionally&#8221; found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/cma-mobile-ecosystem-market-study/">in a market study</a> that Apple and Google have been able to leverage their market power for years</strong> to create &#8220;largely self-contained ecosystems.&#8221; The findings indicate the U.K. will likely take antitrust action against the tech giants.</li>
<li><strong>Poland <a href="https://www.imore.com/poland-opens-investigation-apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> an investigation into Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature.</strong> Poland&#8217;s Office of Competition and Consumer Protection is working to determine if Apple is trying to eliminate competitors in the personalized ads market in order to promote Apple&#8217;s own Apple Search Ads business, &#8220;in violation of competition principles.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Grindr <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/grindr-final-gdpr-fine/">was fined</a> ~$7.1 million (65 million NOK) by Norway’s data protection authority</strong> for passing its user data to advertisers without consent — including private info related to users’ sexual orientation.

<h3><strong>Security &amp; Privacy</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/apple-releases-tracker-detect-android-app-to-help-users-discover-unknown-nearby-airtags/">released a new app for Android users</a> called &#8220;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tracker Detect</a>,&#8221; </strong>which allows Android device owners to scan for unknown AirTags nearby. The app will identify trackers that are separated from their owner and are compatible with Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Find My&#8221; network, which also includes the Chipolo ONE Spot tracker.</li>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/apple-removes-csam-detection-website/">pulled references to its CSAM detection tech</a> from its website after privacy fears.</strong> The tech was meant to automate the detection and reporting of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to law enforcement. But privacy experts were concerned the system could be abused by authoritative governments who used the system to implicate innocent people for other things besides CSAM. Apple had already said it would delay the system&#8217;s rollout in order to collect further input. Whether the removed from the web means the feature is being dropped entirely, however, is unclear.</li>

The app also includes inline code suggestions, tools to move projects from Xcode and back, project-wide search results, a Snippets Library with hundreds of SwiftUI controls, symbols and colors, and more.  A new open project format based on Swift packages can also be opened and edited in Swift Playgrounds for iPad, as well as within Xcode on Mac, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=v868vy6e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple noted.</a></p>

<p>Adobe this week launched a new web and mobile app &#8212; and Canva rival &#8212; called <a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Cloud Express</a> that combines features from its Creative Cloud Suite and Acrobat PDF tools into a single application. The app, which replaces Adobe Spark, aims to help users quickly create anything &#8212; like  social media posts, posters, videos and more using templates, stock images and other assets. The app will offer a free tier and a $9.99 per month version with additional capabilities and an expanded library of more complex templates. Free users can access 1 million images and other assets, while premium users get access to 175 million Adobe Stock photos, 20,000 fonts and access to Photoshop Express and Premiere Rush.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch’s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them. Looking for our other guides? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2021/">Find them here!</a></em></p>
<p>2021 was largely defined by <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2021/10/19/1047032996/why-are-so-many-americans-quitting-their-jobs">the great resignation</a>, in which tens of millions of people left their jobs in pursuit of other opportunities. A sliver of those folks made their next career move into a personal one: betting on themselves by going solo. As a result, we have seen the rise of solopreneurs, either as a business owner, investor, or even a journalist choosing to start their own publication, traditional newsroom be damned!</p>
<p>Betting on yourself is an ambitious yet lonely process, so I surveyed a handful of solopreneurs to see what their gift wish lists look like this holiday season. We set no restrictions, so we weren&#8217;t sure what to expect — but what we got was a fun, thoughtful, and eclectic list of ideas; some focusing on productivity, others on comfort, and others on self-care. If there&#8217;s a running thread between them, it&#8217;s this: if you&#8217;re setting out to do things yourself, <em>take care of yourself.</em></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244419" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>As the appeal of remote work goes from a question mark to a definitive statement, everyone is re-thinking their monitor game. Newton, who publishes <a href="https://www.platformer.news">a daily guide</a> for understanding the social networks built by behemoths and challenged by startups, is eyeing a curved monitor. Why constantly switch from window to window when you can have one mega panoramic view of everything?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than her impressive commitment to hydration, Gay said that this water bottle is her favorite because it&#8217;s light, plastic and comes in a ton of colors. &#8220;Plus,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you’re a FREAK like me who uses an app to keep track of how many liters of water you drink per day, 1 bottle = 1 liter. You’re WELCOME!,&#8221; she said. </span></p>

<p>Finally, our first snack wishlist item! Gay picked the Purely Elizabeth Grain-free Granola, which, she notes, is on the healthier end of sugar-packed options on the market right now. She says she looks forward to it everyday, which seems far more put together than my daily ice cream sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://purelyelizabeth.com/products/coconut-cashew">$7 from Purely Elizabeth</a></p>

<p>For balance &#8211; haha &#8211; we are ending her section with a yoga mat from Alo. The company claims that it&#8217;s 100% formaldehyde-free, non-toxic and PVC-free, as well as dry-wicking and slip free. <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This yoga mat is perfect (unless you have to take it places, and then it’s &#8216;perfect but quite heavy&#8217;),&#8221; she said. &#8220;It’s beautiful, most importantly, it’s thick enough for some at-home tabletop, and squishy enough for a lengthy savasana.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.aloyoga.com/products/w7192r-warrior-mat-powder-pink">$100 from Alo</a></p>

<p>A key to avoiding burnout, as my friends like to remind me, is to indulge in relaxation so you can show up for yourself and your team with fresh energy. That&#8217;s the vibe of this stillness bathtub, which sounds as zen as I imagine it feels. The bathtub combines water, steam, lighting, and aroma to promote &#8220;the luxury of pause.&#8221; Sign me up, especially after a year like 2021.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is better than a rower that works almost as a game system?&#8221; said Conwell. Well, I don&#8217;t have a witty retort to that, but am definitely interested in rowing away from Zombies, and, as the VC says, mixing competition with low-impact workouts.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong><a href="https://avironactive.com/"> Ranges from $2,199 to $2,499 from Aviron</a></p>

<p>Foamy lattes and plant-based milk may not seem like they go together too well, but GoodMylk is aiming to change that. Conwell is an investor in what he claims is the &#8220;healthiest alternative milk on the market.&#8221; Shipped concentrated, GoodMylk helps people who like the taste of homemade hemp, almond and oat milk recreate the product without the hassle of a cheese cloth. Put differently, the founder Brooke Rewa discovered a proprietary flash-blast freezing technique that helps you make alternative milk, fast.</p>

<p>Other than the Apple Watch, Oura rings may be the most popular wearable among techies. Users receive three daily scores, one to measure how well they slept last night, one that tracks fitness activity, and finally one that tells you your readiness to take on the day. All three matter when it comes to balancing the demands of work, live and the growing overlap between the two, so if you&#8217;re into numbers and tracking the Oura ring could be for you. It also offers at-home sizing so don&#8217;t worry about losing it when you&#8217;re washing the dishes. Or do, because I still would find a way.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong><a href="https://ouraring.com/product/heritage-silver"> Starts at $299 from Oura Ring</a></p>

<p>Proof sells old-fashioned, small-batch cocktail syrup in flavors such as pecan, citrus sour and maple bacon. While I&#8217;m not entirely sure about the last one, the syrups sound like a festive way to liven up your own bar cart or at least subtweet at your friends lack-thereof.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong><a href="https://proofsyrup.com/collections/all-syrups?sort_by=price-ascending#MainContent"> $33 from Proof</a></p>

<p>&#8220;There is something about being near water that is extremely soothing and motivating for me,&#8221; Burney said. &#8220;I am originally from Florida and live in Atlanta where there are no beaches so I yearn to be near water as often as possible for self-care, and for rejuvenation.&#8221; As people go to work from home to work from anywhere, I totally resonate with this type of wishlist item; it&#8217;s harder to get Prime Delivery on it, but it seems like island time would fulfill us all in ways that a frother will not. The investor also added that she wants a spa subscription, which&#8230; might be a bit easier to gift.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Please check with your local travel agent, as this could range depending on how much you plan to indulge.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Regular girlfriend meetups</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Let&#8217;s trade some meetings for meetups that have nothing to do with our day jobs as we enter 2022. &#8220;As a solo GP, I still yearn for the company of girlfriends to just BE, no agenda,&#8221; Burney said. She makes a good point, considering that those are the easiest plans to not prioritize sometimes simply because you know your OGs will always be there for you. Well, here&#8217;s a healthy reminder that your friends may be loyal, but they also need attention.</span></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Priceless.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/realestate/empty-office-buildings-hotels.html">race to deploy 5G infrastructure</a> has unlocked a new use for the rooftops of restaurants, hotels, residential buildings, and even hospitals and churches. These rooftops are quickly becoming prime real estate targets for telecommunication leaders eager to establish 5G technology in highly populated areas.</p>
<p>In fact, next-generation wireless deployments are positioned to be one of the largest allocators of lease revenue in the United States over the next five years, creating a seismic opportunity for landlords and other business owners.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has made expanding the country’s 5G infrastructure a national priority. The $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package earmarks <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$65 billion</a> in funding to expand broadband coverage to rural and underserved communities. Despite its speed and power relative to other wireless technologies, 5G has a much shorter range, only reaching up to <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/how-far-does-5g-reach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 1,500 feet.</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248950" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			5G technology is uniquely suited to deployment on existing building rooftops because of the reduced antenna heights for the next-generation wireless network.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In addition to the major wireless communications providers, new entrants in the 5G deployment race include traditional cable companies and Big Tech firms. Together, these companies are forecasted to invest an additional <a href="https://www.accenture.com/t20170222T202102__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-43/Accenture-5G-Municipalities-Become-Smart-Cities.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$275 billion</a> to deploy their 5G macro and small-cell sites. The only effective and efficient way to deploy the sheer quantity of deployment sites required is to leverage existing buildings. In other words, the solution to the 5G race is to adopt a rooftop deployment strategy.</p>
<p>Historically, the wireless communications market has been challenging to navigate for real estate and other business owners. Wireless carriers and tower companies have in the past entered into long-term agreements that often were less than advantageous to the property owner.</p>
<p>In many communities, there’s strong opposition to building new towers and, moreover, the construction, zoning and permitting process can be time-consuming. However, 5G technology is uniquely suited to deployment on existing building rooftops because of the reduced antenna heights for the next-generation wireless network. Now, major institutional commercial real estate owners are better positioned than tower operators for carriers to achieve a faster, more efficient solution for their wireless real estate requirements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A rooftop deployment strategy presents a solution that is mutually beneficial to the 5G carrier and the property owner. Carriers achieve their objective of deploying their infrastructure as quickly as possible in heavily trafficked areas, while property owners reap the financial benefits of leasing their rooftops and monetizing their existing buildings in new ways.</p>
<p>The impact on the net operating income for real estate owners and the revenue generated over the terms of a potentially 30-year lease can be substantial, increasing their access to capital. In addition to collecting payments in return for leasing its rooftop to the carrier, landlords are also able to provide better services to tenants with high-speed broadband connectivity.</p>
<h2>What’s at stake in the 5G deployment race</h2>
<p>The deployment of 5G infrastructure is critically important for the United States to keep pace and remain competitive internationally. Certainly, 5G is about faster connectivity, increased capacity and zero latency, but it’s mostly about driving innovation that will enable a range of business services from autonomous vehicles and expansion of telehealth to efficiencies in manufacturing and agriculture and improved supply chain management.</p>
<p>With all of these benefits considered, 5G is expected to contribute over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1212243/economic-impact-of-5g-in-the-united-states-by-state/">$1.5 trillion to the U.S. GDP</a> by 2025.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has also identified 5G technology and universal broadband as an economic equalizer for rural America. According to policy statements, rural Americans are over 10 times more likely to lack access to reliable internet compared to urban residents.</p>
<p>In the recently signed infrastructure law, the president and Congress prioritized investments in rural broadband infrastructure to bridge that digital divide, expanding internet access to these underserved areas. Because of this emphasis, landlords with properties in rural areas could stand to benefit more from the expansion of 5G infrastructure.</p>
<p>The path to establishing a strong 5G network across the United States will be a long one. While it need not be a deterrent, property owners partnering with 5G providers and wireless carriers should also be informed and cognizant of the cybersecurity considerations of the technology as they house the infrastructure and offer the wireless network to their tenants.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://aon.mediaroom.com/2021-10-26-Aon-Client-Study-Risk-Management-Must-Address-Shifting-Nature-of-Business-Volatility-in-Wake-of-COVID-19-Pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aon survey</a> of more than 2,300 risk managers and other executives, cyber risk was listed as the No. 1 current and predicted future risk globally. Increased connectivity and 5G are the future, which means the cybersecurity industry must continue to innovate and expand its use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance defenses.</p>
<p>We’ve also seen the creation of organizations such as <a href="https://buildingcybersecurity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building Cyber Security</a> to help provide guidance and a framework to improve cybersecurity resiliency in the real estate sector.</p>
<p>For property owners to effectively monetize their rooftops and participate in the race to 5G, government and private industry must continue to work collaboratively on an expeditious deployment of 5G infrastructure, including timely review of 5G installation requests.</p>
<p>Additionally, more work is necessary at the state and local levels to improve the zoning and permitting process for the deployment of 5G antennas. Numerous state legislatures are already <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/mobile-5g-and-small-cell-2020-legislation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering legislation</a> to better address and develop a 5G strategy for their constituencies, which would also provide new opportunities for landlords.</p>
<p>There is more policy and technical work to be done to fuel the race to 5G, but the revenue opportunity for property owners is immediate and tangible. For restaurateurs or hoteliers rebounding from the economic slowdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, monetizing their rooftops could be the difference between shuttering their storefronts and turning a profit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As capital continues to flood the startup market, I keep thinking about the activation energy needed to not only start a company, but remain in charge of one. This type of scaling strategy looks more human than a check &#8212; after all, venture doesn’t fix all things &#8212; in fact, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/the-inherent-tensions-within-venture-capital/">can even complicate the growth of a startup. </a></p>
<p>Today, I want to talk about activation energy and the various resources it takes for founders to begin moving toward a goal: time, community and mental health.</p>
<p>Bear with me; today’s topic is a more elusive concept than helping startups with content marketing or their sales pitches, but I’d argue it is necessary to help any humans, especially those in charge of others’ livelihoods, scale themselves alongside their companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://www.southparkcommons.com/fund">South Park Commons</a> (SPC), a community of tens of engineers in San Francisco&#8217;s South Park neighborhood, came together, it mostly flew under the radar, save for a New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/02/business/tech-scene-south-park-commons-san-francisco.html">profile</a> in 2017, a year after it was formed.</p>
<p>Founded by Facebook&#8217;s first female engineer, Ruchi Sanghvi, she explained at the time that her ambition with SPC was to create tech’s answer to the Bloomsbury Set or Benjamin Franklin’s Junto club, where people could discuss their respective and shared experiences and hopefully form new ideas along the way.</p>
<p>Fast forward and SPC &#8212; which went on to raise a $55 million venture fund in 2018 to back projects born by community members &#8212; says the experiment is working. It now has 450 members in the Bay Area and across the globe. It just closed a new $150 million fund from tech luminaries, as well as institutional investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249592" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It says it also has a highly valuable portfolio. In fact, says Sanghvi, SPC&#8217;s debut fund has already returned its capital &#8212; and then some &#8212; to investors owing to Compound Labs, an open-source platform for decentralized lending whose <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/compound">tokens</a> were distributed in part to early shareholders. Sanghvi says SPC has 10 to 12 other so-called unicorns across its portfolio, too.</p>
<p>We chatted earlier today with Sanghvi and her husband and business partner, Aditya Agarwal, who was also an early engineer at Facebook before cofounding with Sanghvi a startup they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/27/dropbox-buys-cove-to-bring-former-facebookers-ruchi-sanghvi-and-aditya-agarwal-to-the-team">sold</a> to Dropbox in 2012 in a reported talent acquisition. (Sanghvi stayed two years as Dropbox&#8217;s VP of Operations; Agarwal, who joined as Dropbox&#8217;s VP of engineering, was promoted to CTO in 2016 and left in 2018, joining Sanghvi at South Park Commons.)</p>
<p>We talked at some length about the evolution of the SPC community, which began in a physical space, has largely become a highly structured virtual society during the pandemic, but that remains very focused on bringing people together in real life.</p>
<p>Indeed, Sanghvi and Agarwal believe so strongly in the power of offline interactions that in addition to their San Francisco hub, a New York location is currently in the works and they suggest that other locations could follow, including in Seattle and even Southeast Asia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for that membership, roughly 70% of SPC members are &#8220;technical,&#8221; says Sanghvi, though she adds that the other 30% are &#8220;domain experts or have operational expertise or are even academics.&#8221; That composition is very much by design. &#8220;The funny thing is that when you talk with a great entrepreneur and ask if they want to hang out with another entrepreneur, the answer is always &#8216;no,'&#8221; says Sanghvi, laughing. &#8220;They want to hang out with the expert who beat the Stanford team on some AI algorithm, so having those operational experts mixed into the community is super valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The connections lead to more than friendship and fresh ideas, seemingly. According to Agarwal, upwards of 50% of the organization&#8217;s members find their cofounders or founding employees within the community, which underscores another way that South Park Commons sees itself as distinctive. Unlike a Y Combinator, which meets with nascent teams, or VCs who keep tabs on operational execs at big companies, SPC says it&#8217;s focused on capturing people who are plainly talented and probably much in demand but who, though they&#8217;ve left their last gig, aren&#8217;t immediately sure of their next move and mostly just want a little time to figure it out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s looking to capture people whose next move is simply to freely explore ideas, squishy though it might sound. &#8220;We&#8217;re really like a learning community that helps people in the &#8216;negative one to zero phase&#8217; get to the point of being able to start a company,&#8221; says Agarwal, &#8220;and if startups come out of that process, the fund invests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other things to know: members tend to work closely inside the community for nine months before &#8220;graduating,&#8221; meaning they&#8217;ve either raised more than a million dollars for a new startup concept, have more than four full-time employees, or they&#8217;ve taken a job. (Exploring ideas doesn&#8217;t always lead to starting companies.)</p>
<p>When a community member does reach the fundraising phase, one agreement made early on is to give SPC the right of first refusal to invest. (Each member is also invited to invest in SPC funds if they like, and many take the firm up on this offer. According to Sanghvi, SPC&#8217;s new $150 million fund counts 100 members as investors.)</p>
<p>As for the shape of those investments, it&#8217;s fairly standard. Agarwal says that SPC typically invests anywhere from $700,000 to $2 million dollars for 7% to 10% of the company. He also suggests that because SPC&#8217;s network is so valuable, the venture firms that tend to make subsequent investments typically make room for SPC to maintain its percentage ownership rather than dilute it for their own shorter-term benefit.</p>
<p>Certainly, the formula appears to be working right now. In addition to Compound Labs, some of the outfits to pass through South Park Commons&#8217; corridors (physical and virtual), include <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/vitalik-buterin-announces-ethereum-scaling-roadmap-using-the-graph-protocol-202111281110">The Graph</a>, an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data that has gained the very public support of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin; Pilot, a maker of bookkeeping software that&#8217;s now backed by Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures and valued at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/jeff-bezos-backed-start-up-pilot-hits-1point2-billion-valuation-.html">$1.2 billion</a>; and Unit21, a no-code software startup that helps businesses monitor fraudulent activities and in July raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/tiger-global-leads-34m-investment-into-unit21-a-no-code-fraud-prevention-platform/">$34 million</a> in Series B funding led by Tiger Global.</p>
<p>In addition to Sanghvi and Agarwal, who are the outfit&#8217;s two general partners, SPC counts as investors Mitra Lohrasbpour, who previously led revenue analytics and international expansion efforts at Dropbox, and Finn Meeks, who previously spent two years as chief of staff for Sanghvi.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, Agarwal says that though SPC&#8217;s new fund is triple the size of its last, he doesn&#8217;t expect the team to invest any more aggressively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our emphasis is on quality over quantity,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If the quality happens quickly, that&#8217;s great, but that&#8217;s not the high-order play.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hiiii and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 17, 2021! As <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> noted in yesterday&#8217;s newsletter, I&#8217;m handling the daily recap today while he takes a much-deserved vacation/personal day. Alex is one of the most hardworking and efficient humans I&#8217;ve ever met, so I like to think that one vacation day for him is somehow the equivalent to five vacation days for anyone else.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/buskill-kill-cord-self-destruct-laptop/">The USB &#8216;kill cord&#8217;</a>: You know the lever you&#8217;ve got to hold down to keep a lawn mower running? Imagine that, but it&#8217;s a magnetic USB cable for your laptop. Pull the cable, and your laptop automatically locks down or wipes itself. Zack Whittaker takes a look at the project, which was built to help journalists and activists keep their files safe from physical attacks.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/cytrox-predator-phone-hacking-meta/">The new spyware-for-hire</a>: Just as Apple moves to sue the group behind one spyware-for-hire tool, it&#8217;s becoming clear that this is less &#8220;slaying the dragon&#8221; and more &#8220;battling the Hydra.&#8221; Meta/Facebook announced this week that they are banning not one, not two, but <em>seven </em>groups from touching their social networks after detecting that the groups had targeted up to 50,000 people. Citizen Labs reports that one of these banned companies, Cytrox, tried to trick targets into unintentionally infecting their phones with its spyware &#8220;Predator,&#8221; which gives its operator full control over the mic, camera and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/well-tiktok-has-a-discord-now/">TikTok has a Discord now</a>: Ever wish you could talk about TikTok with other TikTokers while not actually being on TikTok? Good news! For some reason, TikTok launched a Discord. As Amanda Silberling puts it, &#8220;If the fast-food chain Wendy’s can have a Discord with over 60,000 members, why not a viral platform like TikTok?&#8221;

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/ex-uber-software-engineers-raise-3m-for-sperta/">THIS. IS. SPERTAAAAA</a>: After spending years helping to fight fraud at Uber, a pair of engineers are taking that hard-earned knowledge and building it into Sperta, an anti-fraud “rules engine as a service” system for fintech companies. Just a few months after launch, they’ve raised $3 million to keep the ball rolling.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/no-code-data-pipeline-platform-hevo-raises-30-million-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/">Hevo raises $30M for its no-code data platform</a>: Successful startups generate a ridiculous amount of data as they grow, but a lot of it tends to get locked up in each individual team’s tools of choice. Hevo taps into all of these tools and pulls that data into a “360-degree view” dashboard, allowing companies to answer complicated questions quickly — and, notably, without writing any code.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/fuzey-takes-in-4-5m-to-charge-up-its-management-tools-for-service-based-businesses/">Fuzey funding</a>: Fuzey aims to be a “one-stop shop” for small businesses — think plumbers, electricians, mechanics — by handling their messages/invoices/appointments and more in one view. Anything that makes running your own business less of a stress labyrinth is a win in my book. The company has just raised $4.5 million in seed funding, bringing its total raised to $5.2 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/longtime-gm-exec-dan-ammann-is-out-as-cruise-ceo/">Cruise’s CEO is out</a>: Longtime GM executive Dan Ammann is out as CEO of Cruise. Neither GM nor Cruise said much about the reasoning behind the departure; according to one of Kirsten Korosec’s sources, the announcement “seemed unplanned and chaotic.” Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt, who was Cruise’s first CEO before shifting to a president/CTO role, will take over as interim CEO.</p>

<p>Founded 16 years ago, Reddit has raised $1.3 billion, boosting the company to a $10 billion valuation. This week, the user-generated community revealed that it had filed confidentially to go public.</p>
<p>“You know what that means,” wrote Alex Wilhelm. “It’s time to ask questions.”</p>
<p>While he awaits Reddit’s S-1 with a sharpened scalpel, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/a-few-questions-about-the-impending-reddit-ipo/">Alex shared his initial questions</a> about the social hub’s operations, specifically:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re curious about content moderation costs, product expansion, the company’s revenue mix, how frequently governments come up in the filing, and what the unicorn has to say about crypto.”</p></blockquote>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The debate around social media’s impact on mental health is hardly new, but the conversation has recaptured the world’s attention in light of<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/05/tech/facebook-whistleblower-testify/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reports</a> this fall that suggest Facebook has been well aware of the toxic mental health consequences of its platforms for teens.</p>
<p>While this data &#8212; and the knowledge that Facebook ignored these concerns &#8212; is troubling, understanding social media’s impact on mental health isn’t all that simple. In fact, there’s a strong argument to be made that social media can offer safe, affirming spaces and connections for young people on the journey to discover themselves and their identities.</p>
<p>These benefits are too often pushed aside while the dark consequences of social media rage on. The fact is that today’s popular social networking platforms, like Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and more, are designed with monetization as a top priority. At their core, these apps encourage excessive use because more user hours on the app equal more ad support.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248891" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The tech industry has an opportunity &#8212; and a responsibility &#8212; to make space for platforms that aren’t dependent on ad dollars.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>While some have responded to the latest backlash by declaring that spaces like Instagram should be<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/opinion/instagram-social-media-children.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> strictly reserved for adults</a>, I strongly believe that it’s possible to build a social media environment that is beneficial for teenagers &#8212; one that helps them discover themselves and affirm who they are; one that lets them explore their identities freely; and one that comforts them in times of darkness and helps them know they are not alone.</p>
<p>I’m not sure this future can be cultivated by<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/10/22719545/instagram-introduce-take-a-break-nudge-teens-harmful-content-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reactive features</a> alone, but there is potential for social media giants to team up with other organizations and nonprofits to make social media a safer place for all people.</p>
<h2>Creating space for ad-supported and nonprofit social media</h2>
<p>While it’s difficult to imagine a world where for-profit social media is not a monopoly, it doesn’t have to be this way. It may not be realistic to eliminate ad-supported social media apps completely, but the tech industry does have an opportunity &#8212; and responsibility &#8212; to make space for platforms that aren’t dependent on ad dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If the number of views, clicks and ads were secondary to people’s wants and needs, we could revolutionize the way social media platforms work. Together, we could build communities that users can come to on their own terms &#8212; whether to escape pressure from other apps, connect with peers or find an accepting place where they can be themselves.</p>
<p>While a handful of ad-free social media spaces already exist &#8212; such as <a href="https://ello.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ello</a> and <a href="https://www.trevorspace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrevorSpace</a>, The Trevor Project’s social networking site for LGBTQ+ young people &#8212; they are much smaller and have fewer features, and therefore may not attract the high volume of users who are accustomed to the bells and whistles that come with social media apps such as Instagram.</p>
<p>There also needs to be a space online for young people to explore their identities anonymously, which is nearly impossible when social media companies prioritize ad support over their users’ mental health and well-being. Advertisers want to know exactly who is spending time on social media so they can target users based on their age, gender, behavior and identities. This becomes especially problematic for young users who want to use social media as a vehicle for figuring out who they are but can’t do so discreetly.</p>
<p>In order to overcome this, the industry as a whole needs to make more investments in social media spaces whose purpose isn&#8217;t profit. Over the past few years, tech giants have made incredible strides in product innovation, which could be applied to other sites that give users a safe place to express themselves and find supportive communities.</p>
<p>There’s a time and place for Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and other ad-supported apps, but there’s also a clear need and want for online spaces that aren’t driven by revenue. It doesn’t have to be one or the other, and we can work together to make room for both.</p>
<p>With TrevorSpace, for example, we’ve invested in research to better understand our users’ wants and needs, without the added pressure of meeting specific revenue goals. Through this research, we’ve learned that our users look to the internet to explore their identities and value having a safe space where they can express themselves.</p>
<h2>What if we used AI for good?</h2>
<p>Beyond investing in more nonprofit social media platforms, there’s also an opportunity for tech companies to apply their leading-edge AI developments to improve the user experience on social media and alleviate some of the mental health stressors caused by spending too much time online.</p>
<p>Social media sites currently use machine learning to inform algorithms that encourage people to spend more time online, but its possibilities extend far beyond that. We know that technology has the power to support people’s mental health instead of exacerbating mental illness, so what if we used AI to give users newfound control over social media?</p>
<p>Imagine if AI could help people find what they really need in a given moment &#8212; like guiding users to content that makes them laugh when they want to laugh or cry when they want to cry, facilitating connections between like-minded users that build positive relationships, or suggesting resources that give them skills or knowledge that positively impact their life.</p>
<p>The majority of social media apps today use AI to determine our feeds, “for you” pages and timelines for us. However, if we instead used AI to let people guide their own journeys on social media, we could foster a fundamentally different emotional experience — one that supported their wants and needs instead of simply monopolizing their time and attention.</p>
<p>This sounds like a no-brainer, and some may even believe this is already happening. However, as recently bolstered by former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen’s testimony, this is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/10/tech/facebook-whistleblower-algorithms-fix/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simply not</a> how the content we see is curated in the current hands of social media leaders. That must change.</p>
<p>Thanks to unprecedented innovations and research in social media, we have the technology needed to create sites that are conducive to our well-being; it’s just a matter of investing time and resources in developing them and creating space for nonprofit apps to coexist with major ad-supported apps.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I see the potential for social media companies to partner with nonprofit companies to develop AI that gives users control over the content they see and how they interact with it, but it would take major time, investment and collaboration from both parties. It would also require social media giants to be OK with making room for much-needed alternative apps in the space.</p>
<p>Making social media safer and healthier for all people is a goal that many nonprofits, including The Trevor Project, are dedicated to realizing, and we would greatly benefit from social media companies’ help making it happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The fees investment banks charge to underwrite IPOs can gobble several points from a public company’s gross proceeds, but new competition is giving some firms a chance to hold on to more of that sweet debut money.</p>
<p>This week, Nubank paid just 1.6% of the $2.6 billion it raised to its underwriters. As Bloomberg reported, “among 490 IPOs in the U.S. so far this year, only three paid a smaller percentage.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/are-nubanks-low-ipo-fees-a-sign-of-the-times/">In this morning’s edition of The Exchange</a>, Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm compared Nubank’s savings to DoorDash, which didn’t set aside <strong>any</strong> shares for underwriters in its November 2020 IPO.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249371" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<hr />
<p>They found several contributing factors, including increased global competition, a desire to attract more retail investors and, yes, SPACs.</p>
<p>This is indubitably “good news for startups” as stock exchanges in different time zones offer more places where startups can list (or double-list) their shares, write Alex and Anna.</p>
<p>“Could it also be a sign of some of the changes we are planning to track in 2022?”</p>
<p>I’ll be off on Tuesday, December 21, but we’ll return with a very comprehensive newsletter on Friday, December 24. Thanks very much for reading, and have a great week.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 2021 H-1B lottery process has been quite a rollercoaster!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We sponsored several people in this year’s lottery. One of our registrants was selected in the first round in March, but none were selected in the second round in July.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We just found out another of our registrants was selected in November; however, he’s from South Africa and restricted from traveling to the U.S. due to omicron.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What should we do? Any suggestions for what to do about our other prospective hires who didn’t get selected?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Eager Employer</strong></p>

<p>Founded 16 years ago, Reddit has raised $1.3 billion, boosting the company to a $10 billion valuation. This week, the user-generated community revealed that it had filed confidentially to go public.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“You know what that means,” wrote Alex Wilhelm. “It’s time to ask questions.”</p>
<p>While he awaits its S-1 with a sharpened scalpel, Alex shared initial questions about the social hub’s operations, specifically:</p>
<p>“We’re curious about content moderation costs, product expansion, the company’s revenue mix, how frequently governments come up in the filing, and what the unicorn has to say about crypto.”</p>

<p>In “New Kids on the Launch Block,” a panel at TC Sessions: Space 2021, Darrell Etherington spoke to three rocket makers to learn more about the factors making commercial space launches less expensive and more competitive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lauren Lyons, COO, Firefly Aerospace</li>
<li>Benjamin Lyon, Chief Engineer &amp; EVP Engineering, Astra</li>
<li>Max Haot, founder and CEO, Launcher</li>
</ul>
<p>“One common theme that quickly emerged was that vertical integration is a key driver of success in the rocket business is driving down costs, especially with smaller capacity launch vehicles,” writes Darrell.</p>

<p>A report by RockHealth.org found that 2021 has been the best fundraising year to date for digital health startups.</p>
<p>Fueled in large part by an explosion in demand for mental health services and the expansion of telehealth during the pandemic, more investors are hunting for founders who can creditably lower costs and create efficiencies in a notoriously ramshackle industry.</p>
<p>Regardless, “proving out a financially substantiated ROI case requires a combination of time and data, and digital health is no exception,” writes Alyssa Jaffee, a partner at digital health-focused VC firm 7wireVentures.</p>

<p>Launching a startup is inherently risky, but scaling up a company to succeed where others have failed spectacularly is a very bold move.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Ample is partnering with companies that manage EV fleets to swap its modular battery packs in and out of their vehicles.</p>
<p>“Fourteen years ago, Better Place raised nearly a billion dollars to do what Ample’s doing, and it ended up declaring bankruptcy,” reports Rebecca Bellan.</p>
<p>In an extended interview with co-founder John de Souza, she asked about the company’s go-to-market strategy, its culture and why he’s certain Ample will succeed where others did not.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The economics and operations work very well because you don’t need a large number at a single station to break even. With a small fleet, you’d have it at max 20 cars and it will break even. That’s what makes it so attractive. You don’t need to deploy the stations until you have a customer.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security researcher says an internet gateway used by hundreds of hotels to offer and manage their guest Wi-Fi networks has vulnerabilities that could put the personal information of their guests at risk.</p>
<p>Etizaz Mohsin told TechCrunch that the Airangel HSMX Gateway contains hardcoded passwords that are &#8220;extremely easy to guess.&#8221; With those passwords, which we are not publishing, an attacker could remotely gain access to the gateway&#8217;s settings and databases, which store records about the guest&#8217;s using the Wi-Fi. With that access, an attacker could access and exfiltrate guest records, or reconfigure the gateway&#8217;s networking settings to unwittingly redirect guests to malicious webpages, he said.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, Mohsin discovered one of these gateways on the network of a hotel where he was staying. He found that the gateway was synchronizing files from another server across the internet, which Mohsin said contained hundreds of gateway backup files from some of the most prestigious and expensive hotels in the world. The server also stored &#8220;millions&#8221; of guest names, email addresses and arrival and departure dates, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249542" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Mohsin reported the bug and the server was secured, but that sparked a thought: Could this one gateway have other vulnerabilities that could put hundreds of other hotels at risk?</p>
<p>In the end, the security researcher found five vulnerabilities that he said could compromise the gateway — including guests&#8217; information. One screenshot he shared with TechCrunch showed the administration interface of one hotel&#8217;s vulnerable gateway revealing the guest&#8217;s name, room number and email address.</p>
<p>Mohsin reported the newly discovered cache of flaws to Airangel, but months passed and the U.K.-based networking gear maker still has not fixed the bugs. A representative told Mohsin that the company hasn&#8217;t sold the device since 2018 and was no longer supported.</p>
<p>But Mohsin said the device is still widely used by hotels, malls and convention centers around the world. Internet scans show more than 600 gateways are accessible from the internet alone, though the true number of vulnerable devices is likely to be higher. Most of the affected hotels are in the U.K., Germany, Russia and across the Middle East, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the level of access that this chain of vulnerabilities offers to attackers, there is seemingly no limit to what they could do,&#8221; Mohsin told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Mohsin presented his findings at the @Hack conference in Saudi Arabia last month. Airangel did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rapid expansion of the commercial space industry over the last couple of years has led early-stage investors to consider very different types of companies than they did when space startups were a novelty.</p>
<p>The availability of more affordable rides to space, the maturity of ground infrastructure and improvements to accessibility and usability of earth observation data have combined to position entirely new breeds of space-related ventures as ripe for high-risk, high-growth investment.</p>
<p>At TC Sessions: Space 2021, we hosted &#8220;Being There When Stars Form,&#8221; a panel discussion with three early-stage investors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chad Anderson, founder and managing partner, Space Capital</li>
<li>Jessica Robinson, co-founder and partner, Assembly Ventures</li>
<li>Jonathan Fentzke, managing director, Techstars</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the topic, we talked about SPACs and also focused on areas that are piquing the interest of people who are placing bets on new and emerging space-related tech companies. Something everyone shared an interest in was infrastructure, including sustainable on-orbit operations and collision-avoidance, as well as applications being developed using in-space assets that are already in operation.</p>
<p>Find highlights from our conversation below, or scroll to the bottom for a video with the entire chat.</p>
<p><strong>Chad Anderson</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The last 10 years have been transformative for space; we&#8217;ve gone from a handful of defense contractors and a few monolithic satellites in orbit, to suddenly tons of participation by 1,600 space companies, raising a lot of capital over the last 10 years and deploying a lot of satellites. SpaceX and Starlink have launched quite a few satellites this year, as they roll out their beta version of Starlink and going into commercial production next year. And from 2020 to 2021, we&#8217;ve seen a massive uptick in the number of satellites launched. So we have tons more commercial activity that&#8217;s happening in space and no doubt, there&#8217;s 100 times more debris in orbit. So getting our arms around that is a key focus area for governments and commercial companies.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jessica Robinson</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The things that are most exciting to us, regardless of whether they&#8217;re here on Earth, or in space, are certainly around data. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll talk a lot about that today. I think the continued opportunities and applications of AI and machine learning are particularly applicable here as well, given that you don&#8217;t want to downlink things that you don&#8217;t have to. And I think robotics is another area that for us as investors translates well, certainly there are considerations in the space environment.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Foursquare’s heyday is long over, but the problem of finding cool local stuff to do lives on. Most people seem to make it work through a sometimes reluctant combination of Facebook or Instagram and word of mouth, but the reality is that there aren’t many good apps that help us get off of apps and out into the world. For Go Disco, that’s the priority.</p>
<p>“On the simplest level, it’s an app to get you offline, together with people that you care about more,” Go Disco co-founder Sean Conrad told TechCrunch. Go Disco is an event recommendation engine, but Conrad sees the app also as a philosophical antidote to social networks that juice engagement to keep users plugged in.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; The crazy duality or irony here is the more tech has been applied to things like medicine, logistics, transportation, it&#8217;s literally like miracles. It&#8217;s saving lives and making the world more efficient,&#8221; Conrad said. “But there&#8217;s this evil side, which is the markets applied to our social lives. Despite this magical, personally vigorous device in our pocket, it&#8217;s like a nightmare for our social lives.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249496" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The app was founded by Conrad, a consumer app developer, and Jesse Berns, a data scientist. It launches today for iOS, with an Android version on the schedule for mid next year. At launch, Go Disco will only surface cool stuff to do in Los Angeles, but it plans to quickly expand to New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Miami, Portland and Austin in 2022.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EnPgcybI2bM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Go Disco searches and sorts local events with a combined approach, blending automated systems that pull public events info with a human-powered editorial team that can find community-specific and more underground happenings that might not show up elsewhere.</p>
<p>The company’s events aggregation tech combs through public event listings and sorts things based on relevant terms, which are then paired with terms from a list of 65 interests. When people sign up for the app, they endorse interests from the list, from stuff like rock climbing and books to the LGBTQ community and activism.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Conrad emphasized the importance of human touch in Go Disco’s recommendations, noting that it’s also a way for the app to be sure the recommendations are inclusive and thoughtful. It’s also meant to make the app’s recommendations more personalized and community-focused than a catch-all events calendar that puts the decision making burden on the user.</p>
<p>For Go Disco, less is more. Rather than being a comprehensive guide to everything happening in your corner of the city, the app aims to serve you a small selection of the stuff it thinks you’ll enjoy most. “We don’t need to have everything&#8230; we just need to show people three or five perfect niche things,” Conrad said. ”The perfect app is you pull it up, the thing you want to do is right there and you&#8217;re done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first version of the app launches today, but the team has plans in the works to deepen the experience by building in a social layer. By March of next year, Go Disco plans to add a way for users to communicate about upcoming events with each other in threaded replies on the app, though for now they’ll need to settle for normal sharing and calendar features.</p>
<p>With an added social layer, Go Disco aspires to get people out of the kind of arduous text threads that they might use to coordinate with groups of friends and into something purpose-built to connect people to events around them. With event-specific conversations, you can pop in and out of what’s relevant without needing to track back in an endless, disorganized group text.</p>
<p>“You know, I&#8217;ve got my rock climbing friends and my foodie friends and my live music friends. Some of them overlap, some of them don&#8217;t, but I don&#8217;t want three extremely noisy text threads on this,” Conrad said. “I would like the ability to engage with those friend groups and stay connected to them. But I also don&#8217;t want to go to every single live music event that all my live music friends want to go to.”</p>
<p>Go Disco is still early days, but it has some ideas about how it would and wouldn’t like to make money. The app won’t sell user data and would prefer to take a cut of ticket sales or charge dedicated users for premium features. Conrad emphasizes that Go Disco would want to be thoughtful if it implemented promoted events, since the whole project depends on thoughtful curation. Keeping the signal to noise ratio healthy is key, as is a focus on connecting people in real life — ideally to make them happier.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s very sad and frightening to imagine having kids growing up in a fake world created by Mark Zuckerberg that&#8217;s like basically an amplification of weird algorithms built to make us fight with each other,” Conrad said. “&#8230;. What we thought about a lot was empathy can mitigate a lot of this and we believe very strongly that being together is like the forcing function for empathy.”</p>

<p>Now, with at least one connected TV (CTV) in <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/353799/study-80-of-us-ctv-viewers-watch-ad-supported.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80% of U.S. households</a>, advertisers are ready to realign their hopes once more.</p>
<p>With seemingly high-quality content and a large reach, CTV — often powered by Google Chrome, Roku, Apple TV or other devices — seems like a good ad bet on its face. And with the looming possible obsolescence of third-party cookies triggering panic over ad targeting on desktop and mobile, CTV offers attractive inventory. But there may be a big downside for those not willing to perform due diligence: It can be easy to fall victim to bad actors exploiting the hype CTV is currently experiencing.</p>
<p>For ad buyers — especially those at startups and more agile organizations — CTV can be a viable and powerful channel to add to your advertising mix. But first, it’s imperative to know that CTV advertising can carry unique risks. Don’t get carried away by the hype, or taken advantage of by frauds. Investing the time and resources to get CTV advertising right before committing further is a smart strategy.</p>
<h2>Knowing the risks of CTV environments</h2>
<p>CTV can reach new and niche audiences, but transparency can be challenging. CTV ads don’t provide the technical visibility of ads on desktop and mobile — often, there’s no client-side tracking of when an ad is served.</p>
<p>This lack of transparency is just one of the risks uneducated CTV ad buying can bring. To get a more complete picture of the problem, we need to examine both the business and technical factors that make CTV unique:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High costs attract fraud. </strong>CTV inventory carries a higher price in cost per thousand impressions (CPM) than many other types of advertising. Fraudsters gravitate toward high CPM because it can maximize their return. If paired with a vulnerable ad ecosystem, there’s potential for big profits with little effort — a perfect recipe for opportunists and bad actors.</li>
<li><strong>Scarcity drives low standards.</strong> CTV video inventory is inherently scarce. Making more requires building more CTV channels and either producing or licensing content. Under these conditions, a domino effect occurs. Ad platforms and networks become overeager to source enough inventory to keep business humming, leading to lax supply standards.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch’s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them.

<p>If you can&#8217;t read a good book without stopping every few pages to tweet about it, you might be what we call Extremely Online. You unabashedly distinguish between real life and digital life by using phrases like IRL versus URL, you disabled the Screen Time app on your iPhone because you don&#8217;t need that kind of judgement. Maybe you&#8217;re so online that it&#8217;s your job to write about social media, and even when you&#8217;re not working, you&#8217;re still thinking about the vice grip that Meta has on your life. Okay, that last one hit a bit too close to home.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re someone who would gladly read a dissertation on what the <a href="https://twitter.com/steak_umm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steak-umms Twitter account</a> means for digital advertising strategy, I&#8217;ve got bad news for you &#8212; that gold mine doesn&#8217;t exist yet. Still, some great writers &#8212; from inside Silicon Valley and from firmly outside of it, through fiction and non-fiction &#8212; can bring us offline to teach us about tech culture. Here are some relatively recent books that confront everything from the rise of TikTok to a fictional metaverse gone wrong.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234897" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>&#8220;Several People Are Typing&#8221; by Calvin Kasulke</h2>

<p>Here are the basic facts: book told exclusively through Slack messages, antagonistic Slackbot inhabits human&#8217;s body, human gets trapped in Slack, all his co-workers think it&#8217;s just a really elaborate bit, chaos ensues.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read this book twice this year, once as an e-book (yes, it really is just a bunch of Slack messages, no other exposition), and once as an audiobook, which features an ensemble cast performing as all the various Slack chatters. Both were lovely experiences. You might see &#8220;Slack book&#8221; and think it&#8217;s just a belabored treatise on how ~capitalism and the corporate world are eating us alive!~. This definitely isn&#8217;t a pro-capitalist book, but even as it tackles serious themes about our generation&#8217;s complete inability to understand how to create a work-life balance, it never feels overwrought, since it&#8217;s just so hilarious and absurd. Do you know how weird it looks to (1) read a book on the Philly bus and (2) laugh out loud at the book you are reading on the Philly bus? This book did that to me.</p>

<h2>&#8220;Uncanny Valley&#8221; by Anna Wiener</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2248512" style="width: 453px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248512" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2248512 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Uncanny-Valley.jpg?w=443" alt="" width="443" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Uncanny-Valley.jpg 515w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Uncanny-Valley.jpg?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Uncanny-Valley.jpg?resize=195,300 195w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Uncanny-Valley.jpg?resize=443,680 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Uncanny-Valley.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248512" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MCD</p></div></p>
<p>When this buzzworthy memoir about working in Silicon Valley came out last year, I deliberately chose not to read it, even though Goodreads kept telling me I would like it (semi-related: startup founders trying to &#8220;disrupt Goodreads&#8221; &#8212; I see you, and I appreciate you). I felt like I didn&#8217;t need a book to tell me something I already know: that startup culture can be toxic and misogynistic and that tech companies own too much of our data, because yes, we know that Browser A is better privacy-wise than Browser B, but what about all of our customized bookmarks and plugins? Even though none of these revelations were particularly shocking, Wiener&#8217;s perspective on the tech world as a non-technical startup employee was a reprieve from the corporate jargon that litters my inbox every day.</p>
<p>But the book isn&#8217;t so much about what it&#8217;s like to work in the Valley as it is about the experience of being a 20-something who just wants to work an innocuous, creative job that doesn&#8217;t hurt people, only to be seduced by the lucrative paychecks of the tech world, which may or may not hurt people. Wiener&#8217;s memoir begins as she slogs through a publishing gig in New York City, struggling to make ends meet while her bosses are taking lunch meetings at upscale bars and wearing designer clothes to the office. But you can&#8217;t blame her for abandoning her artsy college friends to move to the Bay and learn what MAUs are. It becomes clear to Wiener that it&#8217;s seemingly impossible to make it in fields like publishing or arts administration if your parents aren&#8217;t paying your rent. So what&#8217;s more evil: a corporate world that promises creative fulfillment and instead delivers inescapable student loan debt, or one that is wreaking havoc on the Bay Area and pushing longtime residents out of their homes but at least pays its workers well?</p>
<p>So, I guess the book didn&#8217;t really teach me anything new &#8212; there&#8217;s no ethical consumption under global capitalism, blah blah, we&#8217;re all complicit, et. al. But it&#8217;s at least nice to know you&#8217;re not the only one having an existential crisis about these things, I guess? Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m fine.</p>

<h2>&#8220;No One Is Talking About This&#8221; by Patricia Lockwood</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2248506" style="width: 442px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248506" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2248506 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/No-one-is-talking.jpg?w=432" alt="" width="432" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/No-one-is-talking.jpg 503w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/No-one-is-talking.jpg?resize=95,150 95w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/No-one-is-talking.jpg?resize=191,300 191w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/No-one-is-talking.jpg?resize=432,680 432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/No-one-is-talking.jpg?resize=32,50 32w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248506" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Riverhead Books</p></div></p>
<p>A nameless protagonist goes viral for posting, &#8220;can a dog be twins?&#8221; Of course, she becomes famous on the internet. It&#8217;s good content.</p>
<p>The first half of the book is told in post-ironic, somewhat nihilistic online-speak that feels mind-numbing. It&#8217;s the novelistic embodiment of doomscrolling. But when tragedy strikes close to home, the narrator is suddenly unconcerned with what&#8217;s going on in &#8220;the portal,&#8221; which is basically Twitter. Like &#8220;Several People Are Typing,&#8221; &#8220;No One Is Talking About This&#8221; is eerie in its mimicry of how Extremely Online people actually experience the internet. You&#8217;re sucked in, until suddenly, you&#8217;re not.</p>

<h2>&#8220;A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor&#8221; by Hank Green</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2248502" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248502" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2248502 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-beautifully-foolish.jpg?w=450" alt="" width="450" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-beautifully-foolish.jpg 523w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-beautifully-foolish.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-beautifully-foolish.jpg?resize=198,300 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-beautifully-foolish.jpg?resize=450,680 450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-beautifully-foolish.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248502" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dutton</p></div></p>
<p>Hank Green was one of the first YouTube stars, going on to found the YouTube conference VidCon and a bunch of other companies, like a <a href="http://awesomesocks.club" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charity sock subscription</a> and an <a href="https://complexly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">educational video company</a>. He&#8217;s also <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hankgreen1?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weirdly popular</a> on TikTok, so if anyone knows how the internet can change your life, it&#8217;s Hank, the enthusiastic nerd who <a href="https://thecrashcourse.com/courses/chemistry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably taught you chemistry</a> in high school.</p>
<p>Anyway, Green&#8217;s online footprint is relevant because his duology of &#8220;An Absolutely Remarkable Thing&#8221; and &#8220;A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor&#8221; is all about the internet (yes, the book I am recommending you is a sequel, which means you have to read two whole books). The first book chronicles (minor spoiler alert?) an overconfident 20-something&#8217;s rapid rise to global fame as she goes viral for unwittingly making first contact with aliens. April May, this struggling recent grad-turned-superstar, must reckon with what it&#8217;s like to go viral overnight &#8212; and now, in part thanks to TikTok, this experience is more relatable than ever.</p>
<p>But the second book, rather than the first, is highlighted on this list, because that was the story I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about when Mark Zuckerberg unveiled Facebook/Meta&#8217;s plans for the Metaverse (it also might be relevant that I weirdly haven&#8217;t read &#8220;Ready Player One&#8221;). In the second book, April and her friends try to take down a wealthy tech founder whose virtual reality platform is a front for far more nefarious plans.</p>
<p>In one section of the book, Andy sinks deep into the VR &#8220;Altus Space,&#8221; where a leaderboard tracks which user can make the most money by selling goods in the space&#8217;s digital currency. The top 50 people on the leaderboard are promised an earth-shattering, &#8220;premium&#8221; experience. Andy climbs the ranks by adding value to the community, but he&#8217;s thwarted by celebrities who sell limited edition virtual trinkets in a last-ditch effort to win the contest. Without ever mentioning crypto, NFTs or DAOs, Green reminds us that the decentralized internet is not inherently utopian. As Andy&#8217;s girlfriend points out, since when has capitalism been a meritocracy?</p>

<h2>&#8220;Bad Blood:  Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup&#8221; by John Carreyrou</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2248505" style="width: 461px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248505" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2248505 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bad-blood-1.jpg?w=451" alt="" width="451" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bad-blood-1.jpg 524w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bad-blood-1.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bad-blood-1.jpg?resize=199,300 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bad-blood-1.jpg?resize=451,680 451w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bad-blood-1.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248505" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Knopf</p></div></p>
<p>Every book on this list was published in 2020 or later, but &#8220;Bad Blood,&#8221; released in 2018, is the exception. Over three years since the non-fiction book was published, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes is now being tried for criminal fraud, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-testifies-in-her-own-criminal-trial/">things are getting spicy</a>. So, if you&#8217;re Extremely Online, you&#8217;re probably going to hear about Elizabeth Holmes and her tiny vials of blood.</p>
<p>An investigative reporter at the Wall Street Journal, John Carreyrou published <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exposé</a> in 2015 revealing that Theranos, valued at $9 billion, didn&#8217;t actually produce accurate results through its blood testing technology. &#8220;Bad Blood&#8221; reveals how Carreyrou reported the story, including details from his research that didn&#8217;t make his original articles. Whether you&#8217;re eagerly watching Holmes&#8217; trial unfold or you&#8217;ve never heard of Theranos, &#8220;Bad Blood&#8221; is a must-read for anyone interested in (or nervous about) the pitfalls of Silicon Valley culture. It&#8217;s almost too fascinating and horrific to be real.</p>

<h2>&#8220;The Atmospherians&#8221; by Alex McElroy</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2248503" style="width: 458px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248503" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2248503 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/atmospherians.jpg?w=448" alt="" width="448" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/atmospherians.jpg 520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/atmospherians.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/atmospherians.jpg?resize=197,300 197w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/atmospherians.jpg?resize=448,680 448w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/atmospherians.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248503" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atria Books</p></div></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another fiction selection, but this one comes screeching with trigger warnings: eating disorders, suicide, cults, you name it. But it&#8217;s also worth noting that Alex McElroy approaches these sensitive topics responsibly, even writing <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/07/eating-disorders-art-romanticize/619365/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an essay in The Atlantic</a> about how to broach eating disorder narratives without tacitly providing readers with instructions on how to mimic dangerous behaviors. In the case of this novel, McElroy addresses a character&#8217;s eating disorder by showing how his friends react to his suffering, rather than chronicling his exact symptoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Atmospherians&#8221; is so Extremely Online enough that its book cover is literally Instagram, but much of the book takes place in the woods. After a beauty influencer gets &#8220;cancelled&#8221; on social media, she starts a cult with her childhood best friend, where they attempt to reform &#8220;bad men,&#8221; teaching them to unlearn the behaviors of toxic masculinity. But maybe the most online moment is when the narrator is offered a lucrative contract to be the spokesperson for a product that wants to change social media by asking people, &#8220;are you sure you want to post that?&#8221; before they say something that might offend people. It&#8217;s not too far off from real-world warnings that exist on Twitter and Instagram.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re Extremely Online in that you play a lot of video games, you&#8217;ve probably heard about how the gaming giant Activision Blizzard, which produces games like Candy Crush, Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, is facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/blizzard-sec-investigation/">SEC investigations</a> and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/activision-blizzard-ceo-might-step-154146773.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexual harassment scandals</a>. But Jason Schreier&#8217;s reporting reveals that this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to problems in the video game industry.</p>
<p>The start of the book can feel a bit depressing as Schreier recounts numerous stories of game studios closing without notice, developers struggling between jobs and staff being poorly compensated for 70-hour work weeks. But the book&#8217;s subtitle delivers on its promise to chronicle not just ruin, but also, recovery! Ultimately, Schreier creates a hopeful narrative. You&#8217;ll never look at Bioshock Infinite the same way after learning how bad things got behind the scenes, but Schreier shows how independent studios, unionized teams and outsourcing studios like <a href="https://www.disbelief.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disbelief</a> can help solve the toxicity of the video game industry.</p>

<p>I knew that the definitive pandemic-era work from home book was coming, but I&#8217;m glad it was written by Charlie Warzel, who writes the Extremely Online <a href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galaxy Brain</a> newsletter, and Anne Helen Petersen, author of that viral &#8220;millennial burnout&#8221; <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>-turned-<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Even-Millennials-Burnout-Generation/dp/0358315077" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a>. Thankfully, Warzel and Petersen&#8217;s book is less about ~these unprecedented times~ and more about how the culture shift of the pandemic can maybe be an opportunity to solve issues that have existed in the corporate world since before we wore masks every day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Capitalism is inherently exploitative, but it is also &#8212; at least for the immediate future &#8212; our guiding economic system,&#8221; the pair writes. &#8220;If we’re going to live under it, how can we bend it to make that experience involve less suffering?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of Office&#8221; focuses more on &#8220;knowledge workers&#8221; than, let&#8217;s say, an Amazon fulfillment center employee.

<p>This comprehensive history of TikTok&#8217;s rise to social dominance begins as the author, a tech journalist who also wrote a book about YouTube, attends a panel at VidCon. It&#8217;s February 2019. The British writer remembers of the time, &#8220;I know that TikTok is popular, but only in the way that people outside of the U.S. know that the NFL pays astronomical salaries without ever getting a grip on it, or comprehending why anyone would care about it.&#8221; How quickly things changed for us all. Now, with over 1 billion monthly active users, TikTok feels like something that&#8217;s always existed, yet its prevalence is still relatively new. Trillion-dollar companies like Meta look at TikTok like the popular kid who just transferred schools and threatens to upend its seemingly impenetrable social dominance. How did this happen, and with a Chinese app nonetheless, in a time when Western xenophobia is horrifyingly rampant? Stokel-Walker picks apart just how TikTok rose to prominence, charting its impact on the creator economy, Silicon Valley, geopolitics and more.</p>
