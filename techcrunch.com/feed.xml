										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A good thing about technology products is that they can make a particular type of service cheaper over time. We&#8217;re seeing the phenomenon play out in the corporate spend market.</p>
<p>This morning <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a>, one of the North American startups competing in the corporate card and expense software space, announced that it will offer a free tier of its service, and that it will return most of its transaction revenues to customers via a new set of cash-back rates on its pre-funded and charge cards.</p>
<p>Airbase users that use pre-funded Airbase cards at their company will receive 2.25% cash back, while those using charge cards will receive 1.75%, the difference due to the capital cost of offering credit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231145" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>The corporate spend market has grown quickly, leading to ample venture capital and customer interest.</p>
<p>Broadly, there have been two models in play: Free services, and those that charge. Ramp, Divvy and Brex historically offered their services for free, making money instead via interchange, or transaction revenues. Airbase took a different tack, charging for its expense and spend management software, making it more like a traditional SaaS company.</p>
<p>Over time, the two models have blurred, with Brex offering paid software and, starting today, Airbase offering a free version of its product for smaller customers. Airbase&#8217;s aggressive posture is notable for its now offering a no-cost version of its software and opening its veins by giving even free customers its interchange incomes as cash back. The company is effectively repricing free corporate spend products lower by not keeping a good-sized chunk of interchange revenues for itself.</p>
<p>More simply, Airbase is working to eliminate the margin its competitors earn by giving it back to customers, betting that its customers&#8217; graduation rate from its free service to its paid tier will make up for what it is giving away.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This could put Ramp and Brex in a modest pickle — their cost advantage is under attack by a historically more expensive competitor that is now offering its free customers all the interchange revenue that the competing two startups have long lived off.</p>
<p>The Amazon riff about margins and opportunities comes to mind here.</p>
<p>Not that TechCrunch expects Ramp or Brex to take this Airbase move lying down. They will not. Each has oceans of capital as well as venture backers that have shown a sharp willingness to provide them with more financial firepower. But it matters that Airbase is scorched-earthing interchange revenues by giving the money back to end-users. It makes it cheaper — to the point of negative cost — to use modern corporate spend services. That should help with customer acquisition.</p>
<p>TechCrunch chatted with Airbase CEO Thejo Kote about the product news, curious how much marketing effort his company was going to put into its new, free product, called Essentials. Kote said that there is a big push coming, implying that Airbase doesn&#8217;t merely want to attract a few smaller companies to its free product to later convert. It wants to get lots of them, and that, naturally, will bring it into closer competition with Ramp and Brex, which have historically focused on smaller companies.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to the corporate spend market than just business model dynamics and fundraising. Airbase <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/airbase-adds-spend-support-for-international-subsidiaries/">expanded support</a> for international corporate subsidiaries this September, for example, and the results of that product work will be found in customer up-sell rates from free to paid versions of the company&#8217;s software, which it reckons can take a company from inception to an eventual IPO.</p>
<p>But with three American corporate spend startups bashing one another over the head with capital — Airbase<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/airbase-raises-60m-as-the-corporate-spend-market-segments-matures/"> raised $60 million in a round led by Menlo</a> rather recently, Brex is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/brex-raises-300m-at-a-12-3b-valuation/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">raising $300 million more at a $12.3 billion valuation</a>, and Ramp <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/ramp-financial-series-c--d4f66d47">raised $300 million just a few months ago</a> — it&#8217;s fun to see where they are finding market space to undercut one another, to the benefit of customers who keep getting more for less.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how Brex and Ramp respond, and if Airbase actually does manage to preclude interchange fees as a spend software monetization technique by simply deciding to give them back to users.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As people’s expectations for consumer experiences are higher than before, Block Renovation “productizes” home renovation by packaging everything together for both the homeowner and contractor.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blockrenovation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Block Renovation</a> wants to be a part of every home renovation in America after raising $50 million in Series C funding led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>The New York-based company is carving out its piece of the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/home-remodeling-is-a-450-billion-market-and-its-only-going-to-get-bigger-2019-03-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$450 billion U.S. home renovation market</a> with its homeowner and contractor tool to digitize and simplify the home renovation experience, which is definitely an experience if you’ve ever tried even the simplest of changes to your home.</p>
<p>Block Renovation co-founder Koda Wang told TechCrunch that <a href="https://money.com/millennials-shaping-housing-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half of all homebuyers are now under the age of 36</a> and that 87% of them hire a professional for their renovation versus trying to tackle some of the projects themselves.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230935" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The current status of home renovation is abysmal,” he added. “Homeowners hire two guys and a van and pray because they don’t know what the project will look like, how much it will cost or how long it will take.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RsxUv6OHPc"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/wall-street-needs-to-relax-because-remote-work-is-here-to-stay/">Wall Street needs to relax, as startups show remote work is here to stay</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wall Street needs to relax, as startups show remote work is here to stay&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/wall-street-needs-to-relax-because-remote-work-is-here-to-stay/embed/#?secret=RsxUv6OHPc" data-secret="RsxUv6OHPc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After studying the contractor side, the company found it wasn’t much better: Most contractors enjoy the work they are doing, but also have to be small business owners, which means knowing how to do sales, marketing, billing and procurement, which they have to start from scratch with each project, Wang said.</p>
<p>As people’s expectations for consumer experiences are higher than before, Block Renovation “productizes” home renovation by packaging everything together for both the homeowner and contractor, then providing a way for the contractor and homeowner to communicate with each other at every step of the project. The contractor can even take photos of each step of the project and provide a progress update so the homeowner can see how it is going.</p>
<p>In addition, homeowners don’t often have the data of how much it costs for renovation, especially if they decide to move something like a light, or add a wall, Wang said.</p>
<p>“We’ve taken that on for them by accumulating data points and giving them an estimate within 5% to 10% accuracy,” he added.</p>
<p>Joining SoftBank in the round are existing investors Giant Ventures, NEA, Morningside and Lerer Hippeau. Other investors in the round included Obvious Ventures, Rainfall Ventures, Firstminute Capital, BoxGroup, SV Angel and a group of individual investors, including interior designer Kelly Wearstler, designer Ann Sacks, Opendoor co-founder and CEO Eric Wu, Angi CEO Oisin Hanrahan and Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The latest investment gives the company a total of $104 million in venture funding since the company was founded by Wang and Luke Sherwin in 2018.</p>
<p>Things are moving fast for Block Renovation, with the company “doubling and tripling” its growth metrics over the past year, Wang said. The latest round comes just four months after the company announced a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/block-renovation-secures-40-million-140000761.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$40 million Series B round</a>, led by Giant Ventures, added Los Angeles to its list of markets and rolled out its kitchen remodeling feature — it started with bathrooms — as well as ​​free software, services and data for contractors.</p>
<p>Wang said the Series C round was not something the company had actively sought out, but the company was eager to work with Lydia Jett, partner at SoftBank Investment Advisors, who had previously invested in Coupang and Flipkart, and whom Forbes described as having the “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/15/rose-park-softbank-big-winners-in-coupang-ipo/?sh=1ac125c64e24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest cash-returning position for a woman startup investor</a>.”</p>
<p>“The rise of working from home has sparked an increased interest in home improvement projects but many customers are put off by the complexity and cost. “Jett said in a written statement. “Block Renovation is reimagining this process with a simplified and transparent digital platform that spans from planning to build. We are delighted to be partnering with Koda and Luke to support them in making home renovations more predictable and accessible.”</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Lyft and Motional, the Aptiv-Hyundai joint venture aimed at commercializing autonomous driving technology, have announced plans to launch their first fully driverless ride-hail service in Las Vegas in 2023. The news follows multiple years of collaboration, both between the two companies and within the City of Sin.</p>
<p>By the second half of next year, Motional and Lyft aim to be transporting public passengers, who will be able to book rides through the Lyft app, in Motional&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/hyundai-ioniq-5-will-be-motional-and-lyfts-first-robotaxi/">electric Hyundai IONIQ 5-based robotaxis</a> before scaling up to a full commercial launch where Lyft is allowed to charge for rides in 2023.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising to see Motional and Lyft choose Las Vegas as the first city in which to launch a driverless service, but it is a major milestone for the companies as they work towards their shared goal of commercializing autonomous ride-hail. The two have had a relationship with each other  since 2018, when Lyft and Aptiv launched a one-week program in Las Vegas to test a robotaxi service during CES. In November last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/motional-gets-approval-to-test-fully-driverless-vehicles-in-las-vegas/">Nevada gave Motional approval to test its autonomous vehicles</a> without a human safety driver, and just two months ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/motional-expands-operations-in-las-vegas-ahead-of-2023-robotaxi-launch/">Motional announced it would expand its operations and employee headcount in Las Vegas</a> and triple the size of its testing facility.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230971" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In other words, all signs had been pointing to Tuesday&#8217;s announcement for some time. Now, the industry will be keeping an eye out for expansion into more cities. Motional had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/">previously targeted 2023 for commercial launch in major U.S. cities,</a> and this summer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/motional-to-begin-testing-autonomous-vehicles-in-la-as-part-of-california-expansion-plan/">it announced plans to expand its presence in California</a> with a new Los Angeles operations facility that would support testing on public roads.</p>
<p>Motional isn&#8217;t sharing the exact number of vehicles it will launch with Lyft in Las Vegas at this time, and said it would share additional details on the operational design domain, which would stipulate the conditions under which Motional&#8217;s AVs could safely operate, closer to launch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beauty of the agreement with Lyft is that it has the potential to scale widely – we could reach millions of Lyft riders,&#8221; a spokesperson for Motional told TechCrunch, also noting that the company would share more information about plans to launch in other cities &#8220;in the future.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>The initial phase of non-commercial driverless deployment, which will begin in 2022, will allow the companies to fine-tune their autonomous offering by collecting rider feedback and improving upon user experience ahead of commercial launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Other autonomous vehicle companies are getting close to launching commercial driverless operations, as well. Just last week, self-driving GM subsidiary <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/cruise-launches-driverless-robotaxi-service-for-employees-in-san-francisco/">Cruise launched a driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco</a> for employees and certain members of the public. The company also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/gm-backed-cruise-seeks-final-approval-for-robotaxis-in-san-francisco.html">applied for a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission</a> for final approval to charge for ride-hail services. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/cruise-lays-out-its-plan-for-how-it-will-make-robotaxis-a-reality/">Cruise has big plans for scaling up its operations</a>, which are all vertically integrated, to the point of having thousands of purpose-built Origin AVs on the road over the next few years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Launch services provider <a href="https://spaceflight.com/">Spaceflight Inc.</a> said Tuesday it will deploy customer spacecraft to two distinct orbits for the first time, as the company seeks to expand the capabilities of its Sherpa line of orbital transfer vehicles.</p>
<p>Orbital transfer vehicles (OTV) have become a popular way for satellites to reach their final destinations in orbit, allowing smaller space companies to forego the cost and mass of having their own propulsion system while also splitting the cost of an OTV – similar to how SpaceX lets companies split the cost of launch under its rideshare mission program.</p>
<p>Seattle-based Spaceflight aims to execute the maneuver using a new type of Sherpa space tug outfitted with a chemical propulsion system. It is calling the new vehicle the Sherpa-LTC1, and it marks the third type of Sherpa OTV that the company has debuted in the last twelve months. Spaceflight also developed a Sherpa tug equipped with an electric propulsion system, which it calls the Sherpa-LTE, that flew on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/spacex-delivers-88-satellites-to-orbit-lands-first-stage-onshore-for-first-time-in-2021/">SpaceX Transporter-2</a> mission in June, and a Sherpa-LT it debuted in 2020.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230818" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sherpa-LTC1 will head to space next year, aboard the SpaceX Transporter-3 launch that’s scheduled to depart from Florida’s Cape Canaveral in January. The space tug will put a collective 13 customer spacecraft into two separate orbits. First, the Sherpa OTV will deploy nine smallsat payloads before maneuvering to a lower altitude to deploy the remaining four cubesats.</p>
<p>Customers for the mission include Capella Space, Umbra Space, Lynk Global, Inc., Kleos Space, NASA, Czech Aerospace Research Centre in partnership with Spacemanic, Space Products and Innovation (SPiN), and Portland State Aerospace Society.</p>
<p>The new space tug uses a “green” propulsion system developed by Benchmark Space Systems, which the company says will enable rapid orbital transfer for many different sized spacecrafts. According to Grant Bonin, SVP of business development at Spaceflight, &#8220;maneuvers in LEO are just the beginning. These capabilities and services will play a crucial role in accessing other orbits beyond LEO and developing in-space transportation and various mission services.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Qualcomm today launched a new developer platform for building head-worn augmented reality experiences: the Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform. The only supported hardware for the platform is currently Lenovo&#8217;s ThinkReality A3 smart glasses (paired with a Motorola phone), but it will expand to include hardware from Oppo and Xiaomi in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>To build out the software ecosystem, Qualcomm lined up a wide range of partners, including Epic Games&#8217;s Unreal Engine, Niantic&#8217;s Lightship platform, Unity, Viacom CBS and others. Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile U.S. are also partnering with Qualcomm to support startups that use Snapdragon Spaces through the <a href="https://www.hubraum.com/">hubraum</a> program.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230185" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qualcomm_spaces.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230185" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2230185" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qualcomm_spaces.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230185" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230182" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For now, only a small number of developers will have access to the program. These currently include the likes of Felix &amp; Paul Studios, holo|one, Overlay, Scope AR, TRIPP, Tiny Rebel Games, NZXR, forwARdgame, Resolution Games and TriggerGlobal. It plans to make the platform generally available in the spring of next year.</p>
<p>The company also today announced that it has acquired &#8220;the team and certain technology assets from HINS SAS and its wholly owned subsidiary, <a href="https://clayair.io/">Clay AIR</a>, Inc.&#8221; for its hand tracking and gesture recognition solutions. This is in addition to Qualcomm&#8217;s acquisition of Wikitude in 2019, another move that helped it jumpstart its AR efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dating back to 2007, we had R&amp;D programs, looking into augmented reality with algorithms like VIO [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_odometry">visual-inertial odometry</a>] on smartphones,&#8221; said Hugo Swart, Qualcomm&#8217;s vice president and GM of XR, in a press briefing ahead of today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;We enabled, through the last decade, devices like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/an-ar-glasses-pioneer-collapses/">ODG</a>. In 2014, we created new chips dedicated to virtual reality and augmented reality &#8212; and we are here for the long run. We know that we&#8217;re not there &#8212; it&#8217;s still going to require investment until we get to the holy grail of AR glasses that can do both fully immersive and augmented experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230220" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qualcomm_spaces_partners.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230220" class="size-full wp-image-2230220" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qualcomm_spaces_partners.jpg" alt="" width="1024" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230220" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s platform is able to support features like local anchors and persistence, hand tracking, object recognition and tracking, plane detection, occlusion spatial mapping and meshing.</p>
<p>With this platform, Qualcomm wants to lower the barriers for developers to build AR experiences. They will get access to documentation, sample code, tutorial and additional tooling to quickly build basic AR applications. To further help companies who want to build for this ecosystem, Qualcomm is also opening up an additional program, dubbed Pathfinder. With this, they will get early access software tools and hardware development kits, additional funding for their projects and co-marketing and promotion from Qualcomm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.socure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Socure</a>, a company that uses AI and machine learning to verify identities, announced today that it raised $450 million in funding for its Series E round led by Accel and T. Rowe Price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round brings the company’s valuation to $4.5 billion, up from $1.3 billion this March </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/socure-raises-100m-at-1-3b-valuation-proving-identity-verification-is-hotter-than-ever/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when it raised $100 million for its Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its new valuation makes Socure the highest-valued private company in the identity verification space, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.baincapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bain Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.tigerglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined the round as new investors. Existing investors</span><a href="https://commerce.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Commerce Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.scalevp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Scale Venture Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.sorensoncapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorenson Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also participated. The round brings its total funding raised to $646 million since it was founded in 2012.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230878" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socure’s identity resolution engine uses predictive analytics to parse over 8 billion records, providing a multi-dimensional picture of a consumer’s identity for fraud detection purposes, even for hard-to-identify populations, including those who are Gen Z, credit-invisible or new to the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socure’s customer base includes 12 of the top 15 banks and a roster of fintech companies, online gaming providers and crypto exchanges &#8212; Voyager, Public, Stash and DraftKings, to name a few. Socure CEO Johnny Ayers told TechCrunch that about 35% of its customers today are not in the financial services sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use the funds in two ways &#8212; to execute on its mission to “verify 100% of good identities and completely eliminate identity fraud” and to increase its investments “across the entire identity verification lifecycle,” further developing proofing and authentication processes, per Ayers. Ayers anticipates seeing rapid growth in Socure’s online gaming, cryptocurrency and e-commerce marketplace clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the company is also expanding its partnerships with state and federal government actors to help them invest in digital identity technology </span><a href="https://www.socure.com/about/press-release/socure-names-digital-identity-leader-matt-thompson-as-general-manager-of-public-sector-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">after hiring a new head of its public sector business last month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One such use case for Socure is verifying identities to prevent unemployment fraud, cases of which cost the U.S. a total of </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/06/12/the-most-brazen-400-billion-unemployment-funds-heist-in-history/?sh=7720f3302020" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$400 billion in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundraise comes on the heels of rapid growth in the identity verification space as companies conduct more and more business online, driving demand for more robust security and fraud prevention solutions. The tailwind of digitization helped Socure grow from approximately 350 customers served in March, mostly concentrated in financial services, to nearly 1,000 today across a wider range of industries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Webster, chief risk officer of Socure client SoFi, explained his view on what differentiates Socure from its competitors in a written statement to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most players in the space have created point solutions to solve one aspect of digital identity – name, address, device, email, or phone number – but lack the data science insights of Socure’s Sigma+ score that definitively and reliably answers two questions using their multivariate data: ‘Is the applicant a real person? Is the applicant who they say they are?’” Webster wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Ayers confirmed that Socure is considering going public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to be in a position where in 2023, we have all of our ducks in a row,” Ayers said of the IPO preparation process. “We will certainly come to market here in the not-too-distant future.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Richard Socher, former chief scientist at Salesforce, and his co-founders at <a href="http://you.com">You.com</a> have been on a mission over the last year to build a different type of search engine, and today the company is releasing a public beta, while announcing a hefty $20 million seed investment.</p>
<p>The new search engine doesn&#8217;t use a scrolling vertical set of results as you see on every search engine out there. Socher and team wanted to throw out assumptions and come up with something entirely new.</p>
<p>&#8220;The design actually took a lot of iterations. and we tried to have a beginner&#8217;s mindset and tried to really innovate with search. In some ways it&#8217;s crazy, but the main idea of a vertical list is now getting more and more interspersed and cluttered with other things [like ads] and hasn&#8217;t changed in 20 years,&#8221; Socher told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231138" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They went to work to change that and came up with something completely different. For starters the search results page is linked to different apps such as Medium, Yelp and Reddit. You can customize the importance of those apps, or you can choose to not use a particular one at all, as you wish.</p>
<p>The results appear in categories by app along with a web results category, and you scroll left to right to see results in a particular app or category. What&#8217;s more, you can see the results such as video or a code snippet without actually opening a fresh tab, saving time and keystrokes while reducing tab overload.</p>
<p>If you like a certain set of results better, you can move them up in the results, and You.com will remember that in the future and present you the results you like better next time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231163" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231163" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2231163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ThanksgivingSideDishes-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Thanksgiving side dishes search in you.com.

Photo credit: You.com</p></div></p>
<p>Socher says that the founders chose the name because it&#8217;s about what you as a user need from the search engine. &#8220;We are true to our name. It&#8217;s about you. So you actually can choose here and say &#8216;I want to see more Reddit or I want to see less Reddit,'&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t make sense to display results from Reddit, like when you&#8217;re looking for a Thai restaurant near you, it will display Yelp results at the top instead. If you don&#8217;t like Yelp results, it can simply display web results, but this ability to customize gives you a lot of flexibility and control over the results you see.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about this level of customization making the results too one dimensional, especially when choosing news sources, the items you don&#8217;t want to see displayed prominently don&#8217;t disappear, they simply move down the list of results. If you don&#8217;t care about the customization features, you can let the search engine display the results for you.</p>
<p>For starters, they are focusing on developers and privacy aware users. They had considered shopping as a primary use case, but in testing they found when they linked to retailer product catalogues, alpha users thought results were ads when they were actually pages from a catalogue. They decided to move onto other use cases.</p>
<p>Developers can search for things like code snippets. They are able to quickly scroll horizontally through the set of snippets, find something, copy and paste it, and be done much faster than in Google or even a privacy-focused search engine like DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>For people concerned about privacy, you can go into what Socher calls true Incognito mode where everything about you including your IP address is hidden. The search engine is designed to make it simple to move in and out of Incognito mode, so if you need your location turned on to find a restaurant, you can turn off privacy mode, then quickly turn it back on.</p>
<p>In terms of monetization, the company vows never to sell your data to a third party, but for now they are simply trying to get the design down and grow the user base. Socher says the company will concentrate on monetization later. There will probably be ads at some point, he says, but without connecting the query to a user, and without cluttering the results.</p>
<p>As an example, if you search for air purifier you may get an ad for that, but the company displaying that ad won&#8217;t have direct access to data about you, as is the case now with most online ads. The devil will be in the details here, of course, but this is how Socher is describing it.</p>
<p>The company also announced a $20 million Seed investment led by Time Ventures, his former boss, Marc Benioff&#8217;s private venture fund, with participation from Breyer Capital, Sound Ventures, Day One Ventures and a long list of industry angels.</p>
<p>Up until today the search engine has been in private beta with a couple of thousand users, but starting today anyone can try it. If you&#8217;re using Chrome, you can download the extension.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online stock trading platform Robinhood has confirmed it was hacked last week with more than five million customer email addresses and two million customer names were taken, as well as a much smaller set of more specific customer data.</p>
<p>The company said in <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident">a blog post</a> that a malicious hacker had socially engineered a customer service representative over the phone November 3 to get access to customer support systems. That allowed the hacker to obtain customer names and email addresses, but also the additional full names, dates of birth and ZIP code of 310 customers.</p>
<p>Robinhood said that 10 customers had &#8220;more extensive account details revealed.&#8221; Robinhood did not say what information specifically, though no Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed and caused no immediate financial loss to customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231152" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But it&#8217;s precisely that kind of information that malicious hackers can use to facilitate further attacks against victims, like targeted phishing emails, since names and dates of birth can often be used to verify a person&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>The company said once it secured its systems the hacker then &#8220;demanded an extortion payment.&#8221; Robinhood instead notified law enforcement and security firm Mandiant to investigate the breach.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar breach to how Twitter was hacked in July 2020. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/decrypted-teenager-twitter-hacker-garmin-ransomware/">then-teenage hacker</a> used social engineering techniques to trick some of Twitter&#8217;s employees into thinking the hacker was an employee, allowing the hacker access to an internal Twitter &#8220;admin&#8221; tool, which he used to hijack high-profile accounts and spread a cryptocurrency scam. The attack netted the hacker just over $100,000 in cryptocurrency. In its aftermath, Twitter rolled out security keys to its staff to toughen its defenses against attacks that prevent these kinds of attacks from working in the future.</p>
<p>Whatever lacking security controls that allowed a hacker to trick a Robinhood customer service representative into granting them access to an internal system is a likely focus for its investigation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.truveta.com/">Truveta</a> wants to collect privacy-safe medical data from around the United States on a regular basis, making it available for researchers to sift and parse. The company is making real progress towards that goal in product terms, and this morning said it raised another $100 million, giving it a capital base of around $200 million in total.</p>
<p>But the financial aspect, and the fact that Truveta has secured more partners in the medical world to supply it with information, are ancillary to the fact that the startup has started to make its platform available to external parties.</p>
<p>Truveta partners with around 20 medical providers, aggregating regular de-identified data from 42 American states and myriad patients into its collection. From there it has built a software service that allows researchers and other users to ask questions of the collected data. TechCrunch was given a tour of the Truveta product, which, as chart nerds, we liked.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231125" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But frankly, your local technology writer is not precisely the Truveta end-user. Instead, the product is aimed at individuals with their hands in the public health domain. To that end, the company&#8217;s product lets researchers include and exclude elements of the population, before dropping the user into a Jupyter Notebook, from where they can build a dashboard with data that updates daily.</p>
<p>Truveta has eyes on 16% of all clinical care in the United States, per CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/tmyerson">Terry Myerson</a>, who formerly worked with Microsoft.</p>
<p>The company shared a grip of COVID-19 related material this morning that it has gleaned from its own product. It turns out that &#8220;adverse events&#8221; happen to fewer than 1% of folks with a full COVID-19 vaccine, with Moderna patients showing 40% more than those who received Pfizer. Given that I am a Moderna Man and my spouse is Team Pfizer, I was amused by that latter stat. Perhaps I&#8217;ll mix-and-match my booster?</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YGP66G0M2v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/can-data-fix-healthcare/">Can data fix healthcare?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Can data fix healthcare?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/can-data-fix-healthcare/embed/#?secret=YGP66G0M2v" data-secret="YGP66G0M2v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Truveta is more interesting for its long-term potential than for what it has managed to learn thus far, in my view. It&#8217;s good news for our country that the company is starting to open up access to external parties, and has a product that can ingest mountains of data and share it in a privacy-safe manner. Our healthcare system is expensive, siloed, antiquated, and rife with inefficiencies. Truveta could make things a bit more open and, if we are lucky, clear.</p>
<p>What will prove interesting from this juncture is how Truveta converts itself from an interesting — and now operating — project into a business. It has a pretty firm anti-advertising stance, saying in its self-description that its service is &#8220;licensed for ethical medical research [and] not to target advertising to patients or physicians.&#8221; Fair enough, but do researchers have the coin to make the project work? Perhaps Truveta will sell its service back to its data providers, each contributing both data and regular fees to the company?</p>
<p>Truveta notes in its self-produced bio that it pays taxes. Hence, it isn&#8217;t a non-profit. That means at least an attempt at future profitability, which will keep our business model questions at the front of our minds. But with $100 million in new capital, Truveta is hardly about to run short on cash.</p>
<p>All told, Truveta has rapidly scaled its partner base and tech stack to the point of market viability. Let&#8217;s see what demand is attracted, and how quickly positive health <em>and</em> business outcomes can be ascertained.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Seasoned launched in Dallas last year and has attracted over 300 brands operating 100,000 locations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With restaurants having difficulty hiring workers, as is the environment today, one company is developing a hiring platform and restaurant worker network that aims to make that easier.</p>
<p>Seasoned announced Tuesday it received $18.7 million in a Series A round of funding to continue developing its mobile app employee networking and recruitment tools that are being used by more than 250,000 restaurant workers.</p>
<p>Some 800,000 jobs at eating and drinking places were still open as of October, according to <a href="https://restaurant.org/research/economy/indicators/restaurant-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Seasoned CEO Ware Sykes told TechCrunch that restaurant hiring was a pre-pandemic problem that was exacerbated over the past 18 months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230775" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sykes saw the limited ability for restaurants to advertise their job openings and created Seasoned to change that. There are two sides to the app: a free community for industry employees to review openings, schedule interviews and connect with peers, while a subscription-based hiring tool for restaurant managers works to lower onboarding costs and accelerate the timing between application and hire to within three hours.</p>
<p>“The purpose is to bring the service industry together — the worker and the restaurant — so that both can have success,” he added. “We have a social community where workers can find a job in 24 hours. Most other products are not built for the restaurant, but we have a mobile solution for both sides.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230784" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230784" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230784" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.02.23-PM.png?w=680" alt="Seasoned" width="680" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.02.23-PM.png 4212w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.02.23-PM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.02.23-PM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.02.23-PM.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.02.23-PM.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.02.23-PM.png?resize=1536,867 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.02.23-PM.png?resize=2048,1156 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.02.23-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2230784" class="wp-caption-text">Seasoned apps. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Seasoned</p></div></p>
<p>Remote-first Seasoned is the latest company receiving investment for hourly worker tools. For example, Fountain announced an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/as-companies-search-for-hourly-workers-fountain-brings-in-85m-to-assist-them/">$85 million Series C round</a> last week for its applicant tracking system, while Workstream recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/workstreams-text-based-recruitment-tool-gets-a-48m-bet-from-bond-and-beyond/">$48 million in Series B</a> funding for its text-based recruitment approach. In addition, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/bite-ninja-scoops-up-pre-seed-funding-to-reimagine-restaurant-working-environments/">Bite Ninja</a> secured some pre-seed funding to continue developing its software that enables workers to pick up drive-thru shifts from home.</p>
<p>The two-sided app differentiates Seasoned from the others, Sykes said. He believes that unique business model was the driver for the company’s successful launch in Dallas in 2020, where in the first year it attracted over 300 brands operating 100,000 locations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The latest funding round was led by Horizons Ventures and includes TPG Growth and existing investors. It follows a $12 million seed round raised in June to bring the company’s total funding to over $30 million since the company was founded a year ago.</p>
<p>Sykes intends to deploy the new capital into expanding into new markets. In addition to Dallas, it has already added Houston, Austin, Orlando and Miami and is expected to go national in the next year. He also intends to hire across the board in areas like product, technology, go-to-market and data science.</p>
<p>“This has become a movement,” he added. “A year ago, restaurants were listing wages and now they are offering sign-on bonuses and lifting wages across the board. The more data we get, the more we can see what kinds of benefits are attractive for employees.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By the time your baby is crying in the crib, they are over-stimulated and grumpy as can be. <a href="https://cradlewise.com/product/smart-crib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cradlewise</a> is a $2,000 smart crib that monitors a baby&#8217;s depth of sleep, and automatically tries to soothe your little bundle of joy back to sleep as soon as the first signs of wakefulness come along.</p>
<p>The company started taking preorders at CES in 2021, and initially focused on customers in the Bay Area, to keep the feedback loop from Cradlewise&#8217;s customers as tight as possible. To date, around 100 units of the smart crib have been sold, and the company is continuing to take preorders at a discounted price of $1,499.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $7 million seed round was led by </span><a href="https://www.footwork.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Footwork, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with participation from </span><a href="http://www.crv.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and follow-on from existing investors <a href="https://sosv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOSV</a> and <a href="https://www.bettercapital.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Better Capital</a>. Other notable investors participating in the round include founder of Stitch Fix Katrina Lake, CEO of Italic Jeremy Cai, CTO of Molekule Dilip Goswami and ex-CEO of Misfit Wearables Sonny Vu. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224627" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2224642" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224642" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2224642" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bounce-bounce.gif" alt="" width="300" height="169" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224642" class="wp-caption-text">The Cradlewise cradle&#8217;s bouncing motion is designed after how a human would soothe a baby back to sleep. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cradlewise</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;There are 50 baby monitors on the market that will notify you when your baby wakes up. That&#8217;s too late. When my husband and I had our first baby, we quickly learned that as soon as she twitched, we ran over and rocked her. You can&#8217;t do that every time &#8212; you can&#8217;t watch the baby 24/7. Why isn&#8217;t there a crib that can monitor for signs of waking,&#8221; wondered Radhika Patil, the co-founder and CEO of Cradlewise. Excellent question &#8212; and when they failed to find a smart crib that acted the way they wanted, they decided to build one, starting with the quality of the bounce. &#8220;A lot of the cribs available in the market are not intuitive in the way the would rock the child. So we modeled our motion after the way I would bounce our children at 3 am on a yoga ball.&#8221;</p>
<p>The journey started from a combination of curiosity and the &#8220;quantified self&#8221; movement. Radhika and her husband <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bharath Patil</span> were heavily invested in tracking their own sleep and fitness patterns, and when their first baby was born in 2014, they built a prototype of the Cradlewise for her. The idea stayed on the back burner until 2019 when the idea was revived fully, the company raised some cash, and the work started in earnest.</p>
<p>The new money raised unlocks a new round of growth for Cradlewise. The team told me they are working on building out its 11-person team further, and focusing on technology advancements and supply-chain and operations associated with delivering a pretty complex product. The company wants to make more advanced sleep analytics available, and potentially add a smart scale to the crib, to ensure that a baby&#8217;s weight can be tracked along with their sleep patterns. The ultimate goal is to make Cradlewise the centerpiece of a smart nursery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The final product the team created was a rather pricy cradle, and I asked the team whether the price tag made sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very careful that the sleep monitor only checks the footprint of the crib &#8212; there are wall-mounted products out there, but that has serious privacy issues. So we combine early wakeup detection, the natural bouncing movement that imitates how a parent bounces a baby,&#8221; Radhika Patil explains, arguing that the price tag makes sense for a premium product that replaces several baby products. She also highlights the crib&#8217;s green credentials, including a reduction of plastics, and the inclusion of easy-to-recycle materials: &#8220;The mattress is made from coconut coir and natural rubber latex. This means that the mattress is fully biodegradable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says it doesn&#8217;t have plans for a second-hand market for its cribs yet, but suggests that the cradle can be disinfected pretty easily, and the mattress can be discarded and replaced by a new one from the company &#8212; hence the focus on making the mattress itself biodegradable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cradlewise is the only baby product in the market that uses deep tech and AI to learn the baby&#8217;s sleep patterns and growth trends. With software updates that build on this rich data, a characteristic of the very best connected hardware companies such as Nest, Peloton, Tesla and Tonal, Cradlewise is pioneering the connected nursery,&#8221; said Nikhil Basu Trivedi, co-founder and general partner at Footwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cradlewise isn&#8217;t just a smart crib, it is a mental health solution for parents,&#8221; said Kristin Baker Spohn, general partner at CRV. “Having spent much of my career focused on the intersection of technology and health, Cradlewise is a great example of how smart technology can be used to help ensure that both babies and their parents can get a good night’s rest, which is truly one of the most important elements for staying healthy.”</span></p>
<p>The crib is sized so babies up to the age of two can use it, and <a href="https://cradlewise.com/product/smart-crib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preorders continue on Cradlewise&#8217;s website</a>.</p>

The company today announced that it has raised a $5.3 million seed round led by First Round Capital. Redpoint Partners, Susa Ventures and a number of angel investors also participated in this round.</p>
<p>Cascade Labs was co-founded by CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakefuentes">Jake Fuentes</a> and CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brelig">Jon Brelig</a>. Fuentes previously co-founded personal finance service Level Money, which Capital One acquired in 2015. Brelig previously co-founded InfoScout (now Numerator), where he was the CTO until he and Brelig co-founded Cascade Labs in September 2019.</p>

<p>Brelig noted that while at InfoScout, he saw that a lot of ops and analyst teams were often highly skilled at analyzing data but not necessary tech savvy enough to automate their workflows to, for example, build complex weekly reports without a lot of manual labor.</p>
<p>Fuentes, meanwhile, had seen similar issues, but from a slighty different perspective. &#8220;I sold my last company to Capital One and as you can imagine, that&#8217;s a highly analytical place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the degree to which people on the ground that knew the business well could access the huge reams of data that we had access to was still fairly limited. So after I left Capital One and Jon and I started talking about this problem we were: &#8216;maybe this is actually the same thing&#8217; &#8212; and that&#8217;s how Cascade got started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fuentes admitted that there are obviously a lot of tools out there that help businesses access and explore data. But the team argues that there is still a disconnect between exploring data and then putting it to work. &#8220;That&#8217;s the type of thing that fraud operations needed in Capital One, for example, and InfoScout needed to serve clients properly,&#8221; Fuentes said. &#8220;I think to get to that level of operationalizing data, it needs a slightly different toolkit than what we currently have today.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231041" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231041" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2231041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=1536,869 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cascade Labs</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to build fancy dashboards but it&#8217;s another to build a data tool that takes this data and then, for example, helps a scooter company plan nightly pickups for recharging and repairs. With Cascade Labs, operations teams can easily take data from most common sources (or a CSV file, if needed) and then create workflows around that. That may include basic transformations and other standard data operations, but Cascade Labs also offers some predictive capabilities. Typically, at the end of those workflows is an action. That could be emails to the employees of the scooter operators about which scooters to bring in for repairs, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Looker was on the head end of a transformation that&#8217;s still going on, which is how do you get the right data to the right people in the organization that are really running the business,&#8221; Bill Trenchard, partner at First Round, told me. &#8220;I look at what Cascade [Labs] doing as an evolution of them. They are really at the intersection of kind of two movements: no-code tools, empowering non-technical creators to build like engineers &#8212; and the rise of the modern data stack. The combination of both is allowing companies to utilize data in entirely new ways like never before.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also noted that while there are lots of integration tools that produce dashboards, Cascade Labs is about getting the right data to the right people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most companies would kill for Peloton’s level of user buy-in. The company’s cycling and treadmill products have built an almost cult-like mystique around the connected fitness platform. It’s a level of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/peloton/">devotion</a> that had seemingly only grown during the pandemic, in spite of setbacks, including shipping delays and a pair of recalls.</p>
<p>In spite of numerous claims surrounding the supposed death of the gym, however, re-openings<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/11/05/peloton-sales-gym-memberships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> have begun to impact the company’s bottom line</a>. How can a company in Peloton’s position hamper such a slide? The quick and easy answer is to expand into additional home fitness categories. And while the best time for the Peloton Guide to arrive would have been, say, March 2020, it seems entirely possible that the new hardware could goes a ways toward keeping the company well positioned in the home fitness space.</p>
<p>Recent rumors found Peloton jumping feet first into the booming world of home rowing machines alongside brands like Hydro &#8212; and while such a move still seems entirely likely, today’s announcement is more firmly targeted at the likes of Tempo and Tonal. And, perhaps most importantly, it finds the company releasing its most inexpensive hardware to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230715" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Peloton Guide’s $495 price point is a full $1,000 less expensive than its cheapest product, the Bike. That’s due, in no small part, to the fact that it’s the least intensive of the bunch. That price gets you the Guide (effectively a camera system that plugs into a TV), a heart-rate band and a remote control. Other strength training essentials are user-supplied &#8212; something the company spins as a plus in the material, noting, “Members will be able to use their own equipment, weights, or accessories and won’t need any bulky devices to get started with their strength experience.” So, BYOW.</p>
<p>It’s pricier than the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/tempo-launches-a-400-home-fitness-system-the-size-of-a-minifridge/">recently announced Tempo Move</a>, a $395 mini-fridge-sized product that comes preloaded with its own weights. The other big difference on the hardware side, however, is that Tempo’s product relies on a user’s smartphone &#8212; which automatically reduces the potential user base to those with newer iPhones.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230718" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230718" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2230718" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wWiK0WwY.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wWiK0WwY.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wWiK0WwY.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wWiK0WwY.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wWiK0WwY.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wWiK0WwY.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wWiK0WwY.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wWiK0WwY.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2230718" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Peloton</p></div></p>
<p>Instead, the Peloton Guide is built around the company’s own camera system. Here’s what the company has to say about its feature set:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Peloton Guide makes strength training appealing and motivating to beginners and experts alike by using machine learning, a type of AI that uses data to identify patterns and make decisions with minimal input from an engineer, to enhance the renowned Peloton strength class experience. Peloton Guide uses ML to help Members track their movements and progress.</p></blockquote>
<p>The system works with the company’s existing range of strength courses, which, it notes, “has been the fastest growing discipline for Peloton.” The monthly content fee is $13. The Guide won’t quite hit the holiday cutoff, but it should be around for those New Year’s resolutions, arriving in early 2022 in the U.S. and Canada. Users in the U.K., Australia and Germany will have to wait until later in the year.</p>

Now for the first time, the company is introducing a vertical home feed featuring images of dishes and more, designed to help people discover local restaurants.</p>
<p>The feed will first and foremost feature &#8220;popular dishes and other trending photos from consumers, including food photos or interior and exterior shots of the restaurants,&#8221; Yelp said. Much like Google and other types of news feeds, the content shown is based on your proximity to the business, the freshness of content and a dish&#8217;s popularity.</p>
<p>When you click on a restaurant&#8217;s dish, you&#8217;ll be directed to see more photos and reviews of that dish. Yelp uses machine learning to pick out those dishes based on reviews, then pairs them with photos and reviews of the dish. Clicking on other images, like the interior or exterior of a restaurant, will take you to the business page and show you more photos and info.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231123" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The other feature, Yelp Connect, is a paid feature for restaurant owners. It allows businesses to share updates with new and existing customers directly to home feed, helping their posts gain visibility (and Yelp more ad revenue, no doubt). Yelp said that it&#8217;s initial testing showed it may lift a restaurant&#8217;s consumer engagement up to 30 percent.</p>
<p>The new experience is arriving today on iOS exclusively in 150 cities in 25 US states, Yelp said. There&#8217;s no word yet on an Android release, but the company said to &#8220;stay tuned for additional updates.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The new valuation is more than double what the Brussels-based company announced last year when it secured $112.5 million in a Series F investment that put its valuation at $2.3 billion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more data moves to the cloud, it often still lives in multiple places on a business’ network, making it difficult for organizations to understand and access the right data they need and easier for data breaches to occur.</p>
<p><a href="http://collibra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collibra</a>, which provides tools to find, understand, access and analyze data, announced today that it raised $250 million in Series G funding, at a post-money valuation of $5.25 billion. Its products help customers comply with local data protection policies and store data securely.</p>
<p>The new valuation is more than double what the Brussels-based company announced last year when it secured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/collibra-nabs-another-112-5m-at-a-2-3b-valuation-for-its-big-data-management-platform/">$112.5 million in a Series F investment</a> that put its valuation at $2.3 billion. That followed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/regulatory-demands-for-better-data-governance-push-collibras-valuation-above-1-billion/">a $100 million investment in 2019</a> at a valuation of just over $1 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230793" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The valuation is a strong reflection of our position in the market,” Felix Van de Maele, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “If you look around, we have the highest valuation among our competitors and this is a reflection of growth. We are very excited to more than double our valuation in 18 months.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Collibra nabs another $112.5M at a $2.3B valuation for its big data management platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/collibra-nabs-another-112-5m-at-a-2-3b-valuation-for-its-big-data-management-platform/embed/#?secret=K51NOR1EbH" data-secret="K51NOR1EbH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The latest round of funding was co-led by Sequoia Capital Global Equities and Sofina, with participation from new investor Tiger Global Management and existing investors Battery Ventures, CapitalG, Dawn Capital, Durable Capital Partners LP, ICONIQ Capital and Index Ventures.</p>
<p>Collibra was spun out of Vrije Universiteit in Belgium in 2008 and today it works with more than 500 enterprises and other large organizations like AWS, Google Cloud, Snowflake and Tableau. It has over 900 employees working remotely and in hubs, including Brussels, New York City, Atlanta and Poland.</p>
<p>The funding follows record growth by the company, including the acquisition of OwlDQ, a provider of predictive data quality software, in February, Van de Maele said.</p>
<p>“There is a ‘Renaissance’ around data and fueling artificial intelligence models,” he added. “These were manually done before, and now we use AI and machine learning to automate models. It is how we observe the data infrastructure and prepare for problems.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When the company first started, the complexity of the data landscape included millions of data assets, and now that landscape is on the road to billions. To scale to this volume and manage the growth associated, Collibra went after the new funding.</p>
<p>Van de Maele said he “is excited” to have Sequoia and Tiger in the cap table this time around and that existing investors have come back. His goal with investors was to find those that would continue to partner with the company over the long-term.</p>
<p>The new capital will be deployed into expanding its presence across the United States, Europe, Middle East and Australia. Van de Maele expects to make significant hires in engineering, sales and product, essentially doubling Collibra’s workforce by 2023. It will also invest in R&amp;D, customer success and go-to-market so that it can continue providing new features for its Data Intelligence Cloud offering.</p>
<p>Though the company has been around for over a decade, Van de Maele still considers the data intelligence space to be early, especially as larger enterprise companies come onboard.</p>
<p>“The complexity and chaos is at a different level, and what we hear is that they want one platform, not five different tools,” he added. “More organizations need that foundation, but just putting data from one place into a data lake is not going to solve the problem of getting value from it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Draper Esprit, Europe’s only stock-market listed tech VC firm, is changing its name to <a href="http://moltenventures.com">Molten Ventures</a> after a change in senior personnel and an increasingly distant relationship with the US VC network from which is inherited its name.</p>
<p>With former cofounder and CEO Simon Cook <a href="https://www.moltenventures.com/news/thank-you-simon">amicably departed</a> to pastures new and the European listing powering to the fund in new directions, Molten is as good a new name as any with which to plow a new furlough.</p>
<p>Molten’s team says the name conjures up images of transformation, “matter being transformed via the injection of energy – the first transformation is from solid to molten form.” OK&#8230; But behind the marketing speaks is a solid VC fund with a very experienced team, so there are no concerns there.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231108" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In terms of an update on the fund, Molten Ventures now has a portfolio of investments boasting 67 companies, including early-stage companies like Irish drone delivery company Manna Aero, Cambridge-based quantum computing software company, Riverlane, London-based climate intelligence company, Cervest and Finnish satellite company ICEYE.</p>

<p>Its portfolio also includes European unicorns such as Trustpilot, UiPath, Graphcore, Revolut, Cazoo, Ledger and Aircall. Between them, Molten’s portfolio companies have a combined valuation of well over £1.4bn.<br />
 <br />
It’s also an investor in seed venture capital funds. Its Fund of Funds program comprises 42 European funds, including Seedcamp, Earlybird, IcebreakerVC and Future Positive Capital. Funds invested in the last 3 years total £75m, with the same amount committed for the next three years.<br />
 <br />
Just over five years ago, the firm first listed its shares on AIM and the Euronext Growth Market in Dublin. It’s still the only large, tech-focused VC firm listed on the stock market.</p>
<p>Since 2016, Molten has raised £619m (~$860m) and seen cash realisations of over £300 million (~$420m) with £206m (~$290m) in the last full year, deploying over £550m (~$760m). Its annual rate of deployment is about £200m ($270m).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Its initial portfolio totaled 24 European technology companies at a valuation of £74.8 million.<br />
 <br />
Martin Davis, CEO at Molten Ventures said: “Our rebrand to Molten Ventures is rooted in the team’s long experience of transformation – both our own, and our successful efforts to help our portfolio do the same It encapsulates that moment when VCs give their energy to help companies succeed.”<br />
 <br />
Stuart Chapman, Co-founder at Molten Ventures said: “All our energy is devoted to identifying and supporting Europe’s most visionary entrepreneurs. We recognize that building the next generation of companies requires flexible, patient and supportive capital and we are uniquely positioned to offer this – making more possible for all of us.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://AudioMob.com">AudioMob</a> is a startup that provides ‘non-intrusive&#8217; audio ads within mobile games. It turns out that gamers don’t seem to mind little ads like this popping up, and somehow AudioMob seems to have cracked the mechanic.</p>
<p>It’s now raised a $14 million Series A round led by Makers Fund and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Also participating are the Sequoia Scout Program and Google. Total investment to date is now at $16 million. </p>
<p>The company plans to continue its experimental audio technology, file patents in more countries, and expand its offices in London and Abu Dhabi. It’s also now claiming a valuation of around $110 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231097" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I met founders Christian Facey, CEO, and Wilfrid Obeng, CTO, last year when they were spinning up the startup and had gained traction early on, working with Ed Sheeran and Nas alongside brands like Intel, Jeep and KitKat.</p>
<p>AudioMob is now serving audio ads inside mobile games in all countries outside of China with notable rising stars being the UAE, Germany and Canada.</p>
<p>Christian Facey, CEO at AudioMob said: “We’re thrilled to see investors&#8217; excitement for AudioMob’s vision for long term success and our future. We’re on the precipice of innovating a whole industry with audio and now we’re able to build out our tech and team to ensure we’re disrupting the industry in the right way and ensure we eventually become a future tech industry unicorn.”</p>
<p>Wilfrid Obeng, CTO at AudioMob said: “We understand that consumers don’t want to be interrupted, advertisers want their ads to be heard and game developers want to ensure monetization does not affect retention. And now we have built products which meet all three needs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instant grocery and essentials delivery is already a very crowded field in Europe; but today competition was turned up another notch: <a href="https://gopuff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gopuff</a> &#8212; the U.S. leader in the space with a service that delivers food and essentials for a flat fee of $1.95, 24 hours a day &#8212; launched officially in the U.K.. It plans to use London as a base to expand further into the region.</p>
<p>The launch is part branding, and part integration exercise: Gopuff, which was valued at $15 billion after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/gopuff-confirms-new-1b-cash-injection-at-a-15b-valuation-to-expand-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $1 billion in July earlier this year</a>, has been using its cash to make a stream of acquisitions. Two of those have been snapping up instant delivery players Fancy and most recently <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210811005811/en/Gopuff-Doubles-Down-on-European-Expansion-With-Acquisition-of-Dija" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dija</a> in the UK. Now, Gopuff is rebranding those two under its own name, and moving its services over to its main app and platform.</p>
<p>The company is live today in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield and the plan is to be in 33 cities by the middle of next year, led by SVP of Europe, Steven Harman (who had been COO at Revolut); execs poached from Amazon; and Alberto Menolascina, who was co-founder of Dija, as the UK GM. The pricing in the U.K. is £1.79 per order.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231082" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“When looking at expanding into Europe, we were extremely attracted to the similar models, infrastructure, loyal customer bases and talent we saw in both Dija and Fancy,” said Rafael IIishayev, co-founder and co-CEO of Gopuff, in a statement. “By combining Gopuff’s technology, scale and deep experience leveraging existing physical infrastructure, with the local market knowledge and entrepreneurial spirit of the Fancy and Dija teams, we can bring a game-changing and unparalleled experience to UK customers.” I&#8217;ll be meeting with his co-founder Yakir Gola later today and will see if he says more about those plans.</p>
<p>Indeed, the U.K. is Gopuff&#8217;s first international market, but not its last. The company reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/amazon-gopuff-are-said-to-explore-deal-for-german-startup-flink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has its eye on</a> at least one startup out of Berlin, Flink. Germany has proven to be one of the hotter markets for instant grocery delivery. Gorillas, another well-capitalized player in the space &#8212; it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised close to $1 billion</a> earlier this year and is now valued at around $2.1 billion &#8212; is also based in the city.</p>
<p>Aside from Flink and Gorillas, another major player in Europe has been Getir out of Turkey. Backed by the likes of Tiger Global and Sequoia, it is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/getir-is-streets-ahead-following-latest-funding-round-valuing-the-company-at-over-7-5bn-301305869.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $7.5 billion</a> and has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kicked off an acquisition spree in earnest</a>. There are many, many more players in the space, such as Zapp, Glovo, Cajoo, Weezy, Jiffy, Deliveroo, offerings from supermarkets, and much more. All of these have raised or invested collectively hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to carve out market share and grow, capitalizing on a consumer appetite for more on-demand services and &#8212; in a climate of the Covid-19 pandemic still very much hanging in the air &#8212; less of an inclination to go out physically themselves to get what they need.</p>
<p>As we have seen in other on-demand categories like transportation (hello, Uber) the strategic playbook here for the delivery businesses is to raise huge rounds of funding to make aggressive moves into new markets and to compete against others doing the same by offering deep discounts to win customers and potentially lock them into using your services more regularly. Gopuff, which has been around since 2013, believes that globally, the addressable market for instant food and essentials delivery is potentially worth $10 trillion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That will inevitably lead to more consolidation of smaller, regional players; but it also spells deep losses due to extremely negative unit economics that are hard to claw back once promotions have been doled out to the masses. In areas like transportation, that has led to major write-downs both for the companies and their investors.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see whether instant grocery is a mere repeat of that, or if entrepreneurs, startups and their investors have learned a lesson here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automakers, suppliers and startups aiming to roll out automated driving features, robotaxis and self-driving trucks are a little closer to accessing Nvidia&#8217;s newest compute and sensor toolkit.</p>
<p>Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced Tuesday at the company&#8217;s fall GTC event that Hyperion 8 — a production-ready platform that includes sensors, compute and software needed for AV development — is now available to buy for 2024 vehicle models.</p>
<p>Hyperion 8 is the latest iteration of the end-to-end Nvidia Drive platform that automakers can use customize to their likening and needs. Hyperion 8 was first revealed in April. However, some details, including which companies are supplying the 12 cameras, nine radars and one lidar that are part of the platform, weren&#8217;t revealed until Tuesday. Notably, Luminar is supplying the lidar, a potential boon for the newly public company. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Continental, Hella, Sony and Valeo are also supplying sensors to Nvidia for the Hyperion 8. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231054" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity here is that as Nvidia&#8217;s system gets designed in (to production vehicles), we also ultimately get designed in,&#8221; said Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell.</p>
<p>Hyperion is a reference platform that allows customers, like say an automaker, to access and tweak what its needs, including the core compute and middleware as well as AI functions inside the vehicle.</p>
<p>Hyperion 8&#8217;s availability was one of a string of automotive-related announcements made by Huang at the company&#8217;s fall GTC event. The key announcements included developments in mapping bolstered by its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/nvidia-acquires-hi-def-mapping-startup-deepmap-to-bolster-av-technology/">acquisition of DeepMap</a> in June, a tool that can replicate realistic scenes through simulated cameras with data labeled automatically and a personal concierge product that acts as a digital assistant, provides important communication between the automated driving system and the passenger and can handle parking. Each new product announcement either fits into or complements Hyperion 8.</p>
<p>The upshot: Nvidia aims to capture larger slices of the automated driving market, a sector that includes the suppliers and automakers developing driver assistance systems for passenger vehicles and the companies working to deploy fully autonomous vehicles such as self-driving trucks and robotaxis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nvidia has scored a number of customers that are developing on the Nvidia&#8217;s Drive Orin computer system-on-chip, including Cruise, Mercedes-Benz, TuSimple, Volvo and Zoox. Nvidia touted several more design wins during the fall GTC event, including Lotus, Chinese self-driving startup <a href="https://www.qcraft.ai/en">Qcraft</a> and Weltmeister, the EV brand owned by China&#8217;s WM Motor Technology Co.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not expect to have a 100% market share, but we have a dominant portion of the market that&#8217;s developing on Nvidia Drive,&#8221; Danny Shapiro, vice president of automotive at Nvidia said in a briefing ahead of GTC. &#8220;And the reason that is, is because we have this entire end-to-end solution. It&#8217;s not just about one thing that goes in the car but it&#8217;s about the data center, it&#8217;s about the simulation, it&#8217;s about the vehicle and having that on the same architecture is a huge advantage.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency exchange Bitmart is in talks to raise about $20 million at a pre-money valuation of $300 million, two sources familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>Alexander Capital Ventures, known for backing Airbnb and Spotify, is engaging with Bitmart to lead its Series B round, the sources said. Bitmart has raised about $10 million in its earlier financing rounds, according to Crunchbase.</p>
