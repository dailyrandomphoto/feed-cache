										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After IFA became one of an extremely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/ifas-executive-director-discusses-why-the-tech-show-must-go-on/">small number of in-person trade shows</a> in 2020, the gfu Consumer &amp; Home Electronics GmbH <a href="https://b2b.ifa-berlin.com/en/press/press-releases/news_4033.html?referrer=/press/press-releases/#news-en-4033">is pulling the plug on this year’s event</a>. Initially planned for September 3-7 at the Messe in Berlin, the large-scale consumer electronics trade show is going on hiatus.</p>
<p>Among other concerns, organizer are citing the emergency of Covid-19 variants and concerns around the speed and consistency with which vaccines have been rolled out globally.</p>

<p>&mdash; IFA Berlin (@IFA_Berlin) <a href="https://twitter.com/IFA_Berlin/status/1394962508369252357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“Ultimately, several key global health metrics did not move as fast in the right direction as had been hoped for &#8211; from the rapid emergence of new COVID-19 variants, for example in South Asia, to continued uncertainties about the speed of the rollout of vaccination programmes around the world,” the organization said in a press release. “This in turn is adding uncertainty for the companies that were committed or interested in coming to Berlin, as well as media and visitors – all of whom have to plan well ahead with regards to budgets, investments and travel – not just for IFA, but all similar events around the world.”</p>

<p>Another key issue here is the Messe Berlin (convention center) has been – and continues to be – used as both an emergency medical facility and a vaccination center. The planned Berlin Photo Week at ARENA Berlin and SHIFT Mobility events will continue. IFA, meanwhile, is set to return on September 2, 2022.</p>
<p>The news comes as a number of high profile exhibitors have opted not to exhibit in-person at MWC late next month in Barcelona. The list, thus far, includes Qualcomm, Google, IBM, Nokia, Sony, Oracle, Ericsson, Samsung and Lenovo. As with IFA before it, MWC’s organizers are citing a number of safety precautious and likely – given travel restrictions, MIA exhibitors and a general sense of caution even among vaccinated people – a scaled back event.</p>
<p>MWC will be something of a hybrid event, with both online and in-person exhibits. IFA, meanwhile, appears to be canceled outright. The Berlin show is notably different than other consumer trade shows in that it is partially open to the public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The past year has been utterly devastating to the music industry generally, and live music in particular. Artists who make a living touring have been forced to find alternative ways to make ends meet, while those among us who once frequented live events have been looking for ways to plug the hole created by wide-scale shutdowns.</p>
<p>A number of music-related platforms have spent much of the pandemic looking to offer some semblance of the concert-going experience, ranging from live venues to services like Bandcamp. Today, Spotify is announcing<a href="https://www.spotify.live/"> the launch of a new feature</a> designed to provide a live-show experience remotely. Venues in many areas are beginning to reopen, but even fans may be cautious to return to packed, indoor events.</p>
<p>The streaming service is announcing a series of shows starting with dates this month and next, including names like The Black Keys, Rag&#8217;n&#8217;Bone Man, Bleachers’ Jack Antonoff, Leon Bridges and girl in red. Spotify is billing them as “prerecorded livestreams” &#8212; a bit of an oxymoron, that. I recognize that livestream has become kind of a catchall, but it loses some meaning when the thing isn’t, you know, live.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rather than streaming straight from a venue, the service is taking the somewhat novel approach of letting the artist choose the spot for the pre-recorded show. That means live-show venues in the case of The Black Keys and something more creative for Antonoff, who shot his segment on a bus traveling from Brooklyn to Springsteen’s old stomping ground, Asbury Park, New Jersey (greetings).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tB3UM16rkm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/are-virtual-concerts-here-to-stay/">Are virtual concerts here to stay?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Are virtual concerts here to stay?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/are-virtual-concerts-here-to-stay/embed/#?secret=tB3UM16rkm" data-secret="tB3UM16rkm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We have always been a band that loves to play live in venues of all shapes and sizes,” The Black Keys said in a release tied to the news. “The past year has been tough for musicians and fans alike, so we wanted to find a way to share this live performance of songs from our new project, <em>Delta Kream</em>, from a place we love, the Blue Front Café, the oldest active juke joint in America. We’re excited to be a part of this new initiative with Spotify that will give fans a great way to connect with their favorite artists.”</p>
<p>The shows run 40-75 minutes and run $15 a pop. The price seems a bit high to stream a pre-recorded concert, but fans of the groups will likely appreciate what’s being billed as an “intimate” look at one of their favorite artists &#8212; though intimacy is, in part, limited as the company will be selling unlimited tickets to the events. The service isn&#8217;t revealing how large of a cut artists will get, simply telling TechCrunch, &#8220;All artists will receive a guaranteed fee for their participation in the livestream.&#8221;</p>
<p>Streaming the shows requires a Spotify account &#8212; either premium or free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re reading this, there’s a pretty good chance you have a LinkedIn profile with your digital resume and hundreds &#8212; if not thousands &#8212; of professional connections. But how many of those people do you actually know well, and, more importantly, do you ever connect with them and meet others from their networks?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t go to LinkedIn to meet people. You don’t hang out and spend meaningful time there,” said Alex Taub, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://upstreamapp.com/">Upstream</a>, a new professional networking platform that just closed a $2.75 million seed round, bringing their total raised to $3.25 million. The round was led by Ibex Investors and managing partner Nicole Priel (who joins the board) and includes participation by 8-Bit Capital, Human Ventures, NYVP, Converge Venture Partners and a number of angel investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your LinkedIn network is not a good representation of who you actually know and how well you know them. We see these places that LinkedIn isn’t particularly focused [on] and believe there are opportunities for multiple big companies to better serve the needs of professionals,” Taub added.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike LinkedIn, Upstream focuses on generating meaningful connections between its members, and one way they go about it is by hosting digital events that start with a speaker, followed by breakout matched sessions that are five minutes each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a sense of the product, Upstream invited me to be the speaker at last Friday’s “Upstream Social,” where I talked about my work as a journalist and then coincidently got matched with two founders &#8212; one in Brazil and the other in Boston. The week before, the guest speaker was U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;8 Miami-based investors share their views on the region&#8217;s startup scene&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/6-miami-based-investors-share-their-views-on-the-regions-startup-scene/embed/#?secret=OyjW6G2tVS" data-secret="OyjW6G2tVS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To me, the experience felt like LinkedIn meets Clubhouse meets Hoppin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upstream, which is pre-revenue and is Miami-based, is a company whose founder was attracted to the Sunshine State from NYC during the pandemic. Taub and his family signed a two-year lease here and plan to reevaluate their residence in the summer of 2022; they are one of the movers who are cautiously optimistic about the tech industry’s recent explosion in the Magic City.</span></p>
<h2>The origin story</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taub and his co-founder, Michael Schonfeld, are both serial entrepreneurs, having built and sold Social Rank for an undisclosed amount before launching Upstream in October 2020. The impetus for the company came as a solution to a struggle Taub faced in his daily life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Throughout my life, regardless of the job I’ve been in, I spend my time making introductions, connecting people and helping friends hire rock-star talent. Like many people, I get energy from helping others,” Taub said. “When COVID-19 hit and the job market took a dive last March, the number of requests for help I received increased 100X. I noticed quickly that my speed of responding to emails and brain capacity to connect the dots became the limiting factor in getting people help,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s no surprise that Upstream started as a product where people could ask for help, and others from the community pitched in. The company now has more than 200 communities (similar to LinkedIn groups), and about 75% of the people who attend an initial Upstream event return for a second one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I joke that we are building a product that people need because I need it. We feel that we are the right team to solve this problem because we so desperately want it ourselves,” Taub said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With security top of mind in many companies these days, especially given how many staff work at home, there is one area that remains chronically ignored: that of the world of APIs which power all of the platforms we all use every day.</p>
<p>Now, a significant player in the cybersecurity of APIs is super-charging its offering.  42Crunch, an API security startup, has raised $17 million in a Series A round led by Energy Impact Partners. Adara Ventures also participated.</p>
<p>42Crunch has a &#8216;micro firewall&#8217; for APIs which aims to protect against attacks listed in the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/">OWASP Top 10 for API Security</a>. It is used by companies such as Mulesoft, Ford Motors, and Qualys.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO and Co-Founder of 42Crunch, Jacques Declas said: “What do the recent data breaches at Tesla, Facebook, and Clubhouse have in common? They all came about due to API vulnerabilities. 83% of internet traffic now comes from APIs but traditional firewall approaches are not adapted to cope with the specific threats that APIs create.”</p>
<p>The three French co-founders came up with the idea after being the number of APIs used by customers proliferate.</p>
<p>The normal approach to firewalls &#8211; relying on patterns and signatures to detect potential incursions &#8211; does not work when it comes to API traffic. 42Crunch claims its platform can individually protect each API, and prevent common cyber-attacks such as injections but also API-specific attacks.</p>
<p>Isabelle Mauny, Co-founder and CTO of 42Crunch, said: “Protecting APIs from threats at runtime is only part of the story. APIs will only be truly secured when security becomes part of the developer’s flow, rather than an afterthought.”</p>
<p>Nazo Moosa, Co-Managing Partner, Energy Impact Partners added: “42Crunch’s ‘shift-left approach’ to the creation of secure-by-design APIs fits strongly with EIP’s vision of protecting global critical infrastructure. The company’s six-digit customer wins last year were catalytic to our decision to lead the round.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Indian government is not pleased with WhatsApp’s new privacy policy. The nation’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has once again directed the Facebook-owned company to withdraw the planned update.</p>
<p>In a letter to WhatsApp on Tuesday &#8212; which was read to TechCrunch &#8212; MeitY has given the popular instant messaging provider seven days to offer a “satisfactory” response. Failure to do so, the ministry warned, will prompt lawful measures.</p>
<p>“In fulfilment of its sovereign responsibility to protect the rights and interests of Indian citizens, the government of India will consider various options available to it under laws in India,” the letter reads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The letter comes at a time when the ministry is also pursuing a legal case on this matter in the Delhi High Court &#8212; and  the second largest internet market is also<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/india-antitrust-body-orders-investigation-into-whatsapp-privacy-policy-changes/"> conducting an antitrust probe on the subject</a>.</p>
<p>This is not the first time New Delhi has issued a notice to WhatsApp about the new privacy terms. Earlier this year, in a similar letter,&#8221; the Indian government had expressed &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/india-asks-whatsapp-to-withdraw-new-privacy-policy-expresses-grave-concerns/">grave concerns</a>&#8221; about the planned update.</p>
<p>Following backlash from several governments and users, WhatsApp earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">delayed enforcement of the privacy update</a> by three months &#8212; to May 15. Last week, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/whatsapp-is-doing-fine-despite-months-long-backlash-over-policy-update/">somewhat relaxed the deadline</a>, though users need to still need to comply to access some basic features.</p>
<p>A spokesperson at the time told TechCrunch that the vast majority of users who had seen the new privacy terms on the app had accepted it.</p>
<p>With over 450 million users, India is WhatsApp’s biggest market by users.</p>
<p>The ministry in its notice this week has asked WhatsApp why it needs to enforce the new changes to its terms of service &#8212; the first major update in years &#8212; to users in India when those in the EU have been exempted from it.</p>
<p>The updated privacy terms grant WhatsApp the consent to share some personal information &#8212; such as their phone number and location &#8212; with parent firm Facebook. WhatsApp has clarified that communication between two individuals remains just as private as before.</p>
<p>“It is not just problematic, but also irresponsible, for WhatsApp to leverage this position to impose unfair terms and conditions on Indian users, particularly those that discriminate against Indian users vis-à-vis users in Europe,” the ministry wrote in the letter.</p>
<p>In response to a petition filed in the Delhi High Court earlier this month, WhatsApp argued that many Indian firms <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/exclusive-whatsapp-says-zomato-ola-koo-bigbasket-among-others-collect-as-much-or-more-data/">maintain similar policies and share more data</a>. In the petition, WhatsApp had identified food delivery startup Zomato, ride-hailing giant Ola, online grocer BigBasket, as well as Swedish giant Truecaller, which counts India as its largest market by users, as some examples.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart-backed Indian payments services firm PhonePe is in advanced stages of talks to acquire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/samsung-venture-india-indusos/">Samsung-backed Indus OS</a>, a startup that operates an eponymous third-party Android app store, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The deal values Noida-headquartered Indus OS at $60 million, the source said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. The deal has yet to close. PhonePe and Indus OS didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Indian news outlet Entrackr <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/05/exclusive-phonepe-set-to-acquire-indus-os-for-60-mn/">first reported</a> about the development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indus OS powers several popular third-party Android stores including Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Store and provides partners with localized content and apps.</p>
<p>Late last year, Indus OS said it offered its partners 400,000 apps in English and 12 Indian languages. The seven-year-old startup, which has raised about $21 million to date and monetizes through ads, has amassed over 100 million users.</p>
<p>The startup plans to launch an app store for individual users once Google begins accepting third-party app stores, another source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>It remains unclear why PhonePe is interested in Indus OS&#8217; offering. The Bangalore-based startup has long offered its own mini app store on its app. A handful of firms &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/google-policy-cut-india-paytm-mini-app-store/">PhonePe rival Paytm</a> &#8212; have either launched or explored launching their own mini app stores in recent months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Project management has long been a people-led aspect of the workplace, but that has slowly been changing. Trends in automation, big data, and AI have not only ushered in a new wave of project management applications, but they have led to a stronger culture of people willing to use them. Today, one of the startups building a platform for the next generation of project management is announcing some funding &#8212; a sign of the traction it&#8217;s getting in the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forecast.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forecast</a>, a platform and startup of the same name that uses AI to help with project management and resource planning &#8212; put simply, it uses artificial intelligence to both &#8220;read&#8221; and integrate data from different enterprise applications in order to build a bigger picture of the project and potential outcomes &#8212; has raised $19 million to continue building out its business.</p>
<p>The company plans to use some of the funding to expand to the U.S., and some to continue building out its platform and business, headquartered in London with a development office also in Copenhagen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This funding, a Series A, comes less than a year after the startup&#8217;s commercial launch, and it was led by Balderton Capital, with previous investors Crane Ventures Partners, SEED Capital and Heartcore also participating.</p>
<p>Forecast closed a seed round in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 2019</a> and then launched just as the pandemic was kicking off. It was a time when some projects were indeed put on ice, but others that went ahead did so with more caution on all sorts of fronts &#8212; financial, organizational, and technical. It turned out to be a &#8220;right place, right time&#8221; moment for Forecast, a tool that plays directly into providing a technical platform to manage all of that in a better way, and it tripled revenues during the year. Its customers include the likes of the NHS, the Red Cross, Etain and more. It says over 150,000 projects have been created and run through its platform to date.</p>
<p>Project management &#8212; the process of planning what you need to do, assigning resources to the task and tracking how well all of that actually goes to plan &#8212; has long been stuck between a rock and a hard place in the world of work.</p>
<p>It can be essential to getting things done, especially when there are multiple departments or stakeholders involved; yet it&#8217;s forever an inexact science that often does not reflect all the complexities of an actual project, and therefore may not be as useful as it could or should be.</p>
<p>This was a predicament that founder and CEO Dennis Kayser knew all too well, having been an engineer and technical lead on a number of big projects himself. His pedigree is an interesting one: one of his early jobs was as a developer at Varien, where he built the first version of Magento. (The company was <a href="https://inchoo.net/magento/varien-is-now-magento-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually rebranded as Magento</a> and then <a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-inc-completes-acquisition-magento/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by eBay</a>, then <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151102006822/en/eBay-Completes-Sale-eBay-Enterprise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spun out</a>, then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/21/adobe-to-acquire-magento-for-1-6-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired again, this time by Adobe</a> for nearly $1.7 billion, and now a huge player in the world of e-commerce tools.) He also spent years as a consultant at IBM, where among other things he helped build and formulate the first versions of ikea.com.</p>
<p>In those and other projects, he saw the pitfalls of project management <em>not</em> done right &#8212; not just in terms of having the right people on a project at the right time, but the resource planning needed, better calculations of financial outcomes in the event of a decision going one way or the other, and so on.</p>
<p>(He didn&#8217;t say this outright, but I&#8217;m sure one of the points of contention was the fact that the first ikea.com site didn&#8217;t actually have any e-commerce in it, just a virtual window display of sorts. That would have been because Ikea wanted to keep people shopping in its stores, away from the efficiency of just buying the one thing you actually need and not the 10 you do not. Yes, there are plenty of ways now of recirculating people to buy more when you select one item for a shopping cart &#8212; something the likes of Amazon has totally mastered &#8212; but this was years ago when there was still even more opportunities for innovation than there are now. All of this is to say that you might very reasonably argue that had there been better project managing and resource planning tools to give forecasts of potential outcomes of one or another route taken, people advocating for a different approach could have made their case better. And maybe Ikea would have jumped on board with digital commerce far sooner than it did.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Typically you get a lot of spreadsheets, people scattered across different tools that include accounting, CRM, Gitlab and more,&#8221; Kayser said.</p>
<p>That became the impetus for trying to build something that can take all of that into account and make a project management tool that &#8212; rather than just being a way of accounting to a higher-up, or reflecting only what someone can be bothered to update in the system &#8212; something that can help a team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Connecting everything into our engine, we leverage data to understand what they are working on and what is the right thing to be working on, what the finances are looking like,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;So if you work in product, you can plan out who is where, and what resourcing you need, what kind of people and skills you require.&#8221; This is a more dynamic progression of some of the other newer tools that are being used for project management today, targeting, in his words, &#8220;people who graduate from Monday and Asana who need something ore robust, either because they have too many people working on a project or because its too complicated, there is just too much stuff to handle.&#8221;</p>
<p>More legacy tools he said that are used include Oracle &#8220;to some degree&#8221; and Mavenlink, which he describes as possibly Forecast&#8217;s closest competitor, &#8220;but its platform is aging.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently the Forecast platform has <a href="https://www.forecast.app/integrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some 26 integrations</a> of popular tools used for projects to produce its insights and intelligence, including Salesforce, Gitlab, Google Calendar, and, as it happens, Asana. But given how fragmented the market is, and the signals one might gain from any number of other resources and apps, I suspect that this list will grow as and when its customers need more supported, or Forecast works out what can be gleaned from different places to paint an even more accurate picture.</p>
<p>The result may not ever replace an actual human project manager, but certainly starts to then look like a &#8220;digital twin&#8221; (a phrase I have been hearing more and more these days) that will definitely help that person, and the rest of the team, work in a smarter way.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are really excited to be an early investor in Forecast,&#8221; said James Wise,  a partner at Balderton Capital, in a statement. “We share their belief that the next generation of SaaS products will be more than just collaboration tools, but use machine learning to actively solve problems for their users. The feedback we got from Forecast&#8217;s customers was quite incredible, both in their praise for the platform and in how much of a difference it had already made to their operations. We look forward to supporting the company to scale this impact going forward.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Payroll automation is not exactly the sexiest of startup areas but it’s a pretty decent business. The larger startup in the space is Payfit which has raised upwards of $208.4M to do something that lots of companies find quite painful. But Payfit does a lot of other things as well, potentially leaving it exposed. Now a startup aims to come along and hone in on the thorny issue of payroll automation, alone.</p>
<p>Founded by Jonas Bøgh Larsen and Emil Hagbarth Rasmussen, Danish firm <a href="https://www.pento.io/">Pento</a> has raised $15.6 million in a Series A funding led by General Catalyst. Also participating was Avid Ventures and the UK’s LocalGlobe. Existing investors Point Nine Capital, Moonfire Ventures, Hustle Fund, and Seedcamp also took part, alongside angels (see below). This latest funding takes the total raised by Pento to $18.4 million.</p>
<p>The startup claims 700 companies are using it including tech firms Pleo and Cuvva; large hospitality brands (Honest Burgers); and retail and e-commerce brands (Lacoste, Beauty Pie). Pento replaces spreadsheets etc and gives them cloud-based tools, real-time calculations, transparency, and online and telephone support.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pento co-founder and CEO, Jonas Bøgh Larsen told me: “The biggest process we&#8217;re replacing is payroll outsourcing where companies are outsourcing payroll to an accountant, which the vast majority of companies do in Europe. We automate the entire process from reporting to tax calculations to payments. So, what most other platforms or payable products do is basically just helping you calculate the right taxes and National Insurance, and so on. We also take care of the reporting. We also do payments, and we integrate the product to other HR products.”</p>
<p>Adam Valkin, Managing Director at General Catalyst said: &#8220;Despite being so business-critical, payroll is one of the least digitally advanced services across the globe. It’s also one that has garnered a reputation for being too complex, too convoluted and too out of reach for those who aren’t payroll specialists, leading many to consider expensive outsourcing as the only route to go. Pento dispels this myth because it’s built purely with HR and finance teams in mind, by business leaders who truly understand the frustrations involved. It’s easy-to-use, transparent, flexible, secure and affordable. It’s what payroll should be in a modern company and it represents the future of employee compensation.”</p>
<p>Pento’s angel are from Stripe (Thairu and Diede van Lamoen), Monzo (Tom Blomfield), GoCardless (Matt Robinson), Zoom (Eric Yuan), Cuvva (Freddy Macnamara), Intercom (Des Traynor) and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A.I.-powered voice transcription service <a href="https://otter.ai/">Otter.ai</a> wants to make it even easier for its business users to record their meetings. The company is today introducing a new feature, Otter Assistant, which can automatically join the Zoom meetings on your calendar, transcribe the conversations, and share the notes with other participants. Though Otter.ai is already integrated with Zoom, the assistant is designed to make using transcription something you don&#8217;t have to constantly remember to enable at the meeting&#8217;s start or stop at the end, while also serving as a place where participants can collaborate by asking questions, sharing photos and more, as the meeting is underway.</p>
<p>The feature also works around the earlier limitation with Zoom, where only the meeting host could use the Otter.ai integration directly.</p>
<p>The idea to automate meeting transcription makes sense for the remote work environment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/boosted-by-the-pandemic-meeting-transcription-service-otter-ai-raises-50m/">created by the pandemic</a>, where people have been splitting their time between work, parenting, homeschooling and other duties. This can often lead to meetings where users are pulled away and miss things that had been said. That&#8217;s one area where Otter.ai can help. But it can also help with issues like overlapping meetings, or larger meetings were only a few topics are directly relevant to your work &#8212; but where you&#8217;d like to be able to review the rest of the meeting discussion later, instead of in real-time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To use the new Otter Assistant, users first synchronize their Google Calendar or Microsoft Calendar with Otter&#8217;s service. The assistant will then automatically join all Zoom meetings going forward, where it appears as an additional meeting participant, for transparency&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>The assistant also posts a link to the transcription in the Zoom chat for everyone to access. In other words, this is not a feature to use to skip meetings without your boss knowing &#8212; it&#8217;s designed for those times when everyone has already agreed the meeting will be transcribed.</p>
<p>As the meeting continues, attendees can use Otter&#8217;s live transcript to highlight key parts, add photos, and make notes. They can also ask questions via the commenting feature, as opposed to speaking up &#8212; which may be helpful if you&#8217;re in a noisy place at the time of the meeting.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jzbRLczOk1w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Once the assistant is enabled, you don&#8217;t have to remember to turn on Otter.ai for each meeting, and you can even use your headphones to listen to the meeting in progress. The Otter Assistant will still be able to record both sides of the conversation.</p>
<p>However, you are able to turn Otter Assistant off on a per-meeting basis via the &#8220;My Agenda&#8221; section on the Otter website, which will include new toggles next to each meeting you have scheduled.</p>
<p>When meetings wrap, you can also have Otter.ai configured to automatically share the meeting notes with all the attendees.</p>
<p>The Otter Assistant is available to Otter.ai Business users, which are <a href="https://otter.ai/pricing">upgraded plans </a>that start at $20 per month, and include features like two-factor authentication, SOC2 compliance, advanced search, export, custom vocabulary, shared speaker identification, centralized data and billing, and more.</p>
<p>To date, Otter.ai says it has transcribed over 150 million meetings, up from 100 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/a-i-powered-transcription-service-otter-ai-can-now-record-from-google-meet/">in the beginning of 2021</a> . The company doesn&#8217;t provide details on its total subscriber base, but did note earlier it saw a sizable 8x increase in revenues in 2020, leading up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/boosted-by-the-pandemic-meeting-transcription-service-otter-ai-raises-50m/">its $50 million Series B, announced in February.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BTHUNvsf3jM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>In the early days of social media, all things seemed possible. Twitter was this weird reboot of blogs, with a social layer atop an RSS feed that gave authority to last in/first out musings by providing data not just about read or unread but shared by who. You could take that authority data and rank posts by who shared them and who followed those people and what they in turn recommended. Although this was mostly ignored at the time by vendors and writers looking for a viral eyeball payoff, for those looking to support new talent there was something more valuable than reach.</p>
<p>Something like that could happen with Clubhouse and newsletters. On this week&#8217;s edition of the Gillmor Gang, recorded just over a week ago, we talk about Clubhouse, the Facebook advisory board and its siderstep of the Trump deplatforming, and early stuff I can never quite remember because the show always takes a bit too long to fully get up to speed. I&#8217;d apologize for this, but the apology would take too long to reach sincerity sufficient to not make things worse. This by the way is why newsletters exist — to save time scouring the Web and cable news for a sufficient return on investment, as in &#8220;well there&#8217;s another [duration] I&#8217;ll never get back.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Temporal time displacement suffered a serious blow at the hands of HBO Max and its strategy of releasing theater-less blockbusters on the streaming network in 2021 but only intermittently moving forward. As the CDC noted in a confusing but welcome announcement this past Thursday, vaccines are making possible a safe return to theaters in the near future. Soon it will be possible to be confused about the movie Tenet on the big screen. It is not a spoiler to say that Tenet is all about moving through time in the normal forward but also the incomprehensible backward. Time travel stories are invariably brought to a complete standstill when how this works is explained. The only thing harder to do is find a way to end a Saturday Night Live sketch. The only rationale appears to be that the sketch is over, like a bad pun not even worthy of a groan.</p>
<p>Speaking as I was of Clubhouse, we tried it out last Wednesday with Keith Teare and a brief drive-by from Brent Leary. Somehow we were in Hallway mode, which actually captured the feel of the thing nicely. Being in experimental mood, I added anyone who showed up as a speaker whether they wanted to or not. The result felt like a remnant of my childhood in Woodstock, NY, where we were part of a party line with nearby neighbors. You&#8217;d be talking with someone and suddenly realize someone else was on the line, interrupting to basically say they needed to make a more important call. Awkward but oddly exhilarating, as you realized the potential of not only lurking but lurked. I&#8217;m not sure how this is useful or not, but remember that @mentions and retweets were invented not by Twitter but by users. And using Twitter like a party line turned out to be the true superpower of the social network. On Clubhouse, if no one had anything to say, they were quiet. It was very peaceful.</p>
<p>Another pleasant surprise was a listener/speaker from Manchester, England who professed to being a longtime listener to the Gang. He and Keith, also from Manchester, started talking about Manchester United, an important football team I know nothing about. An old friend from the conference circuit popped in and our producer/director Tina Chase Gillmor somehow started up a conversation about my alleged style as a writer. Talking about me is easily my least favorite thing to do, but having others do the job is high on my most list. It&#8217;s also acutely reminiscent of the tech conference hallway conversation stubbed out by the pandemic. I now started to understand why Hallway mode was so-called. It&#8217;s the grease of the wheel business rides on. Follow the Gillmor Gang club on Clubhouse and you&#8217;ll be notified about our next experiment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Kia EV6, an all-electric crossover that kicks off the automaker&#8217;s Plan S strategy to shift away from internal combustion engines and toward EVs, will come to the U.S. early next year, the company said Tuesday evening during a live streamed event in New York.</p>
<p>The EV6 is the first dedicated battery-electric vehicle to built on its new Electric-Global Modular Platform, a platform that is shared with Hyundai and Genesis as part of the Hyundai Motor Group. The EGM-platform is the underlying foundation of the new Hyundai Ioniq 5 compact crossover. And it&#8217;s one of 11 electric vehicles that Kia plans to deliver globally by 2026.</p>
<p>Kia said its new dedicated battery electric vehicles will all start with the &#8220;EV&#8221; prefix. A number will follow &#8220;EV&#8221; to indicate the vehicle&#8217;s position in the lineup. That puts the EV6 somewhere in the middle of its upcoming lineup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the global debut held earlier this year provided <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/kias-electric-vehicle-plans-take-shape-with-ev6-teaser-new-naming-strategy/">many of the details</a>, a few new nuggets of information were shared, including that customers can make reservations for 1,500 first edition versions of the EV6 beginning June 3. The automaker has not revealed pricing for any of the vehicle trims.</p>
<p>The EV6 First Edition will be similar to the base model with lots of techie add-ons, including an augmented reality head-up display, remote smart parking assist feature, 14-speaker Meridian audio system and a two-year subscription to SiriusXM. There will be notable mechanical and exterior differences as well, including a wide sunroof, 20-inch wheels, dual-motor AWD and a 77.4 kWh battery.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154505" style="width: 1360px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154505" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2154505 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg" alt="" width="1350" height="900" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg 1350w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154505" class="wp-caption-text">2022 EV6 <strong>Image credit</strong>: Kia</p></div></p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>Kia designed the EV6 to look and perform like a roomy sports car. The four-door crossover has a low front end that moves up into a roofline, giving it coupe-like profile. The LED headlights have a segmented pattern and the traditional grille found on internal combustion engine vehicles is gone.</p>
<p>The EV6 has the same 114.2-inch wheelbase as the Kia Telluride, which gives some sense of its size.</p>
<p>The Kia EV6 will come with two Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese battery pack options — a 58 kWh or 77.4 kWh — with the larger one providing a targeted range of 300 miles. The vehicle is offered in both rear-wheel and AWD, which depending on the electric motor and battery configuration delivers between 167 and 313 horsepower. The EV6 GT, an AWD model that comes with the larger battery and powerful front and rear electric motors, delivers 567 horsepower. The GT model, which won&#8217;t be available until late 2022, can travel from 0 to 60 mph in less than 3.5 seconds.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, is that the vehicle supports 400-volt and 800-volt DC charging. Kia claims that 800v DC fast charging from a 350-kW charger can add up to 210 miles to the battery in under 18 minutes.</p>
<p>Kia loaded up on various charging features. The EV6 has an onboard 11 kW charger for Level 2 charging that will power up the battery in about seven hours. There&#8217;s also what Kia calls vehicle-to-load functionality, which is jargony way of saying the EV6 can be a power source for appliances, tools and devices like a computer. It works by taking electricity from the battery to a charging control unit, which provides 1900 watts of power.</p>
<p>The user is able to plug into that power via a 100v outlet located in a socket on front of second row seat base. If the battery is fully charged, Kia says power  can be drawn from the vehicle for 36 or more consecutive hours. It can also be used to charge vehicle-to-vehicle, albeit at 1.1 kW, which is a glacial pace that is equivalent to a 110V charger.</p>

<p>There are numerous other driver assistance, safety and in-car tech features as well. Inside the vehicle, are two 12-inch screens that form a curved display and house the instrument cluster and infotainment center. There is Bluetooth functionality and wireless smartphone charging, which has become standard fare in modern vehicles.</p>
<p>For an extra fee, customers can add on a Wi-FI hotspot and the ability to update the maps and infotainment system software wirelessly. Other features include a in-car commerce feature called Kia Pay, a stolen vehicle recovery tracker, smartwatch accessibility that provides battery status, vehicle notifications and certain vehicle control through Apple and Android smartwatches and connected car functions for weather and routing.</p>
<p>Customers are also able to use Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant through a smart speaker integration to remotely control vehicle functions such as remote start.</p>
<p>Four cameras outside of the vehicle give a 360-degree view and help with to detect obstructions while parking along with several other safety features including a safe exit assist that alerts the driver or passengers opening the door to not exit if the system spots approaching traffic.</p>
<p>There is also 21 standard active advanced driver assistance systems including a feature that keeps a set distance from a car in front and centers the EV6 in the lane. A newer version of this feature will be able to assist with assist with lane changes and adjust the lateral position of the car within the lane, according to Kia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ut-ec.co.jp/english/">The University of Tokyo Edge Capital Partners (UTEC)</a>, a deep-tech investment firm, announced the first close of its fifth fund, which is expected to total 30 billion JPY (or about $275 million USD) by June 2021. UTEC currently has about $780 million in total assets under management, and says this makes it one of the largest venture capital funds focused on science and tech in Japan, and one of the largest deep-tech funds in Asia.</p>
<p>UTEC is an independent firm that works closely with universities. It is associated with The University of Tokyo (UTokyo), where it has a partnership with its Technology Licensing Office (TLO) to spin off and invest in companies that originated as research projects. It has also worked with researchers from Waseda University, Kyoto University, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Cambridge University, the National University of Singapore and the Indian Institute of Technology, among other institutions.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, UTEC focuses on three areas: healthcare and life sciences, information technology and physical sciences and engineering. More specifically, it is looking for tech that addresses some of the most important issues in Japan, including an aging population, labor shortage and the digitization of legacy industries.</p>
<p>“UTEC 5 will allow us to provide more funds from seed/early to pre-IPO/M&amp;A stages in Japan and worldwide, on a wider scale and in a more consistent manner,” said managing partner and president Tomotaka Goji in a statement. “I believe this will further help our startups expand to address the global issues of humankind.”</p>

<p>The firm also partners with other funds, including Arch Venture Partners and Blume Ventures, to find investment opportunities around the world.</p>
<p>UTEC&#8217;s portfolio already includes more than 80 Japanese startups and 30 startups from other places, including the United States, India, Southeast Asia and Europe. So far, 25 of its investments have exited. Thirteen went public and now have an aggregated market cap of about $15 billion, and 12 were through mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Some of its exits include 908 Devices, a mass spectrometry company that <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/research-device-developer-908-devices-raises-range-to-%2418-to-%2419-ahead-of-%24116-million-ipo">went public on Nasdaq last year</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/18/fyusion-is-bringing-3d-vision-technologies-to-a-device-near-you/">Fyusion</a>, a computer vision startup <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cox-automotive-acquires-fyusion-301200890.html">acquired by Cox Automotive</a>; and Phyzios, which was <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/google-acquires-phyzios--1e577118">acquired by Google in 2013</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.studentfinance.com/">StudentFinance</a> &#8212; which allows educational institutions to offer success-based financing for students &#8212; has raised a $5.3 million (€4.5 million) seed round co-led by Giant Ventures and Armilar Venture Partners. It’s now raised $6.6 million total, to date.</p>
<p>StudentFinance launched in Spain first, followed by Germany and Finland, with the U.K. planned this year. Existing investors Mustard Seed Maze and Seedcamp, along with Sabadell Venture Capital, also participated.</p>
<p>The startup, which launched at the beginning of 2020, provides the tech back end for institutions to offer flexible payment plans in the form of ISAs (income-share agreements). It also provides data intelligence on the employment market to predict job demand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It now has 35 education providers signed up, managing over €5 million worth of ISAs. It also works with upskilling platforms including Ironhack and Le Wagon. StudentFinance’s competitors include (in the USA) Blair, Leif, Vemo Education, Chancen (Germany-based) and EdAid (U.K.-based).</p>
<p>As for why StudentFinance stands out from those companies, Mariano Kostelec, co-founder and CEO of StudentFinance, said: “StudentFinance is the only platform in this space providing the full end-to-end, cross-border infrastructure to deliver ISAs for students whilst helping to plug the growing skills gap. Not only do we provide the infrastructure to support the ISA financing model, but we also provide data intelligence on the employment market and a career-as-a-service platform that focuses on placing students in the right job. We are creating an equilibrium between supply and demand.”</p>
<p>With an ISA, students only start paying back tuition once they are employed and earning above a minimum income threshold, with payments structured as a percentage of their earnings. This makes it a &#8220;success-based model&#8221;, says StudentFinance, which shifts the risk away from the students. They are likely to be popular as workers need to reskill with the onset of digitization and the pandemic’s effects.</p>
<p>The startup was founded in 2019 by Kostelec, Marta Palmeiro, Sergio Pereira and Miguel Santo Amaro. Kostelec and Santo Amaro previously built Uniplaces, which raised $30 million as a student housing platform in Europe.</p>
<p>Cameron Mclain, managing partner of Giant Ventures, commented: “What StudentFinance has built empowers any educational institution to offer ISAs as an alternative to upfront tuition or student loans, broadening access to education and opportunity.”</p>
<p>Duarte Mineiro, partner at Armilar Venture Partners, commented: “StudentFinance is a great opportunity to invest in because aside from its very compelling core purpose, this is a sound business where its economics are backed by a solid proprietary software technology.”</p>
<p>Sia Houchangnia, partner at Seedcamp, commented: “The need for reskilling the workforce has never been as acute as it is today and we believe StudentFinance has an important role to play in tackling this societal challenge.”</p>
<p>Angel backers include investors, which includes: Victoria van Lennep (founder of Lendable); Martin Villig (founder of Bolt); Ed Vaizey (the U.K.’s longest-serving Culture &amp; Digital Economy Minister); Firestartr (U.K.-based early-stage VC); Serge Chiaramonte (U.K. fintech investor); and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By the end of the year, more than 10 car models from Volvo, GM, Renault and Polestar will be powered by the Android Automotive operating system — and all of the built-in Google apps and services that come with it. Now, the company is making it easier for third-party developers to bring their navigation, EV charging, parking and media apps directly to a car&#8217;s screen.</p>
<p>Google announced Tuesday at its annual developer conference that it&#8217;s extending its <a href="https://developer.android.com/cars">Android for Cars App Library</a>, which is available as part of Jetpack, to support the Android Automotive operating system. This is good news for developers who can now create an app that is compatible with two different, but sometimes overlapping platforms: Android OS and Android Auto. It also means developers can create one app that should work seamlessly between various makes and models of vehicles.</p>
<p>Google said Tuesday it is already working with Early Access Partners, including Parkwhiz, Plugshare, Sygic, ChargePoint, Flitsmeister, SpotHero and others to bring apps in these categories to cars powered by Android Automotive OS.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2154493" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PlugShare.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154493" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2154493 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PlugShare.gif" alt="PlugShare Google Android Automotive OS" width="1600" height="960" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154493" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Android Automotive OS shouldn’t be confused with Android Auto, which is a secondary interface that lies on top of an operating system. Android Auto is an app that runs on the user&#8217;s phone and wirelessly communicates with the vehicle&#8217;s infotainment system. Meanwhile, Android Automotive OS is modeled after its open-source mobile operating system that runs on Linux. But instead of running smartphones and tablets, Google modified it so automakers could use it in their cars.  Google has offered an open-source version of this OS to automakers for sometime. But in recent years automakers have worked with the tech company to natively build in an Android OS that is embedded with all the Google apps and services such as Google Assistant, Google Maps and the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>Many third-party developers like Spotify have used the Android for Cars App Library to create and publish their Android Auto apps to the Play Store. By extending the Cars App to the operating system, developers will only need to build once.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Google opened its Android Automotive operating system to third-party developers to bring music and other entertainment apps into vehicle infotainment systems. Polestar 2, the all-electric vehicle developed by Volvo’s standalone electric performance brand, was the first. And more have followed, including the Volvo XC40 Recharge.</p>
<p>Companies interested in participating in the early access program will have to fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qu-KzNZH260dbZlDSXEHMkd1iqm2fMv2AoFxPozeXgs/viewform?resourcekey=0-tLnNLS30DedMsLJKmVstfw&amp;edit_requested=true">this interest form</a>, according to Google.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roofer Pro. Roof Snap. Acculynx. There&#8217;s suddenly no shortage of companies offering software to make easier the lives of roofers and their customers. Among these is <a href="https://roofr.com/">Roofr</a>, a five-year-old, San Francisco-based, 31-person sales platform for roofing contractors that just raised $4.25 million in post-seed funding led by Bullpen Capital, with participation from Avidbank and previous backer Crosslink Capital.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Rich Nelson is aware of the competition. But as a third-generation roofer by trade, he also knows well that the industry is far from overcoming its reputation as rife with sketchy, flaky contractors whose customers often question whether they need a new roof or suspect the estimates they are given are wildly inflated.</p>
<p>He also knows &#8212; as do his investors &#8212; how big a market opportunity Roofr and its rivals are chasing. &#8220;It&#8217;s a massive, massive market,&#8221; says Nelson. &#8220;On average, every year, roughly five million buildings in the U.S. have their roof replaced,&#8221; and they spend $50 billion toward that end, he says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Right now, Roofr is focused exclusively on helping close that initial sale. It all starts with a picture of a roof that Roofr obtains from partner companies like <a href="https://www.nearmap.com/us/en">Nearmap</a>, whose planes cover cities at low altitude to take high-definition pictures, including of roofs. Roofr software then allows these contractors to draw their own roof measurement reports through these drone, blueprint and satellite images and produce a report, or they can pay Roofr $10 per report to measure the roof for them.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, COVID-19 made the software more attractive to both roofing contractors and customers who weren&#8217;t keen on being in close proximity during the pandemic. Offerings like Roofr&#8217;s made it possible to quickly and easily send a potential customer a quote without visiting the job site. The bet now is that growing awareness over the product will continue to fuel that momentum.</p>
<p>The company also has new offerings in the pipeline that may make it more compelling to both roofers and their clients. In addition to quickly providing roofers with measurement data, for example, roofers can now pay a monthly fee to have Roofr auto-populate an estimate based on a specific materials list, as well as the profit margin the roofer wants to incorporate; it also now provides and preserves digital contracts.</p>
<p>As for its current customer base, Nelson says that it includes the largest roofing contractors in North America, but that Roofr is even more interested in small businesses, which, while fragmented, represent a much bigger opportunity. He says that there are more than 100,000 registered roofing businesses in the U.S., and that the vast majority are comprised of five employees or fewer. (Roofr also sells its software to independent insurance adjusters.)</p>
<p>The new round brings Roofr&#8217;s total funding to $8.25 million. Crosslink led its initial seed round in early 2019. Roofr also raised money from Y Combinator when it passed through the accelerator program in 2017.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>As summer kicks into gear, the IPO market is mimicking the season by cranking up its temperature. Today, TechCrunch explored the IPO filings from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/inside-marqetas-fascinating-fintech-ipo/">venture-backed Marqeta</a> and <a href="https://t.co/XUZg5g5s0L">software startup WalkMe</a>. Squarespace direct lists later this week, along with public debuts from Oatly and Procore on Thursday. All this is great news for late-stage startups and their backers. Not to mention lots of tech workers around the world.</p>
<p>Also today, the fine folks at the <a href="https://www.webbyawards.com/">Webbys</a> announced that TechCrunch’s flagship podcast, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/equity-podcast/">Equity</a>, is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/techcrunchs-equity-podcast-wins-a-webby-award/">best of its kind</a> in the technology category. We’re stoked! &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-i-o-2021/"><strong>Google hosts its yearly developer event</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">advertising</span> search company kicked off its yearly developer confab today, with the remote event showing off new tech including the ability to have a conversation with Pluto. Or a paper airplane. In more serious terms, Google has new AI chips that look pretty darn cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/expensify-ec1-culture/"><strong>Our deep-dive into Expensify continues</strong></a><strong>:</strong> As Expensify gets closer and closer to its public offering, TechCrunch’s coverage of the company’s history and growth continues. In today’s entry we also got to feature my favorite quote in years. Per CEO David Barrett, “Basically everyone is wrong about basically everything.” Agreed.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/piano-raises-88m-for-analytics-subscription-and-personalization-tools-for-publishers-adds-linkedin-as-investor/"><strong>Piano shows there’s big money in subscription tech</strong></a><strong>:</strong> We have a sheaf of funding round below, but the Piano deal stood out as it’s actually tech we use at TechCrunch. So, we’re super familiar with it. The news is that Piano has just closed an $88 million round, a deal that includes <em>LinkedIn</em> as an investor. Both the dollar amount <em>and</em> the investor list that the transaction sports are notable.</p>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>TechCrunch covered our usual daily delivery of funding rounds today, a list that skewed later-stage today. So, from the land of big dollars:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/explorium-scores-75m-series-c-just-10-months-after-b-round/"><strong>Explorium scores $75M Series C</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This new deal comes less than a year after Explorium closed its Series B round, so something is happening at the company that has investors taking note. In short, Explorium helps “data pros find the best data for a given model” according to our own Ron Miller. And it’s apparently big business.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/extend-raises-260m-on-a-1-6b-valuation-to-expand-its-warranty-and-protection-plan-services/"><strong>Extend raises $260M at a $1.6B valuation</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The warranty space is pretty hot at the moment. Just days after M25-backed Upsie <a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/consumer-warranty-startup-scoops-up-182m">raised an $18.2 million round</a>, Extend picked up just over 14x as much capital to help retailers and brands offer warranties more efficiently, and, as Ingrid Lunden reports, help “consumers buy and file claims against them.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/fintech-startup-vise-raises-65-million-in-series-c-led-by-ribbit-capital/"><strong>Vise raises $65M Series C</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The fintech world is hot, but not only when it comes to backend-infra services like Plaid, or shiny consumer plays like Chime. Vise provides portfolio-crunching services to indie financial advisors (hence its name, we presume), and has made enough process since its last round to entice Ribbit Capital to lead its latest private cash infusion.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/klaviyo-series-d/"><strong>Klaviyo raises $320M at a $9.5B valuation</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Recent EC-1 subject Klaviyo’s latest round is proof that email is far, far from dead. The email marketing company told TechCrunch that its customer count “doubled over the past 12 months and [that it] now serves over 70,000 paying customers, a more than 110% increase from 2019.” That explains the new raise, and its nearly decacorn valuation.</p>
<p>In the honorable mention category, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/styra-the-startup-behind-open-policy-agent-nabs-40m-to-expand-its-cloud-native-authorization-tools/">Styra raised $40 million</a> (it’s best known for Open Policy Agent), commission-free trading startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/commission-free-trading-app-stake-secures-30m-from-tiger-global-to-expand-into-europe/">Stake raised $30 million</a> to expand in Europe, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/beta-technologies-adds-368-million-in-series-a-funding-for-its-electric-aviation-ecosystem/">Beta Technologies raised $368 million</a> to keep working on electric airplanes.</p>
<h2>Want to double your rate of return? Seek counsel from experienced executives</h2>
<p>As a rule of thumb, it takes 7-8 years for a successful startup to achieve an exit. But there&#8217;s a simple way to speed up the clock: Bring in one or more founders who have previous executive experience.</p>
<p>According to data gathered by Rob Olson, partner and head of data strategy at venture engine M13, startups that have two or more experienced founders tend to exit 33% faster and raise 34% less capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Combined, these two improvements can nearly double an investor’s rate of return,&#8221; says Olson.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today’s Big Tech news is all about Google and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-i-o-2021/">I/O event</a>. If you are super busy and just want the highlights, here you go:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI: </strong>Google has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-launches-the-next-generation-of-its-custom-ai-chips/">new AI chips</a> that it is super proud of, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-cloud-launches-vertex-a-new-managed-machine-learning-platform/">announced Vertex AI</a>, a “new managed machine learning platform that is meant to make it easier for developers to deploy and maintain their AI models.” Keep in mind how competitive and cutthroat the public cloud world is. Here’s Google taking a stand from third place in that particular scrap.</li>
<li><strong>Android: </strong>We all knew that Android was popular, but I have to admit that I did not expect the software service to have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/android-now-powers-3b-devices/">found a home in some 3,000,000,000 devices</a>. That’s nearly one device for every two humans and Google is keeping the ball rolling by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/">teasi</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/">ng</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/"> Android’s 12 iteration at I/O</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Canvas:</strong> Google’s various productivity apps are getting needed love, the company announced. In the mix is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-interconnects-its-workspace-apps-adds-a-dozen-new-features/">news about Smart canvas</a>, which we described as a “set of new collaborative workspace tools.” What matters more than any single point of news about Docs and friends is that Google is not giving up on them. Which means that, for those of us like myself who live in Google’s productivity suite, we have goodies coming. Good.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you pour through the news out of Google I/O, we wondered … <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/">does the latest Android 12 preview</a> make you want to switch from an iPhone? <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1394724650857476098">Let us know.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year&#8217;s I/O event from Google was heavy on the &#8220;we&#8217;re building something cool&#8221; and light on the &#8220;here&#8217;s something you can use or buy tomorrow.&#8221; But there were also some interesting surprises from the semi-live event held in and around the company&#8217;s Mountain View campus. Read on for all the interesting bits.</p>
<h2>Android 12 gets a fresh new look and some quality of life features</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve known Android 12 was on its way for months, but<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/"> today was our first real look</a> at the next big change for the world&#8217;s most popular operating system. A new look, called Material You (yes), focuses on users, apps, and things like time of day or weather to change the UI&#8217;s colors and other aspects dynamically. Some security features like new camera and microphone use indicators are coming, as well as some &#8220;private compute core&#8221; features that use AI processes on your phone to customize replies and notifications. There&#8217;s a beta out today for the adventurous!</p>
<h2>Wow, Android powers 3 billion devices now</h2>
<p>Subhed says it all (but read more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/android-now-powers-3b-devices/">here</a>). Up from 2 billion in 2017.</p>
<h2>Smart Canvas smushes Docs, productivity, and video calls together</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2153963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="676" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg 1292w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg?resize=768,507 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg?resize=680,449 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Millions of people and businesses use Google&#8217;s suite of productivity and collaboration tools, but the company felt it would be better if they weren&#8217;t so isolated. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-interconnects-its-workspace-apps-adds-a-dozen-new-features/">Now with Smart Canvas</a> you can have a video call as you work on a shared doc together and bring in information and content from your Drive and elsewhere. Looks complicated, but potentially convenient.</p>
<h2>AI conversations get more conversational with LaMDA</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a little too easy to stump AIs if you go off script, asking something in a way that to you seems normal but to the language model is totally incomprehensible. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/googles-lamda-makes-conversations-with-ais-more-conversational/">Google&#8217;s LaMDA is a new natural language processing technique</a> that makes conversations with AI models more resilient to unusual or unexpected queries, making it more like a real person and less like a voice interface for a search function. They demonstrated it by showing conversations with anthropomorphized versions of Pluto and a paper airplane. And yes, it was exactly as weird as it sounds.</p>
<h2>Google built a futuristic 3D video calling booth</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154178" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most surprising things at the keynote had to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-is-making-a-3d-life-size-video-calling-booth/">Project Starline, a high-tech 3D video call setup</a> that uses Google&#8217;s previous research and Lytro DNA to show realistic 3D avatars of people on both sides of the system. It&#8217;s still experimental but looks very promising.</p>
<h2>Wear OS gets a revamp and lots of health-focused apps</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2154142" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154142" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2154142" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154142" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Few people want to watch a movie on their smartwatch, but lots of people like to use it to track their steps, meditation, and other health-related practices. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/after-closing-fitbit-acquisition-google-is-going-big-with-wear-os/">Wear OS is getting a bunch of Fitbit DNA infused</a>, with integrated health tracking stuff and a lot of third party apps like Calm and Flo.</p>
<h2>Samsung and Google announce a unified smartwatch platform</h2>
<p>These two mobile giants have been fast friends in the phone world for years, but when it comes to wearables, they&#8217;ve remained rivals. In the face of Apple&#8217;s utter dominance in the smartwatch space, however, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-and-samsung-are-teaming-up-to-take-on-apples-watchos/">the two have put aside their differences</a> and announced they&#8217;ll work on a &#8220;unified platform&#8221; so developers can make apps that work on both Tizen and Wear OS.</p>
<h2>And they&#8217;re working together on foldables too</h2>
<p>Apparently Google and Samsung realized that no one is going to buy foldable devices unless they do some really cool things, and that collaboration is the best way forward there. So the two companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-adds-foldable-focused-android-developer-updates/">will also be working together</a> to improve how folding screens interact with Android.</p>
<h2>Android TV hits 80 million devices and adds phone remote</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2153285" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Android-TV-Remote.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153285" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153285" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Android-TV-Remote.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="563" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153285" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The smart TV space is a competitive one, and after a few starts Google has really made it happen with Android TV, which the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/android-tv-os-reaches-80m-monthly-active-devices-adds-new-features/">announced had reached 80 million monthly active devices</a> — putting it, Roku, and Amazon (the latter two with around 50 million monthly active <em>accounts</em>) all in the same league. The company also showed off a powerful new phone-based remote app that will (among other things) make putting in passwords way better than using the d-pad on the clicker. Developers will be glad to hear there&#8217;s a new Google TV emulator and Firebase Test Lab will have Android TV support.</p>
<h2>Your Android phone is now (also) your car key</h2>
<p>Well, assuming you have a really new Android device with a UWB chip in it. Google is working with BMW first, and other automakers soon most likely, to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/with-android-12-google-will-turn-your-smartphone-into-a-car-key/">a new method for unlocking the car when you get near it</a>, or exchanging basic commands without the use of a fob or Bluetooth. Why not Bluetooth you ask? Well, Bluetooth is old. UWB is new.</p>
<h2>Vertex collects machine learning development tools in one place</h2>
<p>Google and its sibling companies are both leaders in AI research and popular platforms for others to do their own AI work. But its machine learning development tools have been a bit scattershot — useful but disconnected. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-cloud-launches-vertex-a-new-managed-machine-learning-platform/">Vertex is a new development platform for enterprise AI</a> that puts many of these tools in one place and integrates closely with optional services and standards.</p>
<h2>There&#8217;s a new generation of Google&#8217;s custom AI chips</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154252" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="656" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg 1666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=768,492 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=1536,985 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Google does a lot of machine learning stuff. Like, a LOT a lot. So they are constantly working to make better, more efficient computing hardware to handle the massive processing load these AI systems create. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-launches-the-next-generation-of-its-custom-ai-chips/">TPUv4 is the latest</a>, twice as fast as the old ones, and will soon be packaged into 4,096-strong pods. Why 4,096 and not an even 4,000? The same reason any other number exists in computing: powers of 2.</p>
<h2>And they&#8217;re powering some new Photos features including one that&#8217;s horrifying</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2154063" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154063" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2154063" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg" alt="cinematic google photo" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154063" class="wp-caption-text">NO THANK YOU</p></div></p>
<p>Google Photos is a great service, and the company is trying to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-photos-update-adds-new-memories-and-a-locked-folder-previews-cinematic-moments/">leverage the huge library of shots most users have</a> to find patterns like &#8220;selfies with the family on the couch&#8221; and &#8220;traveling with my lucky hat&#8221; as fun ways to dive back into the archives. Great! But they&#8217;re also taking two photos taken a second apart and having an AI hallucinate what comes between them, leading to a truly weird looking form of motion that shoots deep, deep into the uncanny valley, from which hopefully it shall never emerge.</p>
<h2>Forget your password? Googlebot to the rescue</h2>
<p>Google&#8217;s &#8220;AI makes a hair appointment for you&#8221; service Duplex didn&#8217;t exactly set the world on fire, but the company has found a new way to apply it. If you forget your password, Duplex will automatically<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/chrome-now-uses-duplex-to-fix-your-stolen-passwords/"> fill in your old password, pick a new one and let you copy it</a> before submitting it to the site, all by interacting with the website&#8217;s normal reset interface. It&#8217;s only going to work on Twitter and a handful of other sites via Chrome for now, but hey, if it happens to you a lot, maybe it&#8217;ll save you some trouble.</p>

<p>The aged among our readers may remember Froogle, Google&#8217;s ill-fated shopping interface. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">Well, it&#8217;s back&#8230; kind of.</a> The plan is to include lots of product information, from price to star rating, availability and other info, right in the Google interface when you search for something. It sucks up this information from retail sites, including whether you have something in your cart there. How all this benefits anyone more than Google is hard to imagine, but naturally they&#8217;re positioning it as wins all around. Especially for new partner Shopify. (Me, I use DuckDuckGo.)</p>
<h2>Flutter cross-platform devkit gets an update</h2>
<p>A lot of developers have embraced Google&#8217;s Flutter cross-platform UI toolkit. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-updates-its-cross-platform-flutter-ui-toolkit/">The latest version, announced today</a>, adds some safety settings, performance improvements, and workflow updates. There&#8217;s lots more coming, too.</p>
<h2>Firebase gets an update too</h2>
<p>Popular developer platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-updates-firebase-with-new-personalization-features-security-tools-and-more/">Firebase got a bunch of new and updated features as well</a>. Remote Config gets a nice update allowing developers to customize the app experience to individual user types, and App Check provides a basic level of security against external threats. There&#8217;s plenty here for devs to chew on.</p>
<h2>The next version of Android Studio is Arctic Fox</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2153337" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153337" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153337" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png 1682w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png?resize=300,149 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png?resize=1536,765 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153337" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The beta for the next version of Google&#8217;s Android Studio environment is coming soon, and it&#8217;s called Arctic Fox. It&#8217;s got a brand new UI building toolkit called Jetpack Compose, and a bunch of accessibility testing built in to help developers make their apps more accessible to people with disabilities. Connecting to devices to test on them should be way easier now too. Oh, and there&#8217;s going to be a version of Android Studio for Apple Silicon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google offered an update on its TV platform, Android OS, at its Google I/O developer event on Tuesday. The company said its Android TV OS now reaches over 80 million monthly active devices, including through its new experience Google TV for Chromecast, as well as other platforms like smart TVs. The company also previewed a series of upcoming features for Android TV OS, including a remote control feature for consumers and several developer updates around casting, emulators, and more.</p>
<p>The company repositioned Android TV OS last fall with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-new-google-tv-brings-streaming-apps-live-tv-and-search-into-a-single-interface/">the introduction of the Google TV experience</a>. The new experience, which runs Android TV under the hood, now powers Chromecast with Google TV, smart TVs from Sony, and is coming soon to some TCL TVs. Over 80% of Android TV OS&#8217; growth came from the U.S., Google noted, when announcing its 80 million monthly active devices milestone during the Google I/O event.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s milestone may seem to put Android TV OS is ahead of rivals like Roku and Amazon Fire TV, with <a href="https://www-images-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/press/2021/1Q21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">53.6 million </a> and <a href="https://advertising.amazon.com/blog/amazon-advertisers-can-now-reach-up-to-50m-monthly-active-users-on-fire-tv">50+ million monthly active accounts</a>, respectively. However, these are different measurements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Android TV OS figures are actually calculated by counting the number of devices that were actively used in a month &#8212; which means a user with multiple devices could have those devices counted separately, but a family with multiple people watching on one device would be counted once.</p>
<p>Roku and Amazon define monthly active users as &#8220;accounts&#8221; that have been active during the month. That means, even if that account streams on several different devices during the time period, it would only be counted once. If Roku or Amazon were to calculate active devices as Google is doing, their numbers would be higher.</p>
<p>In addition, Roku and Amazon Fire TV power both their respective company&#8217;s own device lineup and select TVs from partners, but Google&#8217;s Android TV OS also powers devices and services from TV and streaming device brand <a href="https://www.android.com/tv/">partners</a> as well as TV service <a href="https://www.android.com/tv/">providers</a>. That means this global number includes operator-tier and set-top boxes also powered by Android TV OS. It&#8217;s a different type of market.</p>
<p>Google today also announced it&#8217;s adding remote control features directly in Android, so users will be able to control their TV even when their existing remote goes missing. This feature, arriving later this year, will make it easier to type in usernames and passwords or search for longer titles, Google notes. It will work for all users of Android TV OS, including Google TV.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153285" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153285" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2153285" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Android-TV-Remote.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153285" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, for those building Android TV experiences, the company announced a handful of new features coming soon. A Cast Connect feature will allow users to cast from their Chrome browser on their phone or tablet to an Android TV app. Stream Transfer and Stream Expansion will allow users to transfer media to other devices or play audio on multiple devices.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153288" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153288" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2153288" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153288" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google is also making its first Google TV Emulator available, running on Android 11, along with an Android 11 image with the traditional Android TV experience. And developers can now also use a remote that more closely mimics TV remotes directly within the Emulator.</p>
<p>Following developer requests, Firebase Test Lab is adding Android TV support, as well. Initially, Firebase Test Lab Virtual Devices will run the developer&#8217;s app in the cloud on Android TV emulators to scale a test across hundreds or thousands of virtual devices. Support for physical devices will come soon.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153286" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153286" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2153286" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="495" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg 1222w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg?resize=768,559 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg?resize=680,495 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153286" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, the Android 12 Beta 1 is being made available for TV on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/droid-tv/streaming-gaming/google-adt-3">its ADT-3 Developer Kit,</a> starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Düsseldorf-based proptech startup <a href="https://www.dabbel.eu">Dabbel</a> is using AI to drive energy efficiency savings in commercial buildings.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s developed cloud-based self-learning building management software that plugs into the existing building management systems (BMS) &#8212; taking over control of heating and cooling systems in a way that&#8217;s more dynamic than legacy systems based on fixed set-point resets.</p>
<p>Dabbel says its AI considers factors such as building orientation and thermal insulation, and reviews calibration decisions every five minutes &#8212; meaning it can respond dynamically to changes in outdoor and indoor conditions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 2018-founded startup claims this approach of layering AI-powered predictive modelling atop legacy BMS to power next-gen building automation is able to generate substantial energy savings &#8212; touting reductions in energy consumption of up to 40%.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every five minutes Dabbel reviews its decisions based on all available data,&#8221; explains CEO and co-founder, Abel Samaniego. &#8220;With each iteration, Dabbel improves or adapts and changes its decisions based on the current circumstances inside and outside the building. It does this by using cognitive artificial intelligence to drive a Model-Based Predictive Control (MPC) System&#8230; which can dynamically adjust all HVAC setpoints based on current/future conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>In essence, the self-learning system predicts ahead of time the tweaks that are needed to adapt for future conditions &#8212; saving energy vs a pre-set BMS that would keep firing the boilers for longer.</p>
<p>The added carrot for commercial building owners (or tenants) is that Dabbel squeezes these energy savings without the need to rip and replace legacy systems &#8212; nor, indeed, to install lots of IoT devices or sensor hardware to create a &#8216;smart&#8217; interior environment; the AI integrates with (and automatically calibrates) the existing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.</p>
<p>All that&#8217;s needed is Dabbel&#8217;s SaaS &#8212; and less than a week for the system to be implemented (it also says installation can be done remotely).</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no limitations in terms of Heating and Cooling systems,&#8221; confirms Samaniego, who has a background in industrial engineering and several years&#8217; experience automating high tech plants in Germany. &#8220;We need a building with a Building Management System in place and ideally a BACnet communication protocol.&#8221;</p>
<p>Average reductions achieved so far across the circa 250,000m² of space where its AI is in charge of building management systems are a little more modest but a still impressive 27%. (He says the maximum savings seen at some &#8220;peak times&#8221; is 42%.)</p>
<p>The touted savings aren&#8217;t limited to a single location or type of building/client, according to Dabbel, which says they&#8217;ve been &#8220;validated across different use cases and geographies spanning Europe, the U.S., China, and Australia&#8221;.</p>
<p>Early clients are facility managers of large commercial buildings &#8212; Commerzbank clearly sees potential, having incubated the startup via its early-stage investment arm &#8212; and several schools.</p>
<p>A further 1,000,000m² is in the contract or offer phase &#8212; slated to be installed &#8220;in the next six months&#8221;.</p>
<p>Dabbel envisages its tech being useful to other types of education institutions and even other use-cases. (It&#8217;s also toying with adding a predictive maintenance functionality to expand its software&#8217;s utility by offering the ability to alert building owners to potential malfunctions ahead of time.)</p>
<p>And as policymakers around the global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/startups-have-about-1-trillion-worth-of-reasons-to-love-the-biden-infrastructure-plan/">turn their attention</a> to how to achieve the very major reductions in carbon emissions that are needed to meet ambitious climate goals the energy efficiency of buildings certainly can&#8217;t be overlooked.</p>

<p>“The time for passive responses to addressing the critical issue of carbon emission reduction is over,&#8221; said Samaniego in a statement. &#8220;That is why we decided to take matters into our own hands and develop a solution that actively replaces a flawed human-based decision-making process with an autonomous one that acts with surgical precision and thanks to artificial intelligence, will only improve with each iteration.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the idea of hooking your building&#8217;s heating/cooling up to a cloud-based AI sounds a tad risky for Internet security reasons, Dabbel points out it&#8217;s connecting to the BMS network &#8212; not the (separate) IT network of the company/building.</p>
<p>It also notes that it uses one-way communication via a VPN tunnel &#8212; &#8220;creating an end-to-end encrypted connection under high market standards&#8221;, as Samaniego puts it.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup has just closed a €3.6 million (~$4.4M) pre-Series A funding round led by Target Global, alongside <a href="https://main-incubator.com/en/home/">main incubator</a> (Commerzbank’s early-stage investment arm), SeedX, plus some strategic angel investors.</span></p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Dr. Ricardo Schaefer, partner at Target Global, added: “We are enthusiastic to work with the team at Dabbel as they offer their clients a tangible and frictionless way to significantly reduce their carbon footprint, helping to close the gap between passive measurement and active remediation.”</p>

<p>Equity launched in March 2017 in a back room &#8212; a veritable closet, if you will! &#8212; at our old San Francisco office. Alex would come down once a week from his then-digs at Crunchbase News to join Katie Roof and Matt Lynley. Other hosts on our fun ride have included Kate Clark and our very own Connie Loizos.</p>
<p>We’ve got all kinds of podcast goodies up our award-winning sleeves and we hope you and five of your closest friends keep coming along for the ride.</p>
