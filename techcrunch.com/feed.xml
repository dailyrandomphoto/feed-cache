										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The French government and the government-backed initiative La French Tech <a href="https://lafrenchtech.com/fr/la-france-aide-les-startups/french-tech-120-2/">unveiled</a> the new indexes that identify the most promising French startups. The 40 top-performing startups are called the Next40, and the top 120 startups are grouped into the French Tech 120.</p>
<p>The Next40 and French Tech 120 are somewhat new as this is only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">the second version</a> of those indexes. Out of the 120 startups that were already in last year’s French Tech 120, 90 of them are still in this year’s index — 30 are newcomers as there were 123 startups in last year’s French Tech 120.</p>
<p>Combined, they generate close to €9 billion in revenue and provide a job to 37,500 people. Revenue in particular is up 55% compared to last year’s French Tech 120.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s a list of the French Tech 120 — the red logos are part of the Next40:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110214" style="width: 948px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110214" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png" alt="" width="938" height="626" class="size-full wp-image-2110214" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png 938w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110214" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> La French Tech</p></div></p>
<p>There are two different ways to get accepted in the Next40:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have raised more than €100 million over the past three years ($120 million at today’s rate) or you are a unicorn, which means your company’s valuation has reached $1 billion or more.</li>
<li>You generate more than €5 million in revenue with a year-over-year growth rate of 30% or more for the past three years.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the remaining 80 startups in the French Tech 120:</p>
<ul>
<li>40 of them have raised more than €20 million in a funding round over the past three years.</li>
<li>40 of them are selected based on the annual turnover and growth rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, those indexes are limited to private French companies. For the French Tech 120, there are at least two startups per administrative region.</p>
<p>Based on those metrics, only a handful of the startups in the French Tech 120 have a female CEO and the French government thinks tech startups should do more when it comes to diversity and inclusion. That’s why a small group of people are going to work on a roadmap and some recommendations to improve those numbers.</p>
<p>Representatives of six different startups in the French Tech 120 as well as people from <a href="https://www.wearesista.com">Sista</a>, <a href="http://www.techyourplace.fr">Tech Your Place</a> and <a href="https://www.futurepositivecapital.com">Future Positive Capital</a> will get together to work on those topics.</p>
<p>In addition to a cool logo for your website, being part of the French Tech 120 comes with some perks. Those companies can access a network of French Tech representatives in different public administrations.</p>
<p>For instance, it’s easier for your company if you want to get visas for foreign employees, obtain a certification or a patent, if you want to sell your product to a public administration, etc.</p>
<p>There are two new additions to the French Tech network. Someone from the <em>Conseil d’État</em> can help you when it comes to legal compliance. The government has also signed a partnership with Euronext to educate entrepreneurs about going public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank had some good data to report overnight <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/financials/financial_reports/financial-report_q3fy2020_01_en.pdf">with its third-quarter earnings</a>, which covers the last quarter of 2020 through December 31. The company’s first Vision Fund reported large gains driven by DoorDash, where the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/the-vc-and-founder-winners-of-doordashs-ipo/">$680 million investment blew up to just shy of $9 billion</a> — a 13.2x return in SoftBank’s math. While not the first exit from the fund nor the first high-returning exit SoftBank has had, it <i>is</i> the first exit that meaningfully shakes up the prognosis for the Vision Fund’s returns.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cWwsjHqN3U"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/the-vc-and-founder-winners-of-doordashs-ipo/">The VC and founder winners of DoorDash’s IPO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The VC and founder winners of DoorDash’s IPO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/the-vc-and-founder-winners-of-doordashs-ipo/embed/#?secret=cWwsjHqN3U" data-secret="cWwsjHqN3U" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now seems as good a time as any to ask a question we first started pondering when SoftBank launched the Vision Fund way back in 2017: what does a return profile look like at such a late stage of investment?</p>
<p>Early-stage venture capital has a return profile dubbed the “J-curve.” Given a cohort of startups in a venture portfolio, the failures of that cohort tend to materialize quite quickly. Those startups can’t raise money, and thus, they run out of runway and either die or are sold off. That means that the losses from those investments are recognized by investors right away. Meanwhile, the successful startups keep growing and raising venture capital, but funds won’t realize their gains for potentially a decade or more. Thus, the J-curve describes the early years of a fund where the losses are visible but the future gains have not yet materialized.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2110212" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="583" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=300,257 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=768,658 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=680,583 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=1536,1317 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=2048,1755 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The Vision Fund pioneered a much more muscular form of traditional mezzanine (pre-IPO) capital, where it would barge into a company’s cap table with big dollars and high valuations with the dream that these companies would go big. While not true of all of the Vision Fund’s investments, many of these startups were quite mature with serious revenues where the alternative to mezzanine capital was an IPO.</p>
<p>That brought up an interesting fund construction question: the sort of immediate failures that create the J-curve for early-stage investors shouldn’t presumably exist at later stages, where startups are less risky investments. Sure, some startups may grow more slowly than other companies and exit for a middling return, but few startups should actually fail entirely.</p>
<p>So what does the SoftBank data look like today and what can it tell us about late-stage fund performance?</p>
<p>SoftBank Vision Fund I made a total of 92 investments from summer of 2017 to mid 2020, of which 10 have fully exited, and 8 are now traded on the public markets. According to SoftBank, 25 of its Fund I portfolio companies received another venture capital round in calendar year 2020 as well, giving the firm some upticks in its fair-market valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://inevent.com">InEvent</a>, a startup powering virtual and hybrid events, is announcing that it has raised $2 million in seed funding from Storm Ventures.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just tiny fraction of the $125 million that online events platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">Hopin raised last fall</a> — in fact,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-might-be-the-fastest-growth-story-of-this-era/"> a recent Equity episode</a> suggested that Hopin might be the fastest growth story of the current startup era.</p>
<p>CEO Pedro Góes told me that even in a world of more established and better-funded platforms, his team sees an opportunity to break out by focusing on business-to-business events.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an opening in the space space for us to be the leader that we want on B2B,&#8221; Góes said. &#8220;We don’t intend to compete with platforms in the B2C market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Put another way, InEvent is less focused on replicating giant consumer events and more on helping businesses hold virtual events where they can connect with clients and partners. Góes said this is something that he and his co-founder saw Mauricio Giordano and Vinicius Neris saw in their previous work running a digital agency, where they were often asked to help with events in this vein.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we had a lot of experience with events, we could see where the industry was broken and how to fix it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110193" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110193" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110193" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?w=680" alt="InEvent screenshot" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg 5120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110193" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> InEvent</p></div></p>
<p>Góes suggested that two of the big needs for B2B events are customization and support, so InEvent has created what he described as a &#8220;really beautiful&#8221; product that can still be customized with the organizer&#8217;s branding, and the company also offers 24-hour support.</p>
<p>The platform that a virtual lobby where participants can browse all the programming, a video player, a registration system, the ability to create a conference mobile app and more. Góes said the goal was to build something that was &#8220;really flexible,&#8221; allowing organizers to run everything from within InEvent while also allowing them to incorporate outside tools, whether that&#8217;s video platforms like Zoom or CRM software like Salesforce, Marketo and Hubspot.</p>
<p>InEvent&#8217;s founders are from Brazil, but the startup is headquartered in Atlanta and has employees in 13 countries. It says it&#8217;s been used by more than 500 customers including DowDupont, Coca-Cola and Santander for global events.</p>
<p>With the new funding, Góes told me that startup will be able to expand the team (he was proud to note the team&#8217;s diversity — 50% of its managers are women, and 50% of its managers come from a Latinx background). It will also continue to develop the product, for example by improving the video player and adding more marketing automation.</p>
<p>And when the pandemic ends and large-scale, in-person conferences become possible again, Góes predicted that there will still be plenty of appetite for what InEvent can do, because more events will bring online and in-person elements together.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have different clients where we have a website, we have a mobile app, but we also have hardware [to] connect with in-person,&#8221; he said. After all, if you&#8217;re at a sprawling conference like CES, it might still be convenient to chat with another attendee through the mobile app, rather than traveling two miles to see them face-to-face. &#8220;For us, what we are building, the technology for virtual and in-person, is the same thing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is continuing to explore the addition of subscription services and other paid features to supplement its advertising revenues, according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content">Bloomberg</a> this morning. The company is considering a range of ideas, the report said, including tipping, paid consumer-facing features like profile customizations or an &#8220;undo send&#8221; option, or subscription-based access to Twitter&#8217;s Tweetdeck app. Twitter confirmed the company is researching and experimenting with new models, but declined to provide details.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s interest in paid features, including subscriptions, were already public knowledge.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/twitter-survey-reveals-the-subscription-options-its-eyeing-including-an-undo-send-option/">last summer ran a survey</a> which asked users which options they were willing to pay for &#8212; including things like custom colors, the ability to publish longer and more high-def videos, profile badges, auto responses, an &#8220;undo send&#8221; (an alternative to the &#8220;edit&#8221; button users actually want), and, for brands, things like the ability to run brand surveys and added &#8220;social listening&#8221; analytics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Then, during its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/twitter-q2-misses-on-sales-of-683m-loss-per-share-of-0-16-as-covid-19-takes-its-toll/">Q2 2020</a> earnings, Twitter CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/after-ad-revenue-drop-twitter-tells-investors-its-eyeing-subscription-options/">Jack Dorsey told investors</a> it’ll likely run subscription tests.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&#8220;We do think there is a world where subscription is complementary. We think there is a world where commerce is complementary,&#8221; Dorsey said at the time. &#8220;You can imagine work around helping people manage paywalls, as well, that we believe is complementary. So that’s what we’re looking for. We have a small team who is exploring our options, obviously we’re hiring for those teams,&#8221; he had noted.</p>
<p>And last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing">a Twitter job posting was spotted</a> which referenced a team &#8220;building a subscription platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter CFO Ned Segal during its Q3 2020 earnings then confirmed those plans, noting &#8220;you will see tests from us&#8221; on the subscription front. But he also warned these wouldn&#8217;t be things that impacted Twitter revenue in the near-term.</p>
<p>Bloomberg&#8217;s report added just a couple of new details to our earlier understanding of these efforts. It noted that one of the research projects around subscriptions was code-named &#8220;Rogue One,&#8221; and another involved the idea of &#8220;tipping&#8221; for exclusive content.</p>
<p>This latter item could perhaps reference an idea of how Twitter could monetize its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">recent acquisition</a> of newsletter platform Revue, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/">now rolled out</a> on the web. That is, users could possibly &#8220;tip&#8221; (pay) to read someone&#8217;s newsletter. But Twitter could also be considering a tipping feature inside Twitter&#8217;s audio-based networking feature and Clubhouse rival, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">Twitter Spaces</a>. Or it could be something else &#8212; <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-people-with-power-at-twitter">The Information</a> had also previously reported a tipping feature was being looked into, last month, but Twitter told them nothing was yet in development.</p>
<p>Twitter today declined to offer any further clarifications about its plans on this front.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, the company confirmed it was still considering new monetization models in order to grow its revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Increasing revenue durability is our top company objective. You will see us continue to research and experiment with ways to further diversify our revenue beyond ads in 2021 and beyond,&#8221; said Bruce Falck, Revenue Product Lead, in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;These may include subscriptions and other approaches that will give people and businesses of all sizes on Twitter access to unique features and enhanced opportunities for content creation, discovery, and engagement. While we&#8217;re excited about this potential, it’s important to note we are still in very early exploration and we do not expect any meaningful revenue attributable to these opportunities in 2021. Given the massive opportunity to build upon our strengths, our main focus continues to be on growing our ads business,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Twitter in Q3 2020 had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/twitter-revenue-rises-14-but-user-growth-fails-to-impress/">beat analyst expectations</a> on revenue and net income, but investors are still stuck on Twitter&#8217;s inability to substationaly grow its user base. The company reports its Q4 2020 earnings on Tuesday, where its plans for new revenue models may again be discussed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Additive manufacturing has proven an ideal solution for certain tasks, but the technology still lacks more traditional methods in a number of categories. One of the biggest is the requirement for post-printing assembly. 3D printers can create extremely complex components, but an outside party (be it human or machine) is required to put them together.</p>
<p>MIT’s CSAIL department this week <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/fabricating-fully-functional-drones-0208">showcased “LaserFactory,”</a> a new project that attempts to develop robotics, drones and other machines than can be fabricated as part of a “one-stop shop.” The system is comprised of a software kit and hardware platform designed to create structures and assemble circuitry and sensors for the machine.</p>
<p>A more fully realized version of the project will be showcased at an event in May, but the team is pulling back the curtain a bit to show what the concept looks like in practice. Here’s a breakdown from CSAIL’s page:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Let’s say a user has aspirations to create their own drone. They’d first design their device by placing components on it from a parts library, and then draw on circuit traces, which are the copper or aluminum lines on a printed circuit board that allow electricity to flow between electronic components. They’d then finalize the drone’s geometry in the 2D editor. In this case, they’d use propellers and batteries on the canvas, wire them up to make electrical connections, and draw the perimeter to define the quadcopter’s shape.</p></blockquote>
<p>Printing circuit boards is certainly nothing new. What sets CSAIL’s machine apart here is the breadth of functionality that’s been jammed into the machine here. An accompanying video lays it out pretty well:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzCAqVwZYCc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, this is early days &#8212; we’re still months out from the official presentation. There are a lot of questions, and more to the point, a lot of potential points of failure for a complex machine like this &#8212; especially one that seems to have non-experts as a target audience.</p>
<p>“Making fabrication inexpensive, fast, and accessible to a layman remains a challenge,” PhD student and lead author Martin Nisser says in the release. “By leveraging widely available manufacturing platforms like 3D printers and laser cutters, LaserFactory is the first system that integrates these capabilities and automates the full pipeline for making functional devices in one system.”</p>
<p>The software appears to be a big piece of the puzzle &#8212; allowing users to view a version of the product before it’s printed. By then, of course, it’s too late.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.felicis.com/team/aydin/">Aydin Senkut</a> is a Swiss Army knife of an investor. He has been on the Midas List for the past seven years, with early investments in companies like Shopify, Rovio, Fitbit, Ayden, Credit Karma, SoundHound and more.</p>
<p>One such investment is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/guideline/">Guideline</a>, an enterprise tech company focused on giving small businesses a simplified way to offer affordable 401ks to employees. Guideline has raised nearly $140 million from investors such as Tiger Global Management, Greyhound, Generation Investment Management, Propel and, of course, Felicis.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that we&#8217;re thrilled to have Senkut and Guideline <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinbusque/">founder and CEO Kevin Busque</a> join us for this week&#8217;s episode of Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/extra-crunch-live-is-back-in-2021-connecting-founders-with-tech-giants-and-each-other/">new and improved Extra Crunch Live</a> pairs founders and the investors who led their earlier rounds to talk about how the deal went down, from the moment they met to the conversations they had (including some disagreements) to the relationship as it exists today. Hell, we may even take a peek at the original pitch deck that made it all happen.</p>
<p>Then, we’ll turn our eyes back to you, the audience. That same founder/investor duo (in this case, Guideline founder and CEO Kevin Busque and Felicis&#8217; Aydin Senkut) will take a look at your pitch decks and give their own feedback. (If you haven’t yet submitted a pitch deck to be torn down on Extra Crunch Live, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">you can do so here</a>.)</p>
<p>The hour-long episode is sandwiched between two 30-minute rounds of networking. From start to finish, it goes from 11:30 a.m. PST/2:30 p.m. EST to 1:30 p.m. PST/4:30 p.m. EST. And Extra Crunch Live will come to you at the same time, every week, with a new pair of speakers.</p>
<p>In this case, we&#8217;ll be talking to Senkut and Busque about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/guideline-15-million/">$15 million Series B investment</a> that Felicis led in the startup: how did they meet, what attracted them to one another, and ultimately, what made them decide to be financially bound together for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>For now, let&#8217;s learn a bit more about Senkut and Busque, shall we?</p>
<p>Before starting Felicis Ventures (and serving as Managing Partner), Senkut was a senior manager at Google responsible for strategic partner development and account management in Asia Pacific. He joined the search giant in 1999 as its first product manager to launch Google&#8217;s first international sites. He then became the company&#8217;s first international sales manager.</p>
<p>Alongside an impressive portfolio of both angel and institutional investments, Senkut is about as well-rounded as a tech leader can be.</p>
<p>Kevin Busque, meanwhile, founded <a href="https://www.guideline.com/">Guideline</a> in 2015 and has since amassed more than 17,500 small businesses on to the platform with nearly $4 billion in assets under management. Before Guideline, Busque spent seven years at TaskRabbit where he was a cofounder and VP of Technology. Busque deeply understands what it takes to go from idea to MVP to product market fit to hyper growth.</p>
<p>This episode of Extra Crunch Live airs at 3pm ET/12pm PT on Wednesday, February 10.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Extra Crunch Live is for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=felicisguideline">Extra Crunch members only</a>. We’re coming to you with a new pair of speakers every week, and you can catch everything you missed on-demand if you can’t join us live. It’s worth the cost of the subscription on its own, but EC members also get access to our premium content, including market maps and investor surveys. Long story short? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=felicisguideline">Subscribe, smarty.</a> You won’t regret it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ethena co-founders Roxanne Petraeus and Anne Solmssen began their company with a clear goal: There needs to be a more modern, and effective, way to deploy anti-harassment training to employees. Ethena’s solution is to send employees bite-sized monthly “nudges” or pings with five-minute lessons, replacing the usual one-hour annual workshop with more flexible learning.</p>
<p>The startup raised $2 million off of that vision in June, and today has announced it has raised follow-on funding with the same exact amount, led by GSV. The startup currently has $5 million in venture capital, with investors including Homebrew, Neo and Village Global.</p>
<p>The follow-on capital comes right after Ethena has had some solid growth itself. The startup closed a couple major contracts with companies including Netflix, Zoom and Zendesk, and tells TechCrunch that more than 20,000 active employees complete its monthly training.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Solid growth and new cash is where the story could stop for now, but Petraeus tells TechCrunch that early momentum has also inspired a shift of sorts in what Ethena is trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>“When we initially launched in Feb 2020, we thought that for our first year, we’d focus entirely on scaling companies because only startups would be interested in an innovative approach to compliance training,” she said. “What’s changed is we’ve learned that even large enterprises want a better approach, deeper impact and are willing to be innovative in a space historically dominated by lawyers and legacy e-learning providers.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="v20qYVlzAA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/ethena-raises-2-million-in-seed-funding-for-smarter-anti-harassment-software/">Ethena raises $2 million in seed funding for smarter anti-harassment software</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ethena raises $2 million in seed funding for smarter anti-harassment software&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/ethena-raises-2-million-in-seed-funding-for-smarter-anti-harassment-software/embed/#?secret=v20qYVlzAA" data-secret="v20qYVlzAA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup is expanding its offering from anti-sexual harassment training to a wide variety of training courses focused on compliance, from financial compliance to code of conduct measures. The shift wasn’t because of a lack of interest from customers, the co-founder said, but instead demand from existing enterprise customers to offer more than just a singular topic.</p>
<p>“We think taking a specific sector-based approach can actually narrow the impact we’re having,” Petraeus said. “So we are trying to take a really inclusive approach,” from the start on what kind of topics should be treated as more than “just checking off a box.”</p>
<p>Petraeus, an army veteran, says that Ethena’s confidence in effectiveness and outcomes comes from military data on how adults learn.</p>
<p>“We know that traditional training just isn&#8217;t effective at behavior change, and there are some studies that show that it&#8217;s a pretty big backlash with increased unconscious bias after training versus before.” The startup differentiates from other micro-learning plays in its curriculum.</p>
<p>The curriculum is designed to be consumed over the course of a year instead of in an annual hour-long session. This tiny iteration is enough to give employees a repetitive way to understand the content. “We&#8217;re experimenting with things like graphic novels and podcasts to present training,” Petraeus said. “Just making sure whatever we’re doing yesterday is important tomorrow, because I think it’s important for us to be agile content creators.”</p>

<p>But Ethena’s biggest differentiation, Petraeus says, is its content. The pandemic has boasted a whole new sort of situation that employees need help, or proactive guidance, navigating. Petraeus says that Ethena’s monthly cadence gives it flexibility to adopt “modern” scenarios like Slack culture and Zoom etiquette. Ethena’s top performing training nudges in 2020 included lessons on online harassment prevention and mental health inclusivity.</p>
<p>The micro-learning approach has long been popular among edtech companies as a way to sneak or gamify small lessons into a workflow. So far, Ethena says over 90% of 150,000 in-app learner feedback notes are positive, saying the information is engaging and relevant. In Q4, Ethena saw learner growth of more than 250% quarter over quarter.</p>
<p>GSV&#8217;s Deborah Quazzo, who led Ethena&#8217;s seed and now this follow-on financing, said that it&#8217;s &#8220;not a coincidence that they&#8217;ve picked up some of the best logos in the world at an early stage,&#8221; referring to Ethena&#8217;s big customers. Quazzo thinks the compliance market has had very limited innovation so far, even though it&#8217;s a massive opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are seeing such strong product market fit and customers are pulling them into areas of content extension, so having more room to run faster made total sense,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past two decades, there has been a complete revolution in software engineering driven by the rise of open source. Proprietary tools and libraries have widely given way to open-source libraries and editors shared on sites like GitHub. The result has been an explosion of new software engineers who can both learn from and contribute to the most cutting-edge software in the world.</p>
<p>That open model remains mostly a pipe dream in the silicon world. The pipeline and tooling for designing and engineering chips remains almost entirely proprietary, and while new architectures like <a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V</a> and new specifications like <a href="https://telecominfraproject.com/openran/">OpenRAN</a> have made some headway in recent years, the industry is still almost hermetically sealed to open innovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://chipsalliance.org">CHIPS Alliance</a> was started in March 2019 with the mission to open that ecosystem up and encourage the development of open-source practices throughout the hardware silicon world. It’s hosted as a member of the Linux Foundation, and shares a similar ethos of using openness to spur further innovation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Alliance announced today that it has hired Rob Mains as its new executive director. Mains joined the organization last month as general manager, and previously, had a multi-decade career across the silicon industry at companies like Qualcomm, Oracle, Sun Microsystems and IBM.</p>
<p>Mains sees those experiences as being formative for understanding the current ecosystem, but understands that the silicon world has to change. “Obviously, it’s a very different mindset from silicon companies have had in the past,” Mains said. CHIPS Alliance is “creating a platform that different companies and members can contribute to … and bridge us to the next stage of innovation.”</p>

<p>Currently, the organization has more than two dozen corporate and university members, including Intel, Google, Alibaba and RISC-V darling SiFive.</p>
<p>Compared to the RISC-V Foundation and other orgs focused on specific open-source technologies, Mains sees CHIPS Alliance trying to create a more open ecosystem holistically. “There are a number of different areas where we can promote standards and examples,” he said, pointing to examples like bus protocols and interfaces between chiplets. CHIPS Alliance hosts the <a href="https://github.com/chipsalliance/omnixtend">OpenXtend protocol</a> first developed at Western Digital, which is designed to provide a consistent interface between processor caches and memory controllers, and it is <a href="https://chipsalliance.org/announcement/2020/07/16/aib-2-0-draft-specification/">also backing the Advanced Interface Bus (AIB) standard</a> first developed at Intel to connect multiple semiconductor dies together.</p>
<p>Mains has a particular background in electronic design automation (EDA) tools, which help chip designers translate their models into actual transistors on physical silicon. He sees a real opportunity to further expand open-source tools in the EDA space. In addition, the organization is interested in further exploring progress on Open PDK (process design kit) infrastructure such as a <a href="https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk">recent experimental preview offered by Google and Skywater</a>.</p>
<p>Mains hopes that by being a community and a champion for open-source methodologies in hardware, this cloistered industry can open up and expand the range and efforts of innovation happening.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The IPO frenzy is not letting up, Bumble informed the world this morning.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The IPO frenzy is not letting up, Bumble informed the world this morning.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1830043/000119312521031442/d20761ds1a.htm">new SEC filing</a>, the dating company raised its target IPO price range, indicating that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">its previous attempt</a> to quantify its per-share value was an undershoot. This means we&#8217;ll need to calculate a host of new valuations and revenue multiples for the company.</p>
<p>But more than that, we have a question to answer: Is Bumble aiming for a Match.com price, despite not being as profitable as its already-public rival? The last time we covered the pair, Bumble&#8217;s implied revenue multiples were discounted compared to Match, but with this new price, has the smaller company gained ground?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>And if so, does it mean that we&#8217;re seeing more public market enthusiasm for private companies? We&#8217;ll find out.</p>
<p>When it comes to the frenetic demand for IPO shares from public investors, I am reminded <a href="https://dilbert.com/strip/1994-10-01">of a particular Dilbert</a>. In this particular strip, Wally gets fired and is then hired back as a consultant. People outside the company appear smarter, he said, so he&#8217;s now back and getting paid more money than before.</p>
<p>This, but for private companies going public. Some companies appear to have huge promise while private, only to fizzle slowly while public. Or they manage huge price gains during their IPO process, only to cede those wins after they have a few trading months under their belt.</p>
<p>Is that what&#8217;s going to happen with Bumble?</p>
<h2>Bumble&#8217;s new IPO pricing range</h2>
<p>Bumble <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">targeted a $28 to $30 per-share IPO price</a> when it first set a range, implying a greater-than $1 billion raise. Now the company is selling more shares at an even higher price. From 34.5 million shares to 45 million, and at a new $37 to $39 per share price range, Bumble could raise $1.66 billion to $1.76 billion in its IPO.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not counting its underwriters&#8217; option of 6.75 million shares, which might bring its total raise to $2.02 billion at the top end of its new pricing interval.</p>
<p>What is Bumble worth at those new prices? Using its simple, shares-outstanding post-IPO count of 112,745,301 &#8212; inclusive of its underwriters&#8217; option &#8212; the company would be worth $4.17 billion to $4.40 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A Chicago-based startup, <a href="https://www.jiobit.com/">Jiobit</a>, wanted to make a better child location tracker than the bulky smartwatches and other insecurely designed products already on the market. So in 2018, it launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/jiobit-launches-its-more-secure-modular-child-location-tracker-starting-at-99/">own modular kid tracker</a> &#8212; a small dongle of sorts that could be tied to shoelaces, belt loops, or school backpack, for example. Today, the company is out with a new generation of this device, the Jiobit Next, which aims to improve the accuracy, battery life, reliability, and more.</p>
<p>The company says it took its two years&#8217; of learning and customer feedback into account, when developing the new design, which is today used not only by parents, but also by pet owners.</p>
<p>The updated version of the Jiboit, now $129.99, is a small device that weighs less than four quarter coins, and includes a combination of radios &#8212; Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular, and GPS &#8212; as well as sensors including an accelerometer/pedometer, temperature sensor, and barometer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The upgraded version now includes a new antenna system designed to increase performance inside schools, stores, high rises, and other challenging signal environments, the company claims.</p>
<p>It also leverages the reach of low-power, wide-area (LPWA) wireless networks in order to better serve rural regions where cellular coverage is limited and spotty. This allows the device to still be tracked when outside of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth mesh networks.</p>
<p>The new Jiobit is also waterproof (IPX8) up to 5 feet of water for up to 30 minutes and includes an alert button that instantly notifies loved ones that the user is lost or in danger. This button can be customized through the Jiobit app as to which family members will receive the alert, or it can even be turned off &#8212; which may be useful if the child is too young to understand how to use it.</p>
<p>Jiobit owners can continue to monitor the device through the app or now, a web app that includes alerting and notification controls. This opens the service up to more than just families &#8212; it could be used by organizations to deploy Jiobit into the field.</p>
<p>Like some software-based tracking apps, the device supports features like &#8220;Trusted Places,&#8221; which are geofenced areas where you expect the device to be at certain times, like school or maybe a doggie day care. When the device is not in a Trusted Place, you can enable &#8220;Live Mode&#8221; to watch its movement in real-time.</p>

<p>Another improvement focuses on battery life. The upgraded version offers 50% longer battery life than the prior version, the company says. Under typical use cases, the Jiobit will last up to 10 days between charges, though it last longer when on standby and not in active use. (That may be why pet owners are seeing slightly longer battery life of 10-20 days, for instance.)</p>
<p>The original idea for Jiobit had come about because founder John Renaldi, a previous VP at Motorola, was shocked to find that most child trackers on the market were strong their certificate keys in the clear and were hackable. He wanted to build a more secure alternative, and brought on co-founder and CTO, Roger Ady, a previous director of engineering at Motorola, to help.</p>
<p>Today, the Jiobit has its own dedicated security chip to communicate with the company&#8217;s servers, and uses its AES-256 <a href="https://www.jiobit.com/blog/kickstarter-gadget-crowdfunded-hacked-iot-security-jiobit">&#8220;Jiobit TrustChip&#8221; technology</a> to encrypt data both at rest and in transit with TLS1.2 encryption. It also refuses to download any software that&#8217;s not cryptographically signed by Jiobit in order to prevent malware or other &#8220;rogue&#8221; software from being installed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110138" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110138" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110138" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jiobit-Next-Attachment-Line-Up.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jiobit-Next-Attachment-Line-Up.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jiobit-Next-Attachment-Line-Up.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jiobit-Next-Attachment-Line-Up.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jiobit-Next-Attachment-Line-Up.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jiobit-Next-Attachment-Line-Up.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jiobit-Next-Attachment-Line-Up.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jiobit-Next-Attachment-Line-Up.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jiobit-Next-Attachment-Line-Up.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jiobit-Next-Attachment-Line-Up.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jiobit-Next-Attachment-Line-Up.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jiobit-Next-Attachment-Line-Up.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jiobit-Next-Attachment-Line-Up.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110138" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jiobit</p></div></p>
<p>The service itself, meanwhile, is compliant with U.S. children&#8217;s privacy regulations (COPPA).</p>
<p>The new Jiobit Next will work only within the U.S., while the 1st generation works internationally across 146 countries. But both will continued to be supported by way of <a href="https://www.jiobit.com/product">subscriptions</a>. Users can choose between a 2-year subscription plan ($8.99/month), a 6-month subscription plan ($12.99/month) or a month-to-month subscription plan ($14.99/month). These don&#8217;t require a cellular plan or SIM card from your existing carrier, like other child trackers and smartwatches, though.</p>
<p>To date, the startup says it&#8217;s raised $12 million in outside investment, including from Netgear and other midwest VC firms. Jiobit isn&#8217;t disclosing how many devices its sold to date, specifically, but says it&#8217;s in the &#8220;mid-five figure range.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new device is on pre-order starting today and will be sold later this month on its website, and then Amazon, Chewy, and Target. It has also partnered with family tracking app Life360 to offer special pricing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Atlanta-based <a href="https://www.bip-capital.com/">BIP Capital</a> has a new name for its venture capital operations (<a href="https://panoramic.vc/">Panoramic Ventures</a>); a new partner (Paul Judge); and is launching a $300 million new fund in its bid to plant a flag as the premier venture fund among the rising startup cities across the country.</p>
<p>Miami may have grabbed headlines recently as a new hub for venture capital and technology startups, but like other cities across the Southeast it&#8217;s lacked venture funds of a significant size since the early days of the dot-com bubble. Panoramic wants to be the fundraising destination for entrepreneurs outside of traditional tech hubs like Boston, Silicon Valley and New York as these new tech hubs emerge.</p>
<p>Atlanta, which already boasts several startup companies that have achieved billion-dollar valuations including Greenlight Financial and Calendly, has an equally burgeoning startup scene and an opportunity to become the central hub for venture capital investment in a region that encompasses several other rising tech hubs in the Southeast like Birmingham, Miami, Nashville, and New Orleans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a strategy similar to the one that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/">Drive Capital has employed</a> to become a leading fund in the Midwest and across the U.S.</p>

<p>Under the new partnership, which will include famed early stage Atlanta investor, Paul Judge, BIP Capital&#8217;s venture activities will operate under the Panoramic Ventures brand.</p>
<p>Should the firm manage to raise the $300 million it has targeted for Panoramic&#8217;s inaugural investment vehicle it would become the largest venture fund in the Southeast.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to have a fund at that scale,&#8221; said Mark Buffington, a co-founder of BIP Capital and Panoramic Ventures. &#8220;You see the venture activity that is increasing in the region [and] one thing that&#8217;s been missing is a really active venture fund that can scale up as companies grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Panoramic intends to be active at the seed stage while having the capacity to make investments in later stage venture backed companies as well, according to the two co-founders. And the firm will also try to focus on a more diverse group of entrepreneurs, thanks to the addition of Paul Judge.</p>
<p>Judge, a Black serial entrepreneur and investor, was the co-founder of the Atlanta-based voice recognition tech developer <a href="https://www.pindrop.com/">Pindrop</a>, the Wi-Fi startup Luma Home, and security tech developer Purewire.  He&#8217;s also an investor several startups across the Southeast through his own venture initiatives, including <a href="https://techsquare.co/about/">Techsquare Labs</a> and Judge sits on the investment committee for the SoftBank Opportunity Fund, focused on Black, Hispanic and Native American founders. His portfolio includes companies like LeaseQuery, Cove.tool, OncoLens and Eventeny.</p>
<p>About $125 million has already been soft-circled for the new Panoramic Ventures fund, which expects to work closely with some of the other investment firms that have cropped up or established a presence in the Southeast. That includes firms like <a href="https://www.outlanderlabs.com/">Outlander Labs</a>, founded by the husband and wife investment team of Paige and Leura Craig, and the LA-based firm, Mucker Labs, which has an investment partner working out of Nashville.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;There’s been an absence of this type of energy and this type of heft in a venture fund in Atlanta,&#8221; said Judge. &#8220;That’s the hole that we’ve been aiming to fill.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panoramic will invest in Seed, Series A, and Series B funding rounds, the company said in a statement. Investment areas will focus on include business-to-business software as a service companies, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthcare software, financial technologies, digital media, cybersecurity, and frontier technologies. </span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> — and be sure to check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/a-lake-house-architect-a-miami-vc-and-homeowner-walk-into-a-wine-bar/">last week&#8217;s main ep</a> that dug into Robinhood, Miami, and a host of other topics.</p>
<p>This morning we had a pile of news to get through. Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/07/pony-ai-raises-100-million-more-to-advance-its-autonomous-vehicle-tech/">Pony.ai raised another $100 million</a>, which underscores our growing thesis that there is no amount of money yet that will produce the tech required for self-driving cars to work. Perhaps we will get there, but it is going to cost a pretty penny or two.</li>
<li>Sticking to cars, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/hyundai-kia-say-they-aren-t-in-ev-discussions-with-apple?sref=gni836kR">the Apple-Kia tieup is kaput</a>, which we should have known the moment it became known. Apple previously bought startup Drive.ai back in 2019, of course.</li>
<li>Vroom, a 2020 IPO, bought a Super Bowl ad. Who would have expected that? Its shares are up, however, after the ad.</li>
<li>Still on the car beat, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/">Tesla bought $1.50 billion in bitcoin</a>, and may accept the stuff as tender to buy its vehicles in the future. The move sent the price of bitcoin higher.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/clubhouse-is-now-blocked-in-china-after-a-brief-uncensored-period/">Clubhouse got banned in China</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/indian-healthtech-startup-phable-raises-12-million-to-serve-patients-with-chronic-conditions/">Phable raised $12 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/nexthink-nabs-180m-series-d-on-1-1b-valuation/">Nexthink raised $180 million</a>, and Bumble is targeting a higher share price in its impending IPO.</li>
<li>And we may have figured out the ∆ between what investors are saying about the Seed market, and what data has largely said.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://getaway.house">Getaway</a> CEO Jon Staff said that while the startup&#8217;s offerings weren&#8217;t designed with a pandemic in mind, they turned out to be well-suited for a time when people were eager to find safe ways to get off Zoom and out of their homes.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Getaway builds &#8220;Outposts&#8221; — collections of tiny cabins in rustic locations within a two-hour drive of major cities like Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles and New York. Those cabins sound perfect for socially distanced retreats, with guests checking themselves in, each cabin built with its own fire pit and spaced 50 to 150 feet from the others and there were no common areas.</p>
<p>Staff told me that rather than promoting traditional tourist activities, Getaway emphasizes disconnecting from all the stresses and distractions of modern life. So its cabins don&#8217;t include WiFi, and they also have lockboxes where visitors can hide their phones for the duration of their visits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We try to get you to do nothing, quite literally,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How few moments are there in life when really have enough free time that you could do nothing? And if not nothing, have a deep conversation with your partner, or take the time to cook a good meal and really enjoy the experience with people who are there sitting next to the campfire with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Staff acknowledged that some investors were skeptical about Getaway&#8217;s insistence on building the cabins and Outposts itself. He recalled talking to tech-focused venture capitalists who would ask, &#8220;Why isn&#8217;t this a platform? Why isn&#8217;t it going to be worth $1 billon a year from now?&#8221; while potential investors from the real estate world would want to know, &#8220;How tall of a skyscraper do you want to build?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a while, I had this anxiety that we don’t fit in any box,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I learned to appreciate the benefits of not fitting in any box — that’s where innovation really lies.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110114" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110114" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110114" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg?w=680" alt="Getaway lifestyle image" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110114" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getaway</p></div></p>
<p>And the Getaway approach seemed to resonate in 2020, with bookings increasing 150% year-over-year and the startup&#8217;s Outposts operating at nearly 100% occupancy. Today it&#8217;s announcing that it has raised $41.7 million in Series C funding — first revealed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1699380/000169938021000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">in a regulatory filing</a> and led by travel- and hospitality-focused firm <a href="https://certares.com">Certares</a>.</p>
<p>Getaway plans to use the funding to expand to at least 17 Outposts this year, up from 12 in 2020 and nine in 2019. The startup has now raised more than $81 million in total funding, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/getaway-2">according to Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>Staff said that eventually, Getaway could also add other products and services, because, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The brand is not about </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">tiny houses or tiny cabins, The brand is about [the fact that] the world is too noisy and too connected over the long haul. Getaway could be doing other things to solve that problem.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>At the same time, he said it&#8217;s crucial to to remain clear and focused on the experience that Getaway wants to provide.</p>
<p>&#8220;We always try to remind ourselves that we are not creating the experience at Getaway,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re creating the experience and, if we’re doing it well, we&#8217;re facilitating it, we&#8217;re giving you everything you need and nothing you don&#8217;t &#8230; There’s a lot of freedom to make of it what you want as the guest, but there are also boundaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, Staff said that there have been requests to offer Getaway Outposts for work retreats, but that&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re designed for: &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to police it, but we&#8217;re not going to put in WiFi.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.beyondid.com/">BeyondID</a>, a cloud identity consulting firm, announced a $9 million Series A today led by Tercera. It marked the first investment from Tercera, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/tecera-launches-with-225m-to-fund-cloud-consulting-firms/">a firm that launched earlier this month</a> with the goal of investing in service startups like Beyond.</p>
<p>The company focuses on helping clients manage security and identity in the cloud, taking aim specifically at Okta customers. In fact, the firm is a platinum partner for Okta. As they describe their goals, they help clients in a variety of areas including identity and access management, secure app modernization, Zero Trust security, cloud migration and integration services.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Arun Shrestha has a deep background in technology including working with Okta from its early days. Shrestha came on board in 2012 as the head of customer success. When he began, the startup was in early days with just 50 customers. When he left five years later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/identity-management-software-provider-okta-seeks-to-raise-187m-with-ipo-pricing/">just before the IPO</a>, it had over 3500.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Along the way, he gained a unique level of expertise in the Okta tool set, and he decided to put that to work to help Okta customers implement and maximize Okta usage, especially in companies with complex implementations. He launched BeyondID in 2018 with the intention of focusing on systems integrations and managing a company&#8217;s identity in the cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe we are becoming a managed identity service provider, so managing anything identity, anything related to cybersecurity. We&#8217;re helping these companies by being a one-stop shop for companies acquiring, deploying and managing identity services,&#8221; Shrestha explained.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tercera launches with $225M to fund cloud consulting firms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/tecera-launches-with-225m-to-fund-cloud-consulting-firms/embed/#?secret=HTDonPCURP" data-secret="HTDonPCURP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It seems to be working. The last couple of years the company revenues grew at 300% and as it matures, and the growth rates settle a bit, it&#8217;s still expected to grow between 70 and 100% this year. The firm has 250 customers including FedEx, Major League Baseball, Bain Capital and Biogen.</p>
<p>It currently has 75 employees serving those customers with plans to grow that number in the next year with the help from today&#8217;s investment. As Shrestha adds new employees, he sees building a diverse workforce as a crucial goal for his company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity is absolutely critical to our long term sustainable success, and it&#8217;s also the right thing to do,&#8221; he said. He says that building an organization that promotes women and people of color is a key goal of his as the leader of the company and something he is committed to.</p>
<p>Chris Barbin, who is managing partner and founder at lead investor Tercera, says that he chose BeyondID as the firm&#8217;s first investment because he believes identity is central to the notion of digital transformation. As more companies move to the cloud, they need help understanding how security and identity work differently in a cloud context, and he sees BeyondID playing a critical role in helping clients get there.</p>
<p>&#8220;BeyondID is in a rapidly growing space and has an impressive customer list that represents nearly every industry. Arun and the leadership team have a strong vision for the firm, deep ties into Okta, and they&#8217;re incredibly passionate about what they do,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK-based Isotropic Systems has raised a $40 million funding in an &#8220;oversubscribed&#8221; round that the startup says will help it get its next-generation broadband terminal to the production phase by its 2022 target. The funding, a Series B that brings the company&#8217;s total raised to $60 million, was led by SES and included participation form Boeing HorizonX, Space Angels, Orbital Ventures on the venture side, and that includes UK government grant support as well.</p>
<p>Isotropic&#8217;s business is centred around a new type of broadband terminal it&#8217;s developing that can communicate across multiple frequencies, making it possible for it to connect to more than one satellite network at the same time without any loss in signal quality or network speed for any individual connection. The final product would then offer ground connectivity to customers that could potentially maintain connections with more than one of the emerging satellite broadband networks in development, including those being set up by OneWeb, SpaceX, Intelsat, SES, Amazon and more.</p>
<p>The startup will be stand-in cup a 20,000 square-foot testing and prediction facility near Reading in the UK, and expects to have the first operational version of its ground terminal in production by 2022. If its final product works as advertised, it could be a major boon both for satellite network connectivity providers and for clients, since it would mean that customers who can afford the service don&#8217;t have to either select from among the available options, and can instead use one hardware solution to connect to multiple in order to take advantage of potential speed benefits, as well as network redundancy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The benefits are obvious, provided the financials make sense. Imagine, for instance, using onboard wifi on an international flight. Typically, these networks have been unreliable to say the least. Coverage and quality drop-outs are common, and speeds tend to be weak in even the best of cases. Networks like Starlink aim to correct a lot of these legacy problems, but even better would be a solution that offers connection to multiple satellite networks simultaneously, switching between each connection as necessary to maintain the best possible network quality – and potentially combining available bandwidth when possible to boost speeds.</p>
<p>Isotropic&#8217;s potential customer list for such an offering spans military, government, and civilian markets, across both broadband and low-data IoT networks. This latest funding should help it prove its groundbreaking technology can attain the production scale and efficacy required to live up to its promise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm">an SEC filing</a>, Tesla disclosed that it has acquired $1.5 billion in bitcoin, the popular cryptocurrency. Moreover, the company noted that it may also accept bitcoin in the future as a form of payment for its cars, though it did allow that there is some regulatory uncertainty around that effort.</p>
<p>As the news broke, the price of bitcoin instantly rose by around 7% to more than $40,000 per coin.</p>
<p>Tesla had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-cryptocurrency-idUSKBN28U0XM">previously telegraphed</a> that it had an interest in the cryptocurrency, however to purchase such a large block of the coin is notable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="K6hFHygGcd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/">Is rising usage driving crypto&#8217;s recent price boom?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Is rising usage driving crypto&#8217;s recent price boom?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/embed/#?secret=K6hFHygGcd" data-secret="K6hFHygGcd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In its filing, Tesla writes that earlier this year it &#8220;updated [its] investment policy to provide [it] with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on [its] cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity,&#8221; adding that it has the option of putting cash into &#8220;certain alternative reserve assets&#8221; that include &#8220;digital assets, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under that banner, the firm has &#8220;invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin,&#8221; going on to say that the well-known electric car company &#8220;may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s enough wiggle room for Tesla to do whatever it wants with its cash and the crypto markets.</p>
<p>But the company wasn&#8217;t done, completing its news-drop by adding that the company &#8220;expect[s] to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for [its] products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which [it] may or may not liquidate upon receipt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made waves in recent days by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/what-are-these-rich-people-doing-pumping-crappy-assets/">pumping a silly cryptocurrency joke</a> called Dogecoin; this is something more material. Tesla is selecting bitcoin as the cryptocurrency of its choice, helping to further cement the blockchain as the world&#8217;s best known. And that it may accept bitcoin-denominated transactions in the future could help bitcoin retain both value, and exchange volume, though we probably repeat ourselves. It&#8217;s worth noting that Musk himself has also personally sent bitcoin prices higher in past using his social presence, including by changing his bio to just the single word, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-falls-retraces-elon-musk-twitter">before its price faded back</a> after he removed it earlier this month.</p>
<p>The car company then spends three paragraphs saying that its choice is risky. That&#8217;s an understatement. Then again, what is Musk if not entertaining?</p>

<p>Last week I highlighted how Lime was getting into the shared moped business. Now, shared moped startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/electric-moped-startup-revel-launches-an-ev-charging-business/">Revel is getting into the EV charging game</a>. I wonder if we are starting to witness the beginning of a business diversification trend in micromobility?</p>
<p>Revel said it is building a DC fast-charging station for electric vehicles in New York City, the first in a new business venture that will eventually spread to other cities. The company said this new “Superhub,” which is located at the former Pfizer building in Brooklyn, will contain 30 chargers and be open to the public 24 hours a day. This will be the first in a network of Superhubs opened by Revel across New York City, the company said.</p>

<p>Revel didn’t build the EV charging infrastructure in-house. Instead, it is using Tritium’s new RTM75 model for the first 10 chargers at its Brooklyn site, which will go live this spring. These chargers are designed to deliver 100 additional miles of charge to an electric vehicle in about 20 minutes, according to Revel.</p>

<p><strong>Uber</strong> announced plans to acquire alcohol delivery service Drizly in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/uber-is-buying-alcohol-delivery-service-drizly-for-1-1b/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">stock-and-cash deal</a> valued at $1.1 billion deal — cementing a strategy that started more than a year ago. The upshot: Uber is betting that its delivery and ride-hailing businesses will provide the fastest path to profitability.</p>
<p>Drizly&#8217;s marketplace will be eventually folded into the Uber Eats app. For now, Drizly will maintain the standalone app. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The acquisition of Drizly is expected to close in the first half of the year.</span></p>

<p>For those who don&#8217;t follow Uber&#8217;s every move, here&#8217;s a quick recap. Since early 2020, Uber has offloaded most of its businesses, including shared scooter and bike unit Jump, self-driving subsidiary Uber Advanced Technologies Group and the air taxi moonshot Uber Elevate. It also sold a $500 million stake in its Uber Freight spinoff. Meanwhile, it acquired on-demand delivery app Postmates and now Drizly.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Rad Power Bikes</strong> is one other company that had a &#8220;deal of the week&#8221; worthy funding round. The Seattle-based electric bike seller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">raised $150 million</a> from institutional investors, including Morgan Stanley’s Counterpoint Global Fund, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, TPG’s global impact investing platform The Rise Fund and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates. Existing investors Durable Capital Partners LP and Vulcan Capital also participated in the round.</p>
<p>While $150 million is hardly the biggest raise in transportation, it&#8217;s one of the larger ones in the world of electric bikes. The size of round — and the institutions involved — suggests investors see room from growth in the ebike industry and believe in Rad Power&#8217;s business model and its ability to expand beyond the $100 million in sales it generated in 2019. Rad Power Bikes declined to disclose its 2020 sales numbers.</p>

<p>Rad Power is a direct-to-consumer electric bike seller known for creating robust products that combine features like fat tires, big batteries and motors with touchscreens, and even cargo carrying capacity &#8212; all at prices hundreds of dollars below its competitors.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh told me that the funds will be used to double its 325-person workforce, increase the number of retail showrooms and service locations, continue to bring on more contract manufacturers to diversify its supply chain and add more accessories so consumers and customize their bikes.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bear Flag Robotics</strong>, the Silicon Valley-based startup that is developing autonomous technology for farm tractors, announced last month a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agtech-leader-bear-flag-robotics-raises-7-9-million-seed-extension-round-led-by-true-ventures-301211834.html">$7.9 million seed extension funding round</a> led by True Ventures. (I missed this one last week). The funding comes two years after it raised a $4.6 million seed round also led by True Ventures. Graphene Ventures, AgFunder, D20 and Green Cow VC also participated in the round.</p>
<p><strong>DealerPolicy</strong>, an insurance marketplace for automotive retail, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dealerpolicy-raises-30-million-in-series-b-funding-to-support-the-continued-development-of-automotive-retails-leading-insurance-marketplace-301219491.html#:~:text=BURLINGTON%2C%20Vt.%2C%20Feb.,as%20HSCM%20Bermuda%20Management%20Company.">raised $30 million</a> in Series B funding led by 3L Capital and Hudson Structured Capital Management Ltd.</p>

<p><strong>Otonomo</strong>, the cloud-based software startup that helps companies capture and monetize connected car data, agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition company Software Acquisition Group Inc. II with a valuation of $1.4 billion. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001842498&amp;owner=include&amp;count=40&amp;hidefilings=0">prospectus</a> filed by the Otonomo shows it generated $400,000 in revenue in 2020 with a total operating expenditure of $10 million. Otonomo said it expects to have a negative gross profit through 2021. The company said it expects to be EBITDA positive by 2024.</p>
<p><strong>REE Automotive</strong> has reached merger agreement with special purpose acquisition corporation 10X Capital Venture Acquisition Corp. The combined company, which will be listed on the NASDAQ under the new ticker symbol &#8220;REE,&#8221; will have an equity valuation of $3.6 billion. The startup has developed flat and modular EV platforms with fully autonomous-ready independent drive-by-wire, brake-by-wire and steer-by-wire technology for each wheel.</p>
<p>The company said it raised $300 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from investors including Koch Strategic Platforms and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and Magna International.<br />
The transaction is expected to provide more than $500 million of gross proceeds to the company.</p>
<p><strong>Urban SDK</strong>, a connected mobility and safety analytics platform, raised $1.66 million in a funding round led by the Florida Opportunity Fund and matched by DeepWork Capital, a venture capital firm investing in early-stage companies in Florida.</p>
<p><strong>Wheels Up</strong>, the private jet subscription service, announced plans to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Aspirational Consumer Lifestyle Corp. The deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter, would give Wheels Up a valuation of more than $2 billion — more than twice its 2019 value.</p>

<p><strong>Ford</strong> said this week it will spend $22 billion on electrification — double its previous commitment — and invest $7 billion on autonomous vehicles through 2025. It should be noted that $2 billion of that AV budget has already been spent, leaving $5 billion left to invest over the next four years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are accelerating all our plans — breaking constraints, increasing battery capacity, improving costs and getting more electric vehicles into our product cycle plan,&#8221; Ford CEO Jim Farley said. &#8220;People are responding to what Ford is doing today, not someday.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement comes at the beginning of a critical two-year period for Ford and on the heels of a fourth quarter that delivered a $2.8 billion loss. The automaker will ramp up deliveries of its all-electric Mustang Mach-E vehicle and the Bronco Sport (which is not an EV). The first electric E-Transit commercial vans will come off the line in late 2021. Meanwhile, development continues on an all-electric F-150 pickup that is coming in mid- 2022.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget that Ford is also planning to use Google&#8217;s Android Automotive operating system in new vehicles, beginning in 2023 as part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-vehicles-will-be-powered-by-googles-android-operating-system/">six-year partnership</a> announced February 1 that will bring embedded Google apps and services to drivers.</p>
<p>Ford&#8217;s announcement comes a week after GM said it aspired to produce only electric vehicles by 2035.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, the for-profit company tied to open-source web publishing platform WordPress, is announcing that it has acquired analytics provider <a href="http://www.parse.ly">Parse.ly</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, Parse.ly is now part of WPVIP, the organization within Automattic that offers enterprise hosting and support to publishers, including TechCrunch. (We use Parse.ly, too.)</p>
<p>WPVIP CEO Nick Gernert described this as the organization&#8217;s first large enterprise software acquisition, reflecting a strategy that has expanded beyond news and media organizations — businesses like Salesforce (whose venture arm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/automattic-raises-300-million-at-3-billion-valuation-from-salesforce-ventures/">invested $300 million in Automattic </a>back in 2019), the NBA, Condé Nast, Facebook and Microsoft now use WPVIP for their content and marketing needs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both companies, Gernert said, come from similar backgrounds, with &#8220;roots&#8221; in digital publishing and a &#8220;heavy focus on understanding the impact of content.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve really started to shift more towards content marketing and starting to think more deeply beyond just what traditional page analytics provide,&#8221; he continued. That means doing more than measuring pageviews and time on site and &#8220;really starting to look more deeply at things like conversation, attribution, areas &#8230; that from a marketer&#8217;s perspective are impactful.&#8221;</p>
<p>WordPress and Parse.ly already work well together, but the plan is to make WPVIP features available to Parse.ly customers while also making more Parse.ly data available to WPVIP publishers. And Gernert said there are also opportunities to add more commerce-related data to Parse.ly, since Automattic also owns WooCommerce.</p>

<p>The goal, he said, is to &#8220;make Parse.ly better for WordPress and best for WPVIP.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, he added, &#8220;There&#8217;s no plans here to make Parse.ly the only analytics solution that runs on our platform. We want to preserve the flexibility and interoperability [of WordPress], and we want to make sure from a Parse.ly perspective that it still exists as a standalone product. That&#8217;s key to its future and we will continue to invest in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parse.ly was founded in 2009 and has raised $12.9 million in funding from investors including Grotech Ventures and Blumberg Capital, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/parsely/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>. Parse.ly founders Sachin Kamdar and Andrew Montalenti are joining WPVIP, with Kamdar leading go-to-market strategy for Parse.ly and Montalenti leading product.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had deep admiration for WPVIP&#8217;s market position as the gold standard for enterprise content teams, and we’re thrilled to be able to join together,” Kamdar said in a statement. “From the culture and people, to the product, market and vision, we’re in lockstep to create more value for our customers. This powerful combination of content and intelligence will push the industry forward at an accelerated pace.”</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thousands of Chinese users suddenly found themselves unable to access Clubhouse on early Monday evening as the country prepared to start the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. Inside WeChat groups, Clubhouse users rushed to report the situation and help each other with ways to get back onto the red hot live audio app.</p>
<p>Audio drop-in startup Clubhouse was rapidly gaining steam in China, attracting a bevy of users early on to conversations on a wide range of topics. The app seemed likely to meet the fate of other U.S.-based apps and services, however &#8212; namely, a ban &#8212; and as of Monday, that indeed was what Clubhouse faces, as confirmed by TechCrunch. Users in China can no longer access the Clubhouse app, though the app&#8217;s <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">website</a> remains unblocked. The app is unlikely to return, given how much the app&#8217;s model would have to change to comply with Chinese internet regulation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110080" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110080" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2110080" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SSL-notice.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="427" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SSL-notice.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SSL-notice.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SSL-notice.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SSL-notice.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SSL-notice.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110080" class="wp-caption-text">Notice received by users in China when trying to access Clubhouse as of Monday.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clubhouse has faced <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-where-are-the-adults-in-the-clubhouse/">criticism at home in the U.S. for its lack of effective moderation and abuse-prevention practices</a>, so it&#8217;s hardly a surprise that it has fallen afoul of China&#8217;s rather more strict enforcement of measures designed to stifle the spread of information the government deems inappropriate for discussion. The app was also not officially available via Apple&#8217;s China App Store, though access to it and its audio rooms was, before today, freely available without the use of a VPN, provided a user had the app installed on their device.</p>
<p>The app was briefly available on China&#8217;s App Store following its global launch in September but was removed in October, TechCrunch previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/will-the-clubhouse-model-work-in-china/">reported</a>. It&#8217;s unclear whether Clubhouse or Apple pulled the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not Apple&#8217;s doing but surely they must be happy to get out of a tight spot, as the discussion will shift from Apple&#8217;s involvement in the removal from App Store to the blocking of servers by authorities,&#8221; said Benjamin Ismail, campaign and advocacy director at GreatFire.org, which monitors censorship in China.</p>
<p>As Clubhouse was not listed on the Chinese App Store, it’s unclear how many people from mainland China were on the platform. A room discussing the 1989 pro-democracy Tiananmen protest, a taboo topic in China, reached the maximum number of participants at 5,000 this afternoon prior to the ban. Another room focused on the same topic attracted more than 2,000 users.</p>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s API has been blocked on Monday around 7 PM Beijing time, Greatfire.org told TechCrunch. Some users reported inside WeChat groups that they could no longer receive verification codes at their Chinese phone numbers, providing additional clues to the level of blockage. Many users in China signed up with Chinese phone numbers, which are linked to their real ID in the country and could make it easier for the police to identify them.</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, Clubhouse soared in popularity within a few communities in mainland China, including people in startups, investment, academic or those with an overseas background. Many of them were aware the app wouldn’t last long in China, given free and often political debates frequented the platform. Clubhouse rooms titled “How long will Clubhouse last in China” and “Have you been invited to have tea for using Clubhouse?” attracted big crowds. “Having tea” is a euphemism for being taken away for interrogation by the police.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch noted on Saturday, Clubhouse&#8217;s early success prior to this shutdown has already prompted the creation of a number of homegrown alternatives designed around drop-in audio networking. Clubhouse&#8217;s popularity in China, however, may be difficult to replicate for any of these similar efforts &#8212; for the same reasons the original app itself is now inaccessible within the country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a Great Firewall circumvention tool like a virtual private network (VPN), some users in mainland China managed to regain access to Clubhouse, TechCrunch learned. Some features are able to hear and speak with their VPN off, so long as they have entered a room via a VPN. Agora, which operates from the U.S. and China, provides the SDK that powers Clubhouse&#8217;s live audio interaction, TechCrunch previously reported.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Phable, a three-year-old health tech startup that is serving patients with chronic illnesses in India, has raised $12 million in a new financing round as it looks to scale in the world’s second most populated nation.</p>
<p>Manipal Hospitals, one of the largest healthcare providers in India, led the Series A round in Phable. Existing investor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/the-venture-firm-sosv-has-hired-former-techcrunch-coo-ned-desmond-to-help-grow-its-startups/">New Jersey-headquartered SOSV</a> also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of people in India suffer from chronic diseases. One of the biggest challenges they face is the volume of transactions they have to manage each day. There are appointments with doctors and labs for tests, purchasing of medicines, medical devices and insurance, and keeping a log of their test results.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup has built a full-stack solution to process all these transactions. It has also developed what it claims to be the world’s largest integration with medical IoT devices.</p>
<p>The purpose of this is to automatically collect patients’ data so that doctors can keep better track of their progress. The app also enables patients to share what medicine they are taking, and the frequency of the intake.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Phable co-founder Sumit Sinha explained that patients often become less disciplined about taking the full dose of their medication once they start to see improvements in their conditions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><a href="https://www.phablecare.com/">Phable</a> has created a more transparent and real-time communication channel that allows a doctor to nudge their patients to take their medicine on time, and make any necessary changes to the lifestyle or medication cycle, or request a follow-up appointment. The app itself can be used for tele-consultation, the demand for which has skyrocketed in recent quarters as coronavirus forced people to stay indoors.</p>
<p>“This creates a feedback loop between the patient and the doctor even when the patient is not at the clinic or hospital and enables active interventions to get the best outcome,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110071" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110071" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2110071 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="615" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110071" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Phable</p></div></p>
<p>The startup also sells a range of medical IoT devices through its platform that patients can buy for tracking their body performance such as blood pressure and glucose levels. Sinha said that even if a patient has bought a machine from some other place, Phable’s app is compatible with most devices. (Even if it is not &#8212; as is sometimes the case with low-cost, non-branded devices &#8212; patients can manually enter their result, or take a picture of the result and through computer vision, Phable is able to understand and make a record of it.)</p>
<p>“The growing burden of chronic diseases in India is exacerbated by issues around compliance of patients with the treatment regime – including medication, lifestyle changes and periodic follow-ups. Phable would help to fill that gap and would enhance the quality of life for many patients. Manipal Hospitals is pleased to have this opportunity to work with the team at Phable to enhance and grow their offerings,” said Dr. Ranjan Pai, chairman of Manipal Education and Medical Group, in a statement.</p>
<p>Phable, which employs 72 people, also maintains partnership with 1mg and Medlife to make it easier for patients to place orders for their medicines and get them delivered at their doorstep.</p>
<p>In recent quarters, millions of Indians have consulted with their doctors through their phone or computer and bought medication online for the first time. According to Frost &amp; Sullivan, the e-pharmacy market in India was estimated to be around $512 million in 2018. In a recent note to clients, analysts at Bank of America estimated this market to be worth $2.4 billion by 2022. (The preventive healthcare market, which caters to physical and mental well-being, is expected to grow to $102 billion by 2022.)</p>
<p>Phable today serves patients with cardiovascular and endocrinology-related chronic diseases. It has already served more than 220,000 patients and plans to deploy the fresh capital to scale the startup to reach 5 million patients and 35,000 doctors by the end of the year. It also plans to broaden its offering, including allowing patients to purchase insurance from within the app or website.</p>
<p>Currently Phable is used by over 5,000 doctors. These doctors are using the platform to stay better connected with their existing patients and are not being paid by Phable. The startup, however, also enables patients to discover more doctors. All in all, Sinha said doctors have seen their revenue grow by 20% by using Phable’s platform.</p>
<p>“Phable started with an uncompromising vision of connected healthcare, reimagined through leading-edge technology, and has been unrelenting in their efforts since day one. It&#8217;s been our privilege to work with the team through our accelerator MOX and to further support Phable as they go on to better millions of lives in India,” said William Bao Bean, general partner at SOSV, in a statement.</p>
