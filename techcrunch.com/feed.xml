										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following numerous reports that the U.S. government was seeking to crack down on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dji" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dji">DJI, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the Department of Commerce today will be adding the drone giant to its &#8220;Entity List.&#8221; The decision is set to officially go into effect at around 11AM ET this morning, when the list is officially released. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idCAKBN28S24I-OCATC?edition-redirect=ca">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://dronedj.com/2020/12/18/dji-added-to-us-dept-of-commerce-entity-list-bad-news-for-chinese-company/">Drone DJ</a> have issued early reporting based on a conference call with a state official.</p>
<p>The news comes as a pretty massive blow to DJI. The 14-year-old Chinese company has been an utterly dominant force in the drone category. Here in the States, it commands an estimated 77% of the market.</p>
<p>Increased tensions between the U.S. and China have long been a looming concern for DJI’s presence in the States, with surveillance capabilities being a particular sticking point. Along with their wildly successful consumer drones, DJI also has a wide reach in both industrial and governmental applications. In fact, the company specifically offers a<a href="https://enterprise.dji.com/government"> government line of products</a> as part of its enterprise offerings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DJI is one of dozens of companies added to the list. Also of note is chipmaker, SMIC. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross singled the chipmaker out in a press release this morning, stating, “we will not allow advanced U.S. technology to help build the military of an increasingly belligerent adversary.”</p>
<p>The DOC notably placed Huawei and several of its affiliates to the list last year, a move that has severely hamstrung the hardware giant. Among other things, it’s cut off the company’s access from key U.S. technologies like Google’s Android and other software. Huawei has opted to develop its own operating system, but the landing has been a difficult one to stick.</p>
<p>There’s been a good deal of talk around restricting use of the company’s technology by federal and state departments, but this update could prove even more sweeping. DJI has been bracing for this manner of revelation over the past year and chance. The drone maker <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/73687758-f050-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195">has spent a lot of time</a> and resources lobby on Capitol Hill. There&#8217;s been a good deal of speculation around the shape these bans will take after a new President is sworn in on January 20.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to both DJI and the DOC and will update accordingly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.creditas.com/">Creditas</a>, the Brazilian lending business, has raised $255 million in new financing as financial services startups across Latin America continue to attract massive amounts of cash.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s credit portfolio has crossed 1 billion reals ($196.66 million) and the new round will value the company at $1.75 billion thanks to $570 million raised in outside financing over five rounds.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/creditas" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="creditas">Creditas <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is the latest company to benefit from a boom in financial services startup investing across the region. As the year dawned, venture investments into fintech startups in Latin America had grown from $50 million in 2014 to top $2.1 billion in 2020 across 139 deals, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/latin-america-fintech-drivers/">according to a report from CB Insights</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Investors in the round include new investors like LGT Lightstone, Tarsadia Capital, Welington Management, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/e-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="e-ventures">e.ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and an affiliate of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/advent-international" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="advent-international">Advent International, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Sunley House Capital. Previous investors including SoftBank Vision Fund 1, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/softbank" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="softbank">SoftBank <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Latin America DFund, VEF, Kaszek, Vemtires and Amadeus Capital Partners also returned to put more money into the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Creditas is still in the early innings of penetrating the huge untapped secured lending market in Brazil and Mexico&#8221; says Paulo Passoni, Managing Partner of Softbank Latam fund, in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company&#8217;s growth is a testament both to the need for new lending products across Latin America and the perspicacity of investors like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kaszek-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kaszek-ventures">Kaszek Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> whose portfolio has included several massive wins from bets on startups tackling financial services in Latin America.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The journey since our investment in the Series A has been absolutely extraordinary. The team has executed on its vision, and Creditas has evolved into an asset-light ecosystem that resolves key financial needs of its customers throughout their lifetimes”, says Nicolas Szekasy, Managing Partner of Kaszek Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another big winner is Redpoint&#8217;s e.ventures fund, which has focused on investments in Latin America for the last several years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;By empowering Brazilians to take control of their lending needs at reasonable rates, Creditas creates a beloved consumer product that will drive significant value for customers and investors. Having been involved since the seed stage through Redpoint e.ventures, we&#8217;re thrilled to support the company with our Global Growth Fund as well, as they change the Brazilian fintech landscape,&#8221; said Mathias Schilling, co-founder and Managing Partner of e.ventures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Creditas has plans to use the cash to expand its home and auto lending as well as a payday lending service based on customers&#8217; salaries and a retail option to sell through buy now, pay later loans based on a customer&#8217;s salary.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is also looking to expand to other markets, with an eye toward establishing a foothold in the Mexican market as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Founded in 2012, when the founders worked out of a 5 squre meter office on Berrini Avenue in Sao Paulo, the company now boasts a robust business with hundreds of employees and a business resting on a secured lending marketplace and independent home and auto lending operations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company also released quarterly results for the first time, showing losses narrowing from 74.9 million Brazilian reals to 40.5 million reais in the year ago quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zomato" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zomato">Zomato <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has raised $660 million in a financing round that it kicked off last year as the Indian food delivery startup prepares to go public next year.</p>
<p>The Indian startup said Tiger Global, Kora, Luxor, Fidelity (FMR), D1 Capital, Baillie Gifford, Mirae, and Steadview participated in the round &#8212; a Series J &#8211;which gives Zomato a post-money valuation of $3.9 billion. Zomato had previously disclosed fundraise of about $212 million as part of Series J round from Ant Financial, Tiger Global, Baillie Gifford, and Temasek.</p>
<p>Deepinder Goyal, the co-founder and chief executive of Zomato, said the 12-year-old startup is also in the process of closing a $140 million secondary transaction. &#8220;As part of this transaction, we have already provided liquidity worth $30m to our ex-employees,&#8221; he tweeted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup originally anticipated to close a round of about $600 million by January this year, but several obstacles including the global pandemic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/indias-zomato-raises-100m-from-tiger-global-says-it-is-planning-to-file-for-ipo-next-year/">delayed the fundraise effort</a>. Additionally, Ant Financial, which had originally committed to invest $150 million in this round, only delivered a third of it, Zomato&#8217;s investor Info Edge disclosed earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Gurgaon-headquartered startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/uber-sells-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato/">acquired the Indian food delivery business of Uber</a> early this year, competes with Prosus Ventures-backed <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/swiggy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="swiggy">Swiggy </a>in India. A third player, Amazon, has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/">emerged in the market</a>, though it currently offers its food delivery service in only parts of Bangalore.</p>
<p>At stake is India&#8217;s food delivery market, which analysts at Bernstein expect to balloon to be worth $12 billion by 2022, they wrote in a report to clients &#8212; accessed by TechCrunch. With about 50% of the market share, Zomato is the current leader among the three, Bernstein analysts wrote.</p>
<p>Zomato eliminated hundreds of jobs this year to improve its finances and navigate the coronavirus pandemic, which significantly hurt the food delivery business in India in the early months. Goyal said the food delivery market is &#8220;rapidly coming out of COVID-19 shadows. December 2020 is expected to be the highest ever GMV month in our history. We are now clocking ~25% higher GMV than our previous peaks in February 2020.&#8221; He added, &#8220;I am supremely excited about what lies ahead and the impact that we will create for our customers, delivery partners, and restaurant partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>In September, Goyal told employees that Zomato was working for its IPO for “sometime in the first half of next year” and was raising money to build a war-chest for &#8220;future M&amp;A, and fighting off any mischief or price wars from our competition in various areas of our business.”</p>
<p>Making money with food delivery has been especially challenging in India. Unlike Western markets such as the U.S., where the value of each delivery item is about $33, in India, a similar item carries the price tag of $4, according to estimates by Bangalore-based research firm RedSeer.</p>
<p>“The problem is that there are very few people in India who can afford to place an order from a food delivery firm each day,” said Anand Lunia, a venture capitalist at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/india-quotient" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="india-quotient">India Quotient, </a>in an interview with TechCrunch earlier this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So much for a year-end IPO slowdown.</p>

Let&#8217;s get into the filing!</p>
<h2>Poshmark</h2>
<p>Poshmark is an e-commerce marketplace that allows users to sell new and used fashion-related goods to one another. It sits atop secular trends towards e-commerce over traditional retail, mobile commerce over static, and what I would call a cultural rethinking of used goods in recent years.</p>
<p>And of course, Poshmark has braved the economic waves that COVID-19 brought to the global market.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s model is simple: It holds no inventory, instead providing a marketplace where buyers and sellers connect, juiced with an algorithmically-built feed of items and an emphasis on digital social interactions. At the end of 2019, the company&#8217;s audience was 83% female and 80% of its members were part of the Gen Z and Millennial generations.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to understand how Poshmark makes money, with the company charging 20% of a sale price for goods over $15, or a capped rate for cheaper goods.</p>
<p>In theory, the company has a workable flywheel for growth. Attracting new users via marketing helps it build a deeper user base. Those users generate more social activity and purchases, which, in turn, could bring in more sellers.</p>
<p>That would help keep Poshmark&#8217;s goods selection fresh. Which, could attract even more buyers. More goods and more sales means more revenues for Poshmark. Which can then spend some of the resulting margin back into marketing, kickstarting the process all over again.</p>
<p>But despite that winsome circular updraft, the company has posted regular losses, which means Poshmark has had to outspend its business model to keep its growth up. Until 2020, that is. This year, things turned around in profit-terms for the e-commerce marketplace, ending with the company turning in consecutive profitable quarters.</p>
<p>Poshmark&#8217;s cash generation also improved in 2020, putting it on strong footing heading into its public offering. As with other companies that wound up enjoying a strong 2020 based at least in part on COVID-19 and its resulting economic impacts, investors will have to math out what happens to the company in 2021.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the company&#8217;s historical growth and how it wound up generating net income this year.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>From the first nine months of 2019 to the same period of 2020, Poshmark grew its revenues 28% from $150.5 million to $192.8 million. Its profitability, however, swung sharply from a net loss of $33.9 million in the first three quarters of 2019 to net income of $8.1 million during the same period of 2020.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://unfold.com">Unfold</a>, the social media startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/squarespace-acquires-unfold/">acquired by Squarespace</a> last year, is launching a new tool for users to share all the links that are important with them.</p>
<p>This is the first step <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/unfold-ee0f" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="unfold-ee0f">Unfold <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has taken beyond its story-format authoring tools. Co-founder Andy McCune told me that the team has a bigger vision now — just as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/squarespace" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="squarespace">Squarespace <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has become &#8220;the all-in-one platform for your web presence,&#8221; Unfold aims to become &#8220;the all-in-one platform for your social presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re both playing in very saturated spaces with a lot of competitors,&#8221; McCune said. &#8220;We both stand out because we appeal to the person that cares about design. That’s always been the North Star.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the case of the new <a href="https://unfold.com/biosites">Bio Sites</a>, he said one of the goals is to help Unfold users — whether they&#8217;re individuals or large brands — become less reliant on a single social media platform. After all, he noted that when you build a following on Instagram, you&#8217;re building on &#8220;borrowed territory,&#8221; and &#8220;you don&#8217;t really own your audience.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089113" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089113" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2089113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BioSites_Interface.gif?w=680" alt="Unfold Bio Sites" width="680" height="441" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089113" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Unfold</p></div></p>
<p>By creating a simple profile that highlights the links of your choice, then by linking your Instagram and other social profiles to your Bio Site, you can then point audiences to other channels where you have more control — or at least diversify the platforms that you&#8217;re relying on.</p>
<p>McCune and his co-founder Alfonso Cobo aren&#8217;t the first ones to think of this idea. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/linktree-raises-10-7m-for-its-lightweight-link-centric-user-profiles/">Linktree raised funding</a> earlier this year, and there are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21443811/social-media-bio-links-business-tiktok-instagram-influencers">other startups creating similar products</a>. But Cobo said Bio Sites benefit from Unfold&#8217;s design-centric approach, allowing users to create simple profiles that aren&#8217;t just functional, but also looks great and reflect their personality.</p>
<p>Cobo also noted that Bio Sites are created from the Unfold native app — it&#8217;s launching on Android today, with plans for iOS in January. The feature will be available available to all Unfold users, including free users, but subscribers to the premium Unfold+ and Unfold for Brands tiers get additional features like custom URLs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re really going to be expanding in the next few weeks with presence and expressibility tools to help users stand out in different ways,&#8221; Cobo said. &#8220;We&#8217;re also very interested in commerce and will be exploring that route in the future, too.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a return to active launch, constellation satellite operator <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oneweb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oneweb">OneWeb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has sent 36 new satellites to join its existing spacecraft on orbit. This is the third large batch of OneWeb satellites to be delivered, after an initial launch of six in 2019, and then a second and third launch of 34 satellites each in February and March of this year. The company then ran into financial difficulties that led to its filing for bankruptcy protection in March, before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/oneweb-emerges-from-bankruptcy-aims-to-begin-launching-satellites-again-on-december-17/">emerging from said bankruptcy in July</a> thanks to a deal funded in part by the UK government, and in part by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/the-uk-government-to-acquire-satellite-company-oneweb-in-deal-funded-in-part-by-indias-bharti-global/">Bharti Global</a>. In short, it&#8217;s <em>been a year</em> for OneWeb.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s launch took off from the Vostochny cosmodrome, and used a Russian Soyuz-2.1b rocket to make the trip. This is the first ever commercial launch from Vostochny (prior commercial launches handled by Roscosmos have used the Baikonur cosmodrome), and it meant that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oneweb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oneweb">OneWeb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> could launch 36 satellites instead of 34, because of its position relative to OneWeb&#8217;s target orbit.</p>

<p>OneWeb is building a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites that will provide high-bandwidth connectivity for use in Earth-based networks. The company aims to ultimately have 648 satellites on orbit, and intends to speed up the pace of its launches in order to achieve its target by 2022, which will enable it to offer global network coverage to its customers.</p>
<p>Getting ramped and operational is key to OneWeb being able to generate revenue from its offering. The company is also competing with major, well-capitalized LEO networks being created by both <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Amazon – but we heard from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Dave Limp just this past week at TC Sessions: Space that there should be plenty of room for multiple winners in the LEO broadband market, since there&#8217;s no shortage of demand for high-quality connectivity at a global scale.</p>
<p>While OneWeb&#8217;s arrangement with Bharti and the UK has helped it emerge from bankruptcy, Bharti founder and Chairman Sunil Mittal <a href="https://spacenews.com/oneweb-optimistic-about-raising-the-funding-needed-to-complete-its-constellation/">noted earlier this week</a> that the company will likely need to raise a total of $2.5 billion to finish its constellation – half of which is provided by the UK/Bharti consortium.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve seen a big wave of proptech startups emerge to reimagine how houses and bought and sold, with some tapping into the opportunity with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/sundae-snags-36m-to-build-out-its-distressed-property-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distressed property</a>, and others exploring the &#8220;<a href="http://opendoor.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iBuyer</a>&#8221; model where houses are bought, fixed up and resold by a single startup to homeowners who don&#8217;t want to invest in a fixer-upper. But the vast majority of homes are still sold the traditional way, by way of a real estate agent working via a broker.</p>
<p>Today, a startup is announcing that it has raised seed funding not to disrupt, but improve that basic model with a more flexible approach that can help agents work in a more modern way, and to ultimately scale out the number of people working as agents in the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.avenue8.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avenue 8</a>, which describes itself as a &#8220;mobile-first residential real estate brokerage&#8221; &#8212; providing a new set of tools for agents to source, list and sell homes, and handle the other aspects of the process that fall between those &#8212; has raised $4 million. This is a seed round, and Avenue 8 plans to use it to expand further in the cities where it is already active &#8212; it&#8217;s been in beta thus far in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas &#8212; as well as grow to several more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is notable because of the backers that the startup has attracted early on. It&#8217;s being led by Craft Ventures &#8212; the firm co-founded by David Sacks and Bill Lee that has amassed a <a href="https://www.craftventures.com/portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prolific and impressive portfolio of companies</a> &#8212; with Zigg Capital, and Good Friends (an early-stage fund from the founders of Warby Parker, Harry&#8217;s, and Allbirds) also participating.</p>
<p>There has been at <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/5230/proptech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">least $18 billion in funding</a> raised by proptech companies in the last decade, and with that no shortage of efforts to take the lessons of tech &#8212; from cloud computing and mobile technology, through to artificial intelligence, data science, and innovations in e-commerce &#8212; and apply them to the real estate market.</p>
<p>Michael Martin, who co-founded Avenue 8 with Justin Fichelson, believes that this pace of change, in fact, means that one has to continually consider new approaches.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;It&#8217;s important to remember that Compass&#8217;s growth strategy was to roll out its technology to traditional brokerages,&#8221; he said of one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/30/real-estate-platform-compass-raises-another-370m-on-a-6-4b-valuation-en-route-to-an-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big juggernauts</a> in the space (which itself has seen its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/with-the-real-estate-industry-facing-headwinds-softbank-backed-compass-lays-off-15-of-staff-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenges</a>). &#8220;But if you built it today, it would be fundamentally different.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And he believes that &#8220;different&#8221; would look not unlike Avenue 8. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup is based around a subscription model for a start, rather than a classic 30/70 split on the sales commissions that respectively (and typically) exist between brokers and agents. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Around that basic model, Avenue 8 has built a set of tools that provides agents with an intuitive way to use newer kinds of marketing and analytics tools both to get the word out about their properties across multiple channels; analytics to measure how their efforts are doing, in order to improve future listings; and access to wider market data to help them make more informed decisions on valuations and sales. It also providers a marketplace of people &#8212; valets &#8212; who can help stage and photograph properties for listing, and Avenue 8 doesn&#8217;t require payments to be made to those partners unless a home sells.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It also provides all of this via a mobile platform &#8212; key for people in a profession that often has them on the move. </span></p>
<p>Targeting agents that have in the past relied essentially on using whatever tools the brokers use &#8212; which often were simply their own sites plus some aggregating portals &#8212; Avenue 8&#8217;s pitch is not just better returns but a better process to get there.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard time and time again that agents struggle to identify and leverage the technology and tools to successfully manage their relationships and properties. Changing buyer/seller expectations have accelerated the digital transformation of most agents’ workflows,” said Ryan Orley, Partner at Zigg Capital, in a statement. “Avenue 8 is building and integrating the right software and resources for our new reality.”</p>
<p>What&#8217;s also interesting about Avenue 8 is how it can open the door to a wider pool of agents in the longer run.</p>
<p>The real estate market has been noticeably resilient throughout the pandemic, with lower interest rates, a generally lower overall home inventory, and people spending more time at home (and wanting a better space) creating a high level of demand. With a number of other industries feeling the pinch, a flexible platform like Avenue 8&#8217;s creates a way for people &#8212; who have taken and passed the certifications needed to become agents &#8212; to register and flexibly work as an agent as much or as little as they choose, creating a kind of &#8220;Uber for real estate agents,&#8221; as it were.</p>
<p>That scaling opportunity is likely one of the reasons why this has potentially caught the eye of investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Avenue 8&#8217;s organic growth is clear evidence that the market demands a mobile-first, digital platform,” said Jeff Fluhr, General Partner at Craft Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Michael and Justin have a clear vision for modernizing real estate while keeping agents at the center. Avenue 8’s model helps agents take home more even in today’s environment where commissions are compressing.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, just as Uber&#8217;s changed the way that on-demand transportation is ordered and delivered, Avenue 8 is starting to see some interesting traction in terms of its place in the real estate market. Although it was originally targeted at agents with the pitch of being like &#8220;a better broker&#8221; &#8212; providing the services brokers are regulated to provide, but with a more modern wrapper around it &#8212; it&#8217;s also in some cases attracting brokerages, too. Martin said that it&#8217;s already working with a few smaller ones, and ultimately might consider ways of providing its tools to larger ones to manage their businesses better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I was made aware of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/surrogate" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="surrogate">Surrogate.tv’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> work earlier this year when the site released a Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit tournament. Nintendo’s IRL take on its popular racing title was a great showcase for the technology &#8212; though, admittedly, there was enough lag in the remote operation to make control something of an issue.</p>
<p>Of course, Mario Kart is just one of the experiences the platform offers. It’s a pretty broad range, all told, from pinball to battling robots to claw machines. The diversity of experience is probably the service’s biggest strength, all told.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxsjNP-KpIQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today the Finnish startup announced that it has closed a $2.5 million seed round, led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rooks-nest-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rooks-nest-ventures">Supernode Global <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and followed by PROfounders, Brighteye Ventures and Business Finland. The latest sum joins a $2 million pre-seed announced by the company last year.</p>
<p>The company’s big play is an ultra-low-latency streaming and robotics bundle that lets users remotely control real-world objects in the manner of a streaming gaming service. Another recent example is a partnership with Ubisoft, where users raised miniature Viking ships against strongman Hafþór Björnsson, for some reason. 2020, I guess.</p>

<p>“Previously, such teleoperation technology would be accessible only for very specific, mainly enterprise, applications,” CEO Shane Allen said of the seed raise. “With this second round of funding, we will be able to launch a string of exciting initiatives that will enable people to create experiences that have never been possible before, all using our technology.”</p>
<p>It seems clear that Surrogate.tv is looking to expand beyond its own entertainment site, offering up its teleoperation technology to interested third-parties. It’s something many have no doubt been investigating in a year when in-person events have been largely off limits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After spending more than a decade disrupting the neighborhood stores in the U.S. and several other markets, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Walmart are employing an unusual strategy in India to face off this competitor: Friending them.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/walmart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="walmart">Walmart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Amazon, both of which face restrictions from New Delhi on what all they could do in India, have partnered with tens of thousands of neighborhood stores in the world’s second-largest internet market this year to leverage the vast presence of these mom and pop stores.</p>
<p>In June this year, at the height of the pandemic, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-launches-smart-stores-in-india-to-win-mom-and-pop/">announced “Smart Stores.”</a> Through this India-specific program, for instance, Amazon is providing physical stores with software to maintain a digital log of the inventory they have in the shop and supplying them with a QR code.</p>
<p>When consumers walk to the store and scan this QR code with the Amazon app, they see everything the shop has to offer, in addition to any discounts and past reviews from customers. They can select the items and pay for it using Amazon Pay. Amazon Pay in India supports a range of payments services, including the popular UPI, and debit and credit cards.</p>
<p>The world’s largest e-commerce giant also maintains partnerships that allow it to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/18/amazon-india-kirana-neighborhood-stores/">turn tens of thousands of neighborhood stores as its delivery point for customers</a> &#8212; and sometimes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/amazon-begins-selling-items-from-neighborhood-stores-in-india-amid-facebooks-deal-with-jio/">even rely on them for inventory</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amazon partners with thousands of kirana stores all over India as delivery points. It’s good for customers, and it helps the shop owners earn additional income. Got to visit one in Mumbai. Thank you, Amol, for letting me deliver a package. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MSME?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MSME</a> <a href="https://t.co/VpoHUoJOIH">pic.twitter.com/VpoHUoJOIH</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1218440995731316736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>India has over 60 million small businesses that dot the thousands of cities, towns and villages across the country. These mom and pop stores offer all kinds of items, are family run, and pay low wages and little to no rent.</p>
<p>This has enabled them to operate at an economics that is better than most &#8212; if not all &#8212; of their digital counterparts, and their scale allows them to offer unmatched fast delivery.</p>
<p>Krishna Shah, a New Delhi-based doctor, on paper is one of the perfect customers of e-commerce services. She lives in an urban city, uses digital payments apps and her earnings put her in the top 5% income level in the country. Yet, when she needed to buy food for her cats and needed it as soon as possible, she realized the major giants would take hours, if not longer. She ended up placing a call to a neighborhood store, which delivered the item within 10 minutes.</p>
<p>That neighborhood store, which employs fewer than half a dozen people, was competing with over a dozen giants and heavily funded startups including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/grofers-trusted-delivery-partner" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="grofers-trusted-delivery-partner">Grofers <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bigbasket-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bigbasket-com">BigBasket <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; and it won.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s retail market, which is estimated to be worth $1.3 trillion by 2025, from about $700 billion last year, according to Boston Consulting Group and the Retailers’ Association India. E-commerce, by several estimates, accounts for just 3% of the retail market in the country.</p>
<p>If that figure wasn’t small enough already, consider this: Some of the biggest customers of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flipkart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flipkart">Flipkart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Amazon are these small retail stores. An executive with direct knowledge of the matter told TechCrunch that during some sales, as high as 40% of all smartphone units are bought by physical stores. The idea is, the executive said, to buy the devices at a discounted price, sit on them for a few days and when Amazon and Flipkart are done with their sales, sell the same phones at their standard prices.</p>
<p>Sujeet Kumar, co-founder of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/udaan" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="udaan">Udaan, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a Bangalore-based startup that works with merchants, said that even as smartphones and the internet have reached all corners of India, e-commerce hasn’t been able to disrupt the retail market.</p>
<p>“The problem is that it is very difficult for e-commerce companies to build a supply chain and distribution network that is more efficient than those established by neighborhood stores. These mom and pop stores operate on an insanely different kind of cost economics. E-commerce companies are not able to match it,” he said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China&#8217;s top chipmaker, is under mounting pressure as reports of its CEO&#8217;s looming departure and a potential U.S. sanction concern investors.</p>
<p>The U.S. Commerce Department is looking to add dozens of companies, mostly Chinese and including partially state-owned SMIC, to its trade blacklist, <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-sanctions-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-to-blacklist-dozens-of-chinese-firms-including-smic-sources-say-idUSKBN28S0HL">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-sanctions-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-to-blacklist-dozens-of-chinese-firms-including-smic-sources-say-idUSKBN28S0HL">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported on Friday. The move would effectively restrict SMIC from buying key components from U.S. suppliers to build advanced chipsets.</p>
<p>Telecoms equipment and smartphone making giant Huawei, which counts SMIC as a supplier, has been struggling with phone production after the Trump Administration added it to the trade blacklist and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/us-commerce-department-updates-rules-to-further-limit-huaweis-chip-access/">cut off its key chip access</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month, the U.S. government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/the-trump-administration-will-add-smic-chinas-largest-chipmaker-to-its-defense-blacklist-report/">reportedly</a> added SMIC to its defense blacklist, which would bar American investors from buying securities from the company.</p>
<p>SMIC and the Commerce Department cannot be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>The reports arrived amid SMIC&#8217;s management shakeup and what appears to be internal politics at the chipmaking firm. SMIC recently appointed Chiang Shang-Yi, formerly a co-chief operating officer at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), as vice-chairman. Days later an alleged resignation letter from Liang Mong Song made rounds online, and in it, the co-chief executive of SMIC said he was unaware of Chiang&#8217;s appointment and the hiring had prompted him to quit.</p>
<p>SMIC subsequently issued a statement saying<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-champion-chip-maker-checks-if-co-ceo-still-wants-to-work-there-11608117694"> it is &#8220;verifying&#8221;</a> the executive&#8217;s intention to quit, sending the company&#8217;s shares <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55f1cafb-91b8-4ddf-8b83-be8f5f71d327">plummeting</a>.</p>
<p>The fate of SMIC and TSMC is tightly linked to that of Huawei. TSMC, once an important supplier to Huawei, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/tsmc-reportedly-stops-taking-orders-from-huawei-after-new-u-s-export-controls/">reportedly halted orders</a> from the Chinese firm following new U.S. export controls. There were hopes that SMIC could be a replacement, but industry observers have long argued that the Chinese chipmaker is <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/smic-everything-you-need-know">years behind its Taiwanese rival</a> on making state of the art chipsets for phones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sony" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sony">Sony <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has pulled &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077,&#8221; one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cyberpunk-2077-a-retro-futuristic-fantasy-with-huge-potential-if-you-can-ignore-the-cyberjank/">most anticipated games in recent years</a>, from its PlayStation Store after a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kdjq1h/rcyberpunkgame_console_bugs_questions/">flood of complaints</a> and ridicule over compatibility issues and bugs from customers.</p>
<p>The gaming giant <a href="https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1339737360184078336">said</a> it is offering full refunds to any customer who purchased CD Projekt’s title from the PlayStation Store &#8212; though customers need to ask for it. Last week, CD Projekt announced that &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077&#8221; had been pre-ordered more than 8 million times. A day later (Friday), the company said its revenue from digital pre-order sales alone exceeded all of Cyberpunk 2077&#8217;s production, marketing, and promotional costs.</p>
<p>Daniel Ahmad, Senior Analyst at Niko Partners, <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1339762629422804993">said</a> the delisting of a much-anticipated title is unprecedented in the gaming industry. “I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever really seen something like this in the industry before. The only thing that comes close is when Warner Bros. delisted &#8216;Batman Arkham Knight&#8217; from PC due to technical issues, but that was from the publisher themselves. This is the platform holder delisting the game.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said CD Projekt could have delayed the release of &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077&#8221; by another year and avoided the situation it has landed itself in. “&#8217;Cyberpunk 2077&#8242; was expected to become a 30 million+ seller prior to launch. But the state of the game and CDPR&#8217;s handling of the situation post launch has led to this.”</p>
<p>CD Projekt released &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077,&#8221; a game that was first unveiled seven years ago, on December 10 following multiple delays. Shares of CD Projekt were down more than 13% at the time of publishing.</p>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment “strives to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction, and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via PlayStation Store and want a refund,” the company said Friday. &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077&#8221; title is also plagued by bugs and other glitches on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kdjq0z/rcyberpunkgame_pc_bugs_questions/">other platforms</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, CD Projekt acknowledged that more attention should have been paid to make the game “play better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.” The company also said it would offer refund to unsatisfied customers, but many users said they had not received their money back.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like people didn&#8217;t see this coming for a few months now,&#8221; said Niko Partners&#8217; Ahmad. &#8220;From the many delays of the game prior, to developers and QA pointing out issues, to last gen footage of the game being deliberately hidden / taken down (as admitted by CDPR) and more. There are multiple lessons to learn from this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An important one being that management /production processes need to improve. It turns out crunching non stop for months doesn&#8217;t make a game good. It negatively impacts not just the health of devs, but the game too There will also be wider impacts on the industry when it comes to guidelines for marketing, certification and refunds from a publisher and platform holder level Anyway, will be interesting to see how CDPR respond and how they can salvage the lost goodwill they built up over years,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>In August, TME and UMG <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/universal-music-tencent-joint-label/">said</a> they were launching a joint label to discover, develop and promote Chinese artists domestically and to the world.</p>

<p>Tencent has been pally with all three music label giants, which have been licensing content to the Chinese firm&#8217;s music-focused apps. Both Warner Music and Sony Music Entertainment bought shares in TME when the latter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/02/tencent-music-ipo/">went public in Hong Kong</a>.</p>
<p>Warner Music&#8217;s SEC filing earlier this year showed that it had <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/tencent-now-owns-10-of-universal-9-of-spotify-and-nearly-2-of-warner-music-group/">sold a small stake</a> to Tencent. And one should be reminded that Tencent also had a deal with Spotify from 2017 when the two <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/spotify-tencent-share-swap/">swapped stakes</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When an accident on a building site resulted in the death of their friend, the founders of <a href="https://safesitehq.com/">Safesight</a> were inspired to launch the platform to digitize safety programs for construction. The data from that gave birth to a new InsurTech startup this year, <a href="https://getforesight.com/">Foresight</a>, which covers workers&#8217; compensation. The startup has now released, for the first time, news that it raised a $15 million funding round back in May this year, with participation from Blackhorn Ventures and Transverse Insurance Group. To date, it has raised $20.5 million from industrial technology venture capital firms, led by Brick and Mortar Ventures and Builders VC.</p>
<p>Foresight launched in August of this year but has already covered $30M in risks. The company says it is now on pace to reach $50M in underwritten premium in 2021. By leveraging the data from sister company Safesite, the platform says it has been able to reduce workers comp incidents by up to 57% in a study conducted by actuarial consulting firm Perr &amp; Knight.</p>
<p>Foresight’s algorithm leverages Safesight data to predict incidents, highlight risks, and informs underwriting. By wrapping Safesite risk management technology and services into every policy, Foresight provides a path to lower incident rates and lower premiums for customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of the $57Bn national workers compensation market, Foresight focuses on policies ranging from $150K to $1M+ in annual premiums. The company says this segment has been largely overlooked by well-funded InsurTech startups such as Next <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/insurance-1d9d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="insurance-1d9d">Insurance <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Pie, which provide small business policies under $50K in annual premiums.</p>
<p>Foresight and Safesite were developed by longtime friends and co-founders David Fontain, Peter Grant, and Leigh Appel.</p>
<p>Fontain said: “Foresight strengthens the correlation between safety and savings while providing the fast and easy user experience InsurTechs are known for. We leverage purpose-built technology to drive behavioral shifts and provide an irresistible alternative to traditional workers compensation coverage.”</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/darren-bechtel" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="darren-bechtel">Darren Bechtel, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the founder and managing director at Brick &amp; Mortar Ventures commented: &#8220;We first invested in 2016 and have known the founders since 2015 when it was just the two of them, squatting at a couple of empty desks inside another portfolio company’s office. Their initial vision was both elegant and powerful, and the demonstrated impact of their solution on safety performance, even in early interactions with the product, was impossible to ignore.”</p>
<p>Foresight now covers Nevada, Oklahoma, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/arizona" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="arizona">Arizona, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Arkansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico. The company expects to launch workers compensation in the eastern US and a general liability line in early 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7 Labs</a>, the makers of a computer vision platform that helps AI teams &#8220;automate&#8221; and future-proof their training data workflows as advances in AI continue, has picked up $3 million in funding. Leading the seed round is Amadeus Capital Partners, with participation from Partech, Nathan Benaich’s Air Street Capital and Miele Venture.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 by Singularity University alumnus Alberto Rizzoli and former R&amp;D lead at RSI, Simon Edwardsson (the same team behind &#8220;seeing&#8221; app Aipoly), the V7 Labs platform promises to accelerate the creation of high-quality training data by 10-100x. It does this by giving users the ability to build automated image and video data pipelines, organize and version complex data sets, and train and deploy &#8220;state-of-the-art&#8221; vision AI models.</p>
<p>“For companies to build computer vision solutions that deliver business value, they must continuously collect, label and retrain their models,” explains V7 Labs’ Rizzoli. “When we built Aipoly in 2015, we needed to build and maintain our own tools, whilst keeping up with the rapid state of the art of AI, because no third-party SaaS products were available”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fast-forward to today and Rizzoli says that many of the best computer vision companies are now turning to SaaS platforms like V7 to solve this problem. “There’s a lot to think of when building an AI startup, and ‘how can we efficiently store and query 100 different video data sets’ is something you only think of when you’re mid-flight in trying to deliver your service.</p>
<p>“V7 codifies industry best-practices for organizing data, labelling and launching computer vision models for real-world problems”.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088643" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088643" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2088643" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="430" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg 954w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=768,485 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=680,430 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088643" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> V7 Labs</p></div></p>
<p>The browser and cloud-based platform claims the ability to quickly upload and render large image/video data sets “without lag,” and enable labelling to be automated (to varying degrees) without the need for prior training data. V7 has also been designed to make it possible to keep track of a very large number of labels per image/video, supporting thousands of annotations per image and millions of images per data set. Crucially, Rizzoli tells me it is possible to train, deploy and run computer vision models within the platform “in a few clicks without having to worry about DevOps”.</p>
<p>“Customers will soon be able to audit those models &#8212; and their corresponding training sets &#8212; to debug, test data quality, discover failure cases and eliminate any unwanted bias,” he adds, noting that these are all huge unsolved pain-points in the AI industry.</p>
<p>To that end, V7 Labs&#8217; existing 100 or so customers include Tractable, GE Healthcare and Merck. It is growing fastest within medical imaging, in part because it offers support for DICOM annotation and HIPAA compliance, both must-haves in healthcare.</p>
<p>However, measured by the quantity of data processed on the platform, Rizzoli tells me that routine “expert inspections” are the most popular tasks. “These include dozens of companies using AI to look for damage or anomalies in cars, oil rigs, power lines, pipelines or roads,” he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese tech giants have drawn international criticism after research showed they have technologies that enable the authorities to profile Muslim Uyghurs.</p>
<p>The cloud computing unit of Alibaba, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alibaba-cloud" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="alibaba-cloud">Alibaba Cloud, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> developed a facial recognition algorithm that can identify a person&#8217;s ethnicity or whether a person is &#8220;Uyghur&#8221;, according to <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/alibaba-uyghur">research</a> from surveillance industry publication IPVM.</p>
<p>China has repeatedly <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1723306.shtml">defended</a> its controversial &#8220;<a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1623846.shtml">vocational training programs</a>&#8221; imposed upon its Muslim ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs, Kazakhs and others, as part of what the government calls counter-terrorism efforts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alibaba <a href="https://www.alizila.com/statement-from-alibaba-group-regarding-recent-reports-of-the-companys-facial-recognition-technology/">said</a> in a statement that it is &#8220;dismayed&#8221; to learn that Alibaba Cloud tested a technology that included &#8220;ethnicity as an algorithm&#8221; and that &#8220;racial or ethnic discrimination or profiling in any form violates Alibaba’s policies and values.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We never intended our technology to be used for and will not permit it to be used for targeting specific ethnic groups, and we have eliminated any ethnic tag in our product offering. This trial technology was not deployed by any customer. We do not and will not permit our technology to be used to target or identify specific ethnic groups,&#8221; the company added.</p>
<p>A security breach from last year revealed that a &#8220;smart city&#8221; surveillance system hosted on Alibaba Cloud could detect people&#8217;s ethnicity or label them Uyghur Muslim, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/china-smart-city-exposed/">reported</a> earlier. At the time, Alibaba said as a public cloud provider, it &#8220;does not have the right to access the content in the customer database.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hEEqYZpg55"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/china-smart-city-exposed/">Security lapse exposed a Chinese smart city surveillance system</a></p></blockquote>

<p>IPVM also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/12/huawei-uighurs-identify/">found</a> earlier this month that Huawei and artificial intelligence unicorn Megvii, known for its facial recognition product Face++, jointly developed a technology that could alert the Chinese government when the system detected the face of a member from the Uyghur community.</p>
<p>As China&#8217;s tech upstarts seek overseas growth, they increasingly find themselves stuck between the demands of Beijing and international scrutiny over their stance on human rights issues.</p>
<p>Cloud computing is one of Alibaba&#8217;s fastest-growing segments and the giant is eyeing to attract more international customers. Last year, Alibaba Cloud was the biggest player in the Asia Pacific region and the third-largest Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider globally, <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-named-by-gartner-as-third-biggest-global-provider-for-iaas-and-first-in-asia-pacific_596191">according to</a> research firm Gartner.</p>
<p>Alibaba&#8217;s cloud unit grew 60% year-over-year to account for nearly 10% of the firm&#8217;s revenues in the <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p201105.pdf">three months ended September</a>. As of the quarter, approximately 60% of A-share listed companies, those that are based in mainland China and trade in RMB, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">are customers of Alibaba Cloud, the company claimed.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a period of public feedback, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> adjusted some its plans for a <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts">new verification process, </a>set to roll out next year. The company suspended public <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/twitter-pauses-account-verifications-after-critics-slam-it-for-verifying-charlottesville-rally-organizer/">verification applications in 2017</a> and since appears to have rethought a few aspects of what information the platform should signal to its users, blue checks and beyond.</p>
<p>One big verification-adjacent change around the corner: Twitter plans to add a way of distinguishing bots and other automated accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; It can be confusing to people if it’s not clear that these accounts are automated,&#8221; the company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/our-plans-to-relaunch-verification-and-whats-next.html">wrote in a blog post</a>. &#8220;In 2021, we’re planning to build a new account type to distinguish automated accounts from human-run accounts to make it easier for people to know what’s a bot and what’s not.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2020/08/05/twitter-users-may-have-changed-their-behavior-after-contact-russian-trolls">not all bots are good bots</a>, but automated accounts have flourished on the platform since its early days and bots remain some of the <a href="https://twitter.com/earthquakebot?lang=en">most useful</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MagicRealismBot">whimsical</a> and otherwise beloved sources of tweets.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Beg13AVmjE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/twitter-to-relaunch-account-verifications-in-early-2021-asks-for-feedback-on-policy/">Twitter to relaunch account verifications in early 2021, asks for feedback on policy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter to relaunch account verifications in early 2021, asks for feedback on policy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/twitter-to-relaunch-account-verifications-in-early-2021-asks-for-feedback-on-policy/embed/#?secret=Beg13AVmjE" data-secret="Beg13AVmjE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company is also working on a better way to handle accounts for users who have died, and plans to introduce a memorialization process in 2021. Twitter says that memorialized accounts, like bots, will become &#8220;a new account type&#8221; making them distinct from normal users. The idea grew out of the same spirit as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/twitter-election-labels/">Twitter&#8217;s labels for political figures</a>, which sought to provide contextual info about users that can be seen at a glance.</p>
<p>Taking more than 22,000 pieces of feedback on the new verification process into account, Twitter will no longer require a profile bio or header picture to verify users, calling its former thinking &#8220;too restrictive.&#8221; It&#8217;s also redefined a few of its eligible verification categories, expanding &#8220;sports&#8221; to include esports and adding more language around digital content creators into the entertainment category.</p>
<p>Twitter also apparently received a lot of suggestions calling for additional verification categories for scientists, academics and religious figures. Until it spins out more categories, those users can seek verification under the &#8220;activists, organizers, and other influential individuals&#8221; catch-all category.</p>
<p>Verification applicants will need to apply under a particular category and provide links or other information supporting their application. The new &#8220;self-serve&#8221; verification process will be available through account settings on both mobile and desktop.</p>
<p>Twitter will implement the new account verification policy on January 20, 2021, three years after freezing the process. The company did not specify when public verification applications will be accepted again, but it sounds like the wait won&#8217;t be too long and the company plans to share more soon. Starting on the 20th, Twitter will begin sweeping out inactive verified accounts and others that don&#8217;t meet its new bar for a &#8220;complete account.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts">adjusted policy</a>, a complete account — and one eligible for verification — must have a verified email or phone number, a profile image and a display name. Anyone who&#8217;s verified but doesn&#8217;t meet those criteria will receive notifications of the required changes, which must be made before January 20.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s new policy also lays out the company&#8217;s right to revoke verification for accounts in &#8220;severe or repeated violation&#8221; of the platform&#8217;s rules. It sounds like new policy could lay a clearer path for the company to take against users who break the rules, though that ultimately will come down to enforcement rather than written policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to evaluate such accounts on a case-by-case basis, and will make improvements in 2021 on the relationship between enforcement of our rules and verification,&#8221; Twitter wrote in the post.</p>
<p>Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/968243242184491008">paused the verification process</a> in November, 2017 following a public outcry over its decision to <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/twitter-verifies-charlottesville-rally-boss-jason-kessler-who-called-slain-protesters-death-payback-time">verify Jason Kessler.</a> Kessler infamously organized the Unite the Right event in Charlottesville, Virginia that gathered neo-Nazis and white supremacists, ultimately leaving one peaceful counter protester dead. The pause was extended the next year as the company decided to direct more resources toward election integrity.</p>
<p>With the midterms and the general U.S. election behind it, Twitter has returned to its effort to rethink the verification process and what it symbolizes for users on the platform. The company is also experimenting with new features that could dial down harassment, toxicity and misinformation.</p>
<p>Twitter recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/twitter-retweet-changes-quote-tweet-election-misinformation/">added friction to the retweet process</a> in an effort to slow the spread of misinformation, though it <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1339350208942125066">rolled the change back</a> after the election. Twitter&#8217;s latest test: A new pop-up that displays shared interests and a profile bio when a user goes to reply to someone they don&#8217;t follow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous vehicle company <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aurora-innovation" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aurora-innovation">Aurora Innovation <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sent offers Thursday to more than 75% of employees at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Advanced Technologies Group, just a week after announcing plans to acquire the self-driving subsidiary, according to a source familiar with the post-merger integration plans.</p>
<p>Uber ATG Toronto, which employs about 50 people where the subsidiary conducted its research and development work, did not not made the cut, according to a source. Nor has Uber ATG&#8217;s chief scientist Raquel Urtasun, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/uber-hires-raquel-urtasun-to-lead-a-new-atg-self-driving-unit-in-toronto/">led the Uber ATG R&amp;D team</a>. It was previously confirmed that Uber ATG CEO Eric Meyhofer would not join Aurora once the deal closed. Until today, it was unclear if Urtasun, a University of Toronto professor and the Canada Research Chair in Machine Learning and Computer Vision as well as the co-founder of the Vector Institute for AI, would be moving over to Aurora. Urtasun is considered a leading expert in machine perception for self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Of the 1,200 people who work at Uber ATG, more than 850 received emailed offers from Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson. In the email, an excerpt of which TechCrunch has viewed, Urmson said the decision of who to pick was difficult. He noted that the decisions were based on Aurora&#8217;s specific business needs such as areas of overlaps, relative impact and management reporting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aurora wouldn&#8217;t comment on the offers, but did confirm that Uber&#8217;s Toronto office was not being integrated into the newly combined company. An Uber spokesperson also confirmed that the Toronto R&amp;D lab would not be integrated into the joint organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an independent company focused on our long-term growth and success, we must be thoughtful about where and how we spend resources. To deliver on our mission, we weave research into our development process and engineering work, rather than having a separate research and development team,&#8221; an Aurora spokesperson wrote in an email statement. &#8220;We have immense respect for Raquel Urtasun and her team. The impact they have made on both the ATG team, and the industry in general, is incredible. While she and her team will not be continuing on with Aurora, we wish them tremendous success.&#8221;</p>
<p>If every Uber ATG employee who received an offer accepts, it would more than double Aurora&#8217;s size. Before the acquisition was announced, Aurora had about 600 employees working out of its offices in Palo Alto, San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Texas. Uber ATG had offices in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.</p>
<p>Aurora and Uber had been in talks for months before reaching a complex deal that will value the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">combined company at $10 billion</a>. Aurora is not paying cash for Uber ATG, a company that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/uber-atg-1-billion-toyota-denso-vision-fund-spin-out/">valued at $7.25 billion</a> following a $1 billion investment last year from Toyota, DENSO and SoftBank’s Vision Fund. Instead, Uber is handing over its equity in ATG and investing $400 million into Aurora, which will give it a 26% stake in the combined company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Shareholders in Uber ATG will now become minority shareholders of Aurora.</p>
<p>At the time the deal was announced, Urmson told TechCrunch that the next 60 days would be spent bringing the two teams together and &#8220;dispassionately looking at what is the technology that accelerates our first product to market and then amplifying that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ned-desmond" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ned-desmond">Ned Desmond, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a longtime publishing executive who spent more than half a dozen years at Time Inc. before becoming the chief operating officer of both TechCrunch and Engadget for more than eight years, has joined the investment firm <a href="https://sosv.com/">SOSV</a> as a senior operating partner.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s seemingly a good fit for both sides.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sosv" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sosv">SOSV <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; which is currently managing a $277 million flagship fund alongside some smaller vehicles &#8212; has become known for its popular accelerator programs, including <a href="https://hax.co/">Hax</a>, a program focused around nascent hardware startups, and <a href="https://indiebio.co/">IndieBio</a>, SOSV&#8217;s life sciences-focused accelerator.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, the outfit, founded by serial entrepreneur Sean O&#8217;Sullivan in 1995, has now funded so many startups &#8212; roughly 1,000 of them &#8212; that it recently sought out Desmond to work with them, connect them, shine a light on their work and help them raise follow-on funding.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s work that has become intuitive for Desmond, who among other things was heavily involved in organizing TechCrunch&#8217;s multiple events around the world each year, along with its signature Battlefield competitions, which collectively feature dozens of nascent startups annually.</p>
<p>Indeed, soon after Desmond <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/so-long-techcrunch/">resigned</a> from TechCrunch last summer in search of a new challenge (and some needed downtime), O&#8217;Sullivan reached out to him, asking if he might join SOSV to help with its marketing and sales efforts, as well as to provide coaching and connections to its startups.</p>
<p>By O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s telling, SOSV could use the help more than ever.</p>
<p>The outfit has had its share of successes. It was the lead investor in the electric bike company Jump Bikes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/uber-acquires-bike-share-startup-jump/">acquired</a> by Uber in 2018 for an undisclosed amount. It&#8217;s an early investor in the 3D printing company FormLabs (valued at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2018/08/01/3-d-printing-startup-formlabs-venture-capital-unicorn-1-billion-valuation-financing-jeff-immelt-forbes-30-under-30-alumni-max-lobovsky/#69e047fc7471">more than $1 billion</a> during its last round in 2018). It also wrote an early check to the peer-to-peer car-sharing company <a href="https://www.getaround.com/">GetAround</a>, which was hard hit by the pandemic but whose business has since reportedly rebounded such that it was able to raise $140 million in Series E funding in October. (It has raised $600 million altogether.)</p>

<p>Not last, SOSV is an investor in the lab-grown meat producer <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/memphis-meats" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="memphis-meats">Memphis Meats, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which raised <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-memphis-meats-funding/lab-grown-meat-producer-memphis-meats-raises-161-million-in-funding-led-by-softbank-idUSKBN1ZL2OO">$161 million</a> in new funding at the start up of the year, led by SoftBank.</p>
<p>Still, SOSV is in the same boat as many seed-stage investment firms. It&#8217;s working with a lot of very new teams for whom the pandemic has been rough. <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/q3-2020-global-venture-report/">According to Crunchbase</a>, seed funding in the third quarter was down 32% year over year and down 11% quarter over quarter.</p>
<p>While the buzzier, more established companies have had no problems in fundraising &#8212; many are having to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/technology/this-is-insanity-start-ups-end-year-in-a-deal-frenzy.html">bat back overeager investors</a> &#8212; newer, unproven teams without established connections have found it harder to land seed-stage and Series A checks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a super tough market,&#8221; says O&#8217;Sullivan. &#8220;Angels have completely dropped out. Seed investing is down massively.&#8221; Except in life sciences, especially in the U.S.,&#8221; says O&#8217;Sullivan, &#8220;it&#8217;s tougher for every company because you can&#8217;t move quite as fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>What of Zoom and related talk by VCs of the <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/vcs-covid-19-were-doing-fine-thanks">extra time they now have to meet with new startups</a>? O&#8217;Sullivan suggests with a laugh that there&#8217;s no shortage of posturing in the industry. &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s always doing &#8216;great,&#8217; &#8221; he notes. &#8220;But I&#8217;m a Catholic guy. I have to be honest,&#8221; and there&#8217;s &#8220;nothing quite like going to meet with a company and working with them across the table. When you&#8217;re working with them remotely, it&#8217;s just a slower process.&#8221;</p>

Ghosts! Jack-o-lanterns! Dancing skeletons!</p>
<p>Now they&#8217;ve got another one. Rolled out just in time for tomorrow&#8217;s Season 2 finale of The Mandalorian, this one brings The Child (or, as the world has taken to calling him, &#8220;Baby Yoda&#8221;) into your living room.</p>
<p>Want to check it out yourself? You just need to search for the right thing. <strong>This is the way:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open Google.com in the browser of an iOS or Android device</li>
<li>Search for &#8220;The Child,&#8221; &#8220;Baby Yoda&#8221; or [The Child&#8217;s actual name here which I&#8217;ll omit because spoilers].</li>
<li>Scroll down until the &#8220;View in 3D&#8221; button appears. Tap it, then the &#8220;View in your space&#8221; button. (Depending on your device, you might need the Google search app installed. It worked by default on a Pixel.)</li>
<li>Wait until the camera view pops up, then wave your camera around a bit. Once the camera figures out where the floor is, he should appear. Be sure to bump your volume up.</li>
</ol>
<p>I just tested it myself and it worked well, albeit better on some devices than others. It was fast and flawless on a Pixel, but the lighting was bugging out hard on my iPhone.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a camera button that&#8217;ll let you snap photos and videos, and you can drag/pinch to move him around the room or rotate him in place for better shots. Have fun!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus pandemic has underscored, and often exacerbated, the mental health crisis that exists across the world. Even the spread of remote work is part of the problem: As everyone stays at home, the lack of interaction and watercooler chat has left employees without in-person interaction.</p>
<p>The need for a solution has helped tech-powered mental health solutions raise funding to meet increased demand. In the latest development, it emerged that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lyra-health" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lyra-health">Lyra Health, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a platform that focuses on providing workforces with mental health care, has filed paperwork to raise a $175 million Series E at a $2.25 billion valuation.</p>
<p>The paperwork was uncovered by <a href="https://primeunicornindex.com/lyra-health-secures-175m-series-e-round/">Prime Unicorn Index</a>. While it is not clear whether the company has closed the round, filings in Delaware usually appear after part or all of the funding has been secured. Prime Unicorn Index notes that the terms surrounding this Series E round include a “pari passu liquidation preference with all other preferred, and conventional convertible, meaning they will not participate with common stock if there are remaining proceeds.” It also noted that Lyra Health&#8217;s most recent price per share is $27.47, an up round from the Series D, which priced shares at $14.21.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We are reaching out to the company and investors for a response to the filing. One investor noted that the round has not closed yet.</p>
<p>Past backers of the company include Adams Street Partners, Tenaya Capital, Meritech Capital Partners, IVP and Greylock.</p>
<p>We seem to be in a period of rapid growth rounds getting raised in quick succession for the most promising startups. As with Discord &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/filing-discord-is-raising-up-to-140m-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-7b/">confirmed a $100 million round</a> just six months after raising $100 million &#8212; Lyra Health also recently raised funding &#8212; specifically <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/lyra-health-gains-unicorn-status-after-110m-series-d/">a $110 million Series D</a> that catapulted it above a $1 billion valuation.</p>

<p>That effectively means the startup doubled its valuation in a handful of months, suggesting rapid growth or key validation. As reported by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2020/08/25/lyra-health-hits-11-billion-valuation-as-coronavirus-boosts-need-for-teletherapy/?sh=1b581bf66938">Forbes</a>, Lyra Health was set to bring in around $100 million in revenue by the end of the year at the time of its prior fundraise.</p>
<p>There have been a number of categories of technology that have seen a bump of usage and interest during this coronavirus pandemic, and sadly &#8212; or perhaps usefully, depending on how you look at it &#8212; mental health and wellness startups, aimed at helping our well-being in this trying time, have been one of them. Just last week, the meditation app Calm raised $75 million at a $2 billion valuation.</p>

<p>Burlingame, California-based Lyra Health wants to live in offices everywhere. The company helps employers give their employees a suite of safe and confidential tools to support their mental health needs. This is a tricky space to play in, considering that mental health can still feel taboo in workplaces and employees might feel uncomfortable turning to their employers for support. Still, in a world where in-office perks are no longer available, mental health might be a key investment to help startup retention.</p>
<p>Once an employee joins Lyra, the company creates a set of recommendations for the now-patient based on a survey. Lyra Health then can connect patients to its network of thousands of therapists for appointments, consultations and check-ins. The flywheel continues.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, Lyra Health has brought on 80,000 new users, to a total of 1.5 million users last reported.</p>
<p>Tech-enabled mental health care has found tailwinds as the coronavirus pandemic leads to a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6943a3.htm">surge of telehealth</a>, as in-person doctor’s appointments could leave patients at risk. Indeed, Lyra Health started Lyra Blended Care, which pairs video therapy with online lessons and exercises rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
