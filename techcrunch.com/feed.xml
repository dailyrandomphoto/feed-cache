					<description><![CDATA[One argument in favor of SPACs is that it helps younger companies list. Consider this a more extreme example.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Christmas has come early this year in the form of a new SPAC deal. <a href="https://www.infiniteworld.com/">InfiniteWorld</a> announced yesterday it will <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211213005343/en/InfiniteWorld-a-Leading-Metaverse-Infrastructure-Platform-for-Brands-Announces-Plans-to-Become-a-Publicly-Traded-Company-via-a-Merger-with-Aries-I-Acquisition-Corporation">merge</a> with <a href="https://www.ariescorp.io/">Aries I Acquisition Corporation</a> in a deal that will value the startup at around $700 million, per company calculations.</p>
<p>Another day, another SPAC deal. We know. But this time we&#8217;re talking metaverse, so we have no choice but to take a look.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In the wake of Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">deciding</a> that its original product remit was too narrow, something solved by declaring itself a metaverse company, the phrase has been inescapable. The metaverse might be a somewhat squidgy term &#8212; it&#8217;s something involving <em>digital, community, commerce </em>and<em> having a second online existence</em> &#8212; but it&#8217;s hot around the tech world.</p>
<p>That makes it unsurprising that a company working on the theme has found a blank-check company willing to merge.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220366 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>What&#8217;s InfiniteWorld and what does it do? A grand question; I had no idea. Happily, the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001841867/000110465921148881/tm2135215d1_ex99-2.htm">investor deck</a> helps a bit.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the deal, what the metaverse company sells, and then discuss its somewhat humorous financial projections. To say that InfiniteWorld is a nascent commercial enterprise is an understatement, and in a world where many crypto companies are scaling to huge revenues, it stands out as a low-income concern.</p>
<p>To date, that is. InfiniteWorld has huge projections. Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>The deal</h2>
<p>Infinite Assets, Inc., better known as InfiniteWorld, is merging with Aries I Acquisition Corporation. Aries I is listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol &#8220;RAM.&#8221; As of this morning, the company is trading at roughly $10 per share, having regained modest lost ground since its midyear IPO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The four years that Apex.ai spent rewriting — and then safety certifying — the robot operating system to give automakers and other mobility companies a toolkit to integrate software applications into vehicles has paid off.</p>
<p>The startup founded by Bosch veterans and automated systems engineers Jan Becker and Dejan Pangercic has attracted a number of new strategic and private investors, including suppliers Continental and ZF in a Series B $56.5 million fundraising round led by Orillion. AGCO, Canaan, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Airbus Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover&#8217;s InMotion Ventures and others participated in the round. Apex has raised a total of $74 million to date, a figure that includes previously announced investments from Volvo Group Venture Capital, Toyota Ventures and HELLA Ventures. Notably, ZF is taking a 5% stake in Apex.</p>
<p>Investor appetite for companies like Apex has increased as with the development of autonomous vehicles and as the automotive industry has sought to build so-called &#8220;software-defined&#8221; vehicles that can deliver digital services to drivers and passengers and are capable of updating the software wirelessly — like a smartphone. As vehicles have become more complex, demand for a safety certified software development kit grows. Or at least that is what Apex and its many investors are betting on.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Apex.AI has cornered a unique market by making it easier for manufacturers to implement safety-critical software into mobility systems,&#8221;,&#8221; said Ahmed Sallam, partner at Orillion, who is also joining the board. &#8220;We also invested in Apex.AI because we see significant potential to expand the market for their operating system beyond the automotive industry and into other markets such as agriculture, robotics and internet of things (IoT).&#8221;</p>
<p>Apex.ai has focused on giving automakers and mobility companies a way to seamlessly and safely integrate software applications into vehicles. The startup, which has offices in Palo Alto, Berlin, Stuttgart and Munich, Germany, have developed two products. Apex.OS is a software development kit for autonomous driving software and other safety-critical mobility applications. Apex.OS received certification earlier this year by the TÜV NORD for functional safety according to the highest level of ISO 26262. This means the software is verified to be used in production vehicles, which expands the market potential for Apex.ai.</p>
<p>More recently, the company has been working on an enterprise middleware product, called Apex.middleware, that integrates various protocols to improve communication between software applications.</p>
<p>The fresh capital will be used to ramp up Apex in just about every way possible. Becker told TechCrunch the company plans to double its workforce from about 70 today to 140 by the end of next year, expand into Asia and commercialize its existing products and develop new ones in areas adjacent to the automotive industry, including agriculture, mining, industrial automation and internet of things (IoT). Former Panasonic executive Tavis Szeto will lead the Asia expansion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, e-commerce company Big Cartel&#8217;s co-founders Matt Wigham and Eric Turner voluntarily recognized the Big Cartel Workers Union. After the new year, the union &#8212; which represents all thirty non-management employees at the Salt Lake City-based tech company &#8212; will begin negotiating their contracts. This news comes just nine months after workers at the software company Glitch signed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/following-unionization-glitch-signs-collective-bargaining-agreement/">the tech industry&#8217;s first</a> collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Big Cartel Workers Union will be represented by the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Tech Workers Union Local 1010, the same group that represents unions at </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/kickstarter-workers-vote-to-unionize/">Kickstarter</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://cfaworkersunited.com/">Code for America</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s clear that the founders of Big Cartel want this union to be successful, and they see how all of our values line up,&#8221; said Andrew Shaw, who has worked in marketing for two years at Big Cartel. &#8220;I expect the bargaining can go pretty smoothly and quickly and continue to be a good example of how unionizing can go forward in a tech company in an amicable way.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246800" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have officially won our union! After a signed voluntary recognition agreement and a successful card check, Big Cartel Workers Union is official! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/Kx7AiuXvLR">pic.twitter.com/Kx7AiuXvLR</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Big Cartel Workers Union (@bcworkersunion) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcworkersunion/status/1470450139999490053?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Often, unionization pushes are spurred by a particular moment of crisis. But in the case of Big Cartel, the movement to unionize stemmed from a desire to simply affirm and uphold workplace protections.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really building protections around the things in our working conditions that we value, so ensuring that our pay is solid and equitable across genders, races and teams within the company, and making sure that our benefits are more guaranteed than they are now without a contract. We&#8217;re interested in more transparency and more participation in the decision-making processes for the company,&#8221; Shaw told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Big Cartel Workers Union will also be the first tech union in a &#8220;right-to-work&#8221; state. Twenty-seven states, according to the OPEIU, have &#8220;right-to-work&#8221; laws, which prohibit union security agreements between employers and unions. This means that no employee can be forced to join a union or pay union dues, but sometimes, these policies can make it <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK">more difficult</a> for employees to form unions in the first place.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;So often in these companies, benefits just kind of come up [in conversation], or there has to be an individual conflict in order for you to work out some of these details,&#8221; Shaw said. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to see that we can have these conversations without having to begin with a conflict, or without having to feel like it&#8217;s an urgent crisis moment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Right now, workers at video game company Activision Blizzard are experiencing their own &#8220;urgent crisis moment.&#8221; This summer, the developer of games like &#8220;World of Warcraft&#8221; and &#8220;Call of Duty&#8221; was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/07/22/california-activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexism/">sued</a> by state labor regulators for discriminatory workplace practices, and in September, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/blizzard-sec-investigation/">confirmed</a> it is being investigated by the SEC. Since then, over a thousand workers at Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal">signed a petition</a> to remove CEO Bobby Kotrick, who reportedly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680">covered up</a> sexual assault allegations in the workplace. Last week, a group called <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK">A Better ABK</a> initiated an open-ended strike and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/activision-blizzard-workers-announce-open-ended-strike-and-union-drive/">a union drive</a> &#8212; already, executives have asked employees to &#8220;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828146/activision-blizzard-exec-brain-bulatao-anti-unionization-letter">consider the consequences</a>&#8221; of joining a union.</p>
<p>But even in less extreme cases, the road can be rocky for tech workers who are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/more-tech-workers-are-starting-to-unionize/">starting to unionize.</a> When Kickstarter employees <a href="https://www.opeiu.org/Home/NewsandMedia/TabId/2838/ArtMID/4815/ArticleID/1784/Kickstarter-Refuses-Employees%E2%80%99-Request-to-Recognize-Union.aspx">formed a union</a> in 2019, the crowdfunding company&#8217;s leadership refused to voluntarily recognize the unit. When management doesn&#8217;t recognize a workers&#8217; union, the organizers must conduct an election through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) &#8212; in the case of the Kickstarter union, this process took ten months before they ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/kickstarter-workers-vote-to-unionize/">voted to unionize</a>.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, workers at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/controversial-crime-app-citizen-launches-20-month-protect-service/">controversial</a> crime-tracking app Citizen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/citizen-app-workers-vote-to-unionize-fearing-outsourcing-moves">voted to unionize</a> over a year after unionization efforts began. Earlier this year, a spokesperson for Citizen<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/04/citizen-app-workers-push-to-form-union-as-company-blasts-outside-meddling/"> told the New York Post</a> that the company opposed the union drive.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re definitely inspired by our comrades at Code for America and Kickstarter,&#8221; Shaw told TechCrunch. &#8220;We want others to be inspired by the work that we&#8217;re doing because we want to make sure that not just the thirty people here at Big Cartel are protected, but that workers across all industries and across all companies are protected and treated fairly.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese smartphone giant Oppo revealed its first in-house chipset at its annual innovation event hosted in Shenzhen on Tuesday. The MariSilicon X chip announced &#8212; named after the Mariana Trench &#8212; is a neural processing unit that aims to boost photo and video performance through machine learning.</p>
<p>The move adds Oppo to a list of smartphone makers that are designing their own chips, such as Apple. The MariSilicon project, headed by Qualcomm veteran Jiang Bo, started only in 2019.</p>
<p>The silicon is being manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC)&#8217;s 6-nanometer process technology and will be featured in Oppo’s upcoming flagship handset in the first quarter of 2022. The ongoing global chip shortage will not affect the production of MariSilicon X, Jiang told the press at the event.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247089" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Oppo also unveiled the third generation of its self-developed smart glasses, dubbing it an &#8220;assisted reality&#8221; device instead of an augmented reality one.</p>
<p>The description is apt. The headpiece, which weighs just 30g, is reminiscent of Google Glass. It uses the Snapdragon 4100 chip, which is normally found in smartwatches, and it&#8217;s indeed limited to projecting 2D information such as navigation and translation onto its 1.3mm-thick glasses. It works as an extension of one&#8217;s smartphone, or like a smartwatch with a screen in front of one&#8217;s eyes, rather than an AR device that&#8217;s aware of one&#8217;s environment. It&#8217;s slated to ship next spring.</p>

<p>The third piece of product unveiled is Oppo&#8217;s first folding phone, which came a year after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/chinas-smartphone-giant-oppo-ratchets-up-ar-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concept scrolling phone</a>.

<p>What we know so far is the new phone is spearheaded by Pete Lau, Oneplus&#8217;s co-founder who was appointed Oppo&#8217;s chief product officer after OnePlus became Oppo&#8217;s subbrand this year.</p>
<p>Both owned by the BKK Electronics empire, OnePlus and Oppo shared a supply chain prior to the merger but were operating independently. The merger has seen the two phone makers combining operational and R&amp;D forces, including their operating systems, while the brands remain separate.</p>
<p>OnePlus&#8217;s other co-founder, Carl Pei, has been drumming up buzz for his new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/buying-the-best-wireless-earbuds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earbud venture Nothing</a>, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/nothing-raises-another-50m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won over investors</a> and a horde of early followers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some say that antivirus software that you install on your PC may have run its course when it comes to the next generation of computing in the cloud. Today a startup that has built what it believes comes next is making some news with a large funding round, its first outside money.</p>
<p><a href="https://guard.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guardio</a> &#8212; which has built a browser extension that monitors for suspicious and malicious activity when you are on the web or using any digital service that interconnects using the internet (think messaging services, shopping and banking services, and more, but for now no mobile services) &#8212; has picked up $47 million led by Tiger Global, with Emerge, Vintage, Cerca Partners, Union and Samsung Next also participating. The browser extension doesn&#8217;t impact on a computer&#8217;s or an internet connection&#8217;s latency, nor does it &#8220;just sit in the background,&#8221; CEO Amos Peled said in an interview. &#8220;We want to give advice and help to our users. We believe in positive friction.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a bootstrapped startup, Tel Aviv-based Guardio, which was founded in 2018, has already amassed 1 million users for the extension, which is one reason why it was able to raise so much so early on. Peled &#8212; who co-founded the company with Daniel Sirota, and Michael Vainshtein &#8212; said that the company typically has a detection rate of 73% in the first week for average users, where it has been able to identify activity that might be susceptible to data leakage, malicious extensions and other nefarious activity. (That number increases over time, it seems, as the system learns more.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247065" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of the 1 million active users it has of its freemium product today, Peled said that some 100,000 are paying users, currently a mix of consumers and &#8220;micro&#8221; (ie, very small) businesses. The plan will be to continue growing on both tracks and to continue expanding to a wider set of products. Geographically, the key focus for the company will be continuing growth in the U.S. market, where Peled notes there are some 17 million microbusinesses, companies that will not have dedicated security specialists or necessarily lots of resources to spend on security suites, but are just as susceptible to attacks, and perhaps even more in danger of falling over from them due to their size.</p>
<p>The impetus for the company, Peled said, came out of the realization that many organizations of that size were already paying some money for security protection, but that most of it was legacy antivirus software and therefore not fit for purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Attackers have adapted and they have shifted abuse to browser mechanisms, versus the old days of exploits or attacks on people&#8217;s operating systems,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The protection layers that have been there for a few decades, such as antivirus, didn’t quite adapt so there was a gap in the security landscape. A large percentage of users with updated operating systems&#8221; &#8212; which internconnect to the internet &#8212; &#8220;were using antivirus. So much was getting through.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen a huge profusion of cybersecurity startups enter the market in the last several years, but much of the focus has been on enterprise deployments and securing the architecture particular to larger businesses or consumers, so what&#8217;s caught investors&#8217; eyes here is the ability to build a product for the group sitting in the margin of these two, and to find some strong traction for that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is the three founders&#8217; second startup together. The first, <a href="https://arpeely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arpeely</a>, they said specializes in real-time media auctions via machine and deep learning technologies.</p>
<p>“The team’s combined expertise in Cyber, Product and Go-to-Market positions them perfectly to disrupt and innovate in this market. Their traction while bootstrapped is a testament to that,” said John Curtius, a partner at Tiger Global, in a statement.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When users ask a question they receive bite-sized answers in real time from over 40,000 possible experts based on expertise tags. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buoyed by a new cash infusion of $5.5 million in Series A funding, GlobalWonks emerged Tuesday as <a href="https://www.enquire.ai/app/index">Enquire AI</a>.</p>
<p>The Washington, D.C.-based company leverages artificial intelligence in a tool for businesses to find global subject-matter expertise in real time, from both internal and external resources.</p>
<p>Uzabase led the oversubscribed funding round and was joined by Teneo Ventures, Blu Ventures and a group of angel investors. This gives the company $6.1 million in total funding to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246789" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Enquire, then known as GlobalWonks, was started in 2018 by Bilal Baloch, Cenk Sidar and Fatih Orhan after realizing that professionals are untapped resources.</p>
<p>“To understand the regulatory environment in Kenya or public health in Indonesia, you have to know how to get that information,” COO Baloch told TechCrunch. “You might go to an expensive company that relied on an expert that was not on the ground there or the information was not fresh.”</p>
<p>Instead, its Network Pulse technology taps into those “wonks” through a question-based tool where someone would ask a question and receive bite-sized answers in real time from more than 40,000 possible experts based on expertise tags.</p>
<p>By providing short answers, it enables experts to take minutes versus hours and for an additional revenue stream for their expertise. Question-askers can also schedule additional time with experts to go more in depth on a topic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The name change to “Enquire” signifies the company going beyond the “wonks” into new abilities, like through API integrations in adjacent SaaS platforms, so that company employees can tap into the minds and insights of their colleagues, Baloch said.</p>
<p>He estimates the expert network market is $1 billion, and with these new capabilities and name change, Enquire can jump into the market research market, which was projected to be valued at $73 billion in 2020. Indeed, other companies in this space are attracting venture capital as well. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/newtonx-secures-32m-to-power-your-next-business-decision/">NewtonX raised $32 million</a> for its tool aimed at democratizing access to high-quality data and research, while <a href="https://askwonder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonder</a> scales up a research team based on a topic.</p>
<p>By going after the Series A funding the company wants to diversify its portfolio of knowledge technology offerings and will be deploying the new capital into team expansion, marketing and rolling out new API partnerships.</p>
<p>Enquire works with 50 companies around the world and across them 300 clients. In the past 12 months, the company’s revenue grew by 300% and the expert network grew by 207%.</p>
<p>“They are truly re-inventing how we receive and give expertise through technology and we’re glad to invest in a company that has the interest of all parties in mind, said Yusuke Umeda, co-founder of Uzabase, in a written statement. “This puts a significant value on research, resources and application of this data to make important decisions daily.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pony.ai, a Chinese autonomous driving startup with an office in the U.S., has paused its driverless pilot fleet in California six months after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/chinese-startup-pony-ai-can-now-test-driverless-vehicles-in-three-california-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was approved by local regulators</a> to test autonomous vehicles without a human safety driver.</p>
<p>On November 19, the California Department of Motor Vehicles notified Pony.ai that it was suspending its driverless testing permit following a reported collision in Fremont on October 28, the DMV told TechCrunch in a statement.</p>
<p>Pony.ai has 10 Hyundai Kona electric cars registered under its driverless testing permit. This suspension does not impact Pony.ai’s permit for testing with a safety driver, said the DMV.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246454" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to Pony.ai&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/pony-ai_102821-pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collision report</a>, the incident took place on a clear morning when its driverless vehicle was changing lanes using the autonomous mode.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recently, one of our vehicles experienced an incident in Fremont, California, involving a collision with a lane divider and street sign. No other vehicles were involved and no injuries occurred,&#8221; a Pony.ai spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We immediately launched an investigation, and are in contact with the California DMV about the incident,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>While other autonomous vehicles had reported crashes, most have occurred while the safety driver has been operating the vehicle manually or when another vehicle has struck an AV from behind. This incident stands out because the vehicle was in autonomous mode and didn&#8217;t involve any other vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The incident puts a question mark on Pony.ai&#8217;s autonomous driving capabilities. The startup&#8217;s AVs have &#8220;successfully driven over 750,000 real-world miles in California since 2017,&#8221; said its spokesperson.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Baidu veterans, Pony.ai is among a group of AV startups that have R&amp;D teams and testing fleets in both China and California. It has attracted heavyweight investors like Toyota and Sequoia Capital, with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/07/pony-ai-raises-100-million-more-to-advance-its-autonomous-vehicle-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over $1 billion in total raise</a> and a valuation of $5.3 billion as of February. Just recently, alongside Baidu, it was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211129005790/en/Pony.ai-Receives-Approval-for-Paid-Autonomous-Robotaxi-Services-in-Beijing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> to operate commercial drivered autonomous cars within a demo zone in Beijing.</p>
<p>The company has also faced obstacles in recent months. It had halted plans to list through a SPAC in New York after failing to reassure Beijing it would not be targeted by the U.S. government, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-chinas-tech-crackdown-thwarts-ponyais-us-listing-plans-sources-2021-08-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in August. Last month, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/key-executives-resign-after-pony-ai-combines-trucking-and-passenger-car-rd-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the company&#8217;s autonomous trucking business had lost a few key executives, leaving the newly minted unit in limbo. As competition heats up, the startup has a lot to prove to its investors that it has competitive technologies and a viable commercial future.</p>

<p>“The XS1 is the only at-home fitness system that offers the same level of all-body cross functional workouts as those available in professional training facilities, while leveraging robotics and artificial intelligence to deliver personalized insights and coaching that let you take control of your own personal journey to a stronger life,” co-founder and CEO Mohammed Shanableh said in a release.</p>
<p>In addition to increased competition over the past year, the company will have to contend with broader slowing industry sales as gyms have reopened in various locales. Meanwhile, companies like Peloton and Tempo have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/the-500-peloton-guide-brings-connected-strength-training-to-the-wildly-popular-fitness-platform/">recently announced</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/tempo-launches-a-400-home-fitness-system-the-size-of-a-minifridge/">sub-$500, entry-level products</a>, while OxeFit’s system starts at $4,700, plus a $40 monthly software subscription. Still a premium over the $2,000-$3,000 price range for other touchscreen-based home fitness brands.</p>
<p>Though the company is taking a more pro athlete-focused approach to the market, enlisting names like Dak Prescott, Jalen Ramsey and Matt Kemp to help promote its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been an exceedingly difficult couple of years for live performers. And with live events drawing to a close comes a good deal of collateral damage for all of the many facets of the industry such performances directly and indirectly support.</p>
<p>Back in June, as things were tentatively reopening, Mixhalo CEO John Vars told TechCrunch that the low-latency, in-person audio streaming service used the pandemic as an opportunity to “step back and laser-focus on improving our core product.” With that came a pair of additions to its platform: Mixhalo Over Cellular and Mixhalo Rodeo. The exec adds, &#8220;We also found that with no live events on their calendars, venue operators had more time to talk about innovation and improving the fan experience. So, while business development suffered initially, as the year went on, we started to see the pipeline grow beyond even pre-pandemic levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, the company announced that it has raised a $24 million Series B. The raise, led by Fortress Investment, follows a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/mixhalo-series-a/">2019 $10.7 million A round</a>. The company tells TechCrunch the funding will primarily go toward new hires and R&amp;D.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245644" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The new influx of funds will mainly go to expanding our team to address the increasing interest from the market and to further innovate on our technology and product,&#8221; Vars tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We’ll be hiring across all functions, especially in technology. We&#8217;ve already made some great hires and are looking for talented people to join our team in a number of roles. Plus, we have some really cool new technology we’ll be rolling out over the next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>“It’s been a tough couple of years for the entertainment industry, but we’ve persevered by staying focused on improving our product while securing key partnerships along the way,” Vars said in a release. Lead investor Fortress Investment is also the firm behind TSX Broadway, a Times Square-based retail complex that features an outdoor stage and the standard sort of flashing lights you’d expect from that part of Manhattan. Mixhalo’s technology will, naturally, be integrated into the space’s venue.</p>
<p>Other recent high-profile deals for the company include Sting (at Caesars Palace), the Red Rocks Ampitheare, the Los Angeles Football Club, the Sacramento Kings and the Buffalo Sabres.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[jack &#038; annie’s, launched in 2020, features 10 easy-to-make frozen food items that have more meaty applications, like crumbles, meatballs and nuggets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.jackandannies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack &amp; annie’s</a>, a sustainable, animal meat alternative brand made from jackfruit, announced Tuesday $23 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>The round was co-led by Creadev and Desert Bloom and included participation from Wheatsheaf and existing investors Beta Angels and InvestEco. Company founder and CEO Annie Ryu told TechCrunch the company had not done announcements of previous funding rounds and declined to disclose the company’s total raise to date, but did say this round “ was more than we raised in any prior rounds accumulatively.”</p>
<p>The idea for jackfruit products came to Ryu 10 years ago while she was a medical student at Harvard. She and her brother had started a company, and during a trip to India, were introduced to jackfruit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246779" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ryu learned that the fruit was drought resistant and high-yielding and while people ate as much as they wanted, she found that 70% of jackfruit went unused. With global health as her background, Ryu had a vision of halting poverty in this area by adding income for farmers by providing an outlet for the fruit to be used. Today, her brands work with 1,000 farming families with 10% to 40% of their income, she said.</p>
<p>She then went about “pioneering the largest supply chain for jackfruit.” The first brand that emerged was The Jackfruit Co. in 2015 to provide foods that harnessed the fruit’s “meaty” texture and, through R&amp;D, a meaty flavor, but packed with nutrients, protein and fiber. Boulder, Colorado-based The Jackfruit Co. sells about a dozen products, mainly targeting vegetarians. It started selling in Whole Foods and has since expanded.</p>
<p>Now with jack &amp; annie’s, launched in 2020, Ryu calls it a “super approachable brand,” featuring 10 easy-to-make frozen food items that have more meaty applications, like crumbles, meatballs and nuggets. Products retail from $4.99 to $5.99 in the frozen space and from $6.99 to $7.99 for refrigerated items.</p>
<p>In the past few years, a few other companies emerged in the plant-based space using jackfruit as a base ingredient. Last year, Singapore-based<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/singaporean-startup-karana-raises-1-7-million-for-meat-substitutes-made-from-jackfruit/"> Karana raised $1.7 million</a> to develop plant-based pork made from the fruit. <a href="https://www.uptonsnaturals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upton’s Naturals</a> produces meat alternatives using the fruit, as does <a href="https://thespoon.tech/the-very-good-butchers-will-ship-plant-based-meats-directly-to-your-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Very Good Butchers</a> and Native Forest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In less than a year, the brand expanded into more than 1,500 locations in retailers, including Whole Foods, Sprouts, Meijer, Wegman’s, Hannaford, Target and Giant. It is also the third-largest frozen brand in the plant-based category and the top nugget in the natural channel for the 12 weeks ending October 3, according to SPINS Natural Channel, Ryu said.</p>
<p>The company continues to double its revenue on a yearly basis and will use the new funding to continue to build out partnerships and new innovation, expand its footprint on shelves and increase total distribution.</p>
<p>“Jackfruit has the amazing ability to mimic beef, pork, chicken and seafood, so we are at the tip of the iceberg with what we can show,” Ryu added. “Part of what we are doing with leadership is be an innovation partner to major customers, so if they are looking to leverage the meaty texture and to have meat items more delicious with a clear ingredient deck, we can work with them at our R&amp;D center in Boulder.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spatial analysis platform <a href="https://carto.com">Carto</a> has raised a $61 million Series C round. Many companies collect a ton of data with some location element tied to it. Carto lets you display that data on interactive maps so that you can more easily compare, optimize, balance and take decisions.</p>
<p>Insight Partners is leading today’s round. The European Investment Found is also participating as well as some of the company’s existing investors, such as Accel, Salesforce Ventures, Hearst Ventures, Earlybird and Kibo.</p>
<p>A lot of companies have been working on their data strategy to gain some insights. First, they adopt a data warehouse to centralize all current and historical data under the same roof. Companies use products like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery or Snowflake.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242794" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After that, there are different business intelligence, reporting and data visualization tools that help you take advantage of the data that you have stored in your warehouse. This is where Carto comes along with a product specialized on spatial analytics.</p>
<p>Carto can ingest data from multiple sources. You can upload local files for historical data, but you can also connect to live data directly. Carto provides connectors with databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server), cloud storage services (Dropbox, Box or Google Drive) or data warehouses (Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery or Snowflake).</p>
<p>&#8220;In the last three years, we have seen the rise of the data warehouse and we have gone from almost no architecture being based on a data warehouse to becoming the dominant implementation,&#8221; Carto CEO Luis Sanz told me. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we have focused on building Carto as a spatial extension on top of all the major data warehouses, because we see that the trend is just accelerating.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that, you can go through your data using SQL queries and enrich your data. In particular, you can take advantage of Carto’s own <a href="https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/">data catalog</a>. The company has compiled around 10,000 datasets from both open data sources and private providers — around 3,600 data sets are open data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When everything is set up, you get an interactive dashboard. You can move around a map, select and unselect layers and see the real numbers. Essentially, it should feel like playing <a href="https://www.citiesskylines.com">Cities Skylines</a>.</p>
<p>Customers use Carto to find out where they should open their next store, to prioritize some areas for their out-of-home advertising budget, to optimize their supply chain or to deploy cell towers in the right areas.</p>
<p>That’s why Carto has managed to convince a wide variety of clients, such as local governments, banks, consumer packaged goods companies, credit card networks, or infrastructure companies working in transport, utilities or telecommunications.</p>
<p>“The rise of the data warehouse has allowed organizations to unify and connect all their data in a single location, and geospatial data is no exception,” Luis Sanz said in a statement. “Now, thanks to our cloud native offering, they can also perform spatial analytics on top of them. Our Spatial Extension runs on top of all the major data warehouses and takes full advantage of all their benefits, giving our users a complete suite for geospatial analysis that is highly performant, scalable and secure.”</p>
<p>Essentially, Carto is benefiting from the move to data warehouses and digital transformation in general. As more companies move to the cloud, those companies become potential Carto customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A UK parliamentary committee that&#8217;s spent almost half a year scrutinizing the government&#8217;s populist yet controversial plan to regulate Internet services by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">applying a child safety-focused framing</a> to content moderation has today published its <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt5802/jtselect/jtonlinesafety/129/12902.htm">report</a> on the draft legislation &#8212;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> offering a series of recommendations to further tighten legal requirements on platforms. </span></p>
<p>Ministers will have two months to respond to the committee&#8217;s report.</p>
<p>The committee broadly welcomes the government&#8217;s push to go beyond industry self regulation by enforcing compliance with a set of rules intended to hold tech giants accountable for the content they spread and monetize &#8212; including via a series of codes of practice and with the media regulator, Ofcom, given a new major oversight and enforcement role over Internet content.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247038" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a statement accompanying the report, the joint committee on the draft Online Safety Bill&#8217;s chair, Damian Collins, said: “The Committee were unanimous in their conclusion that we need to call time on the Wild West online. What’s illegal offline should be regulated online. For too long, big tech has gotten away with being the land of the lawless. A lack of regulation online has left too many people vulnerable to abuse, fraud, violence and in some cases even loss of life.</p>
<p class="p-quote">“The Committee has set out recommendations to bring more offences clearly within the scope of the Online Safety Bill, give Ofcom the power in law to set minimum safety standards for the services they will regulate, and to take enforcement action against companies if they don’t comply.</p>
<p class="p-quote">“The era of self-regulation for big tech has come to an end. The companies are clearly responsible for services they have designed and profit from, and need to be held to account for the decisions they make.”</p>

<p>&mdash; Joint Committee on the Draft Online Safety Bill (@OnlineSafetyCom) <a href="https://twitter.com/OnlineSafetyCom/status/1470546074121166849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The committee backs the overarching premise that what&#8217;s illegal offline should be illegal online &#8212; but it&#8217;s concerned that the bill, as drafted, will fall short of delivering on that, warning in a summary of its recommendations: &#8220;A law aimed at online safety that does not require companies to act on, for example, misogynistic abuse or stirring up hatred against disabled people would not be credible. Leaving such abuse unregulated would itself be deeply damaging to freedom of speech online.&#8221;</p>
<p>To ensure the legislation is doing what&#8217;s claimed on the tin (aka, making platforms accountable for major safety issues), the committee wants Ofcom to be &#8220;required to issue a binding Code of Practice to assist providers in identifying, reporting on and acting on illegal content, in addition to those on terrorism and child sexual exploitation and abuse content&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here MPs and peers are pushing for the bill to take a more comprehensive approach to tackling illegal content in what can be contested areas of hate speech, arguing that regulatory guidance from a public body will &#8220;provide an additional safeguard for freedom of expression in how providers fulfil this requirement&#8221;.</p>
<p>In earlier iterations the legislative plan was given the government shorthand &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/uk-sets-out-safety-focused-plan-to-regulate-internet-firms/">Online Harms</a>&#8221; &#8212; and the draft continues to target a very broad array of content for regulation, from stuff that&#8217;s already explicitly illegal (such as terrorism or child sexual abuse material) to unpleasant but (currently) legal content such as certain types of abuse or content that celebrates self harm.</p>
<p>Critics have therefore warned that the bill poses huge risks to free speech and freedom of expression online as platforms will face the threat of massive fines (and even criminal liability for execs) for failing to comply with an inherently subjective concept of &#8216;harm&#8217; baked into UK law.</p>
<p>To simplify compliance and avoid the risk of major sanctions, platforms may simply opt to purge challenging content entirely (or take other disproportionate measures), rather than risk being accused of exposing children to inappropriate/harmful content &#8212; so the committee is trying to find a way to ensure a public interest interpretation (i.e. of what content should be regulated) in order to shrink the risks the bill poses to democratic freedoms.</p>
<p>Despite the bill attracting huge controversy on the digital rights and speech front, where critics argue it will introduce a new form of censorship, there is broad, cross-party parliamentary support for regulating tech giants. So &#8212; in theory &#8212; the government can expect few problems getting the legislation through parliament.</p>
<p>This is hardly surprising. Internet giants like Facebook have spent years torching goodwill with lawmakers all over the world (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/15/zuckerberg-again-snubs-uk-parliament-over-call-to-testify/">especially in the UK</a>); and are widely deemed to have failed to self regulate given a neverending parade of content scandals &#8212; from data misuse for opaque voter targeting (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/facebook-ignored-staff-warnings-about-sketchy-cambridge-analytica-in-september-2015/">Cambridge Analytica</a>); to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/13/twitter-ceo-promises-to-crack-down-on-hate-violence-and-harassment-with-more-aggressive-rules/">hate and abuse direct at people on platforms like Twitter</a> (UK footballers have, for example, been recently campaigning against racist abuse on social media); to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/instagrams-adam-mosseri-to-meet-uk-health-secretary-over-suicide-content-concerns/">suicide and self harm content circulating on Instagram</a> &#8212; all of which has been compounded by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">recent revelations</a> from Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen, which included the disclosure of internal research suggesting Instagram can be toxic for teens.</p>
<p>All of which is reflected in a pithy opener the committee pens to summarize its report: &#8220;Self-regulation of online services has failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Online Safety Bill is a key step forward for democratic societies to bring accountability and responsibility to the internet,&#8221; it goes on, adding: &#8220;Our recommendations strengthen two core principles of responsible internet governance: that online services should be held accountable for the design and operation of their systems; and that regulation should be governed by a democratic legislature and an independent regulator &#8212; not Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want the Online Safety Bill to be easy to understand for service providers and the public alike. We want it to have clear objectives, that lead into precise duties on the providers, with robust powers for the regulator to act when the platforms fail to meet those legal and regulatory requirements.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook knows Instagram harms teens. Now, its plan to open the app to kids looks worse than ever&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/embed/#?secret=v8ykHPitac" data-secret="v8ykHPitac" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The committee is suggesting the creation of a series of new criminal offences in relation to what it describes as &#8220;harmful online activities&#8221; &#8212; such as &#8220;encouraging serious self-harm&#8221;; cyberflashing (aka the sending of unsolicited nudes); and comms that are intended to stir up hatred against those with protected characteristics) &#8212; with parliamentarians endorsing recommendations by the Law Commission to modernise comms offences and hate crime laws to take account of an age of algorithmic amplification.</p>
<p>So the committee is pushing for the (too) subjective notion of &#8216;harmful&#8217; content to be tightened to stuff that&#8217;s explicitly defined in law as illegal &#8212; to avoid the risk of tech companies being left to interpret too fuzzy rules themselves at the expense of hard won democratic freedoms. If the government picks up on that suggestion it would be a major improvement.</p>
<p>In another intervention, the committee has revived the thorny issue of age checks for accessing porn websites &#8212; and preventing kids from accessing adult content online is something the UK has been trying (and failing) to figure out how to do for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/20/uk-isps-do-you-have-any-idea-how-difficult-itd-be-to-‘ban’-online-porn/">over a decade</a> &#8212; by suggesting: &#8220;All statutory requirements on user-to-user services, for both adults and children, should also apply to Internet Society Services likely to be accessed by children, as defined by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/">Age Appropriate Design Code</a>&#8220;; and arguing that the change would &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ensure all pornographic websites would have to prevent children from accessing their content&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/uk-quietly-ditches-porn-age-checks-in-favor-of-wider-online-harms-rules/">Back in 2019</a> the government quietly dropped an earlier plan to introduce mandatory age checks for accessing adult websites &#8212; saying it wanted to take a more comprehensive approach to protecting children from online harms via what&#8217;s now called the Online Safety Bill.</p>
<p>However child safety campaigners want the bill to go further &#8212; and so, it seems, does the joint committee; albeit in a &#8220;proportionate&#8221; way.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want all online services likely to be accessed by children to take proportionate steps to protect them,&#8221; the committee writes. &#8220;Extreme pornography is particularly prevalent online and far too many children encounter it &#8212; often unwittingly. Privacy-protecting age assurance technologies are part of the solution but are inadequate by themselves. They need to be accompanied by robust requirements to protect children, for example from cross-platform harm, and a mandatory Code of Practice that will set out what is expected. Age assurance, which can include age verification, should be used in a proportionate way and be subject to binding minimum standards to prevent it being used to collect unnecessary data.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other recommendations pick up on specific suggestions made by Facebook whistleblower, Haugen, in her <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-raises-trust-and-security-questions-over-its-e2e-encryption/">testimony to UK lawmakers earlier this fall</a>, with the committee calling for the law to include a requirement on service providers to conduct internal risk assessments to record &#8220;reasonable foreseeable threats to user safety&#8221;; and further specifying this should include &#8220;the <strong>potential harmful impact of algorithms</strong>, not just content&#8221; [emphasis theirs].</p>
<p>The committee is also urging ministers to extend the scope of the bill to include scams and fraud that stem from paid-for advertising (not merely user-generated content scams) &#8212; an issue that&#8217;s faced high profile campaigning by UK consumer advice personality, Martin Lewis, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/23/facebook-hit-with-defamation-lawsuit-over-fake-ads/">previously sued Facebook for defamation</a> over scam investments ads misusing his image.</p>
<p>UK lawmakers further suggest individual Internet users should be able to make complaints to an ombudsman when platforms fail to comply with the new law &#8212; and recommend that regulated platforms are required to have a senior manager at board level or reporting to the board who is designated the &#8220;Safety Controller.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that role they would be made liable for a new offence: The failure to comply with their obligations as regulated service providers when there is clear evidence of repeated and systemic failings that result in a significant risk of serious harm to users,&#8221; the committee suggests.</p>
<p>While the suggestions are not binding on the government, during her own recent evidence session to the committee last month, the secretary of state for digital, Nadine Dorries, told lawmakers<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/uk-warns-facebook-over-safety-criminal-liability-legislation/"> she&#8217;s &#8220;open&#8221; to their suggestions</a> for improving legislation which she argued will change Internet culture for good &#8212; further predicting &#8220;huge kickback&#8221; from platforms that have got used to being able to mark their own homework.</p>
<p>“I believe that there will be huge, huge [change],&#8221; she said/ This will set off a culture change in terms of our online environments and landscape. There will be huge kickback. Because you have to follow the money — people are making a huge amount of money from these platforms and sites. And of course there will be kickback. But we must not forget the world is watching what we are doing in terms of legislating to hold those platforms to account. That is why it has to be watertight.”</p>
<p>Law and digital rights experts, meanwhile, have given <a href="https://twitter.com/WebDevLaw/status/1470652208807043072">a cautious thumbs up</a> to the committee&#8217;s intervention &#8212; while continuing to warn that the bill itself still poses major risks to online freedoms, and also looks set to usher in nightmarishly complex compliance regime for UK internet services&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now that the world appears to have settled longer-term into working in a significantly more distributed way in the wake of Covid-19, companies are getting more serious about using tools to manage how their teams operate within those new parameters. Today, a startup that&#8217;s addressing that challenge and how it relates specifically to expenses is announcing some funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://meshpayments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mesh Payments</a>, which provides a platform for companies to oversee and manage employees&#8217; expenses, and for employees themselves to better track and manage how and where they spend money, has raised $50 million. It plans to use the funding to continue expanding the functionality of its platform, as well as for further business development. It&#8217;s been on a growth boom in the last nine months, growing tenfold in that period, it said.</p>
<p>The round, a Series B, is being led by the very prolific Tiger Global, with participation also from Entrée Capital and Falcon Edge Capital, as well as past backers TLV Partners and Meron Capital. Mesh Payments &#8212; founded in Israel and now headquartered in New York &#8212; had previously raised $13 million, and it is not disclosing valuation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247053" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Currently the company&#8217;s tools cover areas like travel expenses, spend cards and other forms of spend management, but potentially the more interesting aspect of how Mesh works lies in its name.</p>
<p>Mesh Payments&#8217; platform integrates with various other pieces of software and apps that a company might use to run its business, and continually scans that network to determine whether a particular purchase is a useful one, or one that might be overlapping with something that already exists, not to mention not in line with other parts of a company&#8217;s specific expenditure policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We start with the notion that there is different context to different kinds of spend,&#8221; Oded Zehavi, co-founder and CEO of Mesh Payments, said in an interview. &#8220;The process for a trip versus software differs, so we started building models for these unique cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, the platform integrates with the likes of QuickBooks, Slack, Netsuite, Xero, G Suite from Google, and more. &#8220;We are adding more connectors to connect data from organizations&#8217; services on the cloud to be exposed to more company behavior,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The combination of that data and the intelligence that we designed in a more superior way is what sets us apart.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So, for example, if an employee suddenly decides to set up an iCloud storage subscription, Mesh would scan the network to determine if that fits with corporate policy, and would also set out to see if the organization already has an account with another cloud storage company. If either of those questions raises a flag, the purchase is flagged, too.</p>
<p>Employees get notifications of these, and so to spend managers on the finance team. It&#8217;s up to the finance team to decide how strict they would like the policy to be: whether purchases are blocked, or rejected in the aftermath, or issued with a warning/alert.</p>
<p>Understandably, the system requires some substantial onramping from customers: they have to already be working in a digital enough way in order for Mesh&#8217;s modelling to work to its best ability. So unsurprisingly, the current customer list is heavy with technology companies, which are already working in the cloud and thus representing an easy port to working with Mesh: Monday.com, Hippo Insurance, Sezzle, Riskified and Snyk are on the list.</p>
<p>As recent rounds for Pleo (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/pleo-picks-up-200m-at-a-4-7b-valuation-to-build-the-next-generation-of-business-expense-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised at a $4.7 billion valuation</a> just last week) and Soldo (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/soldo-raises-180m-for-its-expense-management-platform-for-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $180 million in July</a>) show, there is currently a huge appetite in the market for better and more updated tools for managing expenses, both at a time when employees may be needing to spend more independently than before because of how they&#8217;re working, but also because companies are simply looking to get smarter and to better grips with the systems and financial management they have in place.</p>
<p>Mesh&#8217;s focus on larger businesses gives it a very wide funnel, targeting an area that has been particularly rife with legacy tools from companies like SAP (although to be fair they are all focusing on improving user experience and tapping into modern technology more).</p>
<p class="p3">Nevertheless, it&#8217;s a massive opportunity that is likely to stay, just like at least some of our newly-distributed working practices.</p>
<p class="p3">&#8220;Mesh Payments is an example of a true disruptor &#8212; a company who&#8217;s innovations are transforming an already-established industry,&#8221; said John Curtius, a partner at Tiger Global who led this investment, in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;re proud to support a business that continues to deliver on its ambitions, and we look forward to helping Mesh modernize the payments space even further.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open has acquired consumer neo-banking startup Finin for $10 million as the Bangalore-based, Google-backed business-focused neobanking platform looks to broaden its offerings and deepen relationships with banks.</p>
<p>The deal involves both cash and stock, the two said. Launched in 2019, <a href="https://finin.in">Finin</a> is among the first consumer-focused neobanking startups in India. The startup, which had raised about $1 million from Unicorn India Ventures and others, will see key executives including the founder and chief executive Suman Gandham move to Open.</p>
<p>Anish Achuthan, co-founder and chief executive of Open, told TechCrunch in an interview that the acquisition of Finin compliments Open&#8217;s broader offerings.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247047" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://open.money/">Open</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/google-and-temasek-back-indian-neobank-open-in-100-million-fundraise/">recently received the backing from Google and Temasek</a>, operates an SME banking platform and also provides banks with infrastructure to launch their own digital banks. Over a dozen banks today use Open’s infrastructure to offer their banking services. Open currently has partnerships with 14 banks in India and a few more in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Finin offers a savings account that allows consumers to save and invest their money.</p>
<p>“Finin complements our offerings to banks. We will now help banks launch their own consumer-focused neobanking offerings under their own brand names,” he said. “There are many banks that are looking to launch their own modern platforms.”</p>
<p>Open still plans to continue to focus on its enterprise offerings to banks and isn’t looking to launch a consumer-focused neobanking service, he said. “Direct-to-consumer is not in our DNA,” he said. “But as part of our SME offerings such as payroll management, we may complement some B2C features.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When we first launched Finin, I promised my squad that we would make a hallmark in the fintech industry, and show Indian consumers what neo-banking can really do for them,” said Gandham in a statement.</p>
<p>“Now with the acquisition by Open, I’m absolutely convinced that we are speeding towards that goal. The outcome of a consumer-facing neo-banking platform working hand-in-hand with a B2B neo-banking platform is going be exemplary as we will be able to add a lot of value to Open’s SMEs wanting to open salary accounts for employees, expose consumer banking rails to fintechs using Open’s embedded finance platform Zwitch, and also add value to banks wanting to launch digital banking propositions using Open’s cloud native digital banking OS BankingStack.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As advertising and marketing become increasingly automated and thus commoditized, design has emerged as a savior to help brands stand out. And today, a startup that&#8217;s helping companies connect with a wider range of designers and other creatives to meet that demand is announcing a round of funding to fuel its business growth. <a href="https://www.superside.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superside</a>, which operates a network of freelance creatives that are tapped by companies to work on logos, display ads, packaging, bigger marketing campaigns and other design-based efforts, has picked up $30 million, money that it will be investing in further international expansion and growing its team of people, both in-house staff and the creatives network.</p>
<p>Prosus Ventures and Lugard Road Capital are co-leading the round, with previous investors Slack Fund and Acequia Capital also participating. Investors and company would not confirm but I understand from sources to be just over $400 million.</p>
<p>The round is the first sizable funding that Oslo-based, but very distributed, Superside has raised &#8212; it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/05/superside-konsus-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded as Konsus back in 2015 and had picked up only $5.5 million</a> up to now &#8212; and it comes on the heels of some impressive growth in its nearly-bootstrapped state.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247042" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Its customers include the likes of Amazon, Facebook, Salesforce, Cisco, Shopify and Coinbase, &#8220;Really any hot company in the Valley,&#8221; Fredrik Thomassen, Superside’s co-founder and CEO, told me in his understated, Norwegian-accented clip the other day. (This helps downplay the words, which come off as matter-of-fact rather than boastful as a result.) You&#8217;d think that a company like Amazon or Facebook would have no end of people on in-house teams to handle whatever design need might arise, but in fact, no matter how big or small an organization is, there is always something that will need an extra pair of creative hands, especially these days. Superside provides them.</p>
<p>Those hands, meanwhile, are set to multiply. Thomassen tells me that the company currently has 500 on its &#8220;team&#8221; &#8212; his word to include both those working on staff (150 people) and the wider creatives network (350).</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s important for us to think of us all in the same boat and creating equal opportunities globally,&#8221; he said. Creatives are freelancers technically, though, and thus free to do whatever they want, although the idea, he said, is that Superside provides them with enough engagement, interesting work, and non-frustrating tools to manage it all to make it less likely that they would turn to 99designs, Fiverr, Upwork, or any of the other platforms that might provide them with gigs elsewhere.</p>
<p>The plan will be to expand that network in earnest in the coming months. &#8220;We want to go from 350 to 1,000 creatives,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and then maybe 10,000, or 100,000.&#8221; (Again, you have to read this thinking of Thomassen&#8217;s understated clip, which makes all this sound perfectly reasonable.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Design &#8212; and in this case branding, advertising and other fields that have been described traditionally in the industry as &#8220;creative&#8221; work done by creatives &#8212; has faced a massive evolution in the digital age: most if not all work is carried out on software; more often than not, it is intended to be consumed on digital screens; and the nature of global, localized campaigns created by virtue of digital mediums mean that there is simply a lot more creative work needing to be done.</p>
<p>Added to this, even before the Covid-19 pandemic, designers long ago cut their tether to the office, working remotely, putting in extra hours at home even when they do not, picking up side-hustles where they never meet clients in person, and so on.</p>
<p>All of this has played neatly into the creation of really excellent design software, designed to be used, edited, shared and consumed in the cloud, and it&#8217;s played neatly too into the hand of companies like Superside to build platforms to help connect creatives to opportunities.</p>
<p>Superside itself has focused its technology development on making that engagement and following through on work as seamless as possible, with very specific project management software that it has designed itself to manage the processes, including remuneration and related accounting alongside the steps around seeking people, engaging them and working through projects. It has not built design tools up to now, and it has no plans to.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are using exclusively established tools,&#8221; said Thomassen. &#8220;It&#8217;s much more difficult to built competitors to companies like Figma and Adobe. We are incredibly bullish on Figma especially, since it&#8217;s a less closed system than Adobe&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see whether Superside sticks to that, or whether it becomes an attractive company to tap for those big firms that are taking on Adobe and building more bridges to creatives alongside the creative tools themselves. (Adobe&#8217;s ownership of Behance, which gives it a kind of link into those networks of creatives already, implies it might not be in the running if that were the case.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, what sets the company apart is how well it has identified the shortcomings of working with alternatives &#8212; Thomassen himself comes from a marketing background and said he built Superside specifically out of his own frustrations in trying to find, engage and work with creatives &#8212; and built a platform to solve that.</p>
<p>“What sets Superside apart from all the other players in the creative economy is their long-term approach to solving the underlying problems of marketing and creative teams,” said Mats Diedrichsen, the former CMO of Delivery Hero, who is joining the board with this round. “I believe Superside has the potential to become the ‘agency-killer’ while truly levelling the playing field for creatives all over the world.”</p>
<p>Superside has seen significant growth in the last few years, working with reputable brands, including Amazon, Salesforce and Cisco, who have consistently praised Superside’s fast turnaround times, creative diversity, high-quality content, and impressive access to global top talent.</p>
<p>Long-time customer Amir Jaffari, Growth lead at Shopify summarized: “Superside makes it easy for Shopify&#8217;s Growth team to get design done quickly without impacting the quality. Their platform is intuitive and enables speed, and the dedicated team model ensures everyone thoroughly understands our brand and day-to-day needs, allowing for scale.”</p>
<p>“As the need for high-quality, fast-turnaround digital content continues to rise, and companies look for increasing brand distinction, Superside is fulfilling the demand by offering a unique subscription that provides fast, flexible and diverse design from some of the world’s top creative talent,&#8221; added Sandeep Bakshi, head of European investments at Prosus Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;In addition, as the the pandemic has accelerated the momentum of flexible and independent work, Superside is highly attractive for creative team members, offering remote, flexible, and high paying jobs, allowing them to work with top brands globally. We believe Superside can usher in a new era of creative solutions for top companies globally, and are excited to partner with them on this vision.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Company owners can integrate BHub with their financial systems and view everything through one financial dashboard.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bhub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BHub</a> announced Tuesday that it took in a new round of capital just three months after receiving <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/bhub-ai-pre-seed--190bf1a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.4 million in pre-seed investment</a> to offer full back-office SaaS for small and medium businesses in Latin America.</p>
<p>Monashees and Valor Capital Group are doubling down on their investment in the company by leading an inside round of $20 million in Series A funds that included QED Investors, Picus Capital and Clocktower Technology Ventures.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246866" style="width: 328px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246866" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2246866" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bhub.jpeg?w=318" alt="BHub" width="318" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bhub.jpeg 599w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bhub.jpeg?resize=70,150 70w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bhub.jpeg?resize=140,300 140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bhub.jpeg?resize=318,680 318w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bhub.jpeg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246866" class="wp-caption-text">BHub&#8217;s mobile dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> BHub</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246863" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded in June, the Brazil-based company provides what it calls “back-office-as-a-service,” which includes bookkeeping, CFO services, legal and HR services so entrepreneurs can focus on their core business, Jorge Vargas Neto, founder and CEO of BHub, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>BHub is Neto’s third company and his third in the financial sector. He was previously CEO of Zen Finance, which was sold to Rappi in 2020, and Biva, which sold to PagSeguro in 2017, he said. While integrating with Rappi, Zen Finance was told by its accounting firm that it had to pay capital gains taxation, which ended up requiring the company to redo all of its bookkeeping in 10 days.</p>
<p>“It was hellish, but I’m grateful for that experience because I became passionate about how I could help people avoid the same hurdles in Brazil and Latin America,” Neto added. “We tested the market by inviting entrepreneurs to talk about their hurdles of administering business. Some 500 people RSVP’d, and we ended up doing 300 interviews that enabled us to see the pain points and to come up with our vision for a solution.”</p>
<p>For a monthly subscription starting at $349, company owners can integrate BHub with their financial systems and view everything through one financial dashboard that includes a chat function for requesting reports, solving queries and any other activities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Neto explained that in Brazil, hundreds of thousands of businesses closed in 2020, driven partly by the global pandemic and partly by little financial literacy. Brazilian legislation requires every business owner to have a third-party accountant. The market is reserved for them, and they are protected by the law, “so they don&#8217;t have to be that good,” he added. Where the typical accounting firm doesn’t use much technology, this is BHub’s “magic spot,” to provide a service based on a technology approach and with startups in mind, he said.</p>
<p>The Series A came fast for the company due to a combination of factors: achieving early product market fit, steady growth over a period of three months and high referral rates by customers.</p>
<p>The company counts 134 companies as customers and looks to hire 100 people across engineering, technical, accounting, legal, human resources, marketing and customer service.</p>
<p>“Considering the growth we’ve had and what we project we will do, we need to enhance the team of 51 people and grow to 2,000, 2,500 customers by next year,” Neto added. “We do think if we keep up the pace we will get there.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Agricultural microinsurance startup IBISA raised a seed round of approximately $1.70 million led by London-based Insurtech Gateway, with participation from Rockstart’s AgriFood fund and others.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Agricultural microinsurance startup <a href="https://ibisa.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBISA</a> announced that it has raised a seed round of €1.5 million – approximately $1.70 million. The round was led by London-based specialized investor Insurtech Gateway, with participation from Rockstart’s AgriFood fund and others.</p>
<p>Microinsurance typically refers to offering coverage to low-income people against a specific class of risks. In IBISA&#8217;s case, these are small farmers whose livelihoods might be affected by adverse climate events, which are unfortunately <a href="https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/books/9789210054478" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the rise</a>.</p>
<p>While based in Luxembourg, the startup is focused on emerging markets, with a partnership-based approach. &#8220;We work with mutuals, insurers, microfinance institutions, research institutions, farmers and breeders associations and governments,&#8221; its site explains.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246798" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since being founded in 2019, the company has worked with partners in the Philippines, India, and Niger. It now plans to use its funding to hire and expand its presence in existing and new markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why farmers might be relieved to get compensated when their crops get damaged. But there are also several reasons for them not to have agricultural insurance – most of them don&#8217;t, according to IBISA. On one hand, options might be too costly; on the other, paperwork to claim a payout might be too daunting.</p>
<p>This is where technology comes in: IBISA&#8217;s payouts are meant to be quick and hassle-free, because rather than requesting individual claims, it relies on a collective index. That&#8217;s index-based insurance, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parametric insurance</a>, since payouts are triggered by a certain parameter – for instance, notice of catastrophic weather events.</p>
<p>This approach also helps reduce operating costs on the insurer&#8217;s side, making lower rates worth offering, said <a href="https://insurtechgateway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insurtech Gateway</a>&#8216;s co-founder Stephen Brittain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Historically, microinsurance was not commercially viable due to many reasons such as low premiums, expensive claims handling, challenging distribution and a lack of trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>What changed? Again, technology.</p>
<p>If IBISA and others put trust into an index, it&#8217;s because it is supported by data. Its co-founder and CEO María Mateo Iborra worked for several years in the satellite industry, and a key element of the startup&#8217;s approach is its reliance on orbit images to assess damage. In addition, it relies on crowdsourced data from local &#8216;watchers.&#8217;</p>
<p>Spacetech and crowdsourcing aside, there&#8217;s also a blockchain element to IBISA, which sees it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXJHRbvEaA&amp;t=969s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a way to keep costs low</a>. Its name actually stands for &#8220;Inclusive Blockchain Insurance Using Space Assets,&#8221; and it has been <a href="https://blockis.eu/2021/03/16/block-is-innovator-ibisa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accelerated</a> by the European Union’s blockchain-focused project Block.IS.</p>
<p>The company also recently <a href="https://twitter.com/rockstart/status/1463873090228822017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented itself</a> at <a href="https://rockstart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockstart</a>&#8216;s AgriFood demo day. At the time of joining the program last September, IBISA&#8217;s co-founder Jean-Baptiste Pleynet <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rockstart/photos/a.260435713990127/4743682128998774/?type=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made mention</a> of IBISA&#8217;s insurance, satellite and blockchain components, as well as of its potential to drive positive impact.</p>
<p>But Pleynet also emphasized an interesting point of synergy: &#8220;We believe our solution will be very valuable for the food industry to bring resilience to the supply chain and manage climate risks and we wanted to accelerate this path,&#8221; he explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tier, a Berlin-based e-scooter company that&#8217;s quickly expanding throughout Europe, has acquired Vento Mobility, the Italian subsidiary of Wind Mobility. The companies are not sharing the terms of the deal, but it will mark Tier&#8217;s entry into the Italian market.</p>
<p>Just last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/e-scooter-startup-tier-buys-nextbike-to-double-down-on-commitment-to-e-bikes/">Tier also acquired Nextbike</a>, a German bike-sharing platform, a move to both become multi-modal and further consolidate its micromobility empire. Since its founding, Tier has also acquired Makery, a provider of digital services like product strategy, design and management, engineering, testing and quality, training and support, and staff augmentation, as well as Pushme, a battery swapping company.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">On the Wind side of things, the company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/russian-tech-giant-yandex-expands-israeli-footprint-with-acquisition-of-winds-tel-aviv-operations/">recently sold off its Israeli operations to Yandex</a>, the Russian tech giant, so it&#8217;s possible Wind is succumbing piece by piece to the inevitable industry consolidation. The company has raised a total of $72 million; its last funding round was a Series A back in 2019. Tier, for comparison, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/tier-scoots-off-with-first-close-of-its-200m-series-d/">raised $200 million as only part of its Series D round in October</a>, bringing its total funding up to around $647 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246953" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wind did not respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s inquiry for more information about its strategy moving forward.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, the first Tier e-scooters will be available on the streets of Bari and Palermo, with other Italian cities to follow in the coming days and weeks, according to the company. Tier is already present in 165 cities in 18 countries, offering its scooters that include an integrated helmet, turn signals on the handlebar and rear wing, and triple brakes with a large front wheel.</p>
<p>Wind&#8217;s Italian fleet had 4,500 e-scooters across 11 towns and cities in Italy. Tier did not respond to requests for more information about what would be done with those scooters, or if Tier would inherit all, or just some key members, of Wind&#8217;s Italian staff.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly six years after Netflix launched its service in India, the global streaming giant is still struggling to find customers willing to pay for what is already its cheapest subscription globally.</p>
<p>The American firm on Tuesday further lowered the subscription price in India, cutting each monthly subscription tier&#8217;s cost by at least 18% and up to 60.1%. The Netflix Basic plan, which permits streaming on any device but caps the resolution at 480p, now costs ₹199 ($2.6) in India, down from ₹499 ($6.6).</p>
<p>Netflix Standard, which improves the video resolution to HD (720p) and permits two simultaneous views, now costs ₹499, down from ₹649 ($8.5). Netflix Premium, which offers four simultaneous views and streams in UltraHD (4K) video quality, now costs ₹649, down from ₹799 ($10.5).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This isn’t the first time Netflix has played around with prices in India. In 2019, after months of testing, Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/netflix-launches-rs-199-2-8-mobile-only-monthly-plan-in-india/">unveiled a “mobile only” tier in India</a> in a global first that was priced at ₹199. That plan is now available for ₹149 ($1.96), Netflix said today. Existing subscribers on any tier will be able to switch to the new offerings, the firm said.</p>
<p>India is one of the world’s largest entertainment markets. But Netflix has struggled to produce content that helps it court customers beyond a small circle of loud Twitter users in the country &#8212; despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-to-release-41-original-indian-shows-and-movies-this-year/">sinking nearly $1 billion on it to date</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, Disney&#8217;s Hotstar continues to dominate the market &#8212; without much assistance from the Twitter crowd &#8212; thanks to a much larger ad-supported local content library, syndication deals with international giants such as HBO, as well as nearly all sports streaming rights. Their biggest challenger in the country remains YouTube, which per App Annie, reaches about half a billion users in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>At roughly $20 a year for the top offerings, Disney&#8217;s Hotstar as well as Amazon Prime Video are also much more affordable to customers in India.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Research firm Mobile Partners Asia estimates that India will have 89 million individuals who pay for subscription services by the end of this year, up from 57 million last year.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s price cut in India, for which Netflix offered no explanation, comes at a time when the streaming giant has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/netflix-is-raising-prices-on-most-of-its-plans-in-the-us/">raised the monthly tariff</a> in several parts of the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yet another ‘quick commerce’ 15-minute groceries startup is hoping to make a name for itself in this space, adding to the myriad of companies currently crowding out this market. But <a href="https://grovy.store/en">Grovy</a> is avoid the crowded cities of Western Europem, setting its sights on becoming a daily-delivery leader in the East.</p>
<p>It’s now finalized a €3 million financing round led by Lighthouse Ventures to expand across Central and Eastern Europe, with offices already running in Prague and Bucharest, after entering the German market in Frankfurt and Mainz.</p>
<p>While many players rely on significant mark-ups, which can be as high as 20%, as well as low-paid gig workers, Grovy says it only employs full-time workers and leverages a 5% markup on deliveries, with a flat delivery fee that is waived for orders above €40.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246799" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s other schtick is sustainability, with deliveries only on bikes and EVs, discounts on “ugly” produce and soon-to-expire perishables (helping to cut down on food waste) and working with food waste startups such as <a href="https://toogoodtogo.com/">Too Good To Go</a>, while employing a carbon offset program.</p>
<p>Justin Adam, co-founder and CEO of Grovy said: “Frankfurt and Mainz, with their high demand for quick commerce solutions, served as the perfect sandbox. But rather than replicate our model in other German cities, we are bringing it to larger cities across the CEE region, where 10-minute delivery is still a novelty and the potential to scale is massive.”</p>
<p>Michal Zalesak, managing partner at lead investor Lighthouse Ventures said: “Grovy has made achievements in mere weeks that would take a normal grocery chain a year to accomplish. Despite enormous competitive pressures, their unique approach to quick commerce has landed them phenomenal success in Germany, and we want to support them as they take on Central and Eastern Europe’s cities.”</p>
<p>Grovy faces competition from Gorillas and Flink in Germany, Lisek in Warsaw, but tends to face only one-hour delivery competition from the likes of Bolt or Delivery Hero in most other European cities it’s operating in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
