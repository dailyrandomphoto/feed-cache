										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">VerSe Innovation, the parent firm of popular news and entertainment app Dailyhunt and short video app Josh, said on Monday the Indian startup has raised over $100 million as part of its Series H financing round from Qatar Investment Authority and Glade Brook Capital Partners.</p>
<p>The announcement follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">another $100 million+</a> investment the startup secured from Google, AlphaWave, and Microsoft in December last year. The investment then had made Dailyhunt a unicorn (giving it a valuation of $1 billion or higher).</p>
<p>Dailyhunt is a popular news and entertainment app that serves more than 285 million users each day in 14 local languages. Its reach in India would explain why Twitter last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/twitter-moments-dailyhunt-india/">partnered with the startup to bring Moments to Dailyhunt</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>VerSe Innovation expanded to short form videos last year, with Josh. after New Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned TikTok</a> and created a void for snacking content in the country. Scores of large giants and startups &#8212; including MX Player and ShareChat &#8212; have attempted to try their hand at short form videos in the recent quarters. YouTube has also been testing Shorts in India, which it disclosed recently was already garnering over 3.5 billion daily views.</p>
<p>Josh appears to have emerged as one of the key players: The startup says Josh has amassed over 85 million monthly active users and the app sees more than 1.5 billion video plays each day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Josh represents a confluence of India’s top 200+ best creators, the 10 biggest music labels, 15+ million UGC creators, best in class content creation tools, the hottest entertainment formats, and formidable user demographics. Josh has been consistently rated as the leading Indian short-video app in India on the Play store,&#8221; the startup said in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup said it will deploy the fresh capital to broaden its content offering local languages, and expand its creators ecosystem and AI and ML tech stacks.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ByteDance is bringing its battle with archrival Tencent to the court at a time when the Chinese government moves to curve the power of the country&#8217;s internet behemoths.</p>
<p>The Beijing Intellectual Property Court has permitted a ByteDance lawsuit brought against Tencent to proceed, a ByteDance spokesperson confirmed with TechCrunch. Upstart new media company ByteDance alleged that Tencent&#8217;s restrictions on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, are in violation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/">China&#8217;s anti-monopoly draft rules</a>. Douyin is headquartered in Beijing while Tencent&#8217;s base is in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>For three years, Tencent has blocked Douyin from its flagship networking apps WeChat and QQ, which bans users from viewing or sharing content from the short video app. Tencent&#8217;s behavior &#8220;no doubt&#8221; constitutes &#8220;monopolistic behavior achieved by abusing market domination to exclude and limit competition,&#8221; which the proposed anti-monopoly law prohibits, Douyin, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/gP1oPRVpW6qD_dEGIKw3vQ">said</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe that competition is better for consumers and promotes innovation. We have filed this lawsuit to protect our rights and those of our users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tencent said in response the accusation is false and malicious defamation. It further asserted that Douyin, which is used by 600 million users every day, uses illegal and anti-competitive methods to access WeChat&#8217;s user data, and it&#8217;s <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0ujgHBoZmIvPqzpP40t6DA">planning to sue</a> ByteDance for harming its platform ecosystem and user rights.</p>
<p>ByteDance and Tencent each covet the other&#8217;s turf. ByteDance<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/tiktok-challenges-wechat/"> debuted a chat app</a> to take on Tencent&#8217;s dominance in social networking, while Tencent countered Douyin&#8217;s popularity by introducing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/chinas-obsession-with-short-videos-has-its-internet-giants-worried/">a slew of short video apps</a>. Neither has managed to threaten the other&#8217;s dominance in their respective field.</p>
<p>Early signs show that the Chinese government is increasingly willing to rein in monopolistic behavior on the Chinese internet following two decades of relatively lax regulations.</p>
<p>In November, the country&#8217;s top market regulator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/">unveiled</a> the draft version of its first anti-monopoly law, opening a floodgate to lawsuits and investigations. In December, regulators launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">an antitrust probe into Alibaba</a> for forcing vendors to sell exclusively on its platform. Just this month, a court in Beijing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vipshop-hldg-china-antitrust/china-fines-vipshop-almost-500000-for-unfair-competition-acts-idUSKBN2A803Y">imposed a 3 million yuan</a> ($464,000) fine on fashion e-commerce site Vipshop over anti-competitive behavior. It won&#8217;t be surprising to see more Chinese internet giants getting hit by anti-trust actions in the upcoming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Harry Stebbings, the podcaster-turned-VC, is stepping down as a partner of Stride.VC, the London-based venture capital firm he co-founded with Fred Destin, formerly of Accel.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/fdestin/status/1358507176843743233">In a series of tweets</a>, Destin said that Stebbings won&#8217;t be involved in Stride&#8217;s second fund (though he&#8217;ll remain a partner in fund one), and will instead be focusing on his podcast franchise “The Twenty Minute VC” and running his own micro fund, the aptly titled &#8220;20VC&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry’s 20VC podcast has remained his passion and been flying high, creating opportunities that are hard to ignore. My bud wants to lean even harder into the 20VC platform,&#8221; tweeted Destin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In the same Twitter thread, Destin said he remains &#8220;fully committed to Stride and what the team is building&#8221;. That team, however, has now seen a plethora of personnel changes since the VC firm was officially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/stride-vc-official/">unveiled</a> in late 2018. Most recently, Paris-based partner Pia d’Iribarne <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/stride-vc-loses-partner-pia-diribarne/">departed</a> and has since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/new-wave/">co-founded New Wave</a>. Stride also lost operating partner Arj Soysa about a year earlier. He&#8217;s now a finance director at Mubadala Capital in Europe.</p>
<p>Alongside Destin, Stride&#8217;s current team members include investor Pietro Invernizzi, finance and operations partner Ross W., and executive assistant Georgina Gallagher, according to LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Both Stebbings and Destin declined to comment further, pointing me to Destin&#8217;s tweets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Friday, the National Labor Relations Board rejected Amazon’s attempt to delay a union vote set to begin on Monday, February 8. For many, the online giant’s bid was seen as a stalling tactic, including a motion to demand votes take place in-person &#8212; a clear health risk, as the COVID-19 virus still poses a major threat in the United States and globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again <span class="il">Amazon</span> workers have won another fight in their effort to win a union voice,&#8221; Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union President Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement regarding the NLRB&#8217;s decision. &#8220;<span class="il">Amazon</span>’s blatant disregard for the health and safety of its own workforce was demonstrated yet again by its insistence for an in-person election in the middle of the pandemic. Today’s decision proves that it’s long past time that <span class="il">Amazon</span> start respecting its own employees; and allow them to cast their votes without intimidation and interference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon, however, said it was disappointed in the decision because it goes against the company&#8217;s goal of getting as many people as possible to vote in the election, Amazon spokesperson Heather Knox said in a statement to TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even the National Labor Relations Board recognizes that the employee participation rate for its own elections conducted with mail ballots is 20-30% lower than the participation rate for in-person voting,&#8221; Knox said. &#8220;Amazon proposed a safe on-site election process validated by COVID-19 experts that would have empowered our associates to vote on their way to, during and from their already-scheduled shifts. We will continue to insist on measures for a fair election that allow for a majority of our employee voices to be heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the mail-in voting process will continue as planned and ultimately determine whether Amazon’s Alabama warehouse &#8212; which employs around 6,000 &#8212; will join the RWDSU, an AFL-CIO affiliate in operation since 1937. The move would be a major watershed moment for Amazon’s blue-collar workforce &#8212; and could spur similar unionizing among the 110 or so fulfillment centers the company operates across the U.S.</p>
<p>The vote comes amid a sea change for both blue and white-collar workers in a tech sector that has traditionally rejected such movements. Notable recent examples include a group of Google contracts in Pittsburgh, followed by this year’s launch of an Alphabet Workers Union that includes more than 800 employees. Last February, Kickstarter voted to unionize its workforce, followed by developer platform Glitch the following month.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--callout block--right" >
		<h4 class="block--callout__title">Tech workers unionize</h4>
		
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/kickstarter-workers-vote-to-unionize/">Kickstarter workers vote to unionize</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/online-code-collaboration-tool-glitch-votes-to-unionize/">Glitch workers announce intention to unionize</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-alphabet-employees-union/">Google, Alphabet employees unionize</a></li>
</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Unions, which act as an intermediary between workers and their employers, advocate on behalf of employees for better wages, working conditions and other benefits through collective bargaining. While it does cost money to join a union, unionized workers tend to make higher salaries than their non-unionized counterparts. Among full-time wage and salary workers, union members had median weekly earnings of $1,144, compared to $958 for non-union members in 2020,<a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm"> according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p>
<p>Often times these unions are the product of months or years of planning behind the scenes &#8212; likely not a surprise for anyone possessing a basic knowledge of the history of labor in the United States. The formation of an Amazon union would present a historic move for labor and tech in the U.S. &#8212; a potential outcome the company has been looking to stop dead in its tracks.</p>
<p>Besides seeking to delay the vote, Amazon has also gone all-in on trying to persuade its workers in Bessemer not to vote to unionize. Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://www.doitwithoutdues.com/">Do It Without Dues website</a> encourages workers to keep things the way they are, instead of having to pay union dues.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re paying dues&#8230;it will be restrictive meaning it won&#8217;t be easy to be as helpful and social with each other,&#8221; the site states. &#8220;So be a doer, stay friendly and get things done versus paying dues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, workers have complained that Amazon&#8217;s anti-union tactics are too much. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/02/amazon-union-warehouse-workers/">One worker told The Washington Post</a> they were bombarded with anti-union messaging in the bathroom stall.</p>
<p>Amazon opened the Bessemer warehouse in March 2020 and says it has created more than 5,000 full-time jobs starting with a pay of $15.30 per hour, including healthcare, vision and dental insurance, and 50% 401(K) match, Knox said. She described the work environment as &#8220;safe&#8221; and &#8220;innovative,&#8221; and added, &#8220;We work hard to support our teams and more than 90% of associates at our Bessemer site say they would recommend Amazon as a good place to work to their friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Amazon’s labor history has been a spotty one. The company has often come under fire for its treatment of workers &#8212; particularly those in logistics and shipping, like the 6,000 currently employed in its Alabama fulfillment center. Many of those issues were amplified throughout 2020, as Amazon employees were deemed “essential workers” in the earliest days of the pandemic’s arrival in the States.</p>
<p>In November, former warehouse employee Christian Smalls <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-faces-lawsuit-alleging-failure-to-provide-ppe-to-workers-during-pandemic/">filed a suit against the company</a>, citing a failure to provide workers with proper PPE amid the pandemic.</p>

<p>“I was a loyal worker and gave my all to Amazon until I was unceremoniously terminated and tossed aside like yesterday’s trash because I insisted that Amazon protect its dedicated workers from COVID-19,” Smalls said at the time. “I just wanted Amazon to provide basic protective gear to the workers and sanitize the workplace.”</p>
<p>Smalls was fired last March after organizing a walkout at a Staten Island fulfillment center. A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch that he was fired after “putting the health and safety of others at risk and violations of his terms of employment.”</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/13/amazon-workers-fired/">employees Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa were fired</a> for “repeatedly violating internal policies,” according to the company. The pair were vocal critics of the company’s treatment of warehouse employees &#8212; criticism that came to a head during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Then, in September, <a href="https://twitter.com/jfslowik/status/1300756214574276610">reports surfaced</a> that Amazon was looking to hire an intelligence analyst. Specifically, Amazon in a job posting said it was seeking someone who would inform higher-ups and attorneys “on sensitive topics that are highly confidential, including labor organizing threats against the company.”</p>
<p>Amazon swiftly took down that job post, saying it was “not an accurate description of the role – it was made in error and has since been corrected,” Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti said in a statement to TechCrunch at the time.</p>
<p>While Amazon did not give a specific revised description, the company said the role is meant to support its team of analysts that focus on external events, like weather, large community gatherings or other events that have the potential to disrupt traffic or affect the safety and security of its buildings and the people who work at those buildings.</p>
<p>However, that same day, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3azegw/amazon-is-spying-on-its-workers-in-closed-facebook-groups-internal-reports-show">Vice reported Amazon had been spying on workers for years</a> to monitor for any potential strikes or protests. Amazon has since said it will stop using its social media monitoring tool.</p>
<p>“We have a variety of ways to gather driver feedback and we have teams who work every day to ensure we’re advocating to improve the driver experience, particularly through hearing from drivers directly,” Boschetti said in a statement. “Upon being notified, we discovered one group within our delivery team that was aggregating information from closed groups. While they were trying to support drivers, that approach doesn’t meet our standards, and they are no longer doing this as we have other ways for drivers to give us their feedback.”</p>
<p>By unionizing, Amazon workers hope to gain the right to collectively bargain over their working conditions, like safety standards, pay, breaks and other issues. Unionizing would also enable workers to potentially become &#8220;just cause&#8221; employees versus at-will, depending on how the negotiations go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon presents a threat to the very fabric of society and the social contract we work to uphold for all working people,&#8221; <a href="https://bamazonunion.org/whyunion">the union organizers state on their site</a>. &#8220;Corporations like Amazon have built decades of increasingly bold and aggressive attacks on workers’ rights that have dramatically eroded union density, harmed working conditions, and lowered the standard of living for many workers. And it’s not stopping. The RWDSU has always stood against anti-worker and anti-union companies. Our union will not back down until Amazon is held accountable for these and so many more dangerous labor practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mail-in voting ends March 29, with the NLRB set to begin counting ballots the following day on a virtual platform. Each party will be allowed to have four people attend the count.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Amazon and will update this story if we hear back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major project to <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> the venture capital investors of Europe, and their cities.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey of VCs in Belfast and Northern Ireland</a> will capture how things are faring, and what changes are being wrought amongst investors by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how Northern Ireland&#8217;s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and, generally, how your thinking will evolve from here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our survey will only be about investors, and <strong>only the contributions of VC investors will be included.</strong> More than one partner is welcome to fill out the survey. (Please note, if you have filled the survey out already, there is no need to do it again).</p>
<p>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6"><strong>You can fill out the survey here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.</p>
<p>What kinds of things do we want to know? Questions include: Which trends are you most excited by? What startup do you wish someone would create? Where are the overlooked opportunities? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</p>
<p>This survey is part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/">series of surveys</a> we’re doing to help founders find the right investors.</p>
<p>https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/</p>
<p>For example, here is the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/14-vcs-discuss-covid-19-and-londons-future-as-a-tech-hub/">survey of London</a>.</p>
<p>You are not in Northern Ireland, but would like to take part? That&#8217;s fine! Any European VC investor can STILL fill out the survey, as we probably will be putting a call out to you next anyway! And we will use the data for future surveys on vertical topics.</p>
<p>The survey is covering almost every city and country on in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_for_the_Mediterranean">Union for the Mediterranean</a>, so just look for your country and city on the <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> and please participate (<em>if</em> you&#8217;re a venture capital investor).</p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email mike@techcrunch.com</p>
<p>(Please note: Filling out the survey is not a guarantee of inclusion in the final published piece).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We crawled into an abandoned school bus, trespassed through dilapidated hallways, dodged fleeting thunderstorms, and wandered the empty streets of Chinatown late into the evening. For two summery weeks, I couldn’t have been happier.</p>
<p class="p1">New York City was in lockdown. I’d been quarantined in my dinky apartment, disheartened and restless. I was anxious to do something creative. Thankfully, the Hasselblad X1D II 50C arrived for review, along with approval from the studio heads for socially-distanced, outdoor shoots.</p>
<p class="p1">Taking pictures of the mundane (flowers, buildings, and such) would’ve been a disservice to a $10,000 camera kit, so instead, my friends and I collaborated on a fun, little project: we shot portraits inspired by our favorite films.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2109336" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2109336" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2109336 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_shotlist.jpg" alt="Hasselblad X1D II shotlist" width="1024" height="768" /><p id="caption-attachment-2109336" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Veanne Cao</p></div></p>
<p>Equipped with masks and a bottle of hand sanitizer, we put the X1D II 50C and 80mm F/1.9 lens (ideal for close-ups without actually having to be close up) through its paces in some of NYC’s less familiar backdrops.</p>
<p>[gallery type="slideshow" link="none" columns="1" size="full" ids="2109350,2109351,2109349,2109360,2109341,2109346,2109345,2109347,2109339,2109489,2109348,2109381,2109362,2109361"]</p>
<p>Before I get into any trouble for the last photo &#8211; <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2153954/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5707836/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason</a> are professional stuntmen and that’s a rubber prop gun. They were reenacting the penultimate scene from<em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infernal_Affairs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infernal Affairs</a></em> &#8211; a brilliant piece of Hong Kong cinema (much better than the Scorsese remake).</p>
<p>While the camera is slightly more approachable in terms of cost and ease of use with a few upgrades (larger, more responsive rear screen, a cleaned-up menu, tethering capabilities, faster startup time and shutter release), the X1D II is essentially the same as its predecessor. So I skipped the standard review. <img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone wp-image-2109372 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg" alt="Hasselblad X1D II 50C Hasselblad X1D II 50C" width="3000" height="2000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /></p>

<h2 class="p1">What it is, what it isn’t</h2>
<p class="p1">The most common complaint about the X1D was its slow autofocus, slow shutter release and short battery life. The X1D II improved on these features, though not by much. Rather than seeing the lag as a hindrance, I was forced to slow down and re-wire my brain for a more thoughtful shooting style (a pleasant side effect).</p>
<p class="p1">As I mentioned in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/29/two-weeks-with-a-16000-hasselblad-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my X1D review</a>, Apple and other smartphone manufacturers have made shooting great pictures effortless. As such, the accessibility has created a culture of excessively capturing everyday banalities. You shoot far more than you&#8217;ll ever need. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m guilty of. Pretty sure 90% of the images on my iPhone camera roll are throwaways. (The other 10% are of my dog and he’s spectacularly photogenic.)</p>
<p class="p1">The X1D II, however, is not an easy camera. It’s frustrating at times. If you’re a beginner, you may have to learn the fundamentals (ISO, f-stops, when to click the shutter), but the payoff is worth it. There’s an overwhelming sense of gratification when you get that <em>one</em> shot. And at 50 megapixels, it&#8217;s packed with details and worthy of hanging on your wall. Shelling out a ton of money for the X1D II won’t instantly make you a better photographer, but it ought to encourage you to become one.</p>
<p class="p1">Without the contrived studio lights and set design, our outdoor shoots became an exercise in improvisation:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  w</span>e wandered through the boroughs finding practicals (street lights, neon lights… the sun), discovering locations, and switching spots when things didn’t pan out.</p>
<p class="p1">We explored, we had purpose.</p>
<p class="p1">My takeaway from the two weeks with this camera:  pause and be meaningful in your actions.</p>
<p class="p1">Reviewed kit runs $10,595, pre-taxed:<br />
<a href="https://www.hasselblad.com/x-system/x1d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hasselblad X1D II 50C Mirrorless Camera</a> &#8211; $5,750<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </span></i><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</span></i></p>
<p>It’s been a bizarre few weeks, with Robinhood <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/how-the-gamestop-stonkathon-helped-robinhood-raise-3-4b-last-week/">raising a torrent of new funds</a> to keep its zero-cost trading model afloat during turbulent market conditions, other neo-trading houses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/trading-app-public-drops-payment-for-order-flow-in-favor-of-tips/">changing up their business model</a> and more. But amidst all the moves in startup-land, something has been itching in the back of my head: Why are several rich people pumping crappy assets?</p>
<p>It’s fine for a retail investor to share trading ideas amongst themselves; it has happened, will happen, and will always happen. But we’ve seen folks like Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya use their broad market imprint to encourage regular folks &#8212; directly and indirectly &#8212; to buy into some pretty silly trades that could lose the retail crowd lots of money that they may not be able to afford.</p>
<p>Think of Elon coming back to Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357244295091208193?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">pump Doge</a>, a joke of a cryptocurrency that is highly volatile and mostly useless. Or Chamath putting <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1356300692109975553">money into GameStop publicly</a>, a move that he is better equipped than most to get into and out of. Which he did. And made money. Most folks that played the GameStop casino have not been as lucky, and many have lost more than they can afford.</p>
<p>Caveat emptor and all that, but I do not love folks with savvy and capital leading regular people into risky trades or into assets that are not backed by long-term fundamentals, but instead a small shot at near-term returns. Yoof.</p>
<p>Finally, keeping up the theme of general annoyance, Senator Hawley is back in the news this week with an attention-focused announcement of an idea to block big tech companies from buying smaller companies. As you would expect from the insurrection-friendly Senator, it’s not an incredibly serious proposal, and it’s written so vaguely as to be nearly humorous.</p>
<p>But as I wrote here <a href="https://alexwrites.substack.com/p/whacking-startup-valuations-is-bipartisan">on my personal blog</a> about all of this, what does matter out of the generally irksome pol is that there is bipartisan interest in limiting the ability of big tech companies to buy smaller companies. For startups, that is not good news; M&amp;A exits are critical liquidity events for startups, and big companies have the most money.</p>
<p>It’s no sauté of my onions if startup valuations fall, but I think there’s been plenty of attention noting that some Democrats and some Republicans in the U.S want to undercut top-down tech M&amp;A, and not nearly enough notice concerning what the effort might do to startup valuations and funding. And if those metrics dip, there could be fewer upstarts in the market actually working to take on the giants.</p>
<p>Food for thought.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>The Exchange caught up once again with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-jabal-190119">Unity CFO Kim Jabal</a>. We did so not merely to make jokes with her about games that we like or don’t like, but to keep tabs on how Jabal thinks as the financial head of a company that was private when she joined, and public now. A few observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">GAAP v. Non-GAAP: I asked about Unity’s </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://investors.unity.com/news/news-details/2021/Unity-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx">recent Q4 net income</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, measured using generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. It was impacted by some share-based comp numbers. Jabal was clear that her team and investors are more focused on non-GAAP numbers. Why? They strip out non-cash charges like share-based comp and provide a different perspective into corporate performance. This is standard startup practice, but her comment shows how if your company is growing quickly post-IPO, you can stick to adjusted metrics and have no issue. If growth slows, I bet that changes.</span></li>
<li>COVID: Will the COVID bump to gaming stick? Per Jabal, when her company has seen a bump in engagement historically, results don’t tend to fall back to prior plateaus. I wonder if this will be the case for all COVID-boosted parts of the startup and big-tech landscape. If so, it’s very good news.</li>
<li>Know your metrics: Jabal said that her key metrics are non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow &#8212; apart from growth, I’d add. That’s super clear and easy to grok. Startup CEOs, please have a similar distillation ready when we chat about your latest round.</li>
</ul>
<p>And speaking of startups, let’s talk about a company that I’ve had my eye on that recently raised more capital: Deepgram. I covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/deepgram-raises-12m-for-enterprise-speech-recognition/">the company’s Series A</a>, a $12 million round in March 2020. Now it has <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/03/deepgram-raises-25-million-to-build-custom-enterprise-speech-recognition-models/">raised $25 million more</a>, led by Tiger, so this is a fun case of big money investing early-stage, I think. Regardless, Deepgram was a bet on a particular model for speech recognition, and, then, its market. its new investment implies that both wagers came out the right way up.</p>
<p>And I was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">chatting with the CEO of Databricks recently</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/why-one-databricks-investor-thinks-the-company-may-be-undervalued/">more here on its latest megaround</a>), who mentioned the huge gains made in AI, and more specifically around generative adversarial networks (GANs) NLP, and more. Our read is that we should expect to see more Deepgram-ish rounds in the future as AI and similar methods of approaching data make their way into workflows.</p>
<p>And fintech player Payoneer is going public. Via a SPAC. You can read the investor presentation <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816090/000110465921011298/tm215090d1_ex99-2.htm">here</a>. Payoneer is not a pre-revenue firm going out via a blank check; it did an expected $346 million in 2020 rev. I’m bringing it to you for two reasons. One, read the deck, and then ask yourself why all SPAC decks are so ugly. I don’t get it. And then ask yourself why isn’t it pursuing a traditional IPO? Numbers are on pages 32 and 40. I can’t figure it out. Let me know if you have a take. Best response gets Elon’s dogecoin.</p>
<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The public markets have been so active lately that it’s hard to drum up excitement for yet another company making its way to the bull market. But, in the case of Bumble, a dating app where women message first, next week’s public debut is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>The market for dating startups has long had an 11-year-old elephant in the room: Match Group. The Dallas company owns popular dating brands including Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, and more, which some saw as the singular exit point for startups that help people meet.</p>
<p>Bumble, founded by Whitney Wolfe Herd, will change that narrative with its entrance into the public markets. Bumble is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">seeking to raise more than $1 billion upon debut. </a>The company could be worth between $5.73 billion and $6.14 billion, looking at a diluted valuation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bumble’s choice to swipe past the classic route to sell to Match Group tells us that Wolfe Herd is bullish that the exit environment is strong for dating apps, as<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/22/week-in-review-venture-backed-loneliness/"> loneliness amid the pandemic</a> continues to impact the masses.</p>
<p>Cleo Capital&#8217;s Sarah Kunst, a former senior adviser to Bumble, tells me that Bumble is making history in a few ways, and “may well unleash a tidal wave of new funding and startups in the space.”</p>
<p>“As the youngest woman to ever take a company public, Whitney has proven that dating, a category long shunned by venture investors, is a highly lucrative and fast growing sector,” Kunst said. “She also is at the vanguard of several dawning realizations in tech: companies founded outside of Silicon Valley, companies founded by women, and gender parity on boards.”</p>
<p>We’ll be all over this on TechCrunch and Extra Crunch next week, but in the meantime, let’s get through the other news of the week. Make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">follow me on Twitter</a> so I can bother you the remaining six days of the week.</p>
<h2><strong>Pandemic-era valuations </strong></h2>
<p>Valuations are simply the price that an investor thinks a startup is worth &#8212; nothing more, nothing less. When a big event happens in the world of startups, such as a massive exit or blockbuster IPO, startups within the sector-of-interest often enjoy a boom in valuations.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> This week, we explored whether edtech enjoyed that same burst of energy. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/ ">According to over a dozen investors</a>, edtech isn’t seeing skyrocketing valuations. It’s a surprise to me, but venture capitalists have their theories as to why (and seemingly are energized enough by exit opportunities in the meantime).</p>
<p><strong>Etc: </strong>Beyond edtech, this survey can give us key intel on how sectors that faced a pandemic lift, such as fintech and e-commerce, are valued and ranked by investors. It might suggest that the noise is louder than the actual dollars and cents.</p>

<h2><strong>Carta tackles the startup liquidity problem</strong></h2>
<p>Don’t let the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/techcrunchs-favorite-companies-from-500-startups-latest-demo-day-2/ ">Demo Days fool you</a>: <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/venture-capital-is-going-to-get-even-bigger-faster-and-more-expensive-this-year/ ">Venture capital is getting bigger, faster</a>, and older. But if you’re an angel who invested in a startup that was meant to go public in 2014, you might be getting a little bit impatient and want your capital back.</p>
<p>Carta is trying to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/cartas-startup-liquidity-service-cartax-conducts-first-transactions-on-its-own-cap-table/"> create a solution to help startups trade secondary shares</a>, pre-exit events, to bring liquidity earlier on in a startup’s life.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The tool, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/cartas-startup-liquidity-service-cartax-conducts-first-transactions-on-its-own-cap-table/">CartaX</a>, finally launched this week after being teased out for months. Upon launch, Carta sold nearly $100 million of its own shares on its own cap table, at more than double its last valuation post-Series F round.</p>
<p><strong>Etc: </strong>Carta is, of course, hoping that its cap-table management business will help it pull off the operation unlike others who have tried and failed. Here is some context from Danny Crichton:</p>
<blockquote><p>That wave of liquidity startups ran into two problems: One was regulatory, and the other was a lack of company information about cap tables and that company’s current financial picture. Stock buyers were essentially flying blind while buying into companies, which some investors were more than willing to do, but that blindness limited the market demand for secondary shares significantly.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_1447526" style="width: 735px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1447526" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1447526" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png" alt="" width="725" height="408" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1447526" class="wp-caption-text">Image: JaaakWorks/iStock/Getty Images</p></div></p>
<h2><strong>The art of a startup narrative</strong></h2>
<p>It’s normal if sculpting a story out of the hot mess that is your day-to-day doesn’t feel natural. It’s like writing a story before you know exactly what you want to accomplish with each and every word. The difficulty doesn’t diminish the necessity, though.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Whether it’s pitching for a story or for millions of dollars, founders need to know <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/pitch-decks-pricing-and-how-to-nail-the-narrative-with-lightspeeds-gaurav-gupta-and-grafanas-raj-dutt/">how to nail their startup’s narrative.</a> We got into the nuts in bolts in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/pitch-decks-pricing-and-how-to-nail-the-narrative-with-lightspeeds-gaurav-gupta-and-grafanas-raj-dutt/">the latest edition of Extra Crunch Live</a>, a virtual event series for early-stage founders.</p>
<blockquote><p>We were very heads down, building these open-source projects and trying to create good software, and we just hadn’t thought a lot about the narrative. Over the years, that’s gotten a lot better, but it’s also become a lot more self-evident to us and much clearer as we write and build the business,” said Raj Dutt, Grafana’s co-founder and CEO.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Etc: </strong>Speaking of advice, here’s one warning story by Silicon Valley editor Connie Loizos about how an insurtech startup got their idea swiped (and funded) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/this-insurtech-alleges-a-venture-backer-founded-and-funded-a-copycat-a-founders-nightmare/ ">by their own venture backer</a>. And to offset that stress, here’s one inspiring story, by yours truly, about how one woman went from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nathalie-walton-expectful-seed/?tpcc=ECTW2020">user to chief executive of a startup in less than a year.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>You&#8217;ve landed on Human Capital, a weekly newsletter detailing the latest in diversity, equity, inclusion and labor. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here</a> to receive the newsletter every Friday at 1 p.m. PT.</em></p>
<p>The events of this week perfectly encapsulate the variety of worker and workplace-related struggles happening in the tech industry. Google settled some discrimination allegations with the Department of Labor, Amazon agreed to settle a complaint with the FTC over stolen tips from Flex workers and the Alphabet Workers Union filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board. It was quite the week so let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<h3><b>Grocery delivery startup Dumpling faces backlash</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dumpling workers said this week they have been misled by the Instacart alternative’s business model, </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93w87d/ethical-instacart-alternative-shut-down-facebook-group-where-workers-protested-pay-changes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Additionally, workers told Vice the company shut down their Facebook post where they were protesting pay changes. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Vice:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Dumpling is now in hot water with many of the gig workers on its platform, which it calls &#8220;business owners.&#8221; These business owners say the company has misled them about how much autonomy and control they&#8217;d have on the platform, and has shut down their Facebook group after workers on the platform spoke out against a series of changes the company made to its pay model in the latter half of 2020. When Dumpling closed the Facebook group, it said the group &#8220;ha[d]n&#8217;t lived up to its positive intent.&#8221; </span></p></blockquote>
<h3><b>Alpha Global walks back its announcement</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember when Alpha Global announced an alliance of Alphabet workers around the world, including those affiliated with the recently-formed Alphabet Workers Union in the U.S.? Well, it turns out that wasn’t entirely true. </span><a href="https://www.uniglobalunion.org/AlphaGlobal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha Global has since issued a revised statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clarifying it did not have buy-in from AWU.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our announcement of the Alpha Global alliance, UNI mistakenly included CODE-CWA and the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) as members of the Alpha Global Alliance and a quote from AWU Executive Chair Parul Koul, without receiving proper authorization from CWA, the Alphabet Workers Union’s elected Executive Council, or Ms. Koul. We take full responsibility and have addressed this situation to prevent it from happening again.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But by the time Alpha Global made the announcement, the damage had already been done, according to The Verge. Some AWU members expressed their concerns with the way things went down, and some are now pushing to disassociate from the Communications Workers of America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a whole thing that you can </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256577/alphabet-workers-union-turmoil-global-alliance-announcement-google-cwa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read more about here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Alphabet Workers Union files complaint with NLRB</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/alphabet-union-alleges-contract-workers-were-silenced-about-pay?sref=gni836kR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a filing with the National Labor Union</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, AWU alleged Google vendor Adecco violated the law by trying to silence employees. The complaint alleges employees were punished for discussing their pay. The complaint was filed against both Adecco and Google</span></p>
<h3><b>Google CEO meets with HBCUs</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of recent departures of Black leaders at Google, CEO Sundar Pichai met with five HBCUs last Friday. The meeting itself was relatively uneventful &#8212; they reportedly didn’t even talk about the allegations from Dr. Timnit Gebru and April Curley &#8212; but HBCUs and Google provided the following joint-statement to </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/business/google-hbcus/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are all encouraged about the future partnership. The meeting paved the way for a more substantive partnership in a number of areas, from increased hiring to capacity building efforts that will increase the pipeline of tech talent from HBCUs.”</span></p>
<p>Speaking of Dr. Gebru, Google&#8217;s lead of the ethical AI team, Margaret Mitchell, posted an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ERi2crDToYhYjEjxRoOzO-uOUeLgdoLPfnx1JOErg2w/edit">email she sent to Google pertaining to Gebru&#8217;s exit</a>.</p>
<h3><b>Google settles discrimination allegations with DOL</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/google-dol-discrimination-settlement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google agreed to pay $2.59 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to more than 5,500 current employees and former job applicants as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor over allegations of systemic discrimination as it relates to compensation and hiring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google also agreed to reserve $250,000 a year for the next five years to address any potential pay equity adjustments that may come up. That brings Google’s total financial commitment to $3.8 million — a drop in the bucket for the company, whose parent company Alphabet has a market cap of $1.28 trillion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The settlement comes after the DOL’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs found pay disparities affecting female software engineers at Google’s offices in Mountain View, as well as in offices in Seattle and Kirkland, Washington. The OFCCP also found differences in hiring rates that “disadvantaged female and Asian applicants” for engineers roles at Google’s locations in San Francisco, Sunnyvale and Kirkland.</span></p>
<h3><b>Two Google workers quit to show solidarity</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vinesh Kannan, a software engineer, quit Google in light of Dr. Timnit Gebru and April Curley’s negative experiences at the company. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/vineshgkannan/status/1357115873723637764"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kannan said what they experienced “crossed a personal red line I wrote down when I started the job. I know I gained a lot from Google, but I also gained a lot from both of their work, and they were wronged.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Baker, who was a director focused on user safety, left Google last month, saying Gebru’s departure “extinguished my desire to continue as a Googler,” </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-resignations/two-google-engineers-resign-over-firing-of-ai-ethics-researcher-timnit-gebru-idUSKBN2A4090"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Amazon agreed to pay $61.7 million to settle FTC complaint over stolen tips from Flex workers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon will pay $61.7 million to compensate the drivers who loss out on the tips they were owed. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/amazon-to-pay-61-7m-to-settle-ftc-complaint-over-stolen-amazon-flex-driver-tips/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From TC’s Sarah Perez</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the complaint against Amazon and its subsidiary Amazon Logistics, the company had advertised that it paid 100% of tips to drivers. But in reality, Amazon used the customer tips to cover the difference after it lowered the hourly rate — a change it didn’t inform drivers about, the complaint says.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FTC also alleged that Amazon didn’t stop this behavior until it became aware of the FTC investigation in 2019.</span></p>
<h3><b>Amazon union vote on the horizon</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Amazon’s motion to postpone the Bessemer, Alabama union election, the National Labor Relations Board on Friday denied the company’s request. The election will go as planned via mail-in ballots beginning on Monday, February 8. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Context: Amazon has been vocally anti-union, with a </span><a href="https://www.doitwithoutdues.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dedicated to convincing workers not to unionize, as well as fliers posted inside the workplace &#8212; even in bathroom stalls, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/02/amazon-union-warehouse-workers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Workers protest future Amazon fulfillment center</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over in Oxnard, Calif., workers protested at the site of a future Amazon fulfillment center, disrupting the construction efforts, </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/3anyvw/75-striking-workers-halt-construction-at-future-amazon-warehouse"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The strike aimed to challenge the fact that Amazon contractor, Building Zone Industries, hired non-union workers from out of the state for the job. There were reportedly more than 100 people who participated in the strike and refused to cross the picket line to work on the project.</span></p>
<h3><b>CA Supreme Court rejects lawsuit challenging Prop 22</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/ca-supreme-court-denies-lawsuit-challenging-prop-22s-constitutionality/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California Supreme Court shot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down the lawsuit filed by a group of rideshare drivers in California and the Service Employees International Union that alleged Proposition 22 violates the state’s constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are disappointed in the Supreme Court’s decision not to hear our case, but make no mistake: we are not deterred in our fight to win a livable wage and basic rights,” Hector Castellanos, a plaintiff in the case, said in a statement. “We will consider every option available to protect California workers from attempts by companies like Uber and Lyft to subvert our democracy and attack our rights in order to improve their bottom lines.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit argued Prop 22 makes it harder for the state’s legislature to create and enforce a workers’ compensation system for gig workers. It also argues Prop 22 violates the rule that limits ballot measures to a single issue, as well as unconstitutionally defines what would count as an amendment to the measure. As it stands today, Prop 22 requires a seven-eighths legislative supermajority in order to amend the measure.</span></p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t miss TC Sessions: Justice</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, we looked back at &#8220;Soul,&#8221; which was released on Disney+ at the end of last year.</p>
<p>The new Pixar film tells the story of Joe Gardner, a high school music teacher and jazz musician voiced by Jamie Foxx. Joe seems to be on the verge of his big break when he accidentally falls down an open manhole, sending him to a distinctly Pixar-ish twist on the afterlife, and eventually on a metaphysical quest to return to his body before an important concert..</p>
<p>Anthony has been wanting to talk about &#8220;Soul&#8221; for a while — it was easily his favorite movie of 2020, but he watched it right after we recorded our discussion of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/02/original-content-podcast-wonder-woman-1984-might-be-a-beautiful-mess-or-maybe-just-a-mess/">the best streaming content of 2020</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And if you&#8217;re worried that this is nothing more than 40 minutes of praise, well &#8230; you&#8217;re not entirely wrong. Both of us liked it a lot, appreciating both its vibrant (and in retrospect, melancholy) portrayal of New York City life before pandemic lockdowns and social distancing, as well as its inventive portrayal of the worlds our souls go to before we&#8217;re born and after we die. (It was so inventive that Jordan had to wonder whether any unusual substances may have been involved in its genesis.)</p>
<p>Still, we did acknowledge some of the criticism of &#8220;Soul,&#8221; particularly <a href="https://www.tor.com/2020/12/26/pixars-soul-aims-to-spark-an-appreciation-for-life/">certain viewers&#8217; disappointment</a> that even though it&#8217;s the first Pixar film with a Black protagonist, Joe actually spends a large portion of the film as a disembodied blue spirit — entertaining from a story perspective, but not quite an unambiguous victory for representation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The SPAC mania continues unabated, with new SPACs being filed with the SEC on an almost hourly basis at times.</p>
<p>SoftBank, the Japanese telecom conglomerate which has also been running the gigantic Vision Fund and its successor, doesn’t want to be left out. Yesterday, it filed back-to-back SPAC registration statements for two new blank-check companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001837238/000119312521030688/d16631ds1.htm">SVF Investment Corp 2</a> is $200 million and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001837240/000119312521030731/d41389ds1.htm">SVF Investment Corp 3</a> is a $350 million vehicle. Both SPACs have a standard roughly 15% over-allotment option, which means that their final sizes will likely end up at $230 million and $400 million respectively assuming that the underwriters take their option (number three has a slightly smaller over-allotment if you’re checking my math).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One interesting component of both SPACs is that they have what is known as a <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/07/06/special-purpose-acquisition-companies-an-introduction/">forward purchasing agreement</a> connected to SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2. That agreement allows the second Vision Fund to purchase shares into these SPACs when they begin their business combinations with their target startups, essentially giving it the right to buy into the mergers. The Vision Fund has a $100 million agreement with SVF 2, and a $150 million agreement with SVF 3.</p>
<p>As with all SPACs, a registration statement is merely a filing of an intention to raise money, although these days, the vast majority of filings are later consummated.</p>
<p>As the numbering indicates, SoftBank <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1828478/000119312520323022/d50198ds1.htm">had an earlier SPAC</a> that it filed in December and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001828478/999999999521000074/xslEFFECTX01/primary_doc.xml">officially closed on January 7 of this year</a>. That vehicle targeted a total fundraise of $604 million including the underwriters’ over-allotment option. It also included a $250 million forward purchase agreement with the second Vision Fund similar to these latest two vehicles.</p>
<p>What are these SPACs looking for? Well, according to the filings, “We intend to identify, acquire and manage a business in a technology-enabled sector where our management team have differentiated experience and insights. Relevant sectors may include, but are not limited to, mobile communications technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, cloud technologies, software broadly, computational biology and other data-driven business models, semiconductors and other hardware, transportation technologies, consumer internet and financial technology.”</p>
<p>That seems to cover a lot, but just in case, the filings note that “However, we may consummate a transaction with a business in a different or related industry.” So basically anything.</p>
<p>There is no timeline yet for when the SPACs could potentially close, but typical timing is 4-8 weeks given market averages.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The warrant ordered Google to turn over a set of user account data. Civil liberties groups have criticized the use of these dragnet search warrants.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Police in Minneapolis obtained a search warrant ordering Google to turn over sets of account data on vandals accused of sparking violence in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd last year, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>The death of Floyd, a Black man killed by a white police officer in May 2020, prompted thousands to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/unpacking-techs-response-to-george-floyds-death/">peacefully protest</a> across the city. But violence soon erupted, which police say began <a href="https://www.startribune.com/police-umbrella-man-was-a-white-supremacist-trying-to-incite-floyd-rioting/571932272/">with a masked man</a> seen in a viral video with an umbrella and smashing windows of an auto-parts store in south Minneapolis. The AutoZone store was the first among dozens of buildings across the city set on fire in the days following.</p>
<p>The search warrant compelled Google to provide police with the account data on anyone who was &#8220;within the geographical region&#8221; of the AutoZone store when the violence began on May 27, two days after Floyd&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>These so-called geofence warrants — or reverse-location warrants — are frequently directed at Google in large part because the search and advertising giant collects and stores vast databases of geolocation data on billions of account holders who have &#8220;location history&#8221; turned on. Geofence warrants allow police to cast a digital dragnet over a crime scene and ask tech companies for records on anyone who entered a geographic area at a particular time. But critics say these warrants are unconstitutional as they also gather the account information on innocent passers-by.</p>
<p>TechCrunch learned of <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20473889-minneapolis-police-searchgeolocation-warrant">the search warrant</a> from Minneapolis resident Said Abdullahi, who received an email from Google stating that his account information was subject to the warrant, and would be given to the police.</p>
<p>But Abdullahi said he had no part in the violence and was only in the area to video the protests when the violence began at the AutoZone store.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1rztlI-sV4nP45bTQxAEcKua2kDfm52UU&amp;z=17" width="100%" height="600"></iframe></p>
<p>The warrant said police sought &#8220;anonymized&#8221; account data from Google on any phone or device that was close to the AutoZone store and the parking lot between 5:20pm and 5:40pm (CST) on May 27, where dozens of the people in the area had gathered.</p>
<p>When reached, Minneapolis police spokesperson John Elder, citing an ongoing investigation, would not answer specific questions about the warrant, including for what reason the warrant was issued.</p>
<p>According to a police affidavit, police said the protests had been relatively peaceful until the afternoon of May 27, when a masked umbrella-wielding man began smashing the windows of the AutoZone store, located across the street from a Minneapolis police precinct where hundreds of protesters had gathered. Several videos show protesters confronting the masked man.</p>
<p>Police said they spent significant resources on trying to identify the so-called &#8220;Umbrella Man,&#8221; who they say was the catalyst for widespread violence across the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was the first fire that set off a string of fires and looting throughout the precinct and the rest of the city,&#8221; the affidavit read. At least two people were killed in the unrest. (Erika Christensen, a Minneapolis police investigator who filed the affidavit, was not made available for an interview.)</p>
<p>Police accuse the Umbrella Man of creating an &#8220;atmosphere of hostility and tension&#8221; whose sole aim was to &#8220;incite violence.&#8221; (TechCrunch is not linking to the affidavit as the police would not say if the suspect had been charged with a crime.) The affidavit also links the suspect to <a href="https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/aryan-cowboy-brotherhood">a white supremacist group</a> called the Aryan Cowboys, and to an incident weeks later where a Muslim woman was harassed.</p>
<p>Multiple videos of the protests around the time listed on the warrant appear to line up with the window-smashing incident. Other videos of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Lnarikawa/videos/3867734406634782/">the scene</a> at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/emma.fiala.7/videos/786231895117478">the time</a> of the warrant show <a href="https://twitter.com/TDavisFreep/status/1265741751521861632">hundreds of other people</a> in the vicinity. Police were positioned on rooftops and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police/protests-looting-erupt-in-minneapolis-over-racially-charged-killing-by-police-idUSKBN2332G9">used tear gas and rubber bullets</a> to control the crowds.</p>
<p>Law enforcement across the U.S. are increasingly relying on geofence warrants to solve crimes where a suspect is not known. Police have defended the use of these warrants because they can help identify potential suspects who entered a certain geographic region where a crime was committed. The warrants typically ask for &#8220;anonymized information,&#8221; but allow police to go back and narrow their requests on potential suspects of interest.</p>
<p>When allowed by law, Google notifies account holders of when law enforcement demands access to the user&#8217;s data. According to <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/us-v-chatrie-google-amicus-brief-geofence-warrant">a court filing</a> in 2019, Google said the number of geofence warrants it received went up by 1,500% between 2017 and 2018, and more than 500% between 2018 and 2019, but has yet to provide a specific number of warrants</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html">reportedly received</a> over 180 geofence warrants in a single week in 2019. When asked about more recent figures, a Google spokesperson declined to comment on the record.</p>

<p>Civil liberties groups have criticized the use of dragnet search warrants. The American Civil Liberties Union <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/en/publications/letter-google-geofence-and-keyword-warrants">said</a> that geofence warrants &#8220;circumvent constitutional checks on police surveillance.&#8221; One district court in Virginia said geofence warrants <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/new-federal-court-rulings-find-geofence-warrants-unconstitutional-0">violated the constitution</a> because the majority of individuals whose data is collected will have &#8220;nothing whatsoever&#8221; to do with the crimes under investigation.</p>
<p>Reports in the past year have implicated people whose only connection to a crime is simply being nearby.</p>
<p>NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761">reported</a> the case of one Gainesville, Fla. resident, who was told by Google that his account information would be given to police investigating a burglary. But the resident was able to prove that he had no connection to the burglary, thanks to an app on his phone that tracked his activity.</p>
<p>In 2019, Google gave federal agents investigating several arson attacks in Milwaukee, Wis. close to 1,500 user records <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/12/11/google-gives-feds-1500-leads-to-arsonist-smartphones-in-unprecedented-geofence-search/?sh=203215ed27dc">in response to geofence warrant</a>, thought to be one of the largest grabs of account data to date.</p>
<p>But lawmakers are beginning to push back. New York state lawmakers introduced a bill last year that would, if passed, ban geofence warrants across the state, citing <a href="https://www.protocol.com/new-york-lawmakers-want-to-outlaw-geofence-warrants">the risk of police targeting protesters</a><strong>. </strong>Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) grilled Google chief executive Sundar Pichai at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/lawmaker-questions-googles-ceo-about-geofence-warrants/">last year</a>. &#8220;People would be terrified to know that law enforcement could grab general warrants and get everyone&#8217;s information everywhere,&#8221; said Armstrong.</p>
<p>Abdullahi told TechCrunch that he had several videos documenting the protests on the day and that he has retained a lawyer to try to prevent Google from giving his account information to Minneapolis police.</p>
<p>&#8220;Police assumed everybody in that area that day is guilty,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If one person did something criminal, [the police] should not go after the whole block of people,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Friday just past midnight, I stumbled across a Clubhouse room hosted by a well-known figure in the Chinese startup community, Feng Dahui. At half-past midnight, the room still had nearly 500 listeners, many of whom were engineers, product managers, and entrepreneurs from China.</p>
<p>The discussion centered around whether <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com">Clubhouse</a>, an app that lets people join pop-up voice chats in virtual rooms, will succeed in China. That&#8217;s a question I have been asking myself in recent weeks. Given the current hype swirling in Silicon Valley about the audio social network, it&#8217;s unsurprising to see well-informed, tech-savvy Chinese users start flocking to the platform. Demand for invitations in China runs high, with people paying as much as $100 to buy one from scalpers.</p>
<p>Many users I talked to believe the app won&#8217;t reach its full potential or even just find product-market fit in China before it gets banned. Indeed, a handful of well-attended Chinese-language rooms touch on topics that are normally censored in China, from crypto trading to protests in Hong Kong.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If it&#8217;s of any consolation, Clubhouse clones and derivatives are already in the making in China. A Chinese entrepreneur and blogger who goes by the nickname Herock told me he is aware of at least &#8220;dozens of local teams&#8221; that are working on something similar. Moreover, voice-based networking has been around in China for years, albeit in different forms. If Clubhouse is blocked, will any of its alternatives go on to succeed?</p>
<h2>Information control</h2>
<p>A direct Clubhouse clone probably won&#8217;t work in China.</p>
<p>A few factors dim its prospects in the country, which has nearly one billion internet users. The major appeal of Clubhouse is the organic flow of conversations in real time. But &#8220;how could the Chinese government allow free-flowing discussions to happen and spread without control,&#8221; a founder of a Chinese audio app rhetorically asked, declining to be named for this story. Video live streaming in China, for example, is under close regulatory oversight limiting who can speak and what they can say.</p>
<p>The founder then cited a <a href="https://news.qq.com/a/20111102/000768.htm">famous online protest</a> back in 2011. Thousands of small vendors launched a cyber attack on Alibaba&#8217;s online mall over a proposed fee hike. The tool they used to coordinate with one another was YY, which started out as a voice-based chatting software for gamers and later became known for video live streaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;The authorities dread the power of real-time audio communication,&#8221; the founder added.</p>
<p>There are signs that Clubhouse may already be the target of censorship. While Clubhouse works perfectly in China without the need for a virtual private network (VPN) or other censorship-circumvention tools (at least for the moment), the iOS-exclusive app is unavailable on China&#8217;s App Store. Clubhouse was removed there shortly after its global release in late September, app analytics firm Sensor Tower said.</p>
<p>Currently, in order to install Clubhouse, Chinese users need to install the app by switching to an App Store located in another country, which further limits the product&#8217;s reach to users who have the means of using a non-local store.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether Apple preemptively delisted Clubhouse in anticipation of government action, given that any later removal of a major foreign app in China could stir up accusations of censorship. Alternatively, Clubhouse might have voluntarily pulled the app itself knowing that any form of live broadcasting won&#8217;t go unchecked by Chinese regulators, which would inevitably compromise user experience.</p>
<p>Entering China could be way down on Clubhouse&#8217;s to-do list given the traction it is gaining elsewhere. The app has seen about 3.6 million worldwide installs so far, according to Sensor Tower estimates. The majority of its lifetime installs originate in the United States, where the app has seen nearly 2 million first-time downloads, followed by Japan and Germany both with over 400,000 downloads.</p>
<h2>Clubhouse elites</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2108857" style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108857" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2108857" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/43221612455079_.pic_.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="587" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/43221612455079_.pic_.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/43221612455079_.pic_.jpg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/43221612455079_.pic_.jpg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/43221612455079_.pic_.jpg?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/43221612455079_.pic_.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108857" class="wp-caption-text">Clubhouse room hosted by Feng Dahui, a respected figure in China&#8217;s startup world.

<p>The improbability of uncensored and open discussions on the Chinese internet may explain why the market hasn&#8217;t seen its own Clubhouse. But even if an app like Clubhouse is allowed to exist in China, it may not reach the same massive scale across the country as Douyin (TikTok&#8217;s Chinese version) and WeChat did.</p>
<p>The app is &#8220;elitist,&#8221; sort of like a voice version of Twitter, said Marco Lai, CEO and founder of Lizhi, a NASDAQ-listed Chinese audio platform. So far, Clubhouse&#8217;s invite-only model has confined its American user base largely to the tech, arts and celebrity circles. Herock observed that its Chinese demographics mirror the trend, with users concentrated in fields like finance, startup and product management, as well as crypto traders.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might look like Clubhouse blew up within a small circle], but I don&#8217;t think the absolute user number [in China] is that big,&#8221; said Herock.</p>
<p>Even among these users though, there is the question of free time. The other night, I was up at midnight eavesdropping on a group of ByteDance employees. In fact, I&#8217;ve mostly been on Clubhouse in the late evenings after work, because that&#8217;s when user activity in China appears to peak. &#8220;Who in China has that much time?&#8221; said Zhou Lingyu, founder of Rainmaker, a Chinese networking community for professionals, when I asked whether she thinks Clubhouse will attract the masses in China.</p>
<p>While her remark may not apply to everyone, the tech-centric, educated crowds in China — the demographic that Clubhouse appears to be targeting or at least attracting — are also those most likely to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/china-996/">work the notorious &#8220;996&#8221; schedule</a>, the long hours practice common in Chinese tech companies. The type of &#8220;<a href="https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us">meaningful conversations</a>&#8221; that Clubhouse encourages is desirable, but the app&#8217;s spontaneous, live, participatory nature is also a lot to ask of 996 workers, who likely prefer more efficient and manageable use of time.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China&#8217;s startup ecosystem is hitting back at demanding working hours&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/china-996/embed/#?secret=u0j018vHUV" data-secret="u0j018vHUV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Moderators may also need material incentives to remain active aside from the pure passion in connecting with other human beings. One potential solution is to turn quality conversations into podcast episodes. &#8220;Clubhouse is for one-off, casual conversations. Those who produce high-quality content would want to record the conversation so it could be for repeatable consumption later on,” said Zhou.</p>
<h2>Chinese counterparts</h2>
<p>In China, audio networking has played out in slightly different shapes. Some companies place a great deal of focus on gamification, filling their apps with playful, interactive features.</p>
<p>Lizhi&#8217;s social podcast app, for example, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/lizhi-podcast-profile/">not just about listening</a>. It also lets listeners message hosts, tip them through virtual gifts, record themselves shadowing a host who is reading a poem, compete in online karaoke contests, and more.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0qDxREytl2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/lizhi-podcast-profile/">Podcast is social: How China&#8217;s Lizhi makes audio interactive</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Podcast is social: How China&#8217;s Lizhi makes audio interactive&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/lizhi-podcast-profile/embed/#?secret=0qDxREytl2" data-secret="0qDxREytl2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Interaction between hosts and listeners happens in a relatively orchestrated way, as Lizhi&#8217;s operational staff design campaigns and work with content creators behind the scenes to ensure content quality and user engagement. Clubhouse growth, in comparison, is more organic.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese products focus more on spectatorship and performance, not so much translating natural social behavior in real life into a product. Clubhouse features are simple. It&#8217;s more like a coffee shop,&#8221; Lai said.</p>
<p>Lizhi&#8217;s other voice product <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiya-voice-chat-match/id1470581257">Tiya</a> is considered a close answer to Clubhouse, but Tiya&#8217;s users are young — the majority of whom are 15-22 years old — and it focuses on entertainment, letting users chat via audio while they play games and watch sports. That also feeds the need for companionship.</p>
<p><a href="https://dz.zaih.com/">Dizhua</a>, which launched in 2019, is another Chinese app that&#8217;s been compared to Clubhouse. Unlike Clubhouse, which relies on people&#8217;s existing networks for room discovery, Dizhua matches anonymous users based on their declared interests. Clubhouse conversations can start and die off casually. Dizhua encourages users to pick a theme and stay engaged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clubhouse is a pure audio app, with no timeline, no comment, et cetera,&#8221; said Armin Li, an expert in residence with a venture capital firm in China. &#8220;It’s a kind of casual and drop-in style for the scenarios where user needs are not clear like hangout or multitasking … Its high community participation, content quality, and user quality are unseen in Chinese voice products.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bottom line is: The conversations that happen on Chinese platforms are monitored by content auditors. User registration requires real-name verification on internet platforms in China, so there&#8217;s no real anonymity online. The topics that users can discuss are limited, often leaning towards the fun and innocuous.</p>
<p>Why do people in China join Clubhouse anyway? Some, like me, joined out of FOMO. Entrepreneurs are always scouring for the next market opportunity, and product managers from internet giants hope to learn a thing or two from Clubhouse that they could apply to their own products. Bitcoin traders and activists, on the other hand, see Clubhouse as a haven outside the purview of Chinese regulators.</p>
<h2>Technical support</h2>
<p>One thing I find impressive about Clubhouse is how smoothly it works in China. Even when a foreign app isn&#8217;t banned in China, it often loads slowly due to its servers&#8217; distance from China.</p>
<p>Clubhouse doesn&#8217;t actually build the technology supporting its enormous chat groups that sometimes reach thousands of participants. Instead, it uses a real-time audio SDK from Agora, two sources told me. The South China Morning Post also <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3120259/agora-chinese-company-powering-clubhouse-sees-stocks-soar-investors">reported</a> that. When asked to verify the partnership, Agora CEO Tony Zhao said via email he can&#8217;t confirm or deny any engagement between his company and Clubhouse.</p>
<p>Rather, he emphasized Agora&#8217;s &#8220;virtual network,&#8221; which overlays on top of the public internet running on more than 200 co-located data centers worldwide. The company then uses algorithms to plan traffic and optimize routing.</p>
<p>Noticeably, Agora&#8217;s operations teams are mainly in China and the U.S., a setup that inevitably raises questions about whether Clubhouse data are within the scope of Chinese regulations, a possibility that the company flagged in its IPO <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1802883/000162828020009726/agoraf-1a2.htm">prospectus</a>.</p>
<p>With real-time voice technology providers like Agora, opportunists are able to build Clubhouse clones quickly at low costs, Herock said. Chinese entrepreneurs are unlikely to copy Clubhouse directly due to local regulatory challenges and different user behavior, but they will race to crank out their own interpretations of voice networking before the hype around Clubhouse fades away.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everyone knows YouTubers and other creators are popular with internet users of all ages. But today, these influencers also have real businesses powered by a range of software tools and service providers who help weave videos, pictures, clips, memes and other types of content into sustainable success.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The pandemic added fuel to existing trends pushing growth in this category. Today, the platforms are bigger and more diverse than ever and many creators have years of experience growing audiences and monetizing online. Parallel to this industry, the rapid overall growth of enterprise technologies allow for many new types of creator-focused products to be built. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Top investors in the space are seeing new opportunities for startups to build tools that help creators monetize and grow or solve needs that are specific to creator subverticals like gaming or coaching/education. </span></p>
<p>For this particular investor survey, we dug through notes from the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamingrubbs/">Benjamin Grubbs</a>, founder, <a href="https://www.next10ventures.com/#home">Next10 Ventures</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ljin1/">Li Jin</a>, founder, <a href="https://www.atelierventures.co/thesis">Atelier Ventures</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianpomalley/">Brian O&#8217;Malley</a>, general partner, <a href="https://www.forerunnerventures.com/">Forerunner Ventures</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezevidra/">Eze Vidra</a>, managing partner, <a href="http://www.remagineventures.com/">Remagine Ventures</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshconstine/">Josh Constine</a>, principal, <a href="https://www.signalfire.com/blog/creator-economy/">SignalFire</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The blank spaces in the creator economy</strong></h2>
<p>As with many industries that fall under the broad banner of tech, digital creators saw an acceleration from COVID-19, investors said. The simple fact that millions of us are inside and on our phones a lot has helped creators expand their audiences. (More on this in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/9-vcs-say-interactivity-regulation-and-independent-creators-will-reshape-digital-media-in-2021/">digital media investor survey</a> from the other week.)</p>
<p>More people also became creators. Jin noted that the pandemic has led to “people experimenting with creative hobbies and passions,” which smells like rising creator TAM from our perspective.</p>
<p>A broader definition of what constitutes a creator means more potential customers for startups looking to serve them, and perhaps a greater total revenue in the market could be an impact of COVID.</p>
<p>There are ample places for building in the creator economy, including discovery, which O&#8217;Malley cited as a key issue. “The best content doesn’t always rise to the top,” he said, adding that “incentives remain to create content that will be viral and get eyeballs” and to nab the content of others over creating net-new material.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week, we&#8217;re taking a look at Clubhouse&#8217;s breakout moment &#8212; or moments, to be fair. Also, the App Store&#8217;s rules were updated, Parler&#8217;s CEO was fired and other companies began raising their own red flags about Apple&#8217;s privacy changes.</p>

<p>The invite-only audio platform has been on a roll, and has already hosted big names in tech, media and entertainment, including Drake, Estelle, Tiffany Haddish, Kevin Hart, Jared Leto, Ashton Kutcher, and others in the Silicon Valley tech scene. But this week was a breakout if there ever was one, when on Monday, Tesla and SpaceX founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/">Elon Musk showed up on Clubhouse</a>, topping the app&#8217;s limit of 5,000 people in a single room. With others unable to get in, fans livestreamed the event to other platforms like YouTube, live-tweeted, and set up breakout rooms for the overflow. Musk was later joined by &#8220;Vlad The Stock Impaler,&#8221; aka Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, who of course talked about the GameStop saga &#8212; and was then interviewed by Musk himself.</p>
<p>Then on Thursday, Clubhouse saw yet another famous guest: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who casually went by &#8220;Zuck23&#8221; when he joined &#8220;<a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/event/PQ488GWn">The Good Time Show</a>&#8221; talk show on the app, as Musk had done before him.</p>
<p>The format of the social media network allowed the execs to informally address a wide audience of listeners with whatever they want to talk about &#8212; in Musk&#8217;s case, that was space travel, crypto, AI and vaccines, among other things. Zuckerberg, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-clubhouse-2021-2">used the time to talk about AR/VR</a> and its future in business and remote work. (If you thought Zoom meetings were bad&#8230;).</p>
<p>(And who knows, maybe he wanted give the app a try for other reasons, too.)</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>There is something unsettling about this whole arrangement, of course. Soft-balled questions lobbed at billionaires, <a href="https://twitter.com/simonowens/status/1357692763693862916">journalists blocked from rooms</a>, and so on &#8212; all on an app financed by a VC firm, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), that&#8217;s said to be interested in cutting out the media middleman, <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-unauthorized-story-of-andreessen">to &#8220;go direct</a>&#8221; instead. (<a href="https://twitter.com/Jessicalessin/status/1356338137815941120">Not coincidentally,</a> the room inviting the big name guests was co-hosted by a16z&#8217;s Andreessen and its new GP, Sriram Krishnan, who is <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/02/03/sriram-krishnan/">described as</a> having an &#8220;optimistic&#8221; outlook &#8212; perhaps a valuable commodity when much of the media does not.)</p>
<p>Regardless of the machinations behind the scenes that made it happen, it&#8217;s hard to ignore an app where the biggest names in tech show up to just chat &#8212; or even interview one another.</p>
<p><a href="https://medialyte.substack.com/p/portrait-of-a-clubhouse-skeptic">Where is all this going</a>?, is a valid question to be raised. Some have described Clubhouse as the late-night talk show equivalent. A place where interviews aren&#8217;t about asking the hard questions, but rather about whatever the guest came there to say or promote. And that&#8217;s fine, of course &#8212; as long as everyone understands that when big names arrive, they may do so with an <em>agenda</em>, even when it seems they&#8217;re just there for fun.</p>
<p>In any event, Clubhouse proved this week it&#8217;s no longer a buzzy newcomer. For now, at least, it&#8217;s decidedly<em> in the game</em>.</p>
<h3>Companies (besides Facebook) warn investors about Apple&#8217;s privacy changes</h3>
<p>So far, it may have seemed as if the only two businesses taking real issue with Apple&#8217;s privacy changes, including the coming changes to IDFA, were <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-privacy-change-will-hit-facebooks-core-ad-business-heres-how-11611938750?mod=djemalertNEWS">Facebook</a> and Google. Facebook <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt">took out</a> full-page ads and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-looks-to-take-its-fight-with-apple-to-court">weighed lawsuits</a>. Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/google-hasnt-updated-ios-apps-since-privacy-labels/">delayed</a> iOS app updates while it figured out privacy labels. But as other companies reported their fourth-quarter earnings, IDFA impacts were also<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/snap-unity-warn-of-impact-from-apple-ios-14-idfa-privacy-changes.html"> topping their list of concerns</a>.</p>
<p>In Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel&#8217;s<a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Snap-Inc.-Q4-2020-Prepared-Remarks.pdf"> prepared remarks,</a> he alerted investors to the potential disruption to Snap&#8217;s ad business, saying that the privacy changes &#8220;will present another risk of interruption&#8221; to advertising demand. He noted that it was unclear what the long-term consequences of those changes may be, too. Unity, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204005404/en/">attached a number to it</a>: IDFA changes would reduce its revenue by about 3%, or $30 million, in 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2109618" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2109618" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2109618" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/106832756-1611957023306-Test_screens_FINAL.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="411" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/106832756-1611957023306-Test_screens_FINAL.jpg 1910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/106832756-1611957023306-Test_screens_FINAL.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/106832756-1611957023306-Test_screens_FINAL.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/106832756-1611957023306-Test_screens_FINAL.jpg?resize=768,464 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/106832756-1611957023306-Test_screens_FINAL.jpg?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/106832756-1611957023306-Test_screens_FINAL.jpg?resize=1536,929 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/106832756-1611957023306-Test_screens_FINAL.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2109618" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>It may be that no one really knows how damaging the IDFA update will be until it rolls out. These are only estimates based on tests and assumptions about user behavior. Plus, there are reports poking holes in Facebook&#8217;s claims, which had said that small businesses would suffer a 60% cut in revenues. Those are surely overstated, <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/facebooks-misleading-campaign-against-apples-privacy-policy">Harvard Business Review</a> wrote, saying Facebook had cherry-picked and amplified its numbers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Facebook is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/facebook-strikes-back-against-apple-ios-14-idfa-privacy-change.html">already testing ways</a> to encourage users to accept its tracking. The company on Monday began showing some users prompts that explained why it wants to track and asked users to opt in so Facebook can &#8220;provide a better ads experience.&#8221; Users could tap &#8220;allow&#8221; or &#8220;don&#8217;t allow&#8221; in response to the prompt.</p>
<h3>Apple updates its App Store Rules</h3>
<p>Apple said these were moderate changes &#8212; just clarifications and tweaks that had been under way for some time. For example, the new App Store Guidelines <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/02/apple-adds-app-tracking-transparency-rules-to-app-store-review-guidelines">now include instructions</a> about how developers should implement the new App Tracking Transparency rules. Another section details how developers can now file an appeal upon an app review rejection.</p>
<p>Other changes are more semantic in nature &#8212; changing person-to-person experiences to &#8220;services&#8221; to broaden the scope, for example, or to clarify how gaming companies can offer a single subscription that works across a variety of standalone apps.</p>
<p>To see what actually changed, <a href="https://visualping.io/snapshot/_vol_2/_data_285/285439/2021-02-02/2648247_1612277068005_diff.html">go here</a>.</p>
<h3>Parler CEO fired</h3>
<p>Parler &#8212; the app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/16/this-week-in-apps-parler-deplatformed-alt-apps-rise-looking-back-at-2020-trends/">banned</a> from the App Store, Google Play, Amazon AWS, using Okta, etc., etc. &#8212; fired its CEO, John Matze, this week after <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/parler-ceo-john-matze-fired/">struggling</a> to bring the app back online. According to reports <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/03/963832594/parler-ceo-is-fired-after-constant-resistance-inside-the-conservative-friendly-s">from NPR</a> and others, the firing was due to his disagreement with conservative donor Rebekah Mercer, who controls Parler&#8217;s board. Matze argued the app would need to crack down on domestic terrorism and groups that incite violence in order to succeed, he says, but claims he was met with silence. Parler, meanwhile, said those statements were misleading.</p>
<p>After Parler&#8217;s rapid deplatforming following the events at the Capitol, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/following-riots-alternative-social-apps-and-private-messengers-top-the-app-stores/">other alternative social networks climbed up the charts</a> to take its place. But these apps have not proven themselves to have much staying power. Instead, the top charts are once again filled with the usual: Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s actually no fun yelling about the world when no one is around to challenge you or fight back?</p>

<h3>Communication and Messaging</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Element, a client for federal chat protocol Matrix, was <a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355290296947499013?s=20">removed</a> from the Play Store this week, for <a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355465650114846720?s=20">abusive content</a>. But Google made a mistake</strong>. This was a third-party client, not the content&#8217;s host. And it had already removed the content, based on its own rules. For those unfamiliar, Element is an open network that offers both unencrypted public chatrooms as well as E2EE content. Eventually, the developer got a call from a Google VP who helped the app get reinstated. But the situation, which resulted in 24 hours of downtime, raised a question of how well app stores are prepared to moderate issues that crop up in decentralized platforms and services.</li>
<li><strong>Clubhouse CEO Paul Davison confirmed</strong> the company <a href="https://pocketnow.com/clubhouse-ceo-confirms-plans-of-a-subscription-tool-for-creators">will introduce a subscription tool</a> that will allow creators to make money from their rooms.</li>
<li><strong>Telegram, benefitting from the shift to private messaging and the WhatsApp backlash, became the most-downloaded app overall in January 2021</strong>, across both app stores and on Google Play. On the App Store, it was No. 4 and TikTok was No. 1.</li>

<p>Everyone&#8217;s favorite snarky weather app received a major overhaul toward the end of January, which includes a redesigned interface, new icons, tools to design the UI how you want it (an &#8220;interface maker&#8221;), new &#8220;secret locations&#8221; (a fun Easter egg) and more. The app has also switched to a vertical layout that fills the screen with information, which also includes smart cards that bubble up with weather info when it&#8217;s needed. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574">Carrot Weather</a> is also now a free download with subscriptions, instead of a paid app.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Venture capital and venture debt have continued to grow in the country, although the angel scene remains low-key.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to a recent <a href="https://thefoundation.gr/2020/12/17/startups-in-greece-2020-2021-report-progressing-against-all-odds/">report on Greece&#8217;s startup ecosystem</a> by management consultants Found.ation, venture capital and venture debt have continued to grow in the country, although its angel scene remains low-key.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, 2020 was a banner year, with the sale of InstaShop to Delivery Hero valuing the company at $360 million, making it the largest exit for a Greek-founded startup with operations in Greece.</p>
<p>The pandemic has meant Greek investors and startups realize that if they can work from anywhere and hire from anywhere, then Greece is not such a bad place to be. And the Greek VC market benefits as the diaspora returns from the mega cities of the West. The nation&#8217;s startup ecosystem is also attracting more outside investors, who see low capital costs, an educated workforce and the move to remote working/hiring.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bessemer Venture Partners, Insight Venture Partners and FJ labs are all backing Greek startups, and Microsoft completed its first acquisition in the country.</p>
<p>Greek startups and investors are also extending collaboration with near neighbors in Cyprus, Romania, Albania and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Investors in our survey said they were excited by sectors such as infrastructure, agtech, cybersecurity, proptech, efficient software, renewable tech and platforms aimed at helping the recovery of blue-collar jobs.</p>
<p>Were they seeing green shoots after the worst of the pandemic? Yes, but still small.</p>
<p>Investors are spreading their wings outside of Greece “as location becomes irrelevant and work-from-anywhere the new standard” although “the local ecosystem is always a priority.”</p>

<h2><strong>Panos Papadopoulos, partner, Marathon Venture Capital</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong></p>
<p>Infrastructure, agtech, cybersecurity, efficient software.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong></p>
<p>Hack The Box (the largest cybersecurity playground in the world).</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong></p>
<p>Infrastructure software is far from being optimized and resulting in huge bills. There is a lot to be done to leverage modern hardware architecture to make things cheaper and easier to operate.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong></p>
<p>Industry people fixing their industry.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong></p>
<p>Data management/analytics is oversaturated.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong></p>
<p>More than 80%, we operate in underserved market and enjoy preferential pricing.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong></p>
<p>Shipping is an obvious one but we don&#8217;t think venture returns can be accomplished in this space.<br />
Our portfolio company Netdata is changing IT monitoring. Huge OSS community and $30 million raised so far from Marathon, Bain and Bessemer.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong></p>
<p>Get to know the people first and where they are coming from (culturally).</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong></p>
<p>Yes absolutely, big expensive cities will drain talent to their peripheries (not going very far TBH).</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<p>Travel is the obvious answer.</p>
<p>We see a lot of opportunity in software rebuilding, consolidation. There is truly too much software duct taped together. It&#8217;s expensive, difficult to run and creates silos.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong></p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t changed anything really, we just want founders to be able to use exclusively online channels. Companies with a hardware component are more challenged but even they have to innovate on support, which becomes a net positive if/when achieved.<br />
Advise to startups: If you can find money sweep it.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong></p>
<p>Remote work could become a great equalizer or at least give more opportunities to people living far from the big hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong></p>
<p>I think investing in local/geographical ecosystems is not so much about the law/economies of the ecosystem but rather the culture. Actually I was working on an article about that I wanted to share with TC :)</p>
<h2><strong>Dimitris Kalavros-Gousiou, founding partner, Velocity Partners</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Future of work, enterprise software, edtech, AI.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.intelligencia.ai/">Intelligencia.ai</a> — supporting drug discovery with ML and Big Data.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong></p>
<p>Edtech is a hugely untapped market, especially in vertical education and non-English-speaking content.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong></p>
<p>Given the stage we invest in (pre-seed and seed), we are always looking to find founders with a unique perspective, market insights and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong></p>
<p>Although we are an Athens-based fund, we are location-agnostic. Half of our portfolio companies are based overseas, with the majority being in the U.K., where there is a strong community of Greek expats and diaspora.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term?</strong></p>
<p>Given the size of the local market, which is relatively small, I believe by reality our country is better positioned for B2B and enterprise software ventures. The most recent exit of RPA startup Softomotive to Microsoft (May 2020) validates just that. Two companies I&#8217;m excited about are <a href="https://www.intelligencia.ai/">Intelligencia.ai</a>, which helps big pharma companies predict and accelerate clinical development of new drugs, and Netdata. Netdata is an open-source system for monitoring applications, servers, containers and devices in real-time.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong></p>
<p>Greece has recently started to get more traction and headlines in international publications, Softomotive&#8217;s exit as mentioned were good news for the local ecosystem, together with a few up rounds for Athens-based startups such as TileDB, Plum and others.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, as location becomes irrelevant and work-from-anywhere the new standard we expect more founders to emerge from less profound places. Brain-regain will also be a significant driver, as more and more people will go back to their home countries.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<p>Travel tech is profoundly negatively affected by the pandemic and while it&#8217;s really early to tell when and how travel will reemerge, I see little opportunities there for the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong></p>
<p>For our post-revenue investments, cash flow and its impact on runaway is the biggest challenge. Our pre-market, pre-revenue startups are less affected. Fundraising for the next round is a major concern and challenge for all. We strongly recommend continued monitoring and cost-cutting where and if needed. For their fundraising strategies, we recommend raising more money, effectively extending their runway to 18-24 months. In cases where their ideal fundraising scenario is no longer a viable option, we suggest smaller rounds — emergency financing driver primarily by existing investors — that will support the companies until the market is less volatile.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>We are seeing interesting areas for growth as some of our companies decided to partially pivot their core product offering or market segment focus. A great example is <a href="https://www.myjobnow.com/">MyJobNow</a> a local blue-collar marketplace startup. Their initial product was targeting blue-collar workers using classifieds. Just before the COVID pandemic, the company introduced a second product, staffing on-demand service for delivery and last-mile transportation. The product faced significant and accelerated adoption by retail clients and e-commerce ventures as the need for last-mile delivery was significantly and positively affected by the lockdown.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong></p>
<p>Most founders showed a mix of good reflexes, empathy and business clarity during the first months of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong></p>
<p>A key parameter that will greatly affect the next phase of the local scene is for new first-time founders to be able to attract initial angel and pre-seed investment, as access to €50,000-200,000 tickets is still problematic and limited. We need to enhance the investment numbers on this stage in order to enlarge the footprint of the ecosystem and create a strong bottom-up startup funnel.</p>
<h2><strong>Aristos Doxiadis, partner, Big Pi Ventures</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong></p>
<p>I most like to invest in radically better solutions to very basic problems, such as preventing disease, or food provision, or increasing productivity in small firms. This is the social context of the fourth industrial revolution, and where some of the great success stories of the next 10 years will be.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tough choice, but I pick 2bull MeDiTherapy. They have developed a unique blood test for prognosis and diagnosis of aortic aneurysm. These is a very common “silent killer,” that could only be diagnosed up to now by cumbersome and expensive imaging techniques. Once the test gets the required CE mark, we hope it will be widely adopted as a screening method across Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong></p>
<p>In agritech, I haven&#8217;t seen much that would help small farms in rough terrain to increase productivity, secure quality or exploit unique niche varieties. This is potentially a big opportunity in many emerging economies as well as in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong></p>
<p>Ideally, a tool that can solve a fundamental production bottleneck across several industries, and that is based on years of research and has strong IP. An example from our portfolio is Navenio, which has location solution for people and equipment in large indoor spaces, that is infrastructure-free and requires no physical mapping. This has applications in hospitals, shopping malls, logistics centers, railroad stations, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong></p>
<p>We see too many applications for e-commerce and service marketplaces. Most are copycats, but even if there is a new concept somewhere, network effects and economies of scale are prohibitive for almost all new teams.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong></p>
<p>By our mandate, we invest only in companies that have a substantial presence in Greece. This usually means an R&amp;D center and/or product development team. Within Greece we have no specific preference for Athens, our home base, but most of the good deals we see are there.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term?</strong></p>
<p>Greece has strong research teams in biomedical science, and a large number of doctors with international experience and networks. I expect that health tech and medtech will be a big growth sector. Another area is HR tech: Workable (a leading applicant tracking system), Epignosis (learning technology for corporate users) and Bryq (a new bias-free candidate assessment platform) have all started in Athens. The first two already have nine-digit valuations, while Bryq is just taking off.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong></p>
<p>The greatest advantage of Athens and some other Greek cities is the number of highly skilled Greeks in their thirties, who are working in technology or research in the rest of Europe and are looking to return home. Tech employers can easily attract such talent if they offer an exciting and/or well-paid job. These experienced people can train many of the excellent engineering and science grads that come out of local universities. Almost every company in our portfolio has done this. Investment climate is also rapidly improving under the current government, especially for knowledge industries, via various tax incentives, but also by encouraging the research community to open up to business.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I expect that, and we are already seeing this in Greece, as one of the places of origin of such founders, but also as a destination for talent that is leaving expensive and crowded cities.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<p>Travel and hospitality will be hurt. Big Pi has not invested in the sector (by chance, not by design) but some very good Greek teams were in there, and inevitably some will have to move to other things. Great opportunities arise in remote provision of sophisticated services (health, entertainment, education and also equipment maintenance and repair).</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong></p>
<p>There have been delays in enterprise sales, and in the supply chain for hardware products. We have set aside capital to support longer runways, but beyond that we don&#8217;t anticipate much damage. Our advice to founders is to focus all resources on achieving targets that will enable them to raise the next equity round.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong></p>
<p>The Greek government designed and implemented in record time a logistics system for COVID vaccines, and, most impressively, a very user-friendly appointment platform for the vaccinations that is working seamlessly. For a state that until recently was very slow and inefficient, this was a great leap ahead and bodes well for future digital public services.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally?</strong></p>
<p>All six VC teams that were funded by Equifund in 2018 have done a very good job (Marathon, Venture Friends, Uni.Fund, Metavallon, Velocity and Big Pi) and have given a big boost to the ecosystem. Founders from Greek diaspora have been instrumental (e.g., Stavros Papadopoulos of TileDB, Vergetis and Skaltsas of Intelligencia, Masouras of Saphetor).</p>
<h2><strong>Pavlos Pavlakis, principal, VentureFriends</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong></p>
<p>Proptech, fintech and marketplace models, interested in both B2C and B2B startups.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.influ2.com/">Influ2</a> (Person Based Marketing startup — B2B SaaS).</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong></p>
<p>Some investors shy away from capital intensive models e.g., that need a lot of debt fundraising and many prefer B2B SaaS startups. We like B2C a lot, we like operational plays i.e., not pure tech necessarily, plus we are comfortable with models that require a lot of debt raising in parallel to equity.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong></p>
<p>Founders with global aspirations that execute well a scalable model. The team and the market size are the two most important factors, and then a number of other factors: competition, timing/market trend, short- and long-term defensibility/USP, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong></p>
<p>Many markets/areas are oversaturated or would be too hard to compete — this however can vary on geography as well e.g., we have seen some great opportunities in LatAm for example that are &#8220;copy cats&#8221; of other models.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong></p>
<p>The local ecosystem is always a priority. Also apart from local startups we are looking for Greek founders across the globe e.g., recently invested in a U.S.-based Greek founder. However given the size of our fund and opportunities out there we do not restrict our investments only in the local ecosystem. So far more than 50% has been in the local ecosystem (company or founder) however because we are an international (European mostly) VC more and more of our investments are from outside of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term?</strong></p>
<p>Blueground is a great example that we are excited about. It is a proptech portfolio company of VentureFriends. It is a Greek company that we were first institutional investors in. Blueground has expanded globally (13 cities in U.S., Europe and Middle East) and raised more than $100 million so far.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong></p>
<p>Athens and Greece in general is definitely an up-and-coming market. Each year there are more and large success stories that inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs. Capital availability is no longer a large issue (given the presence of multiple funds) and Greek has great and relatively cheap human capital — and great weather :)</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong></p>
<p>I do not necessarily expect this kind of change i.e., more founders coming from geographies outside major cities. However Greek talent — as mentioned, relatively cheap while of high quality plus the surge of remote work — indeed has created more demand and an increase in certain wages (e.g., developers).</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<p>Travel tech is by far the most exposed vertical. In terms of opportunities given that startups are incumbents and digital solutions typically most verticals can present opportunities. Some obvious ones are edtech, delivery/logistic solutions, e-commerce, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong></p>
<p>No major change in our investment strategy whatsoever. Only slight change would be not to pursue travel tech opportunities (even though it depends on a case by case basis — we were very close in investing in a new startup in this sector amid the pandemic — they were doing amazingly well :) The advice to startups that are impacted is to weather the storm by trying to be cautious on burn on the one hand, but preserve as much as possible and build/work on things they have now more time to do so (housekeeping, product, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, many if not most of them! Apart from our travel tech startups all others have grown in 2020 and recovered from the first major wave of the pandemic. Some specific ones from our portfolio even tippled in size (benefited from the pandemic) — this is the example of InstaShop that was sold to Delivery Hero for $360 million in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong></p>
<p>Even though 2020 was an extremely bad year on a health and economic basis, life goes on and many friends and family are getting married, having babies. I became an uncle for the third time, so there are some very happy and hopeful parts of life always.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally?</strong></p>
<p>Founders are by far the most important ones, and then investors are important to support and finance them. But without founders there is nothing :) Blueground, Beat, eFood, Workable, Softomotive, Skroutz, Epignosis and of course InstaShop are some great examples with successful founders who have played an important role in inspiring the ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong></p>
<p>There seems to be a general move from U.S. to Europe and from Europe to Eastern Europe, and from there to emerging markets e.g., LatAm and Asia. Undiscovered and less competitive ecosystems that are on the rise, like Greece, are expected to play a more significant role in the years to come :) We are excited about this.</p>
<h2><strong>Yorgos Mousmoulas, partner, Metavallon</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong></p>
<p>Data/AI/analytics; renewable tech; mostly B2B.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://valktech.io/">Valk</a>, a secure platform for trading unlisted assets on the Corda blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong></p>
<p>Great team; proprietary, defensible technology; first signs of traction.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong></p>
<p>Marketplaces, B2C, food delivery, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong></p>
<p>About 50%. We also invest heavily in startups elsewhere in Europe (and beyond) having some connection to Greece, e.g., founders/investors/advisors, or having it among its target markets.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term?</strong></p>
<p>Maritime; anything related to data and analytics.</p>

<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong></p>
<p>This is a rapidly growing ecosystem with quite a few exits in the past year (including our portfolio company Think Silicon, acquired by <a href="https://metavallon.vc/blog/think-silicon-acquired-by-applied-materials/">Applied Materials</a>. We&#8217;re starting to see the familiar pattern of second-generation founders from the first-generation success stories. Connections to a worldwide diaspora are a strong plus. Operating/personnel costs are low for same quality.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people from the Greek diaspora are basing themselves in Greece again, as they realize they can work from anywhere; also starting to attract international tech workers due to favorable climate, low costs, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<p>Tourism; anything requiring on-premises presence.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong></p>
<p>We have continued to invest at the same pace, are just more cautious/selective vis-a-vis impacted sectors e.g., tourism, transportation. We have supported portfolio companies as needed with bridge rounds, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. <a href="https://creatorup.com/">CreatorUp</a> is doing tech-enabled remote video training and are seeing tremendous revenue growth under the circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong></p>
<p>Some of our companies continuing to close follow-on rounds, despite the COVID climate. Even in adversely affected sectors like tourism — that&#8217;s validation of the fundamental soundness of their business model.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally?</strong></p>
<p>The NBG Seeds initiative by National Bank of Greece is a major organizer of events, get-togethers, etc. helping startups in the very early stages achieve some visibility — and not just in the major couple of cities.</p>
<h2><strong>Myrto Papathanou, founding partner, Metavallon</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong></p>
<p>We mainly invest in early-stage B2B companies and are sector agnostic. Over 80% of our portfolio is from companies developing proprietary [technology] mainly using ML, AI, cloud, SaaS and analytics. So far we have invested in health, energy, security, logistics, media and enterprise software and tools companies.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong></p>
<p>We just closed a follow on round led by Berlin-based Fly Ventures for one of our portcos, Better Origin. The bio startup is Cambridge- and Athens-based and developing the world’s first insect minifarm that converts local food waste into high-quality animal feed in the form of insect larvae. It’s solution combines automation and AI to replicate nature’s recycling system. Following impressive client demand, the recent funding will accelerate its operations and deploy their scalable solution to hundreds of farms across the U.K. and the world. We are very excited about what the company is developing and how fast they are progressing.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong></p>
<p>Europe and Greece in particular are amazing places to develop deep companies. The highly qualified and loyal workforce, value for money engineering, availability of nondilutive finance and newly introduced product skills, business acumen and entrepreneurial ambition are making it an exciting place for B2B startups. I would like to see more startups tackling energy and sustainability problems through technology, I think there is opportunity and the right momentum.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for articulate, highly qualified engineers with a business acumen that can execute. Founders that have deep expertise in an industry and have identified the broken elements that their technology can disrupt.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong></p>
<p>On the B2C space, where we are not active, it seems that there are many teams working on very narrow, niche problems. Even if successful, a lot of those in my humble opinion are very hard to create significant VC-type returns.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong></p>
<p>We are very focused on Greece and also believe there is an amazing opportunity in the diaspora. People who left the country last decade, gained experience and know-how from other markets and are now seeing the opportunity to start their technology companies back home.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term?</strong></p>
<p>We are excited about Athens-based Useberry, Prosperty and Loctio.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong></p>
<p>The landscape for technology startups and investment in Greece has completely changed the last three years. The value of exits and unrealized value quadrupled in 2020 alone and there is great momentum at the moment. The presence of early-stage VCs on the ground also helps in terms of access to initial finance, validation of the business model and its scalability and a global outlook of the businesses. At Metavallon we are happy to have already co-invested with 20+ VCs, local, regional and international and over 40 angels, usually with vertical expertise and strategic interest in our portcos. There is still a lot of space. Finally some companies created last decade are scaling up and adding to the virtuous cycle of introducing previously missing skills, like product and biz dev and sales ops, in the market. The entire southeast of Europe is an overlooked market, which international investors are now waking up to.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, for two reasons. First, the world is now flatter and access to capital and talent is location independent, as long as the technology built has global relevance. The pandemic has in fact created a mini-brain gain in Greece, with technology professionals coming back here and getting involved in startups as founders, executives and investors. Second, access to global talent and efficient remote work are making it hard to justify the costs mainly in human capital, but also peripheral like professional services and even real estate, that the traditional hubs demand. So I expect to see a surge in companies coming up from previously looked over locations.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<p>Hospitality and travel are in for the long game in terms of weathering the effects of the pandemic. These sectors will need patient capital and a prolongment of their business plans. We were impressed to see one of our portcos, Ferry Hopper, that runs a ferry booking engine switch its operations overnight during the pandemic to focus on local customers and commuters as opposed to tourists. These companies will need quick reflexes and adaptability.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong></p>
<p>We have had little impact in our investment strategy as we did not focus on B2C. In a way, investment in very early stages is affected the least as time to a large extend is spent on product and getting to product-market fit. Founders were initially worried about their runway and access to capital, a fear that didn’t really materialize. There is an opportunity on the business development side for B2B companies as clients have more urgency to digitalize, innovate and improve efficiencies. We are asking our companies to stay focused, keep an ear to the ground and their customers and be ready to adapt.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>With the exception of the first two months of the pandemic, retention and growth have not seemed so problematic. What we are seeing in cases are longer cycles in B2B sales, especially when clients are larger corporations in industry, health or the financial sector.</p>

<h2><strong>George Dimopoulos, founding partner, VentureFriends </strong></h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong></p>
<p>Proptech, fintech, B2C and travel tech.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong></p>
<p>Spotawheel, an online used car sales business! First team of this category to have expanded successfully to a second market (Greece and Poland).</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong></p>
<p>I wish I was able to see more fintech and especially insurtech startups coming from Greece. Insurance is a space that is long overdue for disruption.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong></p>
<p>Amazing team, huge market and a product that solves an actual problem i.e., the company to be able to offer a &#8220;must-have&#8221; type of solutions not &#8220;nice to have.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong></p>
<p>It would be really hard to compete for a hardware startup since we don&#8217;t have the necessary background knowledge/expertise and our goal is not to bring just our checkbook at the table. We want to utilize our network, know-how and past experience for every investment we are being involved.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong></p>
<p>As VentureFriends we are quite an outward-looking team having team members in other ecosystems also (U.K. and Poland). We will continue supporting Greek startups since we can&#8217;t afford to miss out on an amazing company from our own backyard but we will be investing actively across Europe and opportunistically even outside of Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term?</strong></p>
<p>We are big fans of B2C companies. Greek founders have demonstrated that they can use the Greek market as a sandbox and then expand internationally to bigger markets. <a href="https://www.theblueground.com/">Blueground</a> (Greece, Turkey, UAE, USA) and <a href="https://www.spotawheel.gr/">Spotawheel</a> (Greece, Poland) are just two recent examples.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong></p>
<p>I wrote the first check as an angel back in 2011 to a Greek startup. Back then a round of $200,000 or an exit at $10 million was a big deal. Today these round sizes or exits below $50 million are not even raising an eyebrow. The aspirations and the confidence of Greek founders have changed dramatically, fueled by big rounds and quite notable exits that have taken place over the last couple of years. We believe that we are only a couple of years away from the first Greek unicorn!</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong></p>
<p>Not really. When it comes to the Greek ecosystem I think that the main 2-3 hubs will continue to churn out the majority of exciting and interesting Greek companies. The pandemic will be just a bad memory in 1-2 years from now. The need to surround yourself with other driven and capable people and the obvious benefits that come with this, will pretty much pull founders and talent at the cities where already there is a vibrant/active startup community. In the case of Greece these cities are Athens, Thessaloniki and Patra.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<p>Travel tech has been and continues to be of interest to us. As you can imagine it has been hit very hard over the last year. We do believe though, that as soon as a meaningful percentage of the population gets vaccinated and life returns back to normal, travel will resume. First for leisure and eventually even for business reasons. The people who will have managed to weather these difficult 2019-2020 years will benefit a lot!</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong></p>
<p>COVID-19 hasn&#8217;t really impacted our investment strategy. Investing in startups at seed stage is a quite long-term type of investment and commitment. Even if a company as we speak is facing some difficulties, the way we approach it in order to evaluate it is by looking at how the company will perform in a more stable environment and/or in a steady state.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>Somehow our portfolio seemed to have achieved a natural hedge. Indeed we had some companies that faced some difficult times while we had some others that were growing by high double-digit percentages month over month. The most obvious example was InstaShop (groceries on demand), our UAE investment into Greek founders where we saw the company triple in size in a matter of months and eventually bringing forward by 2-3 years our exit to Delivery Hero for $360 million.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong></p>
<p>The exit of InstaShop to Delivery Hero for $360 million for sure has been the highlight of this year for us. It pretty much launched us to another level both as a fund and to an extent as a Greek ecosystem since it has set the precedent for current and future founders and has cemented the belief that a Greek team can indeed register a big international success.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong></p>
<p>The local office of Endeavor is definitely a group of people who someone must be connected to. They are very well-connected across the ecosystem of startup and with players of the traditional economy. They can really add value to a young company that is seeking ways to get in touch with more traditional business people.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong></p>
<p>If someone had told me in January 2019 that end of 2019 and the whole 2020-2021 we would be dealing with a pandemic, I would probably have tried to find a way to get access to antidepressants. However here we are today sort of getting a glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel. On a global level, I think that overall governments and central banks have managed the situation better than expected and given the situation we are doing OK. On a more regional level, Greece beat expectations in terms of managing the pandemic while supporting the economy. We have had an excellent performance during the first wave and now during the second wave we are among the countries with the lower cases/population. The government has launched 4-5 rounds of supporting initiatives while also making Greece an attractive investment destination for direct investments. All these are very promising of what to expect from this country when things somehow normalize.</p>

<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong></p>
<p>Tourism/hospitality has turned into a problematic sector these days — also most of the marketplace find it difficult to maintain customer traction.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong></p>
<p>Well above 50% due to the nature of the funds under management (80% comes from GR structural funds and the EIF). Exception is companies founded abroad from members of the Greek diaspora, or they have/want to build some kind of activity in Greece.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong></p>
<p>Everything that has to do with logistics, remote collaboration and training, health tech, as well as fintech.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong></p>
<p>An ecosystem in an early accelerating growth stage with good quality of technical skills.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<p>Tourism/hospitality, marketplaces. I believe founders should focus now more than ever on real/needs and problems.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong></p>
<p>The concern is how difficult it would be to close rounds in this business environment. so far, we have made it, but as the crisis is prolonged it becomes more of a challenge. The advice is to start fundraising as soon as possible with more than usual reserves/runway.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>Yes — SaaS/cloud companies, health tech and digital productions companies are doing great.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong></p>
<p>That we managed to have an exit and close one seed and two Series A rounds within the pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, already happening.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<p>Travel and tourism for sure. E-commerce and new service models from the positive direction.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong></p>
<p>We were following a “cash-flow positive growth” strategy already before COVID and COVID had little impact on our portfolio. Some companies were seriously affected but turned this into an opportunity by unlocking new revenue streams. The overall sentiment among all our founders has been positive. Total portfolio revenues have increased by 4x since the start and 2x during COVID.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>We foresee a 5x revenue increase in the total portfolio in 2021, mainly driven by six companies.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong></p>
<p>Significant contracts (of above $1 million value) signed by two companies, term sheet of above $1 million rejected, buy-out offer rejected, partial exit to a multinational consulting company of a small portion for great value, significant traction entering the U.S. market.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong></p>
<p>Apostolos Apostolakis, Marco Veremis, Sotiris Papantonopoulos, Aristos Doxiadis, George Karantonis, myself for my role around universities and the research space, Angeliki Karagiannaki, Spyros Arsenis, Roula Bachtalia, George Nounesis, Dimitris Tsingos.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong></p>
<p>Greece is now developing its startup ecosystem and there is great momentum in the country. Apart from great people with high skills, big smiles and resilience, the country offers ideal conditions for the new model of working from home (sea, sun, great food and, hopefully soon after the pandemic, culture).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/apostolosapostolakis/">Apostolos Apostolakis</a>, Partner, <a href="http://VentureFriends.vc">VentureFriends</a></h3>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Passion economy, better UX and data-driven fintech products, e-commerce enablement. Across all the sectors we look at, I&#8217;m most interested in models that take the friction out of everyday life, whether that&#8217;s removing paper, automating or increasing transparency.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Influ2 (a Ukrainian/US company vastly improving the enterprise b2b marketing process), Byrd, Spotawheel.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
A version of Kuaishou adjusted for Western markets could be really interesting. Popshop is trying in the US. Mortgages are still terrible, we haven&#8217;t seen much innovation aside from better brokers (like Habito). Ideally I want a service that knows my financial health, the property I&#8217;m buying etc and then creates a product for me. Nobody has solved talent sourcing and management, the amount of effort that goes into hiring, applying for jobs and retention is insane.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Creation of a long term moat and scalability. The classic: strong founder-product-market fit.<br />
In general we are founder driven:  we look for founders who have wild ambition coupled with strong capacities and character.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We invest around 50% in our local Greek ecosystem and the balance in rest of Europe . One of our team members is based in London and we look to have team members in Poland and Spain/Portugal</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not long-term?</strong><br />
It all depends on the founders and their drive. Capital and experience exist. I am very excited about Blueground and Spotawheel as they have the potential to create strong European players.</p>
<p><strong>What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Software startups can start anywhere and when a local market is needed Greece has a decent size to serve as a test market for most use cases. Some startups I am very excited about are Blueground (Alexandros Chatzieleftheriou), Plum (Victor Trokoudis), Spotawheel (Charis Arvanitis), Epignosis, (Thanos Papangelis) Skroutz (George Chatzigeorgiou).</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
The local ecosystem is thriving. We always had well-educated and restless people but now they are also willing to take the risk to startup. There have been some major successes lately: The sale of Instashop for 360mil$  (the largest greek startup exit up to now), was by far the most important event that broke the glass ceiling and upped founder expectations.  Additionally, the sale of Softomotive to Microsoft for around 150mil$, the CVC investment in Skroutz, and the sale of think silicon to Applied materials were also very positive data points of a market that is quickly growing.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I believe that strong startup hubs, in general, will retain their allure. Covid will go away eventually and people will still want to live and work near other like-minded people. However, there are two trends that also favor the emergence of new startup hubs. Remote work, which will remain appealing for some people, is a trend that supports the decision of people to move to eg South Europe to work from there. On top of that, we have the emergence of more cities that have a vibrant local tech ecosystem. We already see this is cities like Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon and lately in Athens where there are now many more promising startups able to attract talent. That increase in local startup activity creates opportunities for people to move and combine the sun and culture of say Athens with work at a promising startup and being around other like-minded people.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Obviously, travel startups will hurt. It is an opportunity for b2b startups to excel in content creation and digital sales. Remote work means managing processes and culture remotely. That creates a wide spectrum of issues to be tackled</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
We never stopped being aggressive and invest. There is no bad time for investing in great founders solving large and clear problems. Similarly, the advice to our startups is to think of what happens after this short term disruption.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or another momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
We definitely do. Apart from travel startups that are still feeling the pain, most other companies have resumed their growth trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The main humbling moment for me was to see the grit people if affected startups showed during the dark hours of this crisis during Spring 2020. As a second note,  the vaccine has given me hope of a return to normality.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
We were already living in an era where technology was transforming, mostly improving, our lives. What we went through just accelerated the pace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture funds have historically counted on several types of limited partners &#8212; or LPs &#8212; for their own investing capital. One of these groups is institutional investors &#8212; think pension funds, university endowments, hospital systems and the like. Another is corporations. A third bucket centers on wealthy individuals and often their <a href="https://www.svb.com/blogs/barry-obrien/the-rise-of-the-family-office">family offices</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fairly small universe, in other words, but two new initiatives, both announced this week and both very different, are looking to change the equation &#8212; and could usher in similar efforts soon.</p>
<p>Arlan Hamilton came out with her news first. Hamilton is the founder of <a href="https://backstagecapital.com/">Backstage Capital</a>, a venture firm focused on investing in startups founded by people of color, women, and members of the LGBTQ community. In short, diversity is at Backstage&#8217;s very core. But Hamilton, who is herself Black, isn&#8217;t interested in funding diverse founders alone; she is also interested in enabling more people from diverse backgrounds &#8212; including socioeconomically &#8212; to invest in venture capital as an asset class.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Toward that end, earlier this week, on the private investing platform Republic, she opened a new fund that anyone &#8212; including unaccredited investors &#8212; could back under a Securities and Exchange Commission rule called Reg CF, or Regulation Crowdfunding.</p>
<p>Hamilton hit the upper boundary of what Reg CF allows an outfit to raise &#8212; $1,070,000 within a 12-month period &#8212; in what seemed like hours from 2,790 investors who were invited to invest as little as $100. But more could be coming. The reason why: that rule <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-273">underwent a change in November</a> under former SEC chair Jay Clayton, and will next month begin allowing outfits to crowdsource up to $5 million.</p>
<p>The process could be slowed down by the incoming SEC chief. President Biden has appointed former regulator and former Goldman partner Gary Gensler, who must now receive Senate confirmation. The new administration is also<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/regulatory-freeze-pending-review/"> reviewing</a> many of the measures moved along late in the Trump administration. If it&#8217;s all systems go, however, it&#8217;s easy to imagine more unaccredited investors being invited to fund other, and larger, venture funds soon.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity knocking</strong></p>
<p>A second initiative this week has similar objectives to Hamilton &#8212; bringing more diverse investors into the ranks of LPs &#8212; though it has a different approach and it&#8217;s targeting accredited investors only, which basically means individuals who are earning $200,000 a year and/or have a net worth of $1 million or more.</p>
<p>Launched by <a href="https://acrewcapital.com/">Acrew Capital</a> &#8212; a Palo Alto- and San Francisco-based early-stage venture spearheaded by veteran VC Theresia Gouw &#8212; the firm <a href="https://money.yahoo.com/fund-aims-diverse-investors-opportunity-130000890.html">revealed yesterday </a>that it&#8217;s currently raising a traditional growth-stage fund with a twist. In addition to giving its current LPs a crack at investing in the new fund, it is also opening the vehicle up to more women, people of color, and underrepresented individuals who may not have had a chance previously to invest in a later-stage private vehicle.</p>
<p>The key here is Acrew&#8217;s emphasis on growth-stage investing. While more women and people of color are breaking into the ranks of seed-stage investing, it takes a long time to make money with early-stage funding. Meanwhile, growth-stage funds are more exclusive because the companies they back are closer to an &#8220;exit&#8221; typically. That makes them very appealing to institutions &#8212; including mutual funds and hedge funds &#8212; and doesn&#8217;t leave much, if any, room for the kinds of individuals who Acrew now hopes to bring into the fold.</p>
<p>Like Backstage, diversity is in the DNA of Acrew, which Gouw cofounded with Lauren Kolodny, Vishal Lugani, Asad Khaliq, and Mark Kraynak, colleagues from their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/16/aspect-ventures-founded-by-theresia-gouw-and-jennifer-fonstad-is-splitting-up">previous fund</a>, Aspect Ventures.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s little surprise that the firm &#8212; which says 88% of its overall team is female and 63% comes from underrepresented backgrounds &#8212;  would be the first to publicly focus on pulling more diverse angel investors, board members, and C-level execs into the world of later-stage deals.</p>
<p>Like Backstage, which gets fresh capital to invest through its new effort, the new effort of Acrew &#8212; which focuses largely on fintech and cybersecurity, and which has a stake in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/chime-adds-485m-at-a-14-5b-valuation-claims-ebitda-profitability/">highly valued</a> challenger bank Chime, among many others others &#8212; is both inclusive and strategic.</p>
<p>As Kolodny explains it, a growing number of startups is focused on enhancing diversity in the board room, and having a diverse LP base of individuals who it can connect with interesting board roles is likely to work out well for everyone involved, from Acrew to the companies to its new LPs.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s an approach that Acrew&#8217;s partners hope won&#8217;t distinguish the firm for long, says Kolodny. &#8220;Our hope is that five years from now, a venture firm helping companies to add diverse independent board members and diverse executives won&#8217;t be a unique strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hope,&#8221; she adds, &#8220;is [this effort] gets people to embrace a new standard around what is what is expected of venture firms.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Pictured above: the members of Acrew Capital who are part of its first growth fund, which it has dubbed its Diversity Capital Fund.</em></p>

<p>This comes after the military staged a coup in Myanmar to take power from the civilian government. The new government claims that Twitter and Instagram were being abused to spread propaganda and misinformation, posing a threat to the country&#8217;s stability.</p>
<p>Telenor Group, one of the country&#8217;s largest telecom providers, said in a statement that it is &#8220;gravely concerned with this development in Myanmar&#8221; and that &#8220;freedom of expression through access to communication services should be maintained at all times, especially during times of conflict.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I've never used "stonkathon" in a headline before, but it's been that kind of week.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Demo days at startup accelerators are a pretty big deal around here.</p>
<p>These events aren&#8217;t just a chance to review the latest cohort of hopeful entrepreneurs — they also showcase the technology, products and services that will compete for VC and consumer attention over the next few years.</p>
<p>You never know where a hit will come from, which is why these events capture our attention. Here&#8217;s just one example from Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2013 Demo Day:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Positioning itself as the “FedEx of today,” it hopes to provide a logistics framework that goes beyond food and can be used for any type of on-demand order.</p></blockquote>
<p>That startup was DoorDash, by the way.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: In 2016, I was 500 Startups&#8217; Journalist-in-residence. I covered one demo day in person, spending most of my time backstage where founder teams practiced their pitches.</p>
<p>It was quite a scene: Several people literally jumped up and down to shake off their nervous energy, but I also recall one who calmly recited their lines while gazing through a window.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jon Shieber and Alex Wilhelm covered 500 Startups&#8217; 27th virtual demo day and selected eight companies as their favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stack</li>
<li>Adapty</li>
<li>MightyFly</li>
<li>Omnitron Sensors</li>
<li>AWSM</li>
<li>Memechat</li>

<p>I&#8217;ve never used &#8220;stonkathon&#8221; in a headline before, but it&#8217;s been that kind of week.</p>
<p>The war between hedge funds and day traders over GameStop vaulted discount trader Robinhood into the headlines for days.</p>
<p>But how did it affect the company&#8217;s financial health?</p>
<p>This morning, Alex Wilhelm examined why Robinhood&#8217;s investors were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/how-the-gamestop-stonkathon-helped-robinhood-raise-3-4b-last-week/">willing to inject $3.4 billion more into the company</a> in just one week.</p>
<p>&#8220;More trades means more PFOF (payment for order flow) revenue,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;And Robinhood effectively doubled in size.&#8221;</p>

<p>Deep tech founders face special challenges when pitching investors: they usually don&#8217;t have a product, customers or revenue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult enough to ask a stranger for a check when there&#8217;s a beta product, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/4-strategies-for-deep-tech-founders-who-are-fundraising/">how do you drum up interest in an unproven idea</a> that may exist largely in your imagination?</p>
<p>&#8220;Early-stage investors are in the business of funding dreams,&#8221; says angel investor Jessica Li.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors are less interested in the intricacies of your technology and more interested in what impact it can create.&#8221;</p>
<p>Step one: use storytelling to highlight your big vision.</p>

<h2 class="article__title">Subscription-based pricing is dead: Smart SaaS companies are shifting to usage-based models</h2>

<p>Some IT managers may still be debating the merits of usage-based pricing versus subscription-based models, but SaaS investors have made up their minds.</p>
<p>Compared to their rivals, companies that employ usage-based pricing trade at a 50% revenue multiple premium. You can argue with success, but seven out of the nine IPOs since 2018 with the best net dollar retention offer usage-based models.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a founder who hopes to break into the $100M ARR club, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">this guest post</a> can help you identify the right usage metrics for creating a sustainable customer journey.</p>

<p>Managing Editor Danny Crichton says this &#8220;explosion of creativity and expressiveness and operational latitude&#8221; offers widespread benefits, but it&#8217;s &#8220;also a recipe for disaster,&#8221; since many end users aren&#8217;t well-trained when it comes to using these tools.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, flexible workspace operator (and one-time unicorn) Knotel announced it had filed for bankruptcy and that its assets were </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newmark-to-acquire-assets-of-knotel-301218584.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being acquired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by investor and commercial real estate brokerage Newmark for</span><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/knotel-approved-to-borrow-initial-30-million-on-bankruptcy-loan"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a reported $70 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knotel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">designed, built and ran custom headquarters for companies. It then managed the spaces with “flexible” terms. In March 2020, it was reportedly </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/03/27/knotel-a-wework-rival-valued-at-16-billion-lets-go-half-of-its-staff/?sh=7d4d46f166c2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">valued at $1.6 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first glance, one might think that the WeWork rival, which had raised about $560 million since its 2016 inception, was another casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But New York-based Knotel was reportedly in trouble &#8212; facing a number of lawsuits and evictions &#8212; before the pandemic had even hit, according to multiple reports, such as this one in </span><a href="https://therealdeal.com/national/2021/02/01/knotel-files-for-bankruptcy-set-to-be-bought-by-newmark/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Real Deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, some industry observers believe the company’s Chapter 11 filing was inevitable despite it </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/workspace-provider-knotel-secures-400m-putting-it-in-weworks-rear-view-mirror/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reaching unicorn status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after raising $400 million in Series C funding in August 2019.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="d95fizmtnb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/workspace-provider-knotel-secures-400m-putting-it-in-weworks-rear-view-mirror/">Workspace provider Knotel secures $400M, putting it in WeWork&#8217;s rear-view mirror</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Workspace provider Knotel secures $400M, putting it in WeWork&#8217;s rear-view mirror&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/workspace-provider-knotel-secures-400m-putting-it-in-weworks-rear-view-mirror/embed/#?secret=d95fizmtnb" data-secret="d95fizmtnb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newmark’s purchase of Knotel’s assets is believed to an effort to recoup some of its investment, according to Jonathan Pasternak, bankruptcy attorney and p<span lang="EN-US">artner at New York-based Davidoff </span><span lang="EN-US">Hutcher</span><span lang="EN-US"> &amp; Citron</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anytime a company that has raised more than half a billion dollars basically implodes, it’s worth taking a look at the roller coaster ride it was on before it got to that point.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>2016</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virgin Mobile co-founder Amol Sarva and former VC Edward Shenderovich founded Knotel, essentially </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reversing the WeWork model. There&#8217;s hype around the company in its early days.</span></p>
<h3>2017</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knotel raised a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/22/knotel-series-a/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Series A round of $25 million </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in February from investors such as Peak State Ventures, Invest AG, Bloomberg Beta and 500 startups. It marketed its offering as “headquarters as a service” — or a flexible office space that could be customized for each tenant while also growing or shrinking as needed. </span></p>

<h3>2018</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, Knotel a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nnounced the close of a $70 million Series B financing led by Newmark Knight Frank and The Sapir Organization. In August, the company </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/flexible-workplace-startups-clamor-to-give-companies-an-alternative-to-wework/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told me</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it was operating over 1 million square feet across 60 locations in New York, London, San Francisco and Berlin, and that it was on track to reach 2.5 million square feet and $100 million in revenue by year’s end. Revenue growth had increased by 300% year over year, according to the company. Customers and users and clients ranged from VC-backed startups Stash and HotelTonight to enterprise customers such as The Body Shop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What they’re doing is different,” said Barry Gosin, CEO of Newmark Knight Frank, in a press release, at the time of the round. “It’s a new category the industry hasn’t seen and is rapidly adopting. We’ve watched their ascent from a distance and are now thrilled to join them on the journey. It marks a shift in how owners and tenants are coming together.”</span></p>
<h2>2019</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knotel announced the completion of a $400 million financing, led by Wafra, an investment arm of the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Kuwait. With the round, the company had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/workspace-provider-knotel-secures-400m-putting-it-in-weworks-rear-view-mirror/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">achieved unicorn status </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and was being touted as a formidable WeWork competitor. At the time, Knotel said it operated more than 4 million square feet across more than 200 locations in New York, San Francisco, London, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Paris, Berlin, Toronto, Boston, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement at the time, CEO Sarva said: “Knotel is building the future of the workplace, and we are excited to welcome a group of investors who believe passionately in our product, vision and ability to execute. Wafra will help us continue our rapid global expansion and solidify our position as the leader in a fast-growing, trillion-dollar flexible office market.”</span></p>
<h2>2020</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In late March, Forbes </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/03/27/knotel-a-wework-rival-valued-at-16-billion-lets-go-half-of-its-staff/?sh=7d4d46f166c2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knotel had laid off 30% of its workforce and furloughed another 20%, due to the impact of the coronavirus. At the time, it was valued at about $1.6 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company had started the year with about 500 employees. By the third week of March, it had a headcount of 400. With the cuts, about 200 employees remained with the other 200 having either lost their jobs or on unpaid leave, according to Forbes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Business as usual is over,” Amol Sarva, Knotel’s CEO and co-founder, said in a statement to Forbes. “Knotel has decided to take sharp action to prepare for the worst case — a long health and economic crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the second quarter, Knotel’s revenue slipped by about 20% to about $59 million compared to the first quarter, reported Forbes. Multiple landlords had filed </span><a href="https://therealdeal.com/la/2020/05/13/knotel-no-pay-lawsuit-says-company-broke-profit-sharing-agreement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By July, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes had reported that Knotel was attempting to raise as much as $100 million, according to various sources “familiar with the matter.”</span></p>
<h2>2021</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knotel </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newmark-to-acquire-assets-of-knotel-301218584.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">files for bankruptcy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, agrees to sell assets to investor Newmark for a reported $70 million after being valued at $1.6 billion less than one year prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Newmark&#8217;s commitment offers a path forward amidst this challenging climate,&#8221; CEO Sarva said in a statement. &#8220;We are optimistic that, through a successful restructuring, we can refocus on our mission of providing state-of-the-art, tailored flex space in key U.S. and international markets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To facilitate the transaction under Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, an affiliate of Newmark agreed to provide Knotel with about $20 million in cash as DIP financing to support Knotel through the bankruptcy process.</span></p>
<p>Just as the startup and VC world watched as WeWork lost a significant amount of value over the past two years, we&#8217;re paying attention to the demise of Knotel and wondering what this means for the flexible workspace sector. As much of the world continues to work from home and office buildings remain mostly vacant as this pandemic rages, our guess is that things will only get worse before they get better.</p>
