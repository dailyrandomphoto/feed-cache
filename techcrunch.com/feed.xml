										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Capital Float, an Amazon-backed startup that offers its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/capital-float-walnut/">buy now, pay later service</a> on many popular online platforms in India including that of the e-commerce firm, said on Tuesday it has raised $50 million in a new financing round following a strong growth in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Lightrock India led the Bangalore-based startup’s Series D financing round, which brings the seven-year-old firm’s all-time raise to over $200 million (more than half of which is in debt). Existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Creation Investments as well as high-profile entrepreneurs David Vélez of Nubank, Kunal Shah of CRED and Amrish Rau of Pine Labs also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>Capital Float reaches customers through partnerships with other firms. It’s a lending partner for many popular online platforms including Amazon India, online learning service Unacademy, airline Spicejet, direct-to-consumers lifestyle and electronics brand Boat and travel booking firm MakeMyTrip. Their customers can make their purchases via a loan at the time of check out, explained Sashank Rishyasringa, co-founder of the startup, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The startup also has partnerships with payments firm Razorpay to reach small and medium-sized businesses and with Walnut to offer personal finance to customers.</p>
<p>Capital Float has amassed over 2.5 million customers. These customers, who make over 2 million purchases a month, are using the service to finance over $271 million a year, the startup said. Most of the startup’s focus over the year has been in the online space, said Rishyasringa.</p>
<p>“Our customer base has more than quadrupled in the last 12 months, and our collection efficiency was still more than 95% during this period when many other firms were witnessing a drop,” he said.</p>

<p>The buy now, pay later market remains at a nascent stage in India, where only a fraction of the population has a credit card. But a handful of startups including Capital Float, ZestMoney and LazyPay are beginning to show traction in the market.</p>
<p>The low penetration of credit cards in India has meant that very few people in the nation have a traditional credit score that banks heavily rely on to establish one’s credit worthiness before issuing them a loan. Moreover, small loans don’t generate lucrative returns for banks, giving them less incentive to write such cheques.</p>
<p>Half of Capital Float&#8217;s user base today doesn&#8217;t have a credit card, said Rishyasringa. Capital Float, unlike many other buy now, pay later services, is a fully regulated entity. This means that the firm has to report to the credit bureaus about users&#8217; transactions, thereby helping them with building their credit score profiles.</p>
<p>The startup underwrites each customer by using a range of signals. The underwriting takes place &#8220;within two clicks and five seconds,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>“Capital Float has solved the unique triumvirate of customer experience, risk management, and merchant partnerships that lies at the heart of unlocking the BNPL opportunity in India. In addition to its strong technology platform, it has built a sophisticated underwriting and collections capability, along with an ethical lending playbook, that makes the model very compelling,&#8221; said Saleem Asaria, Partner at Lightrock India, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have also been consistently impressed with the tenacity and execution focus of the team through a full credit cycle. We are excited to work with the team to build a highly scalable, differentiated, and sustainable business that will positively impact the lives of millions of customers in India through digital credit and financial products.”</p>
<p>The fresh capital, Rishyasringa said, will help the startup meet the surging growth it has seen in recent months. He attributed much of this growth to the pandemic, but also noted that there are some underlying long-term changes in consumer behavior that has helped the startup make larger inroads.</p>
<p>The startup, which finances the loans through partnership with banks such as Kotak and YBL, plans to also broaden its partner, he said.</p>
<p>“More importantly, we see an exponential growth opportunity ahead from this point on. By solving for affordability as well as convenience, in a fully-regulated format, we believe that our BNPL approach can responsibly expand access to credit to over 100 million customers who are starting to transact online. We are privileged to have the support of our investors in pursuing this vision, and are excited to work in partnership to build out a world-class digital financial institution for India,&#8221; said Rishyasringa and Capital Float&#8217;s other co-founder &#8212; Gaurav Hinduja &#8212; said in a joint statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For many financial institutions in Southeast Asia, verifying new customers takes a week or two, said the founders of <a href="https://verihubs.com/">Verihubs</a>. The startup cuts that time down to as little as five seconds, using AI-based identity authentication technology and APIs that let companies continue verifying returning customers through SMS, WhatsApp or flash calls.</p>
<p>Verihubs announced it has raised $2.8 million in seed funding for its goal of becoming &#8220;the one-stop for verification in Southeast Asia.&#8221; The round led by Insignia Venture Partners, with participation from CCV (Central Capital Ventura, the investment arm of Bank Central Asia, the largest privately-owned bank in Indonesia), and Armand Ventures. The round also include angel investors from notable Southeast Asian startups like Shipper co-founder Budi Handoko; Payfazz co-founders Jefriyanto and Ricky Winata; Gotrade co-founder Rohit Mulani; Bukuwarung founder Chinmay Chauhan; and Modalku ex-chief product officer Pramodh Rai.</p>
<p>The startup recently <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/verihubs">finished taking part in Y Combinator’s summer 2021 batch</a> and says it is the first YC-backed AI startup from Indonesia.</p>
<p>Based in Jakarta, Verihubs was founded in 2019 by Rick Firnando, who has more than 9 years of experience in the B2B industry, and Williem Williem, an AI researcher who holds a PhD in computer vision from South Korea’s Inha University. The company currently has 46 customers, including major banks and fintechs, and the founders say it is on track to hit 100 customers soon. While most of its current clients are in the financial space, Verihubs technology can also be used for e-commerce, rental marketplaces and hospitality (one of its clients is a hotel that uses Verihubs for its check-in process).</p>
<p>Before adopting Verihubs, many of its clients were still verifying customers manually, said Firnando. Verihubs serves as an end-to-end verification solution, “because integrating with multiple vendors is painful for developers to do,” he added. That is why it enables clients to perform KYC (know your customer), offers phone number verification using WhatsApp or SMS and also verifies customers’ financial data.</p>
<p>When end users log onto an app that uses Verihubs for the first time, they are prompted to take a selfie and then upload a photo of a government-issued photo ID. Then Verihubs AI-based technology compares the two photos to see if they match, and also cross-references the ID with telecom credit scores and Indonesian government databases, including criminal records.</p>
<p>Verihubs serves two kinds of end users—those who have traditional bank accounts and “unbanked” people. The startup’s new investment from Central Capital Ventura will help it develop its services for users with bank accounts, since it will be able to partner with BCA to access their customers’ data. For unbanked users, Firnando said Verihubs is working closely with Payfazz, which lets customers deposit money with local agents to use for online payments, and BukuWarung, a bookkeeping app for SMEs, to access transaction data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup’s product pipeline also includes building its own credit scores, based on data like transactions and account balances. Verihubs is currently focused on Indonesia, with plans to expand into other Southeast Asia markets eventually.</p>
<p>“For the ID verification system, we found that there is already a product-market fit in Indonesia, but we would like to expand into new products,” Firnando said. “We consolidate financial data from multiple sources, not only for banks, but also unbanked populations. And we’re also exploring expanding into new markets, like the Philippines and Vietnam.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Unless you&#8217;ve been in a cave over the last week, you&#8217;ve likely read a review or some discussion about <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609711/the-contrarian-by-max-chafkin/">T<em>he Contrarian</em></a>, a new book about billionaire investor Peter Thiel by longtime Bloomberg Businessweek features editor and tech reporter Max Chafkin.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t surprising. Thiel has become an increasingly powerful figure in the U.S., and Chafkin is an engrossing storyteller who poured 15 years of reporting into the book and who leaned on relationships with &#8220;hundreds of sources,&#8221; he writes in its acknowledgements.</p>
<p>To learn more, we talked with Chafkin last week in what proved to be a lively discussion that covered how much Thiel (who talked with Chafkin off the record) revealed of his personal life; why the &#8220;Trump thing was partly ideological, but it was partly a trade &#8212; an insight that Trump was undervalued,&#8221; says Chafkin; and why Thiel&#8217;s beliefs are &#8220;extremely inconsistent,&#8221; according to Chafkin&#8217;s reporting. We also discussed Thiel&#8217;s relationship with Mark Zuckerberg, who accepted one of Facebook&#8217;s first checks from Thiel and who has been bound, for good and bad, to Thiel since.</p>
<p>You can hear that 30-minute-long <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/max-chafkin-on-the-inexorable-rise-of-peter-thiel/id1498270180?i=1000536561904">interview here</a>. In the meantime, we&#8217;re pulling out a part of that conversation centering on Zuckerberg because we find Zuckerberg&#8217;s relationship with Thiel to be particularly fascinating and important, given the impact of Facebook on American society and humankind more broadly. We&#8217;ve edited this excerpt lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You talk about Thiel&#8217;s biggest and most important bet really being Facebook and suggest in the book that he used his position as a board member since 2005 to persuade Mark Zuckerberg to be more allowing of an anything-goes type stance, even misinformation. You also suggest there has been friction between Thiel and Zuckerberg for some time, especially as Thiel has come to embrace Trumpism. Do you anticipate that Thiel will be a Facebook board member for much longer? Do you think he has been sidelined in any way?</strong></p>
<p>MC: There&#8217;s an anecdote in the book: When Facebook went public, its stock crashed and Thiel sold the stock pretty quickly, but of course he stayed on the board [and in the book] I talk about this meeting they had at the Facebook campus to kind of pump people up, because when you&#8217;re working in a company and the stock is going down, I understand that it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s most depressing thing. Everybody every day is losing money. The press is beating you up. They were getting sued by firefighters and teachers. It was just an endless parade of bad news. So they had all these speakers come in to try to pick up the troops. And Peter Thiel gave a talk. And during the talk, he said, &#8216;My generation was promised flying cars. Instead we got Facebook.&#8217; Normally he attacks Twitter [with that language]. He says, &#8216;We were promised flying cars, but we got 140 characters,&#8217; but he made it Facebook in this case, and if you&#8217;re sitting in a crowd, or if you&#8217;re Mark Zuckerberg, it&#8217;s like, &#8216;Oh, so the longest-serving board member, mentor, guiding light of my business philosophy, just kind of got up there and told me I sucked.&#8217;</p>
<p>I do think that Zuckerberg actually kind of respects that about Peter, right? When you&#8217;re Mark Zuckerberg, it&#8217;s very hard to get honest feedback. No one&#8217;s gonna ever tell you that you suck except maybe Peter Thiel. But as you say, Thiel has really kind of been tiptoeing up to the line a lot over the last few years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He has often talked about tech monopoly and tech power, and he singles out Google, which . . . maybe takes the heat off of Facebook, but it doesn&#8217;t it doesn&#8217;t help that much, because Facebook and Google are very similar companies and if you&#8217;re going to regulate one, you might conceivably regulate the other. I&#8217;m not sure Zuckerberg is thrilled with that.</p>
<p>Thiel has at various times embraced this kind of right wing activist project in Silicon Valley. You have [conservative activist] James O&#8217;Keefe and others who are intent on exposing what they see as the hypocrisy of of Facebook, Google, Apple &#8212; all the big tech companies &#8212; and Thiel has subtly embraced those.</p>
<p>But he&#8217;s also increasingly embracing them in public. Right now, Thiel has two candidates running in the U.S. Senate races. They&#8217;re both running in Republican primaries: Blake Masters in Arizona, and JD Vance in Ohio, and Thiel has donated ten million bucks to super PACs supporting each of these candidates. These guys are constantly attacking Facebook, and not just attacking Facebook on an intellectual level or raising questions. They&#8217;re making almost personal attacks against Mark Zuckerberg. There&#8217;s a JD Vance ad [funded by Thiel], where it&#8217;s these dark tones, and it&#8217;s like, &#8216;There&#8217;s a contingent of elites in this country who are out of touch,&#8217; and there it is &#8212; there&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg face.</p>
<p>There was one instance [in 2017] where Zuckerberg asked if <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-luminary-peter-thiel-parts-ways-with-silicon-valley-1518696120">Thiel thought he should resign</a>, and Thiel did not and Zuckerberg didn&#8217;t fire him, so there has at least been some tension. [As for whether] Thiel&#8217;s value has diminished, that&#8217;s a really astute question because with Biden in charge, with the Democrats in power controlling the presidency and both houses of Congress, Thiel&#8217;s connection to the right is less valuable. That said, there&#8217;s a very good chance that Republicans will retake the Senate in 2022. And there&#8217;s a chance that that some of those Senators will be very, very close to Peter Thiel, so that could drastically increase his value.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mention in the book that a lot of people who are close to Thiel and admire him are also terrified of him. Despite the fact that Mark Zuckerberg is probably the most powerful person in the world, I wonder if your sense of things is that he&#8217;s scared of Thiel.</strong></p>
<p>MC: I think Zuckerberg could fire Thiel. I mean, Mark Zuckerberg is a formidable guy. He&#8217;s worth a lot of money. He could afford a war with Peter Thiel, and he could afford the backlash. But I think there&#8217;s a question about whether he&#8217;d want to, because right now, the reason Thiel is able to get away with what he&#8217;s able to get away with, with respect to both serving on the board and being this public critic, has to do with the fact that there would be a price to pay if Mark Zuckerberg fired him, and the price would be it would be a huge freaking story.</p>
<p>Thiel had been such an important ally to Mark Zuckerberg during the Trump presidency. There have been these running memes in conservative circles that Facebook is systematically discriminating against right wing points of view, [that it&#8217;s] a liberal company staffed by liberal employees who hate Donald Trump, and that as a result, it is putting its thumb on the scale and advancing the interests of the left. . . [But] Zuckerberg had an awesome response to that, which is &#8216;Hey, I&#8217;ve got this board member. He&#8217;s not just a Republican. He&#8217;s not just some kind of middle-of-the-road conservative like George Bush guy or something. He is Peter Freaking Thiel. He&#8217;s the guy who&#8217;s too crazy for Steve Bannon. He is a dyed-in-the-wool Trumpist.&#8217; And that gives Facebook a really, really powerful argument.</p>
<p>When somebody like Josh Hawley, who has taken money from Peter Thiel, or Ted Cruz, another person who has taken money from Peter Thiel, comes along and attacks Facebook . . . I think if [Thiel] left, especially if he was fired &#8212; if that was a story that came out &#8212; it would be open season.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an existential issue for Mark Zuckerberg. But I think it might be more comfortable to keep his friend and board member Peter Thiel, despite the fact that they might have some profound differences of opinion on the value of Facebook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian food delivery startup Swiggy is in talks to raise over $500 million in a new financing round that could value it at over $10 billion, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Atlanta-headquartered Invesco is in talks to lead &#8212; or co-lead &#8212; the new financing round in the Bangalore-based startup, which counts SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Falcon Edge Capital, and Prosus Ventures among its existing investors, sources added.</p>
<p>A deal has not finalized yet so the terms may change, one of them said. Swiggy had no comment on Monday. Indian news outlet CapTable <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/09/swiggy-zomato-foodelivery-valuation-grofers-funding/">first reported</a> about the fundraise talks.</p>
<p>The new fundraise talks come less than three months after Swiggy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/indian-food-delivery-startup-swiggy-raises-1-25-billion-led-by-softbank-and-prosus/">finalized a $1.25 billion funding round</a> at a post-money valuation of $5.5 billion. The startup&#8217;s chief rival in India, Zomato, had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">a stellar debut on Indian stock exchanges this year</a> that paved the way for Indian consumer tech startups to explore public markets. Zomato&#8217;s market cap has surged to $14.5 billion on stock exchanges, up from $5.4 billion valuation it had attained in private markets earlier this year.</p>
<p>Swiggy, like its older rival Zomato, was severely hit by the pandemic. But it has recovered strongly in recent quarters, the startup said in July. The value of orders it was processing that month was 30% higher than those in the pre-COVID times, it said.</p>
<p>Amazon also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/">entered the food delivery space in India</a> last year, but, as a Zomato executive mentioned in a public forum this year, the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/amazon-expands-its-food-delivery-service-across-bangalore/">yet to make inroads</a> in this category. Amazon&#8217;s food delivery service is currently only available in Bangalore.</p>
<p>At stake is India&#8217;s food services market, which is expected to reach $97 billion by March of 2026, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report to clients this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2208927" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208927" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2208927 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="474" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg?resize=768,356 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg?resize=680,315 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208927" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Bernstein</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;India food services market is large and expected to reach $97 billion by FY25. Organized food service is growing faster and expected to reach 55% market share by FY25. We expect online penetration to expand to 20% by FY25 and market size to reach $20 billion growing at 46% CAGR. Significant part of the growth will be driven by new customer acquisition and penetration into smaller markets. Zomato had 10 million monthly transacting users (MTU) in FY20, expected to increase 5x by FY25 to ~50 million,&#8221; they wrote.</p>
<p>Swiggy&#8217;s recent bet &#8212; the expansion into quick grocery delivery &#8212; has also gained traction at a time when rivals in the space (Grofers and BigBasket) have either not seen such traction or have yet to aggressively explore the space. Zomato, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/zomatos-100-million-investment-to-turn-grofers-into-a-unicorn/">invested about $100 million in Grofers</a> earlier this year, this month shut down a pilot program where it was testing grocery deliveries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, Ford Motor Company announced an investment of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/"> $30 billion toward electrification by 2025.</a> On Monday, the automaker unveiled some specifics for that plan. Ford and its battery joint venture partner, SK Innovation, will be<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/ford-sk-to-spend-11-4b-to-build-two-us-manufacturing-campuses-dedicated-to-evs-and-batteries/"> investing $11.4 billion</a> in the two new campuses it plans to build in Kentucky and Tennessee to produce the next generation of electric F-Series trucks and the batteries to power both Ford and Lincoln vehicles.</p>
<p>Alongside this investment, Ford has also outlined existing plants that it has repurposed to accommodate manufacturing for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at where Ford is now and how its electrification footprint will change in the coming years.</p>
<h3>Blue Oval City in Stanton, Tennessee</h3>
<p>In May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/ford-and-sk-innovation-announce-battery-manufacturing-joint-venture-blueovalsk/">Ford and SK Innovation signed a memorandum of understanding</a> to establish a joint venture to domestically manufacture batteries for electric vehicles. The joint venture, BlueOvalSK, aims to produce around 60 GWh of energy annually starting in 2025.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Now BlueOvalSK is spending $5.6 billion on a mega-campus in Stanton called Blue Oval City, which is expected to create around 6,000 new jobs and a new model for vehicle and battery manufacturing. The site is also close to Ford&#8217;s battery cell assembly and e-motor plant in Rossville, Tennessee.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Blue Oval City will become a vertically integrated ecosystem for Ford to assemble an expanded lineup of electric F-Series vehicles and will include a BlueOvalSK battery plant, key suppliers and recycling,&#8221; said the company in a statement. &#8220;</span>Blue Oval City will be among the largest auto manufacturing campuses in U.S. history. Like the iconic Rouge complex in Michigan did a century earlier, Blue Oval City will usher in a new era for American manufacturing.&#8221;</p>
<h3>BlueOvalSK battery manufacturing campus in Glendale, Kentucky</h3>
<p>Ford and SK Innovation announced on Monday an additional $5.8 billion spend on a battery manufacturing campus to open in Glendale in 2025. The 1,500-acre facility will bring 5,000 new jobs to Kentucky, and it&#8217;s well-placed to supply Ford&#8217;s Louisville assembly plant, which currently produces the Ford Escape hybrid and plug-in hybrid and the Lincoln Corsair plug-in hybrid.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both Blue Oval City and BlueOvalSK battery manufacturing campus are expected to be capable of producing up to 43 GWh each, or a total of 86 GWh annually, in order to power Ford&#8217;s next generation of electric vehicles.</p>
<h3>Ford Ion Park in Romulus, Michigan</h3>
<p>Only 30 minutes&#8217; drive from where it all began, Ford aims to build its Ford Ion Park, a battery R&amp;D facility where the automaker will house up to 200 battery technology experts and purchasing and finance leaders to help develop and manufacture lithium-ion and solid-state battery cells. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/ford-to-open-new-lab-to-develop-next-gen-lithium-ion-and-solid-state-batteries/">Ion Park represents $100 million of a total $185 million investment</a> into building higher-volume battery cells at lower costs.</p>
<p>Ford will refurbish an existing 270,000-square-foot facility to include pilot-scale equipment for electrode, cell and array design and manufacturing engineering and innovation, <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/07/27/ford-romulus-mich-ford-ion-park.html">according to the company</a>. A nearby batteries benchmarking test lab in Allen Park will support Ion Park as it tests cell construction and chemistries. Ion Park will also be close to Ford&#8217;s product development center in Dearborn, and its 1,100-acre Dearborn truck plant, which currently produces the F-150 hybrid and the Raptor.</p>
<h3>Existing facilities in Michigan</h3>
<p>Ford also has plans to utilize its existing plants around the country to aid its push for electrification. In Michigan, the company has identified its Rouge Complex, the Livonia Transmission Plant, the Rawsonville Components Plant and the Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center.</p>
<p>Ford is building an Electric Vehicle Center as part of its historic Rouge Complex in Dearborn, which is conveniently located close to the Truck Plant. This center will house the production of the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck. A spokesperson for Ford told TechCrunch the Rouge plant has started pre-production for test vehicle there, but has not yet begun mass production for commercial sales.</p>
<p>The Livonia Transmission Plant and Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Centers help produce Ford&#8217;s eMotor, and its Rawsonville Components Plant currently makes PHEV and FHEV battery packs alongside other components needed for ICE vehicles.</p>
<h3>Ford&#8217;s electrification in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri</h3>

<p>Ford has also outlined existing assembly and transmission plants in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri for electrification production. In Ohio, Ford has identified the Cleveland and Lima Engine Plants and the Sharonville Transmission Plant, which currently<a href="https://corporate.ford.com/operations/locations/global-plants/flat-rock-assembly-plant.html"> all seem to still produce</a> ICE engines or transmissions. A Ford spokesperson said these plants are all producing components for electrified vehicles, but not all-electric vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The decarbonization of the planet will be the next major disruption of the 21st century, according to SOSV managing general partner Sean O&#8217;Sullivan and Carmichael Roberts of Breakthrough Energy Ventures.</p>
<p>A disruption of such magnitude will bring about changes that will touch every industry and corner of daily life, and as a result, a complex web of challenges and resistance. It will also deliver unprecedented opportunity for entrepreneurs — and the investors backing them — who can turn their climate tech ideas into commercialized products and services, whether that&#8217;s plant-based foods, carbon capture, electric vehicles or battery recycling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The difficult thing here is that we have to change everything,&#8221; O&#8217;Sullivan said while on the TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 virtual stage. &#8220;Climate tech is not just one thing that needs to be changed. We have 100 areas, 1,000 different areas that need to be reinvented and industries that need to be reconstructed.&#8221;</p>
<p>This opportunity has helped climate tech become one of the hottest sectors to invest in. But that doesn&#8217;t mean success is guaranteed. Unlike other sectors, climate tech crosses into nearly every industry, including transportation, energy, agriculture, consumer goods, food and beverage, and packaging.</p>
<p>For investors, the initial challenge is vetting the startups, along with their technology and business plan, to determine if it&#8217;s really climate tech or just window dressing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a big and broad category that encompasses anything and everything that could lower overall carbon,&#8221; Robert noted.</p>
<h2>Are people ready for climate tech?</h2>
<p>Forces in entrenched industries can threaten progress even after climate tech startups successfully navigate fundraising and begin to scale. As O&#8217;Sullivan noted, people are inherently resistant to change.</p>
<p>However, both investors have seen more openness.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you listen to people today, they&#8217;re trying to figure out how to transition, blend, add. I see a lot more of &#8216;How do we embrace the transition?&#8217; And even further, &#8216;How do we not fear it?&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford Motor Company and battery manufacturer SK Innovation plan to spend $11.4 billion to build two massive campuses in Tennessee and Kentucky that will produce batteries as well as the next generation of electric F-Series trucks — a project the companies said will create 11,000 new jobs.</p>
<p>Facilities on the two campuses are designed to cover the entire ecosystem of building an electric vehicle<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from battery cell production and recycling to a supplier park and an assembly plant. </span>Ford is contributing $7 billion to the project, the largest single manufacturing investment in its 118-year history. The investment is part of Ford&#8217;s previously announced plan to put $30 billion toward electric vehicles by 2025.</p>
<p>The automaker also said it will spend $525 million over the next five years on high-tech job training across the United States, starting in Texas. The investment will focus on training auto technicians to support Ford&#8217;s coming onslaught of electric and connected vehicles.</p>
<p>Ford&#8217;s &#8220;mega campus&#8221; plans — the first facilities that the automaker has constructed in a generation — are meant to support its growing portfolio of EVs, including the Mustang Mach-E, the Ford E-Transit cargo van and the upcoming F-150 Lightning pickup truck, which has already received more than 150,000 pre-orders from customers. It&#8217;s also part of the company&#8217;s strategy to drive down battery costs to the $80 per kilowatt-hour pack level.</p>
<p>&#8220;The timing of these investments is very important because we see a critical mass for a transition to battery electric vehicles right on the horizon,&#8221; Lisa Drake, Ford&#8217;s chief operating officer in North America, said in a media briefing Monday. &#8220;And we&#8217;ve already seen evidence of that in the industry and now from our own recent product launches.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Ford is bullish on the demand for EVs. The company predicts that one-third of the full-size pickup segment will be fully electric by 2030, Drake noted.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208886" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Blue-Oval-City_GIF.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208886" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2208886 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Blue-Oval-City_GIF.gif" alt="" width="960" height="540" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2208886" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ford</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Monday&#8217;s announcement follows a string of planned investments by Ford, including an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck/">injection of $250 million</a> and 450 new jobs to increase production capacity of its upcoming F-150 Lightning to 80,000 all-electric trucks annually. Those funds and jobs will be spread out across its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center and Rawsonville Components Plant, Ford said.</p>
<p>It also comes less than a week since Ford announced plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/ford-partners-with-battery-recycling-and-materials-startup-redwood-materials-amid-ev-push/">partner with Redwood Materials</a> to create a closed loop system that will cover recycling production scrap and EVs at the end of their life as well as supplying the automaker with raw battery materials. Securing a supply of batteries &#8212; or the materials to make them &#8212; has prompted the automotive industry to partner with cell manufacturers and increasingly turn to companies like Redwood Materials.</p>
<p>Drake provided more details about that partnership Monday, noting that Redwood Materials will set up a recycling facility on its so-called Blue Oval City campus near Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
<h2>Tennessee campus</h2>
<p>Once completed. the $5.6 billion campus in Stanton, Tennessee will rival the size and population of a small village. The 3,600-acre campus, or nearly 6 square miles, will be designed as a closed loop manufacturing center. This means that materials used in production can be reused to make new EVs.</p>
<p>The campus will have a battery production facility operated in partnership with SK, a supplier park and an assembly plant dedicated to electric F-Series trucks. The battery manufacturing facility will be able to produce 43 gigawatt hours of cell capacity. Ford said the assembly plant will be designed to be carbon neutral from the start of production in 2025.</p>
<h2>Kentucky campus</h2>
<p>Ford said it will build twin battery plants on the campus located in the central Kentucky town of Glendale. Batteries produced at the plants will be used in a new lineup of Ford and Lincoln electric vehicles later this decade. Production of the lithium-ion batteries is expected to begin in 2025.</p>
<p>The 1,500-acre battery campus, which Ford is calling BlueOvalSK Battery Park, will cost about $5.8 billion and employ 5,000 people. The twin battery plants will be capable of producing up to 43 gigawatt hours each for a total of 86 gigawatt hours annually. Adding in the third battery cell plant in Tennessee will push the total capacity up to 129 GWh, according to Yoosuk Kim, executive vice president and global head of marketing at SK.</p>
<p>In all, that&#8217;s enough capacity to power over 1 million electric vehicles, Drake said.</p>
<p>Ford has previously said that its global plans for battery electric vehicle calls for at least 240 gigawatt hours of battery cell capacity by 2030. That is roughly 10 plants’ worth of capacity. Ford has previously said that 140 GWh will be required in North America, with the balance dedicated to other regions, including Europe and China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The proliferation of affordable and fast mobile data allowed hundreds of millions of Indians to come online for the first time in the past decade. But there are scores of areas in the South Asian nation’s economy that remain largely offline. One of those is factories. There are about 150,000 factories in India, but the vast majority of them lack digital means to connect and sell their products to retailers.</p>
<p>About six years ago, a team of four people (Siddharth Vij, Chaitanya Rathi, Siddharth Rastogi and Shubham Agarwal) &#8212; all of whom had either personal or family background in the manufacturing business &#8212; came together to tackle this challenge.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, they announced that their effort &#8212; the startup <a href="https://www.bijnis.com">Bijnis</a> &#8212; continues to make inroads in the market and has won the trust of several investors.</p>
<p>Bijnis has raised $30 million in a Series B financing round led by Westbridge Capital, they announced. The new funding also saw participation from existing investors including Sequoia India, InfoEdge, Waterbridge Ventures and Matrix Partners India.</p>
<p>The New Delhi-headquartered startup operates an eponymous mobile app that Vij, in an interview with TechCrunch, described as an “operating system for factories.”</p>
<p>The Bijnis app helps factory operators generate demand from buyers and other retailers alike and also helps them procure supplies. It also offers manufacturers with logistics and payments services &#8212; through partnerships with several popular players in the industry.</p>
<p>“The problem is that these manufacturers spend the vast majority of their time running factories. So they rely on wholesalers and other agents for buying and selling. These players don’t share the identity to the buyers as this is how they get to squeeze a lot of money from the manufacturers,” he explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bijnis is trying to remove the traditional agents from the equation to help manufacturers considerably improve their profits &#8212; and also aggressively expand by discovering new customers. One of the ways it is doing so is by helping these businesses establish a digital presence so that anyone can find them online, he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208897" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208897" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2208897 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bijnis-app.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="830" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bijnis-app.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bijnis-app.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bijnis-app.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bijnis-app.jpg?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bijnis-app.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bijnis-app.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208897" class="wp-caption-text">A slide from the pitch deck the startup shared with TechCrunch. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bijnis</p></div></p>
<p>“The founding team has very strong category understanding given their family background in manufacturing and that has enabled them to build a compelling proposition for manufacturers and retailers in the fashion and lifestyle categories,&#8221; said Sandeep Singhal, partner at Westbridge Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bijnis has carved a niche for itself as the B2B platform of choice in these categories and we are excited to be partners as they transform the ecosystem for these categories in India.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 5,000 factories operating in fashion, footwear and lifestyle categories are now using the Bijnis app, said Vij, adding that the startup has so far focused more on ensuring that the factories that come to the platform are able to generate enough demand rather than trying to court as many manufacturers as possible. The platform has also onboarded over 100,000 retailers.</p>
<p>But the new fund, the startup said, will help it win more manufacturers and retailers as increasingly more businesses are becoming aware of Bijnis’ offerings. The startup, which employs over 200 people, also plans to broaden its product offerings, he said.</p>
<p>“Traditional supply chains in lifestyle categories in India continue to be extremely unorganised and fragmented. Small and medium manufacturers are the backbone of these supply chains, representing a significant part of India’s manufacturing economy, which is at the brink of massive transformation driven by rapid digitisation across layers,” said Shraeyansh Thakur, vice president at Sequoia India, in a statement.</p>
<p>“The team is very excited about Bijnis’s vision of building an operating system for manufacturing in this segment and look forward to partnering them on this mission.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Live shopping — the seamless and simultaneous combination of online shopping, livestreaming and social media — has been taking North America by storm since October 2019. Though booming to take up <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/its-showtime-how-live-commerce-is-transforming-the-shopping-experience">over 13%</a> of all e-commerce sales in China, the North American set is still new to this innovation, where influencers transform star power to selling power in moving millions of dollars of perfume, produce and even seats on a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/news-bites/article/3078136/chinas-live-streaming-sales-queen-sold-rocket-launch-service">rocket launcher</a>.</p>
<p>In Canada, cosmetics brand Urban Decay introduced a deeper meaning to “see now, buy now” through its <a href="https://brainstation.io/magazine/loreal-leans-into-livestream-shopping-experiences">first use of live shopping</a> in October 2019. Since this first foray into the physical-digital wild west, live shopping is set to become an <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/its-showtime-how-live-commerce-is-transforming-the-shopping-experience">$11 billion industry</a> in the United States by the end of this year.</p>
<p>While “live shopping” has been the buzzword on every brand marketer’s lips, adoption comes with a lot of questions. One of the most pressing questions we’ve seen circling around emails, webinars and routine Zoom calls is in deciding who the face of these live-shopping events should be, and how a new industry standard for selection, payment and expertise can be implemented.</p>
<p>As director of marketing and communications at a live-shopping startup in North America, I’ve watched the continent’s adopters soar to success &#8212; or learn big lessons.</p>
<p>After watching the influencer market rise to its present-day success, I want to break down how brands should be selecting, compensating and coaching their influencer hosts, as well as outline a few key terms industry players should keep note of.</p>
<h2>Start with influencers on day one</h2>
<p>Knix, the woman-founded Canadian intimates brand, has a model that thrives on its customer community &#8212; and ambassadors that bring it to life. The brand pierced through a $46 billion lingerie market to usher in a new era for leakproof undergarments, activewear and loungewear, designed around real feedback from real consumers.</p>
<p>A huge pivot came when the brand shifted entirely from retail sales to direct-to-consumer in 2016, focusing on connecting and communicating with customers online. Knix has also implemented a robust influencer affiliate strategy, seeding product and providing exclusive 10% off discount codes to communities close to their influencer affiliates.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Knix also became the first intimates brand to launch with <a href="https://www.livescale.tv/">Livescale</a>, using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScT1dUrDx4g">live shopping</a> to add extra excitement to its buzz-worthy swimwear launch. Hosted by influencer Sarah Nicole Landry, real Knix customers and Knix founder Joanna Griffiths, the first event exceeded expectations, placing overall sales conversion well above live-shopping’s average, and certainly for a first-time event.</p>
<p>The live-shopping experience was the first to blend social media strategies with the expertise of the Knix brand team, showcasing online polls, gamification features and direct paths to purchase without ever leaving the brand’s social channels, website and online newsletter.</p>
<p>The secret? In part, the organic community culture the brand has worked for years to build — topped off with the selection of an influencer host who has known the brand for years and can speak directly to its merits without a second thought.</p>
<h2>Expertise is more crucial than following</h2>
<p>Yes, live-shopping events with celebrity hosts may make the news — but that doesn’t mean they always make the strongest sales.</p>
<p>A well-organized script with a passionate spokesperson is more important than budget-busting hosts, flashy names and buzzy PR tactics, our data show. The TL;DR? Let your host’s authentic connection to their audience shine brighter than anything else.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1-H4NaxYs4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Mostly friends and sometimes family have encouraged me to tell stories about my days in the comedy, music, and tech businesses. And for all of this time I&#8217;ve been reluctant. However, with the Pandemic and the impending birth of my first grandchild, I&#8217;ve reconsidered. My wife&#8217;s passion for genealogy has reminded us that stories get lost fast. People die, forget, become estranged as they lose track of the family tree. It takes real effort to rebuild those connections as time goes on. Our kids don&#8217;t care about any of this now, but later they will. And the genealogy of friendship is the story of our times, the things we find important and the friends we choose to share. For the past few months I’ve started work on a book. From time to time, I&#8217;ll include some of that work here.</p>
<p>The second season of The Morning Show arrived on Apple TV+, just as our subscription to the service flipped from free with a new iPhone purchase a year ago to $4.99 a month. The first season did pretty well with its blend of inside baseball about the the broadcast TV news business. The production values were strong, reminiscent of the West Wing treatment of Washington beltway politics. The MeToo story line featured A-List performances by Jennifer Anniston, Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, and a complicated turn by Billy Crudup. Not bad for $4.99 but even with the surprise sleeper soccer hit Ted Lasso barely enough to keep afloat in the Netflix/Disney+ struggle for streaming leadership. And there is Apple&#8217;s stake in this amid the challenges of competing with Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and the rest of the tech giants.</p>
<p>For me, Apple TV+ has crossed over from a question mark to a must have, much like CNN when it debuted in 1980, and HBO, which grew out of the fledgling Z Channel we enjoyed in a Malibu house David Sanborn was renting that same year. Dave had arrived in town to play on a Pure Prairie League record being produced at The Band&#8217;s Shangri-La recording studio on a hill overlooking the Pacific. I was house sitting the League&#8217;s Malibu beach house over the holidays when Dave showed up at the front door unexpectedly.</p>
<p>At this point I&#8217;d known Sanborn since 1973, when he played on the soundtrack for the Firesign Theatre&#8217;s Proctor and Bergman film TV Or Not TV. I&#8217;d produced the TV Or Not TV record and directed a stage version of the show on a West Coast tour that ended with a performance at a Columbia Records promotional event in Los Angeles. Invited guests included George Harrison, who greeted the three of us with the catchphrase from the Firesign&#8217;s first album: &#8220;Civilization Ho.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the Pure Prairie League session, Dave decided to rent another house down the street on Broad Beach. The house quickly became a rallying point for characters like Gary Busey, Richard Manuel of the Band, and Sanborn associate Marcus Miller who wrote much of the material for Dave&#8217;s records. He would fly in from touring with Miles Davis and work up the new tunes on a PortaStudio and MiniMoog I had set up in the living room. Eventually Sanborn invited me to move out of my small room at Shangri-La and into the beach house. This is where the Z Channel came in.</p>
<p>This was the first cut at premium television. Each month the Z Channel would show several films rotating throughout the week and multiple times per day. Busey, who had first surfaced on a local Tulsa TV station with late night B-movie comedy cut-ins with Gaillard Sartain, was a stone cold genius at riffing off of whatever was on TV. And the Z Channel turned this into an intense ritual where repeated viewings of films like Spielberg&#8217;s 1942 would take on such hilarious undertones that the only way to escape Busey&#8217;s comedy stylings was to leave the building doubled over in laughter. To casual observers, of which there were none, this suggested a new paradigm shift as improv met the Hollywood windowing system — and produced HBO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Out of HBO grew streaming television, as original productions like The Sopranos and Game of Thrones led to the binge production model that Netflix rode to the top of the charts. Over the past several years this tsunami of economic restructuring led to the unbundling of the television networks and the realignment of studio production around the relentless demands of streaming and subscriptions. Pay TV became Pay Media, Data became the competitive coin of the realm. And the Pandemic mandated the underlying principles of a new economy we are still struggling to understand even as we vote for it with our feet and behavior.</p>
<p>After 15 months at home, we finally took advantage of the beginning of summer to travel by car to our bungalow in South Carolina. Our children were born and raised there until we moved to the Bay Area as tech publishing realigned and the valley bubble crashed. Software became a service, and mobile became the dominant platform. Blogs and podcasting morphed into streaming and social with the current investments in the creator economy — newsletters and live audio.</p>
<p>These efforts have not gone unnoticed by the remaining media giants. Substack&#8217;s year-long investment in proving a subscription basis for writers and influencers has reached some combination of yes, it&#8217;s possible and no, it&#8217;s very hard to scale. On the pro side, Kara Swisher is one of the significant contributors moving her newsletter behind the paywall of the New York Times, and bolstering Twitter Spaces with a frequent live audio show. The fact that you can&#8217;t find these shows after the fact will likely be solved by a record/replay feature Twitter is working on. Once you can&#8217;t distinguish live audio from a podcast, the next step is not distinguishing podcasts from streaming programming. This evolution is behind Rachel Maddow&#8217;s moves to straddle her daily show and her podcast-becomes-book properties. CNBC&#8217;s Jim Cramer is going there too, as I noted on this edition of the Gang:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jim Cramer, the fabulous analyst and the Mad Money guy [adds Brent Leary]. He&#8217;s signed a new deal. This is kind of like Rachel Maddow 2.0 or 3.0. He&#8217;s doing something called CNBC Investor Club, and basically he&#8217;s delving into the creator economy. These media on camera editor types are slowly becoming engaged in creating product.</p></blockquote>
<p>Frank Radice:</p>
<blockquote><p>He doesn&#8217;t jump into something like that unless he sees a real opening to make money. Think of what he was doing even before he went to CNBC. And he&#8217;s not a stupid man. I think it&#8217;s very interesting that he will be able to on CNBC and probably on his new ventures, make his opinions public as long as they put a rejoinder at the end, saying this is not an opinion of CNBC, it&#8217;s just Jim Cramer&#8217;s opinion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brent Leary jokes about Cramer dipping into the 30% pool that the Epic lawsuit frees up for new Club members, but however the move shakes out, we appear to be on the way from cable (CNN) to PayTV (Z Channel) to the subscription+ economy. What Netflix wrought and Amazon, Disney, Hulu, HBO Max, and Paramount+ chased is being tested by Apple TV+ of all things. Apple is doing things a little different this time, undercutting its AppleTV device with streaming dongles like Amazon Firestick and platform deals with smartTV heavyweights like Roku. The AppleTV hardware is top of the line, but in price not exclusivity. The kicker is that AppleTV+ is bargain-priced but exclusive in execution.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve got HBO pinned down as a cable premium service folded into HBO Max fighting off the disappearing theatrical window. Apple&#8217;s original-only strategy seemed overmatched by Netflix&#8217;s volume game, but the Pandemic knocked down production to the point where originals had to be acquired from Europe and Scandinavia to keep the pipeline open. Well-appointed binge blockbusters like The Crown and so-called limited series like The Queen&#8217;s Gambit came from the HBO playbook, but they were few and far between for nightlight viewers struggling to keep up with subtitles and mediocre dubbing.</p>
<p>Instead we&#8217;re in the AppleTV+ equation. With the same methodical and relentless blend of hardware and software Apple uses to dominate the mobile margins, AppleTV+ extends the platform with a product designed to wipe out the broadcast linear markets. For the first time, the Emmys were not so much dominated by the streamers as ghosting the network TV shows in nominations. CBS, long a bastion for comedies, broadcast the Emmys without a single nomination, and gave the spotlight instead to Hacks, a funny HBO Max original developed not for cable but streaming direct. We&#8217;re not in Kansas, anymore.</p>
<p>Where we are is watching Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, and scifi epic Foundation. Not enough to satisfy the void created by the collapse of network and cable TV, but more than a harbinger of things to come. When CNN debuted, people wondered why anyone would watch news 24 hours a day. Now they&#8217;re wondering that again, with the mute button on 24/7 and notifications telling you what&#8217;s shaking. Production is shifting from green screens to interactive LED screens that matte actors into backgrounds they can see as they perform. Projects deemed unfilmable are no longer so. Blackberry, meet the iPhone.</p>
<p>AppleTV+ has the aura of a linear broadcast network spiced with a tech platform. Apple&#8217;s hardware/software overlapping release schedule shifts between short range customer-facing innovations like this year&#8217;s iPhone 13 camera advances and long-range efforts to move from third party data and user tracking to a first party transaction data set. The new phone&#8217;s ability to use additional mapping to do professional-level rack focusing while and after recording augurs for more and more features shifting into software manipulation on more powerful system hardware. AppleTV+ takes advantage of a hole in the market between streaming and traditional broadcast and cable to build out the same mix of quality and innovation lock-in its physical products offer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for September 27, 2021. Today’s TechCrunch news is <em>big</em> news, so instead of jamming it into the intro, we’re just going to dive in! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/"><strong>Say hello to TechCrunch+:</strong></a><strong> </strong>TechCrunch’s Extra Crunch product is now called TechCrunch+ for a host of very good reasons. This brand changeover is something that has long been in the works, and frankly I am pretty excited about it. Read more at the first link, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">or give us money here</a>. (Support journalism!)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/">Facebook pauses kids’ Instagram:</a></strong> Today’s <em>other</em> big news comes from Facebook, a company that has been in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">news just a little bit lately</a>. Now, after withering feedback on its work to build an Instagram for kids, the company is hitting pause. It still thinks the product is a good idea, mind. It just wants to convince the market first. Let’s see how that goes.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/coinbase-to-let-you-deposit-part-of-your-paycheck-into-your-coinbase-account/"><strong>Coinbase makes it easier to bet on crypto:</strong></a> By letting you put part of your paycheck into its service, TechCrunch reports. Obvious snark aside from the more conservative investors among us, the move makes some sense. It’s standard to put a slice of your income into investment accounts, perhaps tuned for retirement. If you think that Solana really is the future, why wouldn’t you want to put a percentage of your income into that particular digital asset? Akin to my index funds, it’s just a number on a screen, after all.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the startup news of the day, TechCrunch spent a little time today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/can-direct-listings-really-fix-the-ipo-pricing-problem/">noodling on the IPO pricing problem</a> and how direct listings <em>may</em> improve price discovery for unicorns, and we also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/will-rising-interest-rates-scupper-the-startup-surge/">tucked into the interest viz startup valuations discussion!</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/y-combinator-malloc-spyware/"><strong>Malloc wants to help you combat mobile spyware:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Your mobile phone may be the center of your life. A sort of planning-communications-gaming-dating device that also has all your photos. And it’s not that secure, thanks to companies with a bit more focus on profits over privacy and even more nefarious actors. Y Combinator-backed Malloc and its service Antistalker are helping consumers fight back.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/edsights-gets-a-5-million-series-a-for-student-retention-services/"><strong>EdSights raises $5M to help keep students from churning:</strong></a> Sure, it may seem a little wacky to think of students as income-generating assets that can churn, but they are, and they do. So, here we are. Now with 6x revenue growth, the edtech service is flush and ready to expand.</li>
<li><strong>Fake meat bulletin: </strong>Two fake meat stories for you today, the first of which being that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/new-age-meats-bites-into-25m-for-cultured-meat-product-line-development/">New Age Meats has raised $25 million</a> for its cultured meat products. Second: Beyond Meat’s plant “chicken” tenders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/beyond-meats-plant-based-chicken-tenders-are-coming-to-grocery-stores/">are coming to grocery stores</a>. Nerds who are watching your weight, rejoice. (It can’t just be me right?)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/astera-labs-a-fabless-chip-startup-nabs-50m-at-a-950m-valuation-to-remove-bottlenecks-in-high-bandwidth-cloud-applications/"><strong>Astera Laba shows that there’s capital in the market for chip startups:</strong></a> Even fabless concerns like Astera. The company just banked $50 million at just under a $1 billion valuation. Startups, get on solving the chip shortage please and thank you.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/flat6labs-closes-10m-seed-fund-for-tunisian-startups/"><strong>Flat6Labs raises $10M for Tunisian startups:</strong></a> Speaking of startups, upstart tech shops in the Tunisian Republic have a new seed fund to hit up. More good news from Africa, it appears, at least from a capital-access perspective. The continent has had a hot year when it comes to fundraising.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creative capital is the secret sauce, not venture capital</h2>
<p>Before a startup lands its first customer or investor, its founders must invest time and energy to develop intellectual property.</p>
<p>In some cases, IP can be as tangible as a patent, but strategic assets can also take the form of product visualizations, target audience data or early product/engineering prototypes.</p>
<p>Brett Lovelady, founder of design firm Astro Studios, defines these design and development assets as &#8220;creative capital,&#8221; which &#8220;can ultimately last longer and potentially become more valuable&#8221; than venture capital.</p>
<p>In a guest post for TechCrunch+, he describes different types of creative capital and includes multiple examples of how startups can leverage it for success.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/youtube-tv-may-drop-14-nbc-universal-channels-over-a-contract-dispute/"><strong>YouTube TV, now even more like cable:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I preface by admitting that I am a regular YouTube TV customer. And I hate that it is, like cable, stuck in an era of coverage blackouts if the football team you want to watch is in a different part of the country. But now YouTube TV is bringing yet another Cable Innovation to its own service, namely content blackouts over contract gripes. NBC Universal might yank 14 channels from the YouTube product. Woot. Progress.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/"><strong>TikTok reaches 1 billion monthly active users:</strong></a> In case you were curious if TikTok is still cool or has been slowly flattened into another medium for advertising and Coca-Cola ads, here’s your answer.</li>

The U.K. competitive watchdog is cool with the Facebook deal to buy the small CRM maker. Not <em>all</em> purchases from Big Tech companies are dying on the vine.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/apple-maps-rolls-out-3d-view-to-london-l-a-new-york-and-san-francisco/"><strong>Apple is rolling out 3D view to LHR, LAX, JFK and SFO:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Good news if you live in one of those four cities. Sadly for those of us with backyards in places like Providence, we have to wait.</li>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every day, we see another traditional financial institution scrambling to figure out its crypto strategy, and it’s clear why. Crypto is past the tipping point of mainstream consciousness, and use cases like cross-border payments are firmly outside of the sandbox stage.</p>
<p>Cross-border payments are one of the earliest crypto use cases for obvious reasons. Qualitatively, public blockchains and their native cryptocurrencies are global by nature and built to be secure, censorship-resistant, cheap to transact with (depending on the token) and (possibly most importantly) can settle transactions instantly 24/7/365.</p>
<p>However, it’s taken a few years for crypto to make a significant dent in this $130 trillion a year industry that incumbents &#8212; like money-transfer companies and big banks &#8212; have held a monopoly on. For example, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/how-westernunion-is-fighting-back-against-fintech-startups/">vast majority of Western Union’s revenue</a> comes from individual transaction fees from cross-border payments.</p>
<p>It all comes down to crypto having the same or better level of global liquidity than fiat and readily available on-off ramps. Good news: Both these lines are trending positively.</p>
<h2>Antiquated systems favor big banks</h2>
<p>The world of traditional foreign exchange (FX) has remained fairly stagnant for years &#8212; you can only make payments during regular banking hours, and while messages are sent via SWIFT, payments aren’t actually settled until a few days later.</p>
<p>There are at least two distinct steps to this antiquated correspondent banking system, and as we all are painfully aware, transactions are slow, error-prone, costly and inefficient. While there are larger payment flows in corridors such as U.S.-to-Mexico, there are still costs to consumers.</p>
<p>As you move into non G-20 currencies, it’s anybody’s guess as to when your money will arrive from one country to the next, and you’ll be paying fees anywhere from 5%-10%. This system has long served the big-money-center banks that monopolized access to liquidity among themselves, raking in trillions of dollars over the years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For years (pre-2017), crypto liquidity was limited to a handful of exchanges with a few million dollars in volume across all assets. That’s dramatically changed in the past few years.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207732" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207732" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207732 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="780" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-1.png 1808w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-1.png?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-1.png?resize=300,229 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-1.png?resize=768,585 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-1.png?resize=680,518 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-1.png?resize=1536,1171 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-1.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207732" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Asheesh Birla</p></div></p>
<p>Ripple early on focused on the thesis that it will become cheaper to source liquidity for cross-border payments with crypto over traditional fiat if (1) crypto grows in volume around the world (measured by the level of liquidity on exchanges) and (2) you can make bigger payments with it (measured by order book size). What was a lofty vision in 2015 is now reality.</p>
<h2>On- and off-ramps are required to access crypto liquidity</h2>
<p>A key factor required to use crypto for cross-border payments is easy on- and off-ramps to move from fiat to crypto and vice versa to get access to crypto liquidity. I could once count on one hand the available methods, and today, the different venues, such as stablecoins and exchanges, for moving in and out of crypto are growing quickly. Everyone from the major money transfer companies and card networks to global crypto exchanges is taking advantage of tokenization to address this first hurdle.</p>
<p>Fiat-backed stablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular on- and off-ramps because they ensure a relatively easy way to get access to crypto without having to immediately convert money into fiat when making a payment and therefore eliminating the conversion taxes headache and high volatility in crypto.</p>
<p>This is evident in the growing market cap of stablecoins, which <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1255835/stablecoin-market-capitalization/">shot up</a> to well over $100 billion in July 2021 from $4 billion in 2019. They provide access and liquidity into crypto exchanges, decentralized finance platforms and less liquid fiat-to-fiat corridors, showing the power of what tokenized assets can do. As the world trends toward tokenizing all kinds of value (fiat, crypto, identity, loans, NFTs, etc.), the more liquidity there is within the system to support moving from one asset to the next.</p>
<h2>Getting into the data</h2>
<p>Now onto the quantitative reasons &#8212; data shows that sourcing liquidity from crypto becomes more cost-effective than fiat over time. The fundamental question is at what data point does sourcing from crypto become consistently cheaper than traditional fiat foreign exchange (FX)?</p>
<p>Using the chart below, we can see how crypto volume, an indicator of liquidity, has grown over the past five years by using five of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap (Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash) on Bitstamp as a proxy for the larger crypto market. These assets combined consistently accounted for about 85% of all crypto volume (outside of stablecoins) from 2016 to 2021.</p>

<p>We specifically looked at USD and EUR monthly volume for the five tokens compared to the USD and EUR average difference in spot and implied FX rates, as well as the USD and EUR order book size from April 2016 to June 2021. Spot rate shows the immediate FX rate at that specific moment in time, while implied rate shows the FX rate achieved from bridging sending currency to destination currency with an intermediary (such as using a crypto asset as the bridge).</p>
<p>As the years passed, the difference between the spot FX rate and the implied rate gets closer to zero, evident from the average trend line, meaning it’s becoming on par or cheaper to send payments through crypto than it is with fiat.</p>
<p>Extrapolating the trend line further, we could forecast the trend line going past zero to a negative difference within the next two years (provided crypto volume continues to double at the current rate). It’s also worth noting other factors at play here, such as that payment providers like PayPal or Western Union charge a fee per fiat transaction (between 0.2%-1% margin).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207734" style="width: 1812px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207734" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207734 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-3.png" alt="" width="1802" height="1676" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-3.png 1802w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-3.png?resize=150,140 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-3.png?resize=300,279 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-3.png?resize=768,714 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-3.png?resize=680,632 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-3.png?resize=1536,1429 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/crypto-chart-3.png?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1802px) 100vw, 1802px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207734" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Asheesh Birla</p></div></p>
<p>Over the same time period, the chart above shows how order book size is quickly increasing &#8212; meaning there’s enough liquidity to support payments as high as $4 million total in 2021 with these five cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Traditional transaction-based payments revenue will become obsolete</h2>
<p>To all the money-transfer companies that make a huge chunk of their revenue from FX transaction fees, there should be alarm bells going off when seeing this data.</p>
<p>Here’s the reason why companies are pushing to use crypto for cross-border payments &#8212; it’s no longer just about the qualities of blockchain and crypto that make it useful for this use case, but also that global liquidity can truly support these payments at scale. As more options are available for consumers, traditional companies will have to lower transaction fees to keep market share, which will partially mitigate the issues.</p>
<p>To all the consumers that have previously gone to PayPal or the like to make a cross-border payment: Why stick with them when it’s cheaper, faster and just as &#8212; if not more &#8212; secure to use crypto?</p>
<p>These companies will need to change their revenue models, which currently rely heavily on transaction fees, or risk becoming obsolete. While some are going in the opposite direction (i.e., PayPal has already<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58492953"> upped its transaction fees</a> for cross-border merchant payments in Europe, and Western Union is pushing further into digital payments to stave off competitors), the proverbial wave is already crashing down. Other services that they provide (compliance, addressing, etc.) will not save them either &#8212; many crypto companies are already implementing robust anti-money-laundering and know your customer (AML/KYC) programs.</p>
<p>While this data using BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC and BCH in a few corridors is a proxy for the entire market, the trend lines are directionally obvious. Crypto is above a $2 trillion market cap today &#8212; imagine what could be possible when it’s at $5 trillion or $10 trillion.</p>
<p>Crypto liquidity is changing the game. We’re past the “if” &#8212; it’s now onto “when.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LinkedIn earlier this month unveiled a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/linkedin-is-launching-its-own-25m-fund-and-incubator-for-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new push around creators</a> to bring more original content (and engagement) to its platform, but that&#8217;s not the only effort they are making to bring more activity to its networking site. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that LinkedIn is also running a test around events &#8212; specifically, paid events.</p>
<p>We were first passed code related to the events test via a source who asked to remain anonymous: The code pointed to LinkedIn selling tickets, as well as those organizing the events having a dashboard where they could monitor how those sales are going, how much they are earning, and of course then run the events themselves. A LinkedIn spokesperson confirmed the information to us:</p>
<p>“Amid the changing world of work and transition to a nearly all-remote workforce, LinkedIn Events has seen a surge in growth, with 21 million people attending an Event on LinkedIn in 2020,&#8221; said Nicole Leverich, LinkedIn spokesperson. &#8220;We continue to learn from member and customer feedback and test new ways to improve the experience. As part of this, we are exploring options for payment in the Events product based on feedback from event organizers.”</p>
<p>From what we understand this is part of a bigger overhaul the company is looking to make around video and audio services, so these are likely going to anchor the events service, which will all be rolled out in the coming weeks and months. <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005239/en/Hopin-Announces-LinkedIn-as-Latest-Strategic-Investor-and-Partner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn was announced in June of this year as an investor in Hopin</a>; but it&#8217;s not clear if Hopin &#8212; which was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210805005315/en/Hopin-Raises-450-Million-to-Accelerate-Platform-Expansion-and-Continue-to-Build-the-Future-of-Experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last valued at $7.75 billion</a> in its most recent, August funding round &#8212; will be involved in this.</p>
<p>LinkedIn has been working in and around events for years, starting with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/linkedin-gets-physical-debuts-new-events-hub-for-people-to-plan-in-person-networking-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Events hub that it first debuted in 2019</a>, before the days of the pandemic and with a focus on in-person get-togethers. Some months into the COVID-19 pandemic it formalized some of the ways that it was being used in more virtual events scenarios with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/linkedin-ads-polls-and-live-video-based-events-in-a-focus-on-more-virtual-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of online polls and video events</a> aimed at virtual engagement.</p>
<p>Because of this and its place as a social network for those professionally networking, LinkedIn already had a strong, and pretty natural, association with events &#8212; both larger industry expositions or conferences as well as smaller affairs. It&#8217;s used by a number of big events to manage log-ins for attendees; people share content from events on LinkedIn; and those who go to conferences use it to continue their networking after they have engaged in person (or these days, virtually). So it makes sense for LinkedIn the business to consider how and if they could be a more proactive, central participant in that process, owning and hosting the experience themselves, and maybe making a bit of money out of it in the process.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update this as we learn more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The 660,000-square-foot factory will be capable of producing “thousands of different types of space vehicles per year,” including 1000 complete satellites and over 1 million satellite components per year, the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>Terran Orbital was founded in 2013, the same year that it acquired nanosatellite developer Tyvak, but has maintained a low profile since. In 2017, Lockheed Martin took <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/29/lockheed-martin-takes-a-strategic-stake-in-nanosatellite-company-terran-orbital/">a small stake</a> in the company. While Terran operates a 128,000-square-foot facility in Irvine, California, CEO and co-founder Marc Bell told TechCrunch in a recent interview that Terran doesn’t disclose its current manufacturing capacity or how many satellites it has built.</p>
<p>Terran Orbital is a contract manufacturer that designs, builds and engineers satellites, primarily for the U.S. government. Bell said around 95% of Terran’s work is related to NASA and the Department of the Defense, and he declined to specify any of the company’s commercial customers.</p>
<p>The company will also be developing its own satellite constellation, Bell added. These satellites will use a type of synthetic aperture radar that will be capable of capturing images even through clouds or other weather events that impact visibility, like thunderstorms. Terran said it will start launching these satellites at the end of 2022.</p>
<p>It’s anticipated that the facility will be completed in 2025 and should generate around 2,100 jobs at an average wage of $84,000. The facility is being built in partnership with Space Florida, the state’s aerospace development authority, which is providing the conduit financing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The announcement marks the latest boost for Florida’s Space Coast, which is already home to facilities owned by SpaceX, Blue Origin, Redwire and others. Last year, more than 1,200 satellites were launched into space, more than double the amount that were sent to orbit the previous year.</p>

<p>Ignore the compliments; Sharma was merely trying to bait <a href="https://twitter.com/jrichlive">Jeff</a> and me into engaging with his question. Which worked, as you can tell.</p>
<p>Sharma is someone with quite a lot of experience with both technology cycles and capital flows, so he&#8217;s not asking the generic question &#8212; he wants us to go a level deeper on the concept. So, let&#8217;s poke at the interest rate/tech valuations conversation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One reason why startups are able to raise as much money as they are &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">record sums, recall</a> &#8212; is today&#8217;s low interest rate environment.</p>
<p>Interest rates are slim around the world, which means that money is <em>cheap</em>. Cheap money means that you can hire capital for not a lot of cost. Coinbase, for example, is <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2021/Coinbase-Announces-the-Upsize-and-Pricing-of-2.0-Billion-of-Senior-Notes-for-General-Corporate-Purposes-Including-Product-Development-and-Potential-MA/default.aspx">raising $2 billion in debt</a> at the moment that will come due in two tranches. The first, due in 2028, will yield 3.375%, while the second half, due in 2031, will yield 3.625%. Coinbase raised its target from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion thanks to investor interest. Money is inexpensive, so Coinbase is stacking a bunch of it on its side of the table from investors unable to find lower-risk, higher-yield places to stash their capital.</p>
<p>Cheap money means that you can&#8217;t expect much from loaning out your funds; bond yields are garbage today for that reason, which is great for companies like Coinbase and less great for capital pools in search of yield. Those same buckets of cash have gone fishing in other locales hoping for more profit per dollar, including the venture capital market. Ample capital has allowed venture capitalists to raise ever-larger funds, more quickly, and has allowed non-traditional investors to crowd into the startup market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A good chunk of the unicorn boom is predicated on this cheap money moment we find ourselves in.</p>
<p>But nothing lasts forever, and with the U.S. government getting <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/23/heres-what-will-happen-when-the-feds-tapering-starts-and-why-you-should-care.html">ready to start closing the taps on market-stimulating bond-buying</a> and eventually raising the domestic cost of money by boosting the target range for the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFEDTARU">Federal Funds Rate</a>, there is an expectation that certain assets will begin to lose some of their luster.</p>
<p>If money becomes more expensive, capital can make more money hiring itself to others; therefore, venture investing will become less attractive from a risk/reward perspective &#8212; again, in theory. At the same time, the stock market may reprice itself. Rock-bottom interest rates have led investors to buy up shares in growth-oriented companies because those firms were expected to have more valuation upside than similar investments into slower-growing companies were expected to post.</p>
<p>This particular trend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/what-happens-to-high-flying-startups-if-the-pandemic-trade-flips/">hit its zenith last summer</a>, when a number of industries were kneecapped by early-COVID restrictions and software stocks offered a way to still hunt yield through the prism of corporate <em>revenue growth, </em>payable not in a regular coupon disbursement but via market value accretion.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>In very broad terms, rising rates <em>should</em> make pouring capital into venture capital funds less attractive simply by making competing asset allocations more enticing. And rising rates may make the value-through-growth trade of public stocks less attractive as other shares cycle back into prominence.</p>
<p>There are technical explanations for the latter portion of our argument. Here are a few from the Sharma Twitter thread:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2208653" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.06.07-PM.png?w=595" alt="" width="595" height="101" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.06.07-PM.png 595w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.06.07-PM.png?resize=150,25 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.06.07-PM.png?resize=300,51 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.06.07-PM.png?resize=50,8 50w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2208654" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.05.57-PM.png?w=585" alt="" width="585" height="240" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.05.57-PM.png 585w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.05.57-PM.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.05.57-PM.png?resize=300,123 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-27-at-1.05.57-PM.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></p>
<p>But Sharma is not really after <em>that</em> set of answers. He is instead questioning conventional wisdom. <em>Why should it really be true</em>, he&#8217;s asking, <em>that tech stocks like Amazon and Salesforce will be worth less when rates rise &#8212; are they really worth less?</em> In the Sharma worldview, rising software and e-commerce total addressable market has made those two companies worth more than was previously anticipated; why should those gains go away if money gets more expensive?</p>
<p>We have to move not in absolutes, but in basis points, to get the argument here. Interest rates, when they do change, will change slowly. It doesn&#8217;t seem likely that many governments are going to rapidly spin the crank on the price of money. Changes will come gradually, and with caution.</p>

<p>So aside from <em>sentiment</em> shifts that might lead to related asset price alterations, or wind up being more extreme than structural evolution, we shouldn&#8217;t really expect much change to the key dynamics of the market today when rates <em>begin</em> to rise. Or, more simply, a 25-basis-point change to the Fed target rate (0.25%) won&#8217;t mean much by itself unless more hikes are expected in a regular, rapid fashion.</p>
<p>The value of Amazon and Salesforce <em>probably</em> shouldn&#8217;t change much when the price of money <em>starts</em> to creep higher. If rates manage to hit 5%, then, sure, Amazon&#8217;s market cap will probably decline in relation to the value of other assets, but that&#8217;s more a comparative shift than a demand that Salesforce et al. lose value.</p>
<p>Sharma is arguing the base case with a wink. He&#8217;s a software bull. But his question does raise a good point for us to chew on: When the underlying factors responsible for part of the boom in the value of software and the wave of investment into software do change, how quickly will valuations change? (Put another way, when what&#8217;s driving relative price appreciation of growth-oriented revenues compared to other assets and dollars flowing into SaaS changes, how fast will the results of those factors shift?)</p>
<p>Those anticipating a dramatic repricing of tech valuations by initial, incremental shifts to the price of money, I reckon, are expecting a bit more of an exclamation point than they will actually read.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/what-could-stop-the-startup-boom/">why The Exchange wrote the following the other week</a>, when discussing the current startup boom and its potential durability:</p>
<blockquote><p>But what we do think is possible to say with some certainty, or at least more than when a rebalancing of capital in the larger economy may occur, is that it will take a somewhat large shunt to knock the startup game off its current footing. Product demand coupled with funding interest is a killer combination for driving investment decisions — there’s capital chasing yield, and high-growth companies looking for capital. It’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O59JNz7rdIU">match made in heaven</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, many investors we’ve spoken to during this reporting cycle have been bullish about the quality of founders and startups they have the option of investing in. There’s not only market demand and capital, but what’s being built to answer the first with the help of the second is pretty good, at least in the view of the folks writing seven-, eight- and nine-figure checks to the startups in question.</p></blockquote>
<p>All business cycles cycle. All things that go up eventually lose some altitude. But the appetite for startup shares and tech shares more broadly won&#8217;t come back to Earth at 1 g. Instead, a more lunar-gravity descent seems more likely. Pending something new, of course.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Around 90% of startups ultimately fail, and the reasons leading to failure are well known: Undercapitalization, scaling challenges, lack of a competitive advantage or realistic IP. However, what about the 10% that succeed? What did they do to beat the odds?</p>
<p>To create a pathway for market success, startups need two essential assets groups: venture capital and creative capital.</p>
<p>Venture capital is formed of the financial and operational assets invested in a new, unproven business enterprise. Creative capital comprises the design and development assets that bring an ingenious idea to life.</p>
<p>Venture capital gets the most attention, but it’s creative capital that can ultimately last longer and potentially become more valuable.</p>
<p>Billion-dollar unicorns like Airbnb, Lynda.com (now LinkedIn Learning), Square, YouTube, Byju’s and Pinterest have benefited from “creative” founders who were physical and digital product designers, educators, developers and visualizers. These companies found great success by creating and amplifying stories and visualizations to spark interest.</p>
<p>Venture capital usually arrives after rigorous assessments and due diligence cycles are completed. However, when creative capital is developed and applied before venture capital, it helps speed up these assessments and analysis of a company’s concept, often accelerating product deployment, reducing founders’ dilution and improving valuations.</p>
<h2>So what is creative capital?<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Depending on your industry, creative capital is defined as a mix of strategic assets that may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target audience insights and data.</li>
<li>Visualizations of products, services, experiences, etc.</li>
<li>Branding, naming and communication systems.</li>
<li>Product design and engineering prototypes.</li>
<li>Preliminary development cost projections.</li>
<li>Network partner sourcing and introductions.</li>
<li>Future product extensions and roadmaps.</li>
<li>Digital content, platforms and setup.</li>
<li>IP identification and development.</li>
<li>Advisory expertise for investors.</li>
</ul>
<p>These assets are almost always created to combine with business planning and introduction purposes, eventually helping companies bring their ideas to life.</p>
<h2>Why creative capital?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile spyware is one of the most invasive and targeted kinds of unregulated surveillance, since it can be used to track where you go, who you see and what you talk about. And because of its stealthy nature, mobile spyware can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/stalkerware-apps-google-ads/">be nearly impossible</a> to detect.</p>
<p>But now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">one Y Combinator-backed startup</a> is building an app with the aim of helping anyone identify potential <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">mobile spyware</a> on their phones.</p>
<p>Malloc, a Cyprus-based early-stage company, made its debut with <a href="https://www.mallocprivacy.com/mallocproducts/">Antistalker</a>, an app that monitors the sensors and apps running on a phone — initially for Android only — to detect if the microphone or camera is quietly activated or data transmitted without the user&#8217;s knowledge. That&#8217;s often a hallmark of consumer-grade spyware, which can also steal messages, photos, web browsing history and real-time location data from a victim&#8217;s phone without their permission.</p>
<p>The rising threat of spyware has prompted both <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211876">Apple</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#mic-camera-indicators">Google</a> to introduce indicators when a device&#8217;s microphone or camera are used. But some of the more elusive and more capable spyware — the spyware typically used by governments and nation states — can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security/">slip past the hardened defenses</a> built into iOS and Android.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Malloc says Antistalker comes in. Malloc&#8217;s co-founders Maria Terzi, Artemis Kontou and Liza Charalambous built the app around a machine learning (ML) model, which allows the app to detect and block device activity that could be construed as spyware recording or sending data.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208536" style="width: 1090px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208536" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2208536 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208536" class="wp-caption-text">Malloc co-founders Liza Charalambous (left), Maria Terzi (middle), Artemis Kontou (right). <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Malloc/supplied</p></div></p>
<p>Terzi, who specializes in ML, told TechCrunch that the startup trained its ML model using known stalkerware apps to help simulate real-world surveillance. Machine learning helps to improve the app&#8217;s ability to detect a broad range of new and previously unknown threats over time, rather than relying on the more traditional methods of scanning for signatures of known spyware apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already know applications that are spyware. Why don&#8217;t we use their behavior to train a machine learning model that will then be able to recognize new spyware?&#8221; Terzi told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The ML model runs on the device to be more privacy-preserving than sending data to the cloud. Malloc said it collects some anonymized data to improve the ML model over time, to help the app to detect more threats as they emerge on users&#8217; devices.</p>
<p>The app also looks for anomalous app activity, like bursts of data sent by apps that haven&#8217;t been used for days, and allows the user to look at which apps have accessed the microphone and camera and when.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bet that&#8217;s already catching the eyes of investors, with the startup securing close to $2 million from Y Combinator and the Urban Innovation Fund.</p>
<p>Terzi said the company has more than 80,000 monthly active users — and growing — since it launched earlier this year, and plans an enterprise offering to help companies protect their employees from surveillance threats. The company is also planning to launch an iOS app in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Car enthusiasts have a history of electric-car hesitancy. While some are fully on board with electrification and hybridization, there are still some petrol holdouts, especially at the rarified and pointy end-of-the-price spectrum like Lamborghini.</p>
<p>The push for electrification and hybrid powertrains poses a significant challenge to the carmaker known for creating striking, bespoke containers for some of the most powerful gasoline engines in the world, and there&#8217;s a small sense of reluctance about it from Lamborghini&#8217;s top brass.</p>
<p>Lamborghini has said it will shift all models to hybrid powertrains by 2024 and already announced one hybrid model, the exceedingly limited run Lamborghini Sián FKP 37 and the Countach LPI 800-4. By next year, the first production (i.e., not limited run) vehicle with a hybridized powertrain will be released, though Lamborghini is still mum on what exactly that will look like. While other supercar makers like Ferrari, McLaren and Porsche continue to make both production and limited run vehicles with hybrid powertrains, Lamborghini is one of the last supercar companies to get into the game.</p>
<p>Lamborghini hopes to leverage its loyal customers to innovate around the future of their iconic super sports cars.</p>
<h2>The future of fuel for Lamborghini</h2>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, we are super niche &#8212; and make up a very small part of the CO2 equation. But we want to do our part,&#8221; Andrea Baldi, the new North American CEO of Lamborghini said at a recent launch event for one of the last gas-powered Huracáns that Lamborghini will release, the Huracán STO. &#8220;The shift to hybrid, electric and alternative powertrains is forcing us to rethink performance and we&#8217;re not sure that electrification is the long-term direction to move in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether we release a fourth model with a hybrid or electric powertrain or find a solution for internal combustion that uses a different kind of fuel, we&#8217;re still learning. We need to deliver on a common target: Emotion and the authentic Lamborghini experience,&#8221; Baldi says.</p>
<p>He wouldn&#8217;t elaborate on specifics around the kind of fuel or technology the company might employ but Lamborghini CTO Maurizio Reggiani did allude to some interesting research that could point to a fully electrified Lamborghini in the future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Hybrid powertrains are the next frontier where we are sure we can innovate,&#8221; Reggiani said separately. &#8220;We exist because we have unique DNA. We are engineering emotion and there is some research we&#8217;re doing with the Polytechnic University in Milan on how physical events like vibration, for example, can impact the flow of emotion.&#8221; It&#8217;s possible to see a world where the physical effects of an ICE engine are simulated by gyroscopes and audio tracks.</p>
<p>Technically, Lamborghini&#8217;s factory in Sant&#8217;Agata Bolognese has been carbon neutral since 2015, Baldi says, but the 1,800-person company is part of the much larger, and much more carbon-emitting VW Group. Yet, despite its low volume of vehicles and a concerted push from the Italian government to exempt automakers like Lamborghini and Ferrari from the coming combustion engine ban, Lamborghini is being forced to move toward an alternative-fuel future.</p>
<p>Baldi says that one in 11,000 vehicles in the world is a Lamborghini, which is tiny compared to a massive automaker like Toyota or Honda. &#8220;Hybridization and electrification offer the opportunity to expand the future of emotion for the Lamborghini owner. You&#8217;re buying a dream. The majority of customers are looking for a car that expresses their success,&#8221; Baldi says. Yet, no matter how much Lamborghini customers want their combustion engines to continue well into the future, the time for those engines is coming to a close.</p>
<h2>Building a direct customer connection</h2>
<p>Meeting customer demands has always been at the heart of the Lamborghini brand and the company is leveraging its loyal owners to determine the future model direction as it works toward a 50% reduction in CO2 starting in 2025. The recent launch of the already sold out Countach LPI 800-4 at Pebble Beach is an example of how Lamborghini is using its customer base to create a new, high-demand product with a hybrid powertrain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t just create vehicles in a vacuum. The whole customer experience has enriched the bonds we have with our customers,&#8221; Baldi said. &#8220;The special project we did with the Countach &#8212; that was an exercise of trust directly between the company and the customer. We had 1-to-1 meetings as if they were friends and that helped inform what we did with Countach. Building that vehicle was an emotional decision and it was a good business case.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the advent of COVID and resulting limits on travel, factory visits were largely halted during 2020, but Lamborghini was ahead of the game having launched a digital platform called Unica, back in 2018, that allowed them to deliver the specialized customer contact and service that owners expect. The app can be downloaded to a smartphone and owners gain access to exclusive events, launches and social media. In order to sign up, you have to provide the VIN of your Lamborghini and your certificate of ownership.</p>
<p>The app has opened up the possibility of direct sales between the company and consumers, as a result. &#8220;Direct sales is where we need to explore. We are in an age of acceleration, and we want to have a direct relationship with customers. The question is how much can we expand the direct touch with customers?&#8221; Baldi said. &#8220;To ensure a sense that the value of the car will be preserved means we have to have high-touch customer relationships. The average wait for a car is currently more than a year, right now. The wait time is selling these cars and the value is preserved because we have direct contact with customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latest Lamborghini model, the Huracán STO, a street homologated race car, is currently sold out until 2022 and comes with added connectivity via the Unica app and the vehicle. The system allows owners to record lap times, throttle and brake input, steering angle and video of laps on a track and upload the data to the app. There, owners can share their information with other Lamborghini owners, their friends, the company or their race coaches to continue to improve their performance. It becomes a sort of elite social network for Lamborghini owners and offers the company a way to connect in more direct ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;Customers demand the right context to experience a Lamborghini,&#8221; Baldi said. &#8220;Supersport cars are expanding. If we can offer these experiences in auto lifestyle and motorsport, and expand to more high touch, customers will stay within the brand.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When sister duo Claudia and Carolina Recchi were first building <a href="https://www.edsights.io/">EdSights</a>, they used a big guiding question.</p>
<p>“In a perfect world [where] we somehow had a magic wand that allowed us to collect the data on whatever we want on our fingers, what would we want to know to prevent [college] students from dropping out?,” Claudia said. The co-founder’s first few years were spent understanding data points, whether it was helping connect students to the right resources or simply hearing their concerns and communicating them to decision-makers. They landed on using a chatbot as a service that could both effectively check in with college students and collect data in a timely way.</p>
<p>The chatbot got a deep injection of vulnerability amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, the startup began selling its services to universities in search of better ways to retain and engage students, especially as the pandemic locked down campus’ and left students more alone than ever.</p>

<p>Last year, EdSights&#8217; product was defined by its chatbot. Branded under the guise of a school’s mascot, the chatbot would send personalized questions and messages to students to understand their biggest stresses. It then would connect them to university resources ranging from financial aid to food and security services. EdSights sold the service to universities in search of better ways to retain and engage students, especially as the pandemic disrupted basic communication across the world.</p>
<p>The startup announced today that it has raised a $5 million Series A led by Album VC, the same firm that led early investments in Podium, Andela and Degreed. Other investors in the round include Lakehouse, Good Friends, Chegg CEO Dan Rosensweig and GSV Ventures’ Deborah Quazzo. With the new cash, EdSights’ total known capital raised to date is $8 million.</p>
<p>The new money isn’t without momentum. EdSights declined to share specific numbers, but shared that it sports 6x annual revenue growth. It also landed 70 customers, which can be colleges, institutions or universities, which is up from 16 last May. Co-founder Carolina Recchi, who built the company alongside her sister Claudia, said that their company is “very close to being profitable” and would be if they chose to stop hiring additional people. She estimates that EdSights will hit profitability in 14 months given these new growth goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>A constant challenge for EdSights is if it can spark action based off of the visibility that it provides. Universities notoriously deal with red tape, which could halt new initiatives or fast deployment, which could hurt how EdSights&#8217; return of investment plays out. The co-founders positioned a counterargument, saying that the student body data will help universities spend smarter on resources that students demand, and cut costs on newly irrelevant services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Universities are inefficient about how much money they spend, so I think we&#8217;re really uncovering when that happens,&#8221; Carolina said. &#8220;And I think that&#8217;s really why data is important&#8230;it&#8217;s the next phase of optimizing higher ed.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the startup doesn&#8217;t plan to just consult. Eventually, EdSights wants to start providing in-demand services such as mental health specialists, financial resources and career readiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you reach a certain level of scale and actually understand, what do we do about the areas in which the institution cannot help?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Is there someone else that can? And can that be us?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re changing the name of our membership product to TechCrunch+. We’re doing so for a few reasons but mainly because you know and trust TechCrunch to bring you the best alpha possible in the startup ecosystem. We also feel that the work the team is doing to provide our subscribers with a <em>more</em>, <em>better </em>and<em> deeper </em>signal isn’t “extra.” It’s table stakes to serve our kind of informed and dedicated audience.</p>
<p>Some TechCrunch+ updates will be rolling out on the site today, with more coming in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Beyond the logo and name change, we&#8217;ve also expanded our offering to support more locations around the world. Within the next quarter, we hope to have access available in most major startup ecosystems on the planet and soon, everywhere.</p>
<p>TechCrunch+ includes more membership types than we had in 2019. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/08/how-to-claim-a-student-discount-for-extra-crunch/">Student, military and government discounts are available</a>, plus we also offer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/save-25-with-extra-crunch-group-membership/">group memberships</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we&#8217;ve improved our integration with our events business. Our weekly video series, Extra Crunch Live, is now a free product, and it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/check-out-the-amazing-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-cru-ahem-techcrunch-live/">has been renamed TechCrunch Live</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A few highlights from the event series include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/pilot-ceo-waseem-daher-tears-down-his-companys-60m-series-c-pitch-deck/">Pilot CEO Waseem Daher tears down his company’s $60M Series C pitch deck</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The response for the event has been positive and we want to bring the event series to more readers. While attendance for TechCrunch Live will be free, VOD will remain behind the paywall. VOD from other TechCrunch events like Disrupt will also stay behind the paywall. Expect further integration and activation opportunities with TechCrunch+ when events (hopefully) return to in-person in 2022.</p>
<p>Our customer support email has been changed to <a href="mailto:plus@techcrunch.com">plus@techcrunch.com</a>, and we have a new Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/techcrunchplus">here</a>.</p>
