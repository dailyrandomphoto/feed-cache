					<description><![CDATA[South African tech talent marketplace OfferZen is one of the beneficiaries of the growing global demand for tech workers: It confirmed to TechCrunch that it has raised €4.5 million ($5.07 million) in Series A funding from South African investment company Base Capital.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South African tech talent marketplace <a href="https://www.offerzen.com/">OfferZen</a> is one of the beneficiaries of the growing global demand for tech workers: It confirmed to TechCrunch that it has raised €4.5 million ($5.07 million) in Series A funding from South African investment company Base Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is OfferZen’s first round of funding since <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/philipjoubert">Philip Joubert</a>, <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/malanj">Malan Joubert</a> and <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/brettjones">Brett Jones</a> founded the company in 2015</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a tech talent marketplace, OfferZen allows software developers and engineers to sign up as candidates who are then curated by OfferZen and made available to companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developers are live on the marketplace for four weeks, during which OfferZen guarantees that they’ll get contacted by different companies. The developers are only allowed to work permanent roles, the company said.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240731" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OfferZen operated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in South Africa for four and a half years until April 2020, when it expanded to the Netherlands after acquiring an Amsterdam-based recruitment tech startup called TryCatch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to OfferZen CEO Philip Joubert, over 1,000 companies and 100,000 software developers use the tech talent marketplace. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of its customers from both ends of the marketplace </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in South Africa, the Netherlands, and parts of Europe like the U.K. and Germany, which are prominent hubs for global talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion to the Netherlands and servicing parts of Europe contributed heavily to OfferZen’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth in the second half of this year, experiencing a 29% increase in placements between Q3 and Q4 alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tech hiring came to a near standstill in the first half of 2020 due to COVID. Since then, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we’ve seen a huge acceleration in the market &#8212; companies are now raising far more capital than they were pre-pandemic, investing more in technology and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hiring much faster,” the CEO said in a statement. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Access to top tech talent has become the bottleneck for many companies and we’re in a position to help companies solve that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OfferZen doesn’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> income-sharing agreements, a revenue model adopted by tech talent companies such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/lambda-school-rebrand-bloom-institute-of-technology/">Bloom Institute of Technology</a> (formerly Lambda School), or hourly rate charges, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/softbank-sinks-200m-into-andela-propels-company-into-unicorn-territory/">Andela</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/freelancer-marketplace-toptal-sues-andela-and-ex-employees-alleging-theft-of-trade-secrets/">Toptal</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the South African tech talent company makes money only off companies via two models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first is a pay-per-placement model with a one-off 12.5% fee of the developer’s first salary. So, for instance, if a company hires a developer for $100,000, it pays OfferZen $12,500 as commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second model is an annual subscription offering for companies that recruit lots of developers at once, paying upfront for OfferZen services. OfferZen says this model accounts for 40% of its revenue, while the rest is from the pay-per-hire model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On competition, Joubert mentioned that what sets OfferZen apart from players such as Honeypot and Talent.io is how well the company focuses on building an engaged developer community through events and various channels as well as its sourcing process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a solid user base with very high-quality developers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in our developer community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So we’re very, very well known [and] we invest a lot in the community,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also simplify the sourcing process. So we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obviously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have a lot of candidates on our platform, which is a good thing, but then companies also want to find the most relevant candidates. And so we have a sophisticated matching engine that shows the most relevant candidates for the positions that companies are currently hiring for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said most of the fresh funding would be plowed into OfferZen’s tech community. In addition, as OfferZen deepens its expansion into Europe into two more countries next year, a chunk of the money will go into growing its operations, product and growth teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Joubert brothers and Jones first conceived the idea behind OfferZen, they all lived in Silicon Valley, working as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> software developers. And although they had friends with similar professions in Africa, they realized that opportunity wasn’t democratized. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had a bunch of friends back in South Africa, who were very smart as developers, but they weren’t working at great companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And the reason they weren’t doing that was that they, I guess, [had] too many barriers to getting a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> great job where they were,” the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OfferZen connects developers to various local and global companies such as Luno, ABSA, MMI Holdings, Takealot, WeTransfer, Adyen and Catawiki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to this raise, OfferZen bootstrapped with the founders&#8217; money. It opted to raise money now because it needed venture capital to expand into more European territories, Joubert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had built up a business in such a frugal way, and of course, without raising funding and bootstrapping, you’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forced to design a really strong business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” he said. “Now we are seeing all these opportunities that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be tackled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faster if we raise funding. So we decided, let’s raise some funding, now we can grow the team ahead of revenue, which we haven’t been able to do before. We can do that, take on the European market and expand faster.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spain&#8217;s <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com/">Jobandtalent</a>, a &#8220;workforce marketplace&#8221;-cum-digital temping agency which uses AI to match workers to casual labor gigs in sectors like warehousing, ecommerce and logistics, has closed a $500 million Series E round of funding led by Kinnevik and with what it bills as a &#8220;significant&#8221; follow on by SoftBank VisionFund 2.</p>
<p>Existing investors including Atomico, DN, Infravia, Kibo and Quadrille also participated in the round &#8212; which the startup said values its business at $2.35BN (post-money).</p>
<p>Alongside the equity raise, the 2009-founded startup has secured another chunk of debt financing ($75M) from Blackrock.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240801" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Jobandtalent says the latest funds will be used to accelerate its expansion in key markets, including the US &#8212; its most recent focus. Earlier this year (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/jobandtalent-takes-120m-from-softbank-to-enter-the-us-market/">March</a>), it announced a $120M Series D (as well as $100M in debt financing) which it said it would use to enter the US.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VUtbBEVhG7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/jobandtalent-takes-120m-from-softbank-to-enter-the-us-market/">Jobandtalent takes $120M from Softbank to enter the US market</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jobandtalent takes $120M from Softbank to enter the US market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/jobandtalent-takes-120m-from-softbank-to-enter-the-us-market/embed/#?secret=VUtbBEVhG7" data-secret="VUtbBEVhG7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Flush with Series E cash, it plans to &#8220;significantly&#8221; increase the size of its tech and sales team over the next two years, and also says it will add &#8220;key&#8221; exec roles &#8212; as it seeks to scale in the US and deepen its business in Europe.</p>
<p>Currently it offers a temporary labor service in nine markets globally: Spain, the UK, Germany, France, Sweden, Portugal, Mexico, Colombia and the US &#8212; matching workers looking for temp roles with employers in need of casual labor in (with a focus on sectors like manufacturing and logistics).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span class="il">Jobandtalent</span> is by far the largest <span class="il">job</span> platform in Europe. We are just starting to grow in the US, <span class="il">and</span> this round of funding will help us accelerate those plans <span class="il">and</span> become market leaders there as well,&#8221; the startup told us.</p>
<p>Its gig-finding pitch also comes with a promise of &#8220;stability&#8221; for the temps on its books &#8212; via an AI-aided pipeline of &#8220;consistent work&#8221;; and benefits for temps that it says are more akin to being employed (and can include pensions, sick and holiday pay, health insurance, and training courses).</p>
<p>Temp workers apply for and manage roles, submit paperwork, sign contracts, and get paid via the Jobandtalent app &#8212; so it&#8217;s streamlining and taking over a range of back office functions for employers dealing with temps (who it directly employs) in addition to helping simplify the process of finding work (and, indeed, being paid for it) for those who rely on seasonal and/or temp gigs to earn a living.</p>
<p>Its UK website includes fairly visible links to a <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com/whistleblowing/WHISTLEBLOWING_POLICY.pdf">whistleblowing policy</a> and a <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com/modern-slavery-statement">statement on modern slavery</a> &#8212; as well as a link to (multi-lingual) instructions on <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com/labour_exploitation/REPORTING_HIDDEN_LABOUR_EXPLOITATION.pdf">reporting hidden labor exploitation</a>.</p>
<p>The startup touts an average NPS score for workers on its platform of 56 vs an industry average that it says stands at just 18.</p>
<p>In the first nine months of 2021, Jobandtalent says its platform was used to match more than 100,000 workers to casual roles. (That&#8217;s up on since earlier this year, when it said more than 80,000 workers had used its marketplace to find temporary roles at that point.)</p>
<p>It also says more than 1,300 companies are now signed up to source workers via its platform, including DHL, FedEx, XPO, Ceva Logistics, eBay, IKEA, Kuehne &amp; Nagel, JD Sports, Ocado, Sainsbury’s, Argos and GLS &#8212; up from 850+ companies back in March.</p>
<p>Its business growth rate is 130% annually, with Jobandtalent adding that it&#8217;s been EBITDA positive since the second half of 2020. It also told us its annual revenue run rate is now more than €1BN.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even with the current pressure in the labour market, we are able to find and match workers with roles at a much higher success rate than other,&#8221; suggested Juan Urdiales, co-founder and CEO, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to accelerate the expansion of our team and grow our presence in both new and existing markets &#8212; helping more workers find the jobs they want, and helping businesses fill the roles they need.”</p>
<p>Also commenting on the funding in a statement, Natalie Tydeman, senior investment director at Kinnevik, added: “Jobandtalent’s workforce-as-a-service platform is disrupting the modern labour market and placing people back at the centre of employment. By offering a personalised service driven by data and proprietary technology, Jobandtalent is simplifying the experience of finding work for thousands of people and transforming it for the better. We’re proud to be working with Juan and the team to accelerate the growth of the business.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With key ESG reporting regulations such as the EU Taxonomy and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) covering more than 75 percent of European companies, across the EU and the UK, the regulatory environment is evolving fast.</p>
<p>Non-financial data, such as carbon emissions, is catching up with financial reporting burdens. And it’s not just the Environmental (“E”), it’s also social factors (&#8220;S&#8221;) and corporate governance (&#8220;G&#8221;).</p>
<p>Now, Berlin-based Greentech startup <a href="https://plana.earth/">Plan A</a>, which recently raised a $10M Series A round &#8211; has developed a new SaaS tool to cover this ESG reporting in an automated fashion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240823" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It says its integrated module “automates measurement, analysis, and reporting of ESG performance, providing a central data management and reporting platform.”</p>
<p>This idea is that sustainability managers, also within VCs, can now peer into the ESG rating of their subsidiaries, portfolio companies, and suppliers through the Plan A Platform, reducing reduces data collection and analysis efforts to less onerous levels.</p>
<p>Plan A recently closed its Series A financing round at the beginning of November, six months after its Seed funding in March.</p>
<p>It plans to expand the decarbonization tooling and Scope 3 calculations for various industries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Berlin-based Greentech will also continue its international expansion, so that the current locations in Berlin, Paris, and Munich will be followed by others in the coming year, including London.</p>
<p>Lubomila Jordanova, cofounder and CEO of Plan A, said: &#8220;Regulatory pressure is increasing. Investors, employees, and consumers are placing ever-growing importance on companies reporting their ESG impact and developing sustainable business models in line with their values. Our goal is to support them in this transformation process with innovative, digital tools.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.maplevc.com/">Maple VC</a> is based in San Francisco, but don&#8217;t let that fool you, says its founder, Andre Charoo. The young fund, which launched in 2016 with $1.2 million in capital commitments, just closed on $16.5 million in capital commitments for a second fund that promises to almost exclusively back savvy Canadian founders, no matter where they live today and no matter what they are building, as long as tech is at the core of their startup.</p>
<p>Says Charoo &#8212; a Toronto native who worked briefly at at the early photo-sharing app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/color-says-not-shutting-down/">Color</a>, spent a year helping Uber expand into Canada in 2011, then logged more than seven years as a VP with the hiring platform Hired as he got Maple VC off the ground &#8212; &#8220;I&#8217;m a generalist who specializes in backing founders with Canadian roots.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a marketing approach that manages to be both specific and broad, and it snagged the interest of an enviable group of investment firms that are among the new fund&#8217;s limited partners, including Tiger Global, Foundry Group, Recast Capital, Insight Partners and Plexo Capital. Promising early investments from Maple&#8217;s debut fund also helped meaningfully, says Charoo. We talked with him earlier today about some of those deals, what raising capital from his backers was like, and how he&#8217;s putting Maple&#8217;s new fund to work.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241028" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>TC: You describe Maple as the first and only fund whose sole goal is to fund the Canadian diaspora at the seed stage. Why do these founders need your capital?</strong></p>
<p>AC: I was born and raised in a suburb of Toronto and attended the University of Toronto, and I tried and failed to get a job in finance in Canada, whereas when I got here to the US, I received multiple offers on Wall Street [and worked at Wachovia Securities]. It left me a little frustrated and asking this question of why I was good enough to get a job on Wall Street but not the equivalent in Canada.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about this is many of the founders I meet who leave Canada have a very similar story. They get rejected in Canada, they go to Silicon Valley, and they get backed by some of the best VCs in the world. For example, Marcelo Cortes, the cofounder and CTO at Faire and a fellow Canadian, tried to raise a seed round in Canada in 2017. No one would buy. So he went to Silicon Valley, got backing by a top tier fund and just last week, he announced that Faire just closed on $400 million in funding at a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wholesale-marketplace-faire-raises-400-million-11637056802">$12.4 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Isn&#8217;t there a big difference between 2021 versus 2017, thanks to formerly employees of Shopify and other companies that have seen exits? Where are you seeing angels coming from, and do you work closely with networks there to source deals?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AC: Ironically, I&#8217;m outside of Canada, again because I believe some of the best founders have left Canada . . and arguably aren&#8217;t tied to those angel networks in Canada and will not be calling Canadian VCs.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You wrote nine checks out of your first fund. What are some of the companies that stood out for prospective LPs?</strong></p>
<p>ACL Yes. All Day Kitchens, centered on restaurant tech, was in that fund. There&#8217;s a biotech company called Vision that&#8217;s automatically tracking nutrition in that fund. RenoRun [a platform for general contractors to source materials] is another. Aalto, a home marketplace that Sequoia followed on, is in that fund, as is [digital home management platform] Setter, which was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201208005876/en/Thumbtack-Acquires-Digital-Home-Management-Platform-Setter-Adding-New-Maintenance-Capability-for-Homeowners">acquired</a> by Thumbtack, which has led to Maple being a proud shareholder of Thumbtack at the moment.</p>
<p>Altogether, I’ve written 27 checks totaling $12 million to companies across both funds, and that includes SPVs.</p>

<p><strong>TC: What were some of those fundraising conversations like for this much bigger second fund? Were they quick, given everyone has so much money to deploy and you&#8217;re developing a track record that illustrates a strong network, or was it a drawn-out process?</strong></p>
<p>AC:  Some of them were long, Connie [laughs]. Some of them were long, some were short. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to be part of some of the diversity initiatives for some of my LPs, including Insight Partners and Alpaca VC. It&#8217;s been great to see firms engaged this way.</p>
<p>Look, I think being a person of color has actually made me a better VC. Not only am I frequently the only Black professional in the room, which has given me this unique perspective and ability to go against the grain and look for outliers, but it has helped me build a really diverse portfolio. I&#8217;m proud to say that 70% of the founders I&#8217;ve backed are people of color and at least 30% are women.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&#8217;s a wide range. Some have [committed] to participate within the first call; some have taken a full year to get over the line.</p>

<p><strong>TC: I interviewed one of your founders back in May named Kate Hiscox, whose company, Sivo, a debt-as-a-service provider, was a very big bet for you.</strong></p>
<p>AC: That is true. Sivo represents 20% of my funds, whereas average checks range from $500,000 to $1 million. I personally think Kate is a killer founder &#8212; from Canada &#8212; and there was just a lot of evidence from the team she put together before she had [raised] a penny [that this was a huge] opportunity that she was going after.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have enough flexibility in your investing mandate to back a team without Canadian founders?</strong></p>
<p>AC: I have LPS who are like &#8216;Hey, Andre, you&#8217;re in some amazing networks in Silicon Valley. Are you going to say no to a founder who is sitting across the table from you who is not from Canada?&#8217; The answer is that I&#8217;m open to backing [other founders]. My goal is to build a top-tier seed-seed stage fund. I just happen to believe that this cohort of founders with Canadian roots is the way I&#8217;m going to get there.</p>

<p><a href="https://harrison.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harrison.ai</a>, a Sydney-based company that creates medical devices with AI technology, announced today it has raised $129 million AUD (about $92.3 million USD) in what it says is one of the largest Series B rounds ever for an Australian startup.</p>
<p>The funding was led by returning investor Horizons Ventures, and included participation from new investors Sonic Healthcare and I-MED Radiology Network. Existing backers Blackbird Ventures and Skip Capital also returned for the round, which brings Harrison.ai’s total raised over the past two years to $158 million AUD.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241360" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Harrison.ai announced it has also formed a joint venture with Sonic Healthcare, one of the world’s largest medical diagnostics providers, to develop and commercialize new clinical AI solutions in pathology. The partnership will focus first on histopathology, or the diagnosis of tissue diseases.</p>
<p>This follows another joint venture Harrison.ai formed with I-MED Radiology in early 2020, creating Annalise.ai to develop AI-based radiology diagnostic support tools.</p>
<p>Harrison.ai CEO Dr. Aengus Tran told TechCrunch he became a doctor to help as many people as he could. “As I looked more into artificial intelligence, I fell in love with the idea of using AI to help more people than I ever could my lifetime.”</p>
<p>Harrison.ai was started with his brother Dimitry to scale the global capacity of quality of healthcare by giving clinicians AI-based tools. Dr. Tran said that Annalise.ai was able to release its first regulatory-approved product within 18 months, an AI tool that detects clinical findings on chest X-rays.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding will also be used to hire more AI data scientists and engineers, and form clinical partnerships around the world to expand into new healthcare areas. Harrison.ai says its AI-based technology can help improve the diagnosis process in places where there is a healthcare shortage.</p>
<p>“COVID has intensified the inequities and struggles the global healthcare system was already under, especially in critical areas like radiology and pathology,” said Dr. Tran. “For the past decade and more we have seen a critical shortage of radiologists in both developed and developing markets, and that has only gotten worse as COVID led to further skills shortages and a backlog of elective procedures and requirements.”</p>
<p>He added that Harrison.ai’s AI-based technology is designed to help scale healthcare systems, and are not meant to replace clinicians. “We’re giving them the tools to make critical healthcare decisions quickly, and at scale, with the help of artificial intelligence.”</p>
<p>Harrison.ai currently has teams in Australia, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, and plans to expand into other countries soon. Its products are ready for market in Australia, the UK, Europe and some Asian countries, Dr. Tran said. The company’s goal is to expand into other markets, with the goal of helping one million patients a day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More investor money is flowing into Indonesia’s startup ecosystem. Today, <a href="https://acv.vc/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AC Ventures</a>, which focuses early-stage startups in the country, announced it has raise $205 million in committed capital for its oversubscribed Fund II, more than double its original target of $80 million. Investors include World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Disrupt AD, the venture development platform of Abu Dhabi Developmental Holdings. This brings the firm’s total assets under management to about $380 million.</p>
<p>AC Venture’s Fund III has been actively investing since its first close in March 2020, and has now completed 30 out of its 35 targeted investments, and says it is on track to deploy over $100 million by the end of 2021. All of its investments were in pre-Series A stage startups. The firm says many portfolio companies gained traction during the COVID-19 pandemic, with some, like Shipper, Stockbit, Ula, Aruna, Bukuwarung and Colearn, reaching “centaur” status, or a valuation of at least $100 million. AC Ventures also says Fund III is delivering strong early returns, with a MOIC (multiple on invested capital) of 1.94X less than two years after its first close.</p>
<p>Back in October 2020, when TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/ac-ventures-announces-the-first-close-of-its-80-million-fund-for-indonesian-startups/">covered Fund III’s first close</a>, its target was $80 million. That number increased, until finally reaching more than $200 million. Fund III’s typical check size varies widely. Founder and managing partner Adrian Li told TechCrunch that having a larger fund size gives AC Ventures the flexibility to deploy the right amount of capital based on the stage of a startup, so it doesn’t have to worry about finding co-investors or other srouces of capital. This means that depending traction and sector, Fund III’s first check sizes can range from a few hundred thousand dollars to several million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241343" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“I think with the increased traction of the portfolio during COVID and a step up in global interest in Asian companies, startups have raised faster than,” said Li. “The larger fund allows us to make sure we can keep our pro ratas and maintain ownership percentages in the best companies.”</p>
<p>He adds that at the beginning of 2021, it “became clear that technology companies were being relied on more than ever to help people continue their daily lives, whether shopping, paying or even entertainment, and that was quickly reflected in the public markets.” He added, “I think the turning point was probably August or September last year. From then, institutional investors and LPs began to realize that COVID was not going away in the short term. They therefore started looking for companies that were “having huge moments of adoption, new users and new user frequency by existing users, and Indonesia was a stand out.”</p>

<p>AC Ventures two earlier funds returned 2.99X and 2.41X gross MOICs, and they include unicorns Xendit and Carsome. The firm’s portfolio companies have also raised a total of more than $500 million in follow-on funding from investors like Sequoia, Tiger Global and Prosus.</p>
<p>The firm started investing in 2014 as Convergence Ventures and in 2019, became AC Ventures through a merger with Agaeti Venture Capital. It now has a total of more than 100 portfolio companies, which AC Ventures says makes it one of the largest Indonesian-focused early-stage venture capital firms.</p>
<p>Many of AC Ventures’ partners, including Li, are former entrepreneurs who have worked in markets like the United States, China and Indonesia. As a result, he says they are uniquely positioned to work closely with startups from early stage to exits. For example, AC Ventures helps its portfolio companies hire key talent, introduces them to the right business partnerships to scale and helps with downstream financing. Having a larger fund gives AC Ventures more ability to invest in wha tthey call their value creation team, or a group of experts in areas like data operations and growth and scaling.</p>
<p>“Building a specific team whose sole objective is to increase the value of our portfolio companies through their advice and interactions is someting that’s really excites us. With a small fund, it’s hard to build an operational team to help portfolio companies, but now with the larger fund size, we’re able to invest into that,” said Li.</p>
<p>Since it works with very early-stage startups, AC Ventures has developed specific strategies for deciding on investments. For example, it makes decisions using a comparable market and business model analysis to understand new sectors.</p>

<p>Li says AC Ventures invests in companies with great teams and strong ideas, or companies that have bootstrapped their way to having customers and revenue. “There isn’t a hard and fast rule, but what we want to do is come into companies as early as possible, where we have built a conviction around the team and market so we can be a longstanding partner in them as they grow.”</p>
<p>At early stages, “there’s not much data you can underwrite on,” he added. “Fortunately, investing in Indonesia, we have the benefit of hindsight for models that have worked around the world and the ability to analyze where certain markets are in Indonesia, relative to the total country and the economic development of the national. We can do a lot of market and business model research and so on, all up front. We can see if this model looks right, if it’s got big potential, if it’s a business model that’s worked well in markets like China or India.”</p>
<p>AC Ventures has also done quantitative and qualitative analysis of its most successful portfolio companies, and honed in on a set of signals that identify the founding teams with the most potential. Li said this gives the firm a more objective way of ranking early-stage startups.</p>
<p>For example, it’s important for at least one of the founders, usually the CEO, to have the strong capability to convey their vision to relevant stakeholders, constituents or first users and business partnerships. When AC Ventures asks founders about their business, they also need to be able to go into detail, including all their numbers, what works and what doesn’t. “Running a business, there are all these devils in the details that are very necessary, so you know what experiments to run, how to ititerate your product. There’s a lot to take in at the early stage of a business, but we find it critical that the founding team is really on top of that.”</p>
<p>In statement about IFC’s investment in AC Ventures’ Fund III, Azam Khan, IFC country manager for Indonesia, Malaysia and Timor-Leste said, “IFC’s partnership with AC Ventures underscores our long-term commitment to Indonesia’s economic development and digital transformation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bangalore-based fintech startup Simpl has raised $40 million as it looks to expand its online buy now, pay later service’s offerings in the world’s second-largest market.</p>
<p>Valar Ventures and IA Ventures led the six-year-old startup’s Series B round. LFH Ventures and some existing investors also participated in the round, said the startup, which has raised $83 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="http://getsimpl.com">Simpl</a> partners with popular online brands and offers their customers the ability to make purchases without paying for them at that very moment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241293" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the years, additionally, it has also developed a range of offerings including a one-time checkout feature; Bill Box, which allows customers to automate their recurring expense payouts, and splitting a bill in three parts, to build a &#8220;full-stack solution,&#8221; said Nitya Sharma, co-founder and chief executive of Simpl, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Some of Simpl’s partners include telecom network Jio Platforms, food delivery service Zomato, pharmacy 1MG, grocer BigBasket and ticketing platform MakeMyTrip.</p>
<p>Buy now, pay later services have existed in India for several years but have started to gain fast traction only in recent quarters as e-commerce and digital payments increase their reach in the country.</p>
<p>One of the factors that is making these services popular among consumers is the trust deficit that exists between them and the services with which they are engaging, said Sharma, pointing to continued popularity of cash as the payment method for e-commerce firms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Uber introduced the ability to let users pay driver partners with cash for the first time in its existence months after launching in India.</p></blockquote>
<p>With a service like Simpl, customers know that they don’t have to pay right away and have the ability to dispute transactions and quickly request a refund, he said. The startup uses its own underwriting technology to determine the customers to whom it can offer its services, he said. For brands, too, an easier checkout process means the conversion increases significantly, he added.</p>
<p>“We built a full-stack checkout platform that gives merchants ultimate control of the user experience and helps them build trust with consumers at checkout. Simpl is like a Khata or a Tab for online commerce. This intuitive user experience, built on the bedrock of trust, will enable a larger e-commerce market and will lead to greater adoption of mobile payments in India and the rest of the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup said it has grown its monthly active merchants and active user base by 10 times in the past 18 months. Over 7,000 brands now use Simpl, the startup said. It now plans to work on further improving the consumer and merchants experience on its platform and also expand to new areas including bringing Simpl to offline neighborhood stores and building a loyalty program, said Sharma.</p>
<p>“India’s e-commerce market is at an inflection point and we believe Simpl’s solution is a key enabler in accelerating adoption of digital payments in e-commerce” said James Fitzgerald, partner at Valar Ventures, in a statement. “It significantly improves consumer experience, which is why it is quickly becoming a preferred partner for merchants. The team has shown great execution and we are excited to join their mission of democratizing e-commerce for all merchants big and small.”</p>
<p>Pay later fintech players today finance loans worth $500 million each year, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent note to clients. They expect the figure to balloon to $26 billion by 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its annual re:Invent conference, AWS today announced two new initiatives for the automotive industry. One is a new product, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/aws-iot-fleetwise-transferring-vehicle-data-cloud/">AWS FleetWise</a>, a new service that makes it easier for automakers to collect and retrieve sensor and telemetry data from their vehicle fleets. The other is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/automotive/">AWS Automotive</a>, a broader, industry-specific initiative that brings together a range of the company&#8217;s products under a single umbrella, similar to AWS&#8217;s other industry solutions like AWS for Industrial.</p>
<p>Collecting sensor data isn&#8217;t necessarily a new thing for automakers. But FleetWise promises to provide an end-to-end solution that will give them a lot of flexibility. Maybe they want to smartly filter data right on the car to reduce the amount of data transferred to the cloud, or only pull in data from specific sensors like engine temperature, or maybe they do indeed want to get all of the data. It&#8217;s up to the individual auto manufacturer to decide <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/features/">what data they need</a>.</p>

<p>Mike Tzamaloukas, AWS&#8217; general manager for AWS Automotive, told me that no matter what data gets used, to get started with FleetWise, the manufacturer has to first describe and model the vehicle and its sensors, using the open source Vehicle Signal Specification that a number of automakers have already adopted.</p>
<p>AWS then provides the automakers with the source code to interact with FleetWise and collect data. The automaker&#8217;s developers can then take this code, modify it as needed and build it into the vehicle gateway, while its engineers can start building data collection campaigns to pull in data from the live vehicle fleet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The possibilities with data collection campaigns are endless and we are pushing the envelope in that data collection campaigns are not just time-based, are not just event-based, but it&#8217;s intelligent data filtering across your entire fleet,&#8221; Tzamaloukas explained. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we hope to give the automakers the ability to pull in the terabytes of data generated from all kinds of different cars out there, but at a much higher signal-to-noise ratio.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tzamaloukas expects that FleetWise will be generally available in 2022 and that we&#8217;ll see cars available for purchase with it built-in around 2024. A lot of this data may stay in the automakers&#8217; back ends, but he noted that they could make some of it available to drivers as well, maybe in the form of more detailed monthly vehicle health reports.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for AWS for Automotive, AWS&#8217; Dean Phillips, who heads up this initiative, told me that he sees it as a way to clarify AWS&#8217; capabilities for the industry. &#8220;We&#8217;re pretty excited about AWS for Automotive because it really helps clarify for our customers the different solutions that we have from AWS,&#8221; he said. These solutions include a number of different solutions areas that automakers can adopt as needed, ranging from cutting-edge autonomous mobility services to product engineering support, supply chain tracking and digital customer engagement solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla has yet to produce its all-electric Cybertruck, but diehard fans who need to lay their hands on something new and associated with the highly anticipated and delayed vehicle can now buy a cyberwhistle for $50. Yes, a whistle.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Tuesday a link to the webpage for his 65.1 million followers to view along with a message &#8220;Blow the whistle on Tesla,&#8221; which may or may not be a nod, a dare or a threat to those former employees who have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-13/when-elon-musk-tried-to-destroy-tesla-whistleblower-martin-tripp?sref=gni836kR">actually attempted to do just that</a>. He later tweeted, &#8220;Don’t waste your money on that silly Apple Cloth, buy our whistle instead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Clicking <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberwhistle?sku=1715672-00-A">on the link</a>, customers will see this message:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241272" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>Inspired by Cybertruck, the limited-edition Cyberwhistle is a premium collectible made from medical-grade stainless steel with a polished finish. The whistle includes an integrated attachment feature for added versatility.</p>
<p><em>Note: Cyberwhistles are final sale.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>No word on what that integrated attachment reference means, but TechCrunch suspects it might be a lanyard hole so customers can wear this around their neck.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As any Tesla aficionado might expect, the cyberwhistle is shaped like the Cybertruck, the all-electric truck that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/behold-the-tesla-cybertruck-is-here/">Musk revealed</a> back in November 2019. The Cybertruck was supposed to go into production in late 2021. The company has pushed that date to sometime in 2022, per its website in which potential customers can put down a $100 refundable deposit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/category/lifestyle">cyberwhistle can be found</a> housed under Tesla&#8217;s lifestyle products, which include items such as the $150 Tesla decanter, the $45 desktop charger modeled after a Tesla Supercharger, the $35 S3XY mug and several die-cast models of vehicles, including the Tesla Semi, which also has pushed the start of production to 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital mortgage lender <a href="https://better.com/">Better.com</a>, which announced in May that it was going public via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/digging-into-digital-mortgage-lender-better-coms-huge-spac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPAC</a>, is getting a cash infusion from its backers sooner than expected. Blank-check company Aurora Acquisition Corp. and SoftBank have decided to amend the terms of their financing agreement to provide Better with half of the $1.5 billion they committed immediately instead of waiting till the deal closes.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the deal who preferred to remain anonymous told TechCrunch that with the new arrangement, capital hits the company’s balance sheet now (faster than originally planned) and puts more money on the balance sheet overall to fuel further growth. Specifically, according to an email from Better CFO Kevin Ryan to the company and obtained by TechCrunch, Better.com will have $1 billion on its balance sheet by week’s end.</p>
<p>In the email, Ryan told employees:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241263" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>We pulled forward the funding of our SPAC deal … With this new structure the company will fortify our balance sheet and position us as extremely well capitalized in a tough mortgage market. Surviving is winning and capital ensures survival … By the end of this week we expect to have $1 billion of cash on the company’s balance sheet. Quantum’s more than we have ever had. [sic] We will continue working through the process of public listing but the most important step has been taken (getting the money).</p></blockquote>
<p>The new arrangement will replace the prior agreement wherein $950 million of the $1.78 billion in committed financing from Aurora and SoftBank would have been used to purchase existing shares from Better’s stockholders rather than the company receiving it directly to its balance sheet.</p>
<p>The amended terms will not change Better’s implied valuation of $6.9 billion, the company says.</p>
<p>As for what Better plans to do with the capital, a spokesperson told TechCrunch that the money will help the company double down on existing businesses, continue to build out “a custom-first home purchase experience” and launch new products and services “that make the post-close homeownership experience as amazing as customers deserve it to be.”</p>
<p>Better, which recently added a number of new insurance products, plans to expand its offerings into other product categories, including personal loans, student loans and life insurance.</p>
<p>The company chose to go public via a SPAC rather than taking the traditional IPO route because it preferred the guarantee of execution that SoftBank offered it with the blank-check deal, CEO Vishal Garg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/better-mortgage-spac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in September</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: The headline and story were updated post-publication to accurately reflect the amount of the cash infusion</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Korea-based peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform <a href="https://www.peoplefund.co.kr/">PeopleFund</a> announced today it has closed a $63.4 million (75.9 billion won) Series C round led by Bain Capital with participation from Goldman Sachs. Returning investors in the round include <a href="http://www.clsacapital.com/fund-lendingark.html">CLSA Lending Ark Asia</a> and <a href="https://500.co/">500 Global</a>.</p>
<p>The latest funding brings the total raised by PeopleFund to about $83.6 million (100 billion won) since it was founded in 2015.</p>
<p>The Series C will support hiring AI engineers and secure alternative data to advance its credit-scoring algorithm further. PeopleFund also will beef up its machine learning-powered credit scoring system, which is one of its key differentiators, that provides a quantitative scoring model (for credit valuation), a qualitative scoring model and a demand forecasting model (for near-primer borrowers).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240665" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>PeopleFund wants to address the structural problem involving the risk of high interest-rate loans in the near-prime loan sector and offer more personalized financial products to subprime and near-prime borrowers with its data-driven technology platform, CEO and founder Joey Kim told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“For the past six years, we have been focusing on proving the performance of our data-driven risk management technology, which is the essence of consumer lending,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;Our mission is to grow into the No. 1 player in the Korean non-bank lending market to provide better loan options for average Koreans that the banks underserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>The financing event comes five months after PeopleFund received its regulatory approval from South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) to register with the government.</p>
<p>In early June, only three Korean P2P lenders out of 41 applicants were granted licenses from the FSC to operate the business legally: PeopleFund, Lendit and 8 Percent. The FSC said it will continue to review other applicants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>South Korea has passed the first law in the world dedicated to digital lending, &#8220;The Marketplace Lending Act,&#8221; in August 2020 to regulate marketplace lenders, protecting P2P consumers. The new law enables the licensed P2P lending startup to operate as an authorized financial institution to lend, raise capital from international and domestic institutions, and provide loan referral services to its customers.</p>
<p>The number of marketplace lenders in Korea has fallen from 237 to 102 between August 2020 and May 2021, per PeopleFund&#8217;s annual report in 2020.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240681" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240681" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2240681 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg" alt="People Fund" width="1920" height="1105" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg?resize=1536,884 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240681" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PeopleFund</p></div></p>
<p>PeopleFund, which connects borrowers with lenders to enable lending, provides loans at an average interest rate of 11.25% per annum, about 3% to 4% lower than other non-bank lenders. Near-prime borrowers are not qualified for bank loans thus have no choice but to resort to non-bank lenders like credit card loans (or saving banks), Kim said.</p>
<p>What sets PeopleFund apart from other competitors is the lowest delinquency rate in the industry, being managed by its own alternative credit scoring system, and having strong risk management capabilities, Kim said. PeopleFund claims it has managed over $1 billion in loans as of October 2021, with a delinquency rate of 2.06%.</p>
<p>Another differentiator is its credit scoring system optimized for mid-interest loans based on about 480,000 loan customers registered on its platform. PeopleFund built a credit scoring system (CSS) 4.0 for near-prime borrowers to provide more affordable mid-rate loans to borrowers, who use the funds to refinance existing loans taken from other second-tier lenders. The refinancing loans account for 66% of its total loans, he added.</p>

<p>Kim said that its clients include near-prime borrowers and individuals and institutional investors who expect 7%-9% the ROI per annum (before tax). Its lenders are mostly retail customers the company has through its partnership with Kakao Pay.</p>
<p>“For individual and institutional lenders, we offer diversified lending opportunities at an average annual return rate of 6% to 9%. For the borrowers and the lenders, [our] AI-based data-driven underwriting process has been the core of its competitive advantage, which has been outperforming other non-bank players by a 3% to 5% gap in loss rate,” Kim said.</p>
<p>PeopleFund targets the traditional personal credit loans market in South Korea, which is estimated at around $67 billion, according to the company.</p>
<p>The company, which accounted for about 57% of market share in the personal loan of the P2P lending market as of October, expects to generate profit in 2022, Kim said.</p>
<p>“While leading online lenders in the U.S. have grown to be worth billions out of lending platforms such as <a href="https://www.upstart.com/">Upstart</a> and <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a>, Korea’s online lending is only just beginning, said Tim Chae, managing partner of 500 Global that participated in all fundraising since the seed round. “We strongly believe that PeopleFund will grow to become a clear winner with its proven track record, accelerating tech-driven innovations in the non-bank lending sector in Korea.”</p>

					</ul>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Investment in fintech is surging back following a brief but notable drop during the COVID pandemic. As a result, countries worldwide <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/lessons-we-learned-from-the-last-week-of-fintech-earnings/">are seeing a large influx of capital</a> for fintech ventures, and both investment totals and deal counts in the fintech space are increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>Although a large part of fintech funding focuses on countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, smaller countries, particularly in Asia, are making their presence known. This is hardly surprising given that Asia leads the world in fintech adoption rates.</p>
<p>Singapore is one country building a solid reputation as a hub of fintech activity, and this reputation is generating substantial investment.</p>
<h2>Singapore’s fintech investment surges forward</h2>
<p>According to KPMG, total fintech funding worldwide in the first half of 2021 <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/be/pdf/2021/Pulse-of-Fintech-H1-2021.pdf">reached $98 billion</a> from 2,456 deals, rebounding strongly from the COVID-inspired investing dip of 2020.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the U.S. accounted for most of the total investment at $42 billion. However, fintech funding also recovered well in Asia and the EMEA region.</p>
<p>For the first half of 2021, Asian fintech funding activity <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">amounted to $7.5 billion</a> despite the lack of any notably large deals. CBInsights estimates that Asian fintech funding in Q3 is strong at nearly $6 billion, trailing only the U.S.</p>
<p>Despite its small size (less than 5 million total population), Singapore is quickly reaching investment levels of countries many times its size. Although the KPMG data shows only $614 million during the first half, the Singapore Monetary Authority&#8217;s chief fintech officer, Sopnendu Mohanty, suggests a strong surge in the second half, pushing Singapore’s total to $3 billion. Given the record number of deals in the first half of 2021, Mohanty’s optimism seems justified.</p>
<p>Compare Singapore’s total to countries like Canada and the major European countries. In the first half, Canada’s total investment was $4.8 billion, while France and Germany were each in the $2 billion-$2.5 billion range. But these countries are six to 10 times the size of Singapore and have similarly larger GDPs.</p>
<p>Singapore’s investment level is also notable among countries in the Asia Pacific. The two most populated countries, China and India, generated only $1.3 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Australia had less than a billion. Singapore is swinging well above its weight when it comes to fintech investment.</p>
<h2>Fintech adoption drives investment</h2>
<p>Fintech adoption continues to grow rapidly, and the pandemic only provided additional fuel for the fire. Adoption rates in Europe, for example, <a href="https://tokenist.com/will-the-coronavirus-and-working-from-home-accelerate-fintech-adoption/">accelerated by 72%</a> in 2020 alone.</p>

In short, the neobank will sell its shares for less than it expected, lowering the size of its impending capital raise and also cutting its public-market valuation. TechCrunch dug into whether the news matters for Latin American startups more broadly. (More on the company’s economics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">here</a>.)</li>

The U.S. cloud infra management concern is targeting a pretty high price point for its shares, at least in revenue-multiples terms. Good news for open source startups more generally? We think so.

Not with their currency (subscriptions) or attention (ads), but with their spare compute time. We had questions, but the model sounds pretty neat.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/fundbox-raises-100m/"><strong>Fundbox shows that SMBs can build unicorns:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Forget the old VC rule that selling to SMBs is bad business. There are just too many successful startups out here looking to sell to small businesses for the old saw to be anything but toothless. Fundbox’s new $1.1 billion valuation is evidence of the fact, with the SMB-focused fintech adding nine figures to its accounts in a single gulp.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cloudtrucks-raised-115m-series-b-to-help-truck-entrepreneurs-manage-their-business/"><strong>The other way to make tech money from trucking:</strong></a> Sure, we read a lot about self-driving semis and how computers will soon drive our big trucks. But, in the meantime, CloudTrucks is raising a treasury to grow its software business aimed at trucking firms that still employ human drivers. The company just closed a massive $115 million Series <em>B</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And <em>for</em> startups out there looking to raise, a little venture fund news for your diversion:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/sapphire-ventures-secures-largest-capital-raise-to-date-across-two-new-funds/"><strong>Sapphire Ventures raises $2B:</strong></a> For its sixth main fund and third “opportunity “ fund, Sapphire Ventures has banked 10 figures worth of capital. That’s a Smaug-level haul, and indicative, I believe, that I will annoy the firm’s Jai Das at least four times per quarter in 2021 for notes on what he’s seeing in the market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/partech-raises-750-million-growth-fund/"><strong>Partech raises $750 million for second growth fund:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Normally a venture capital concern raising hundreds of millions of dollars doesn’t get my pulse up even a single BPM. However, as Partech is based in Paris, I have to admit that I found the news more than a little notable. Recall when Europe’s startup scene was considered an also-ran? That was a while ago now.</li>

<p>Jack Dorsey was Twitter’s first CEO — and also its fourth.</p>
<p>He led the platform from its launch in 2006 until he passed the torch to co-founder Ev Williams two years later. In 2015, Dorsey returned to the role, even though he was simultaneously serving as CEO of fintech platform Square.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being ‘founder-led,’” he wrote in a letter to employees.</p>
<p>“Ultimately I believe that’s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I’ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders.”</p>
<p>The Equity podcast team <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/3-views-on-jack-dorseys-decision-to-step-down-as-twitters-ceo">discussed his departure in a TechCrunch+ post</a> yesterday afternoon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Wilhelm: A call to return to the old normal from the new normal</li>
<li>Natasha Mascarenhas: A reset would rewrite how VCs and entrepreneurs do business</li>
<li>Amanda Silberling: Founders aren’t rock stars</li>
</ul>
<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today’s Big Tech news comes in two chunks. There’s the day’s news from huge tech concerns, and then there’s a whole mess of AWS-related news from our enterprise team.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/eu-ai-act-civil-society-recommendations/">European AI regulation may lack teeth:</a> </strong>Per our own Natasha Lomas, a collection of civil society organizations has come to the view that “draft legislation” in Europe “falls far short of protecting fundamental rights from AI-fueled harms like scaled discrimination and blackbox bias.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/stellantis-mercedes-benz-invest-in-solid-state-battery-developer-factorial-energy/"><strong>Mercedes invests in Factorial Energy:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, we could have put this entry in the startup section, but how frequently do we see the parent company of reigning F1 winning champions, the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team, in our pages? Infrequently. Regardless, Factorial is working on solid state batteries for cars, so you can see why the Silver Arrows corporate family was interested.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/twitter-expands-safety-policy-bans-posting-images-of-people-without-their-consent/"><strong>Twitter cracks down on abusive image/video posting:</strong></a> In <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">baby’s</span> CEO’s first PR crisis, Twitter announced today that it is moving to “ban sharing images or videos of private individuals without their consent.” At issue is the fact that some video, well, will never get consent of say, the cops, despite being in the public interest. Twitter noted a public interest nuance, but some folks were still mad.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And then, the Amazon/AWS news deluge:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Karpenter is a “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/aws-launches-karpenter-an-open-source-autoscaler-for-kubernetes-clusters/">new open source autoscaling tool for Kubernetes clusters</a>.”</li>
<li>SageMaker Canvas is a “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/aws-gets-a-no-code-ml-service/">no-code ML service</a>.”</li>
<li>AWS to highlight partners that “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/aws-targets-the-energy-industry-with-launch-of-the-aws-energy-competency-program/">develop specialized solutions aimed at the energy industry</a>.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/awss-analytics-services-go-serverless/">AWS analytics are now serverless</a>.</li>
<li>There’s a new ML chip from Amazon, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/aws-introduces-new-trn1-chips-to-speed-up-training-of-machine-learning-models/">the Trn1</a>.</li>
<li>But that’s not all! Amazon’s cloud team also has a new ARM chip called the “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/aws-launches-its-graviton-3-processor/">Graviton 3</a>.”</li>
<li>And we have even more from AWS’ big shindig <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws-reinvent-2021/">here</a>, if that is your jam!</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps it should be pro forma for corporate boards in search of a new CEO to start by talking to the company’s longtime engineers, product managers and marketing leads.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jack Dorsey was Twitter’s first CEO — and also its fourth.</p>
<p>He led the platform from its launch in 2006 until he passed the torch to co-founder Ev Williams two years later. In 2015, Dorsey returned to the role after Dick Costolo’s stint, even though he was simultaneously serving as CEO of fintech platform Square.</p>
<p>Like many, I wondered how one person could adequately handle that level of responsibility. And apparently, so did Dorsey.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240934" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“There’s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being ‘founder-led,’” he wrote in a letter to employees.</p>
<p>“Ultimately I believe that’s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I’ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders.”</p>

<p>The Equity podcast team <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/3-views-on-jack-dorseys-decision-to-step-down-as-twitters-ceo/">discussed his departure in a TechCrunch+ post yesterday afternoon</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alex Wilhelm: A call to return to the old normal from the new normal</strong></li>
<li><strong>Natasha Mascarenhas: A reset would rewrite how VCs and entrepreneurs do business</strong></li>
<li><strong>Amanda Silberling: Founders aren’t rock stars</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s too early to say whether the move will alter the founder-led ethic that permeates Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m hoping it starts a trend where mature tech companies do a better job of recognizing and rewarding employees who innately understand their culture, products and services. Case in point: Former CTO Parag Agrawal was initially hired as a software engineer, but a decade later, he’s leading Twitter’s 5,500 employees.</p>
<p>Perhaps it should be pro forma for corporate boards in search of a new CEO to start by talking to the company’s longtime engineers, product managers and marketing leads.</p>

<p>Brazil-based Nubank initially indicated that it planned to raise a maximum of $3.66 billion in its upcoming IPO, but this morning, the Latin American neobank’s holding company lowered that to $2.86 billion.</p>
<p>This public offering was coming in hot; why throttle back now? In this morning’s edition of The Exchange, Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm unpack the numbers for the new proposed valuation and ask, “Does the revision matter?”</p>

<p>Collecting data to optimize B2B marketing is notoriously difficult.</p>
<p>“Practitioners tend to see each new source of information about their potential buyers — each signal type — as a substitute for the last one that didn’t work,” according to Kerry Cunningham, senior principal at account engagement platform 6sense.</p>
<p>Embracing a product-led growth mindset allows organizations to look at users as signals, “just like form-fill leads, de-anonymized website traffic, visitors to your booth, and the rest,” says Cunningham.</p>

<p>News of the omicron coronavirus variant may have suppressed retail activity over the Thanksgiving weekend, but what’s the explanation for flat online spending?</p>
<p>This year, Black Friday e-commerce totaled just $8.9 billion, compared to $9 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>“Perhaps we should not have been surprised,” writes Alex Wilhelm. “There were warning signs.”</p>
<p>Looking back at missed Q3 estimates from companies like Shopify, Amazon and Pinduoduo, “somewhat softer e-commerce numbers simply should not be a surprise,” he concludes.</p>
<p>Due to supply-chain concerns and ongoing pandemic restrictions, retailers say consumers started shopping earlier this year. Still, this is the first time we’ve seen a decrease in Black Friday spending.</p>

<h2>As human capital grows scarce, flexible compensation can help attract and retain talent</h2>

<p>The pandemic-fueled labor shortage has many causes, but inflexible and inadequate compensation is one of the most discussed.</p>
<p>However, employees don’t always leave because of pay. “An opaque model for allocating compensation” is often to blame for employees feeling unheard and unseen, writes Compright CEO Boyd Davis.</p>
<p>Davis explains how startups can tackle this issue by analyzing employee and market data to come up with compensation strategies that are transparent, equitable and fair.</p>
<p>The pandemic taught us to be flexible and “embrace change and be open to adjusting processes, [which] holds true for compensation planning as well,” Davis writes.</p>

<p>Music recognition service SoundHound more or less disappeared about five years ago, so it was a surprise when its SPAC backer announced the company’s IPO at a valuation of $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>That, Anna Heim notes, is five times as much as Apple paid for Shazam, its biggest competitor.</p>
<p>SoundHound turned down the volume as it quietly developed a conversational AI product it now sells to a number of leading brands. “If its SPAC deck is to be believed, it seems it is just doing magic in plain sight,” writes Anna.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s that time of year again. Analysts and journalists from across the globe have convened in Hawaii to witness Qualcomm announce its big chip news for the year. Just a few days of sun, surf, Snapdragons and summits.</p>
<p>As promised, the latest version of the SoCal chip giant’s flagship SoC arrives with a rebrand — one that’s going to take some getting used to. Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue like, say 888, but no one said chip nomenclatures were going to be easy. What’s more, the new silicon is arriving soon, with the first devices expected before the year’s up — giving handset makers more or less exactly four weeks to get them out the door.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241139" style="width: 1128px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241139" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241139 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Block-Diagram-e1638313204512.png" alt="" width="1118" height="1101" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241139" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241133" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new chip is focused on six key competencies: 5G connectivity, camera sensors, AI, gaming, audio and security — pretty much what you’d hope for from a mobile chipmaker in 2021. On the connectivity front, the SoC sports a 5G modem-RF capable of hitting up to 10-gigabit download speeds, coupled with the FastConnect 6900 Mobile Connectivity System, which it claims can best WiFi 6 speeds.</p>
<p>The new imaging system sports an 18-bit ISP, with improved dynamic range, color and speeds. It supports 8K HDR video, coupled with a new Bokeh Engine that brings Portrait Mode-style shots to video, while an Always-On ISP delivers low power consumption to tasks like face unlock.</p>
<p>The new Adreno GPU, meanwhile, promises improved graphics performance with lower power consumption, while support for lossless audio arrives on the sound side. As for security, the new platform sports a new Trust Management Engine, as well as support for Android Ready SE for digital car keys.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241141" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241141" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2241141" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241141" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AI may be the biggest piece of the puzzle here. A new 7th Gen engine brings improved tensor acceleration. Per Qualcomm,</p>
<blockquote><p>The latest AI-based natural language processing from Hugging Face can intelligently serve as your personal assistant by prioritizing and analyzing your notifications. Working with Sonde Health, we are using on-device AI to accelerate their models that can analyze a user’s vocal patterns to determine if a user is at risk for health conditions such as asthma, depression, and COVID-19. Also, a new always-on AI system is powered by the 3rd Gen Qualcomm® Sensing Hub with more data streams being processed using lowest power AI.</p></blockquote>
<p>Imaging and AI, in particular, are key for Qualcomm this year because, let’s face it, the company’s got a lot more competition than it did only a few years back. Note the brands that have currently signed up to release devices sporting the SoC: Black Shark, Honor, iQOO, Motorola, Nubia, OnePlus, OPPO, realme, Redmi, Sharp, Sony Corporation, vivo, Xiaomi and ZTE. It’s not a bad list, as far as these things go. I should add that I cribbed it directly from Qualcomm’s press material, so it’s alphabetical (likely for political reasons), which is how you get names like Black Shark ahead of, say, Sony.</p>
<p>But you’ve got a number of big Chinese manufacturers on there, too — vivo, OPPO and Xiaomi dominate the world&#8217;s largest smartphone market. And the list is as notable for its absences than the names it includes. Huawei, is, of course, not present (unlike spinoff, Honor), as the company looks to in-house chips amid concerns with the U.S. government.</p>

<p>Beyond that, big names like Google, Apple and Samsung are notably missing. Qualcomm is no doubt feeling a pinch as more companies push to develop their own in-house silicon, many of which have sported some impressive numbers in testing. That’s not to say that Qualcomm’s dominance is over among premium handsets, but chips are an increasingly important battlefield for smartphone differentiation among hardware makers with the resources to go in-house.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Longer-term energy storage is a drag, and a lot of battery tech has been focusing on &#8220;how quickly can we charge these batteries so I can drive my EV for another couple of hundred miles.&#8221; That&#8217;s a fundamentally different problem than trying to capture the power of the sun for 12 hours, before releasing the power for the next 12 hours while the moon is doing its lazy stroll against the nighttime sky.</p>
<p><a href="https://energydome.com/">Energy Dome</a> today announced the close of its $11 million Series A fundraise, with the goal of deploying the first commercially viable CO<sub>2</sub> battery in a demonstration project in its native Sardinia, Italy.</p>
<p>The company told us that a CO<sub>2</sub> battery&#8217;s optimal charge/discharge cycle ranges from four to 24 hours, positioning it perfectly for daily and intra-day cycling. It points out that this is a fast-growing market segment, not well served by existing battery technologies. Specifically, the hope is to charge the CO<sub>2</sub> battery during the daytime when there is a surplus of solar-generated power, before discharging during the peak evening and nighttime hours, when demand for electricity outpaces what solar can deliver. Because, well, I&#8217;d hate to feel the need to spell this out for ya — but there&#8217;s no sun at night.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241199" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Built using commodity components, the company claims that its CO<sub>2  </sub>battery achieves a 75%-80% round-trip efficiency. Perhaps more interestingly, though, is that the operational life for the batteries is projected to be in the neighborhood of 25 years. If you&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on other power-storage solutions, you&#8217;ll have made a mental note that the operational life of most other solutions starts to degrade significantly by the time it hits the one-decade mark. The company projects that considering the whole lifecycle cost of its product, the cost of storing energy will be about half of the cost of storing with similarly sized lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>The tech is pretty neat — the company is using CO<sub>2</sub> in a closed-loop cycle where it changes from gas to liquid and back to gas. The company itself is named after the &#8220;dome&#8221; component of the solution — an inflatable atmospheric gas holder filled with CO<sub>2</sub> in its gaseous form.</p>
<p>When charging, the system draws electrical power from the electric grid, which drives a compressor that draws CO<sub>2</sub> from the dome and compresses it, generating heat. The heat is stored in a thermal energy storage device. The CO<sub>2</sub> is then liquified under pressure and stored in liquid CO<sub>2</sub> vessels, at ambient temperature, to complete the charging cycle. When discharging, the cycle is reversed by evaporating the liquid CO<sub>2</sub>, recovering the heat from the thermal energy storage system and expanding the hot CO<sub>2</sub> into a turbine, which drives a generator. Electricity is returned to the grid and the CO<sub>2</sub> reinflates the dome without emissions to the atmosphere, ready for the next charging cycle. The system has up to 200 MWh in storage capacity.</p>
<p>The round was led by deep tech VC firm <a href="https://www.360cap.vc/">360 Capital,</a> while a number of other investors round out the investment round, including Barclays’ Sustainable Impact Capital program, a division of the banking giant Barclays that takes an impact investment approach, Geneva-based multifamily office Novum Capital Partners and Third Derivative, a global climate technology startup accelerator founded by RMI and New Energy Nexus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitch introduced a new way for streamers to fight accounts that evade channel-level bans Tuesday. The automated tool is called &#8220;Suspicious User Detection&#8221; and can spot users trying to get around bans, giving anyone moderating a Twitch channel more recourse for dealing with potentially disruptive behavior before it starts. The company announced that the new ban evasion detection tool was on the way back <a href="https://twitter.com/twitch/status/1425550623215218689">in August</a>.</p>
<p>The company says it developed the tool in direct response to community feedback calling for more robust moderation options for handling users popping up with new accounts after being banned. After an account is flagged as either a &#8220;possible&#8221; or &#8220;likely&#8221; ban evader, a channel&#8217;s moderators can choose to take action against it manually.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241013" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241013" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2241013" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitch-suspicious-user-tool.gif?w=600" alt="Twitch suspicious user detection tool" width="600" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241013" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitch</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241000" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Any messages sent from an account flagged as a likely violator will be automatically screened from chat, pending review by a moderator. For channels that want to be more aggressive with moderation, the same setting can be turned on for accounts flagged as possible ban evaders. Mods can also manually add users to the suspicious account list to keep closer tabs on them.</p>
<p>Twitch notes that as with any automated moderation tool, false positives are possible, though it hopes to strike a balance between proactive detection powered by machine learning systems and human intervention. &#8220;You’re the expert when it comes to your community, and you should make the final call on who can participate,&#8221; Twitch wrote in a blog post, adding that the system will improve over time after training on input from human moderators.</p>
<p>Twitch sees the new ban evasion detection system as a modular solution alongside AutoMod, which gives moderators a way to review potentially harmful messages in chat, and Phone-Verified Chat, an option that Twitch added last month that requires users to verify their accounts before chatting. Twitch users can sign up for five accounts with a single phone number, but a channel ban now impacts all accounts linked to that number, sealing up one of the easier workarounds for anyone looking to skirt the platform&#8217;s policies.</p>

<p>Twitch streamers have long been pushing the company to do more to protect creators, particularly those most vulnerable to online harassment. This year alone, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/streamers-are-boycotting-twitch-today-to-protest-the-platforms-lack-of-action-on-hate-raids/">#ADayOffTwitch</a> and #TwitchDoBetter campaigns escalated visibility for marginalized creators facing widespread abuse on the platform, prompting the company to respond.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve seen a lot of conversation about botting, hate raids, and other forms of harassment targeting marginalized creators,&#8221; the company tweeted at the time. &#8220;You’re asking us to do better, and we know we need to do more to address these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitch&#8217;s longstanding lack of discovery tools already made success on the platform an uphill challenge for underrepresented creators, but targeted harassment campaigns made matters much worse. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/twitch-streamers-respond-after-huge-leak-of-creator-payout-data/">trove of Twitch payout data</a> leaked last month painted a grim picture of diversity in the upper echelons of streaming success, where top creators are nearly universally white men.</p>
<p>In May, Twitch added more than 350 tags to help users find streamers by identifiers like gender, sexuality, race and ability. The update was an overdue step to drive discovery and surface more diverse creators on the platform, but without adequate moderation tools many users worried that the system was driving targeted harassment toward their communities. In September, Twitch took the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/twitch-hate-raids-lawsuits/">unusual step</a> of filing a lawsuit against two users linked to thousands of bots powering mass harassment campaigns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There has been speculation for some time that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/could-marc-benioff-be-the-next-ceo-to-move-to-executive-chairman/">Marc Benioff was ready to step back</a>, perhaps take the same path as Jeff Bezos and move <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">to chairman of the board</a>. The scuttlebutt had it that Bret Taylor was in line for a promotion. Seems Benioff wasn&#8217;t ready to go out to pasture just yet, but Taylor<a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Bret-Taylor-Promoted-to-Vice-Chair-and-Co-CEO-of-Salesforce/default.aspx"> got his promotion today</a> to co-CEO at the CRM giant.</p>
<p>Taylor, who was president and chief operating officer, is now vice chair and co-CEO working alongside Benioff, rather than reporting to him. Benioff sees this as a good way to operate moving forward as the company has expanded greatly in recent years with major acquisitions like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/salesforce-closes-15-7b-tableau-deal/">the $15.7 billion deal for Tableau</a> in 2019 or the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">$27.7 billion Slack acquisition</a>, which Taylor spearheaded, at the end of last year.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of ground to cover, and it&#8217;s probably a hard job for one person to take it all on alone. &#8220;We’re in a new world and Salesforce has never been more relevant or strategic for our customers. Together, Bret and I will lead Salesforce through our next chapter, while living our shared values of trust, customer success, innovation and equality for all,&#8221; Benioff said in a (bland) statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241144" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Taylor, as you would expect, was grateful for the opportunity as he moves to the top of the food chain alongside Benioff. &#8220;Partnering with him to lead the company he co-founded 22 years ago is an enormous privilege. I’m thankful for our Salesforce employees, our Trailblazers, our customers, and all of our stakeholders who help us make our company and our world a better place,&#8221; Taylor said in a statement.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time that the company has gone the co-CEO route. Prior to this, Keith Block held that role starting in 2018 before leaving in 2020.</p>
<p>Taylor, who at one time was CEO at early social network FriendFeed, also served as CTO at Facebook from 2009-2012. He came to Salesforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">when it acquired Quip</a> for $750 million in 2016. He quickly moved through the ranks leapfrogging other longtime executives. He was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/salesforce-promotes-bret-taylor-to-president-and-coo/">promoted to president and chief operating officer</a> in 2019, placing him just below Benioff until today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been quite a week for Taylor, who was also named independent <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_news/2021/11/11-29-21_TWTR_Announcement.pdf">chairman of the board at Twitter</a> on Tuesday.</p>

Being a founder of a high-growth startup means that you will encounter many situations you never have before, so choosing an investor who will be a partner in building the business is a key decision. In this context, promises of exclusive value-add resonate deeply.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, most founders find that the actual value they receive from investors is not always as promised. I have had the opportunity to work with amazing investors who build great thought partnerships with their founders, who are invaluable in making the decisions that change the trajectories of companies and have superpowers in attracting talent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240717" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Venture investing is an apprenticeship business, and I am humbled whenever I get a chance to learn from a great investor. However, when I speak to founders, it’s more likely that the investors they picked exhibited a variety of post-funding archetype behaviors, all of which detract from value, not add to it.</p>
<p>In the spirit of helping founders look beyond the promises of value, let&#8217;s delve into some common archetypes of investor relationships that founders experience post-investment. I hope that both founders and investors will read through these archetypes with a sense of humor. Like a good episode of “Silicon Valley,” there is some exaggeration here for effect, but not much!</p>
<h2>8 disappointing investor archetypes</h2>
<p><strong>The narcissist.</strong> Narcissists are completely full of themselves, and everything is always about them — how great their firm is and how great they are. They’re so enamored with themselves that they never take time to understand what founders really want or need. Some narcissists may be well past their glory days &#8212; just figureheads riding on their former successes &#8212; and they’re not going to add value to your startup.</p>
<p><strong>The child with a hammer.</strong> This is the investor who tells you to follow their advice because, “We used to do this when I was at Google,” or, “When I was on Airbnb’s board, we did this.” They have a hammer, and every problem they see looks like the same nail to be pounded in — in the same way they did it in the one significant experience they previously had in their professional career. They lack the perspective that there could be 10 other ways to approach and solve the problem. Some investors also have a “fire the executive” hammer that can be particularly destructive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>The know-it-all.</strong> This is the investor in meetings who doesn’t want to hear anyone else’s opinions, including the founders’. “I invested in Facebook before their Series C, therefore I have all the answers.” They don’t respect founders or their fellow board members, which is damaging to vital relationships and board dynamics. They may also have silver bullets like “OKR” or “recurring revenue” that they are partial to without understanding whether these are a good fit for this business and situation.</p>
<p><strong>The lapdog (aka the cheerleader).</strong> This is the investor who is never going to deliver the hard message to you — they’ll always try to be friends with the founders because they want a recommendation to the next company. They’ll pop in to a meeting and invite you out to dinner or on a lavish ski trip. Anytime there’s a difficult situation, however, they fall back on, “Whatever the founder wants is the right answer,” instead of being a thought partner and bringing a valuable perspective.</p>
<p><strong>The service router.</strong> If you want someone with a fat Rolodex, then you’ve come to the right place with the service router. Need a CFO or a sales manager? The service router will point you to people but never aim for excellence or help a founder figure out what looks good, say, in a new VP of sales. Service routers are good at recirculating among their portfolio companies. The problem is that the talent might have done a fine job at one company but isn’t the right fit for your startup.</p>
<p><strong>The Needy Ned.</strong> This investor will drive you nuts because they want to be involved in <em>everything</em> your company does, regardless of whether they’re adding value in the process. This might be the first company they’ve been on the board of, or they might be junior in the venture firm. You’ll know you’re dealing with a Needy Ned when they’re surprised and outraged when you haven’t told them every operational detail of your business. A more difficult version of Needy Ned is someone who not just wants to be involved but is trying to grab the wheel out of the founder’s hands and do things their way.</p>
<p><strong>The numbers person.</strong> For this investor, business is a big, complex spreadsheet, and everything can be reduced to a number or a ratio. They usually come from private equity, investment banking or growth investing, and they typically throw around terms like revenue churn, ARR and “the magic number.” The trouble is, they don’t understand the story behind the numbers, and they don’t know what it takes to move them.</p>
<p><strong>The drive-by.</strong> If you want your investor to stay out of your hair after they send some funding your way, then the drive-by is for you. They’re deal machines — even before your deal is sealed, they’re already on to the next one. By the time two years go by, they have completed 10 other deals and they’re not remotely interested in you as a founder or a company. They might attend a board meeting or two, but when they do, they’ll probably be checking their email to nail down their latest deal.</p>
<h2>My thoughts for founders</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, founders fall for these archetypes every day. As you consider your funding options, here are some things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>The <em>person</em> matters way more than the <em>firm</em>. Don’t buy the brand; buy the person. Perform due diligence on the person thoroughly and well. Talk to founders and dig into the references the investor gives you using your own back channels. Make sure there is a personality and style match among you, your co-founders and the existing board. In addition, make sure the investor’s knowledge and prior experience match your business.</p>
<p>Make sure both the person and the firm really understand your business. One good way to assess this is how much diligence they do on your product, and whether they personally talk to customers as opposed to reviewing call transcripts done by third parties. If an investor does not take the time to truly understand what you are building before they invest, what are the chances they will understand it after, and, more importantly, be a valuable thought partner?</p>
<p>Everyone is a good fair-weather sailor, but when there is a failure or small misstep (which, as I point out in my book, “<a href="https://anticipatefailure.com/">Anticipate Failure</a>,” will surely happen), the worst behaviors rear their ugly head. Examine how the person behaves when important decisions need to be made or when the going gets tough. One way to test is to ask the investor for references to their worst-performing companies and hear directly how they behaved when things were not going well.</p>
<p>Check for evidence of value-add and ask for it in writing in quantifiable ways in the term sheet. If they say they are going to help with hiring, ask them to write down goals for the first two quarters. If they say they can help with customers, ask exactly what amount of revenue they will commit to adding. If they say their brand will attract independent board members, ask to speak to board members they have placed.</p>
<p>If you take time to find a good fit with an investor, you will significantly maximize the chances of building something great. Even one bad investor on a board can significantly hurt the chances of your success, and I have unfortunately seen this happen a few times.</p>
<p>Don’t be lured by promises, valuations and check sizes &#8212; these are transitory, and the sugar highs from these shiny objects will last for but a short period. Keep your eye on the goal and pick your investor wisely.</p>

<p>The giving season has arrived, but an ample supply of next-gen consoles has not. Between chip shortages and resellers/bots, the chances of someone getting their hands on a PS5 or Xbox Series X without a whole lot of effort(/luck) are slim to none. It can be done! But you might not want to bet the holiday on it.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s just not gonna happen this year, there&#8217;s still plenty of stuff that should make the gamer in your life happy — accessories and nice-to-have extras that any gamer will appreciate and make their current setup a bit comfier while Sony/Microsoft/et al. catch up with demand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238323" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>Headphones</h2>
<p>Every gamer needs a good pair of headphones — skimping on this is a one-way ticket to a headache. In many of today&#8217;s most popular games, bad audio is a distinct disadvantage.</p>
<p>Trying to decide between wired and wireless? Wired could be fine if they&#8217;re gaming at a desk; for couch gaming, wireless will help &#8217;em be more comfortable and less tangled.</p>
<p>Here are some recommendations for each platform</p>
<h3>For Xbox or PlayStation: SteelSeries 7X and 7P</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076127" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076127" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2076127" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="716" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=768,537 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=680,475 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=1536,1073 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=2048,1431 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076127" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey</p></div></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve played pretty much every PS5 game with these. They&#8217;re just fantastic and much better than Sony&#8217;s own PlayStation-branded headsets. Comfortable, amazing sound, good battery life and quick connecting.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not the cheapest but they&#8217;re definitely not the most expensive either — there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RJHH6Q8/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07RJHH6Q8&amp;linkId=f3ba87c9aeb7c00ece70b849a12ee157">a new version</a> that doesn&#8217;t change much, so the (still great) last generation is on sale. Note: The 7X is for Xbox consoles and the 7P is for PlayStation — sadly there isn&#8217;t one version that works for both. Fortunately if you want something like that, it&#8217;s the next thing on the list.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>SteelSeries 7X (Xbox), <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Steelseries-Xbox-Arctis-7X-Headset-for-Series-X-S/996217534">$133 from Walmart</a> | SteelSeries 7P (PlayStation), <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/steelseries-arctis-7p-wireless-lossless-2-4-ghz-wireless-gaming-headset-for-playstation-5-and-playstation-4-white/6436579.p?skuId=6436579&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;extStoreId=144&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAtJeNBhCVARIsANJUJ2G4C3EBV8jDdDDxf_h3boxfUTDuhr2SZUgCsUvtNgmkrq53S5Ol44EaApE-EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">$150 from Best Buy</a></p>
<h3>For Switch, multiple consoles or for a budget: SteelSeries Arctis 1</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2241021" style="width: 838px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241021" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241021 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg" alt="" width="828" height="542" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg 828w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg?resize=768,503 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241021" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SteelSeries</p></div></p>
<p>These aren&#8217;t as cushy or expansive-sounding as the 7 series but they&#8217;re solid, comfortable and (because they&#8217;re wired) are compatible with everything under the sun: all major consoles plus phones, and the price is definitely right. If this list seems SteelSeries heavy, it&#8217;s just because they really got it right this generation.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>SteelSeries Arctis 1, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S9886QV/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07S9886QV&amp;linkId=c8b39e4f74e10c9dd3b2669a9e5102df">$50 from Amazon</a></p>
<h3>For PC: Razer BlackShark V2 or V2 Pro</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076125" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076125" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2076125 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="748" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=768,561 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=680,497 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=1536,1122 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=2048,1496 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076125" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldeway</p></div></p>
<p>This headset is understated in design, sounds great and plenty comfortable. I&#8217;ve had nothing but compliments for the sound of the mic.</p>
<p>To be honest I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s worth the extra cash for the wireless (Pro) version, since PC gamers tend to be within three feet of their computers. If you can get the wireless one on sale go for it, but the wired version is a great option when money is tight.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Razer BlackShark V2 (Wired), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086PKMZ1Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B086PKMZ1Q&amp;linkId=f3b190689739a87b8149b6a8a2debb90">$75 from Amazon</a> | Razer BlackShark V2 Pro (Wireless), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FQG96RP/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08FQG96RP&amp;linkId=b2b1c0a3900f7e325f6f5608e64617bb">$140 from Amazon</a></p>
<h3>Maybe a mechanical gaming keyboard?</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1833717" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1833717" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1833717" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg" alt="Symbols inspired by Paiwan culture on Ducky's limited edition Year of the Pig mechanical keyboard" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg 3861w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1833717" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Catherine Shu</p></div></p>
<p>This is a tough one. I was originally going to do a roundup of a bunch of keyboards … but, like next-gen consoles, many of the best ones are very hard to find right now.</p>
<p>If your PC-gaming loved one has a keyboard they like, you can sneak a look and get them a new one or an upgraded one of the same brand. But if you hear them talking about what &#8220;color&#8221; of mechanical switch they like or they&#8217;re talking about building their own … maybe back down. Once they go down that rabbit hole, the choices are very individual and it&#8217;s hard to get right as a gift. Maybe go with a gift card or something.</p>
<h2>Console accessories</h2>
<p>Maybe your loved one was lucky enough to get a Series X or PS5 already, or they have one coming soon. Maybe they just want to upgrade their current-gen console. Either way, they&#8217;ll probably still want a little extra gear.</p>
<h3>PlayStation:</h3>
<h4>Media remote</h4>
<p><div id="attachment_2241024" style="width: 1237px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241024" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241024 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg" alt="" width="1227" height="918" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg 1227w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1227px) 100vw, 1227px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241024" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>
<p>If someone uses their PlayStation 5 as the primary way of watching Netflix, Plex and so on, it gets old pretty fast using the rather large, heavy, easy-to-bump-off-the-couch DualSense gamepad for it. Snag one of these remote controls and no one has to learn whether &#8220;O&#8221; or &#8220;X&#8221; means cancel, or whether to use the bumpers, triggers, D-pad or analog sticks to rewind and fast forward. Honestly, this thing should probably come in the box. Super easy and convenient gift for combination gamers/cord-cutters.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FC5R4KV/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08FC5R4KV&amp;linkId=f042ba2bc68da9fa10c43f64f330f04c">$30 from Amazon</a></p>
<h4>A big hard drive expansion</h4>
<p><div id="attachment_2241030" style="width: 731px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241030" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241030 size-full" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SSD.jpg" alt="" width="721" height="333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SSD.jpg 721w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SSD.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SSD.jpg?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SSD.jpg?resize=680,314 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SSD.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241030" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>On a PS4, you can just buy a big ol&#8217; external USB hard drive and plug it in. You can do the same with a PS5, but there are …<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-extended-storage/"> limitations</a>. For the most part, it&#8217;s better to upgrade the internal storage.</p>
<p>Any reasonably tech-confident person should be able to install this expansion drive for PS5s, which they&#8217;ll probably want eventually since games these days are flippin&#8217; huge. This is a one-time purchase and install that will extend the life of the console and make things simpler, especially if they have the &#8220;digital&#8221; version without a disc drive. The major brands (Samsung, PNY, Kingston) all have PS5-compatible options; just make sure it&#8217;s one of those and you&#8217;re good. One detail that&#8217;s easy to miss: Some models note that they need a heatsink to work with a PS5 but don&#8217;t actually include one in the box. THANKS.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a splurge since the vanilla Xbox controllers are pretty excellent … but if the Xbox has been your loved one&#8217;s main gaming platform for years, you might be able to help them up their game a bit. The improved ergonomics, sweet D-pad, rear paddle triggers and other improvements can be game changers — no joke. You can do things with those rear paddles that would require ridiculous hand contortions to pull off otherwise. Xbox One-era controllers are compatible with Xbox Series X consoles, so this one is an investment that should work for years regardless of what gen they&#8217;re on right now.</p>

<p>Same deal with the PlayStation: External USB drives work well enough on the last-gen Xboxes, but <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-series-x-s-storage-guide">there are limitations</a> when using them with the next-gen consoles.</p>
<p>Not that installing the PS5&#8217;s expansion card is particularly hard, but with the Xbox Series X you literally just plug it into the back. That&#8217;s it. $220 for 1 TB seems a bit expensive to me, but it&#8217;s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.seagate.com/consumer/play/storage-expansion-for-xbox-series-x/">$150-$400, depending on capacity</a></p>

<p>The only thing better than having a Pro Controller is having two Pro Controllers. These things are excellent and the best way to play most games if you&#8217;re on the couch. With the Switch&#8217;s focus on multiplayer it can lead to bitterness when one person gets a sweet ergonomic Pro and everyone else is on the tiny Joy-Cons.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> While they&#8217;re not <em>quite</em> as hard to get as next-gen consoles, first-party controllers are also in short supply this year! Order early to make it happen.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nintendo has an ever-expanding library of retro games on its console (if you pay the monthly fee for them) and it just feels better to play them on the original controllers. However, Nintendo seemingly only makes about 50 of those per year and they&#8217;re constantly out of stock. Grab an SN30 — they&#8217;re wireless, they work with other platforms and they add analog sticks to the SNES layout so you can play any game with &#8217;90s flair. By &#8220;you&#8221; I mean your loved one, obviously.</p>

<p>The Switch can run out of space fast if you&#8217;re not careful, and it&#8217;s pretty much mandatory to grab a microSD card to expand its storage. Fortunately, expanding the Switch&#8217;s storage is easy and relatively cheap! Grab a 256 GB or 512 GB microSD card and banish storage worries once and for all.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t bother paying any markups for a microSD card with Mario on it or whatever — once it&#8217;s in the console you never see it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Varies by capacity/speed. 512 GB microSDXC, as pictured above, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P7M6K35/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07P7M6K35&amp;linkId=96235896f7073a3210a9eae0a407779c">$75 from Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Subscriptions and digital goods</h2>
<p>These days most gamers need to subscribe to one thing or another — on the consoles, for example, most of the online multiplayer requires a subscription. Figure out what their subscription of choice is and get &#8217;em set up with a few more months, and you know it&#8217;s a gift that&#8217;ll go to good use.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve got options here. If they just want to play online, Xbox Live Gold starts at around $10 a month. If you also want to give them all-you-can-eat access to a surprisingly solid collection of games, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate costs around $15 a month and includes Xbox Live Gold.</p>

<p>Sony also has two different plans: PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now. Plus ($10 a month, or $5 per month if you pay by the year) is what you need for online multiplayer; Now (same pricing) gets you access to hundreds of games. Know that these are two separate subscriptions.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online is pretty bare bones, but if they want online play in Smash Bros or Mario Kart it&#8217;s a must. And, as an added little bonus, it comes with access to a bunch of NES and SNES games.</p>
<p>Wondering what the more expensive &#8220;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack&#8221; is? The short version: For more than double the price, they&#8217;ll throw in access to a bunch of N64 and Sega Genesis games, plus the Animal Crossing Happy Home Paradise expansion. Maybe worth it if Animal Crossing is their thing, maybe not otherwise.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got a bunch of family members who want online access, the Family plan lets you add up to eight users to one $35-per-year account, which works out to about $5 per user per year. That&#8217;s cheap!</p>

<p>Are they super into a specific game? Fortnite? Apex? Halo Infinite?</p>
<p>This is kind of hard to explain, but maaaany games these days have a system — generally called a &#8220;battle pass&#8221; — that rewards you with in-game things (think character skins or dances you can do to taunt your enemies) for logging in and playing. Some of those systems have paid tiers that offer more rewards. Buying those premium upgrades can feel like a bit of a luxury — making it, potentially, a solid gift for the person who can&#8217;t/won&#8217;t splurge on themselves.</p>
<p>One catch? Depending on the game, gifting the battle pass can be tough! The trick, in most cases, is to gift them some of the game&#8217;s respective in-game currency (you want to buy it as a code or card from a trustworthy retailer, generally; there are scams aplenty in these waters), which can generally be used to buy the premium battle pass. In most cases battle passes expire with each in-game &#8220;season&#8221; — so if they&#8217;ve already got that season&#8217;s pass, they can save it for the next one or just use the currency on in-game skins or something else they&#8217;ve been eyeing.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Varies</p>
