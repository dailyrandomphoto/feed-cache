										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech investments in emerging markets have been in full swing over the past couple of years and their ecosystems have thrived as a result. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these markets like Africa, Latin America, and India, have comprehensive reports by publications and firms on trends and investments in their individual regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there&#8217;s hardly a report to compare and contrast trends and investments between these regions and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rightfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Such a task is Herculean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, a <a href="https://bfaglobal.com/catalyst-fund/briter-catalyst-fund-state-of-the-fintech-industry-report/?utm_source=briter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=fintech_report">report</a> released today by data research organization </span><a href="https://briterbridges.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and global inclusive tech accelerator </span><a href="https://bfaglobal.com/project/catalyst-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catalyst Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is punching above its weight to offer a holistic representation to the darling sector of these three markets: fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report &#8220;State of Fintech in Emerging Markets Report&#8221; has three objectives &#8212; to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaluate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the investment, product, and inclusivity trends across emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team surveyed over 177 startups and 33 investors across Africa, Latin America, and India</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Though this sample size used is minuscule, the key findings are quite impressive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s dive in.</span></p>
<h2>Fintechs have raised $23B across the regions since 2017</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s no stopping emerging markets&#8217; favorite. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sector has continued to receive the largest share of investments year-on-year for the past five years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 300 million unbanked African adults account for 17% of the world&#8217;s unbanked population</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it&#8217;s not difficult to see why in 2019, the continent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> five mega deals in Branch, Tala, World Remit, Interswitch, and OPay that amounted to a total of over $775 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this dropped last year to $362 million, companies like Flutterwave, TymeBank, Kuda have raised sizeable rounds during this period</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America is home to a growing base of digital users, enabling regulation and reforms, and vibrant small businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like Africa, the percentage of unbanked people is high, 70%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintechs in the region have taken the opportunity to cater to their needs and have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been compensated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with mega-rounds, including NuBank, Neon, Konfio, and Clip</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, fintech startups have raised $10 billion in the past five years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019 alone, Indian fintech startups raised a record of $4.8 billion, per the report. Then last year, the sector brought in $3 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past five years, they have totaled $11.6 billion with notable names like CRED, Razorpay, Groww, BharatPe, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Africa&#8217;s average seed rounds stand at $1M, India and Latin America average $3M</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the report, early-stage deals have been increasing over the past five years totaling over $1.6 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Their average size, especially for seed rounds, has grown from $750,000 in 2017 to $1 million in 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For  Latin America, the average seed deal in the last five years was around $5.7 million while India did approximately $4.6 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The report says the data for the latter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was skewed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of CRED&#8217;s $30 million seed round.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148378" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148378" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2148378" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="336" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png 2165w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=768,380 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=680,336 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=1536,760 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=2048,1013 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148378" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Briter Bridges &amp; Catalyst Fund</p></div></p>
<h2>Latin America is IPO-hungry, India breeds unicorns while Africa is just getting started with M&amp;A</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Stripe&#8217;s acquisition of Paystack was the highlight of Africa&#8217;s M&amp;As because of its size and the homegrown status of the Nigerian fintech startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other larger rounds include the $500 million acquisition of Wave by WorldRemit (which happens to be the largest from the continent) and the DPO Group buyout by Network International for $288 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the African fintech market that has noticed mega acquisition deals and many undisclosed seven-figure deals, the Latin American fintech market is a sucker for IPOs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the report, fintechs in the region have several $100 million rounds (Nubank, PagSeguro,  Creditas, BancoInter and Neon) but have sparse M&amp;A activity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the startups to have gone public recently include Arco Educacao, Stone Pagamentos, Mosaico, and Pagseguro</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other, India has more than 25 billion-dollar companies and keeps adding yearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month, the country recorded more than eight. These unicorns include established companies like PayTm and new ones like CRED.</span></p>
<h2>Payments, credit, and neobanks lead fintech activity</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report shows that payments companies are the crème de la crème for fintech investment across the three regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Within that subset, B2B payments reign supreme. The next two funded fintech categories are credit and digital banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, payments startups have seen more investments than credit and neobanks. Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, Wave, Paystack, DPO come to mind.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148377" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148377" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2148377" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-8@4x.png?w=680" alt="most funded fintech categories emerging market" width="680" height="330" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-8@4x.png 2263w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-8@4x.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-8@4x.png?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-8@4x.png?resize=768,373 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-8@4x.png?resize=680,330 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-8@4x.png?resize=1536,746 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-8@4x.png?resize=2048,995 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-8@4x.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148377" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Briter Bridges &amp; Catalyst Fund</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America most funded fintechs are neobanks. And it is the only region with all three product categories </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funded at $2-3 billion. Some of these companies include NuBank, Creditas, and dLocal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">India&#8217;s top-funded fintech startups are in payments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it has notable representation in credit and neobanks, some of which have raised nine-figure rounds like Niyo, Lendingkart, and InCred</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Investors are enthused<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>about the future of insurance, payments, and digital banks</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the handful of investors surveyed in the report on their view on future trends in fintech products 5 years from now, most of them chose insurance, payments, and digital banking models</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment platforms and embedded models are also areas of interest. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were less keen on agriculture and remittances while wealth tech platforms and neobanks were also lower </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">priority</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How is it that digital banking and neo-banking are at two ends of the spectrum of investor choice? I can&#8217;t say for sure.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148375" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148375" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2148375" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/36@4x.png?w=680" alt="investors appetite in the coming years emerging markets" width="680" height="428" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/36@4x.png 2273w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/36@4x.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/36@4x.png?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/36@4x.png?resize=768,484 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/36@4x.png?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/36@4x.png?resize=1536,968 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/36@4x.png?resize=2048,1290 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/36@4x.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148375" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Briter Bridges &amp; Catalyst Fund</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parts of the report talk about underserved consumers in these regions and how fintech startups are serving them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also discusses whether these fintech startups </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">promote financial inclusion and what features and products would get them to that point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this, the glaring fact, which is no news, is that Africa is lagging years behind Latin America and India. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking with Briter Bridges director Dario Giuliani, he pointed out that he&#8217;d lean on five years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He added that what makes India a better market at this stage is because it is a country rather than a continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is easier to manage one country than 54 countries in Africa and 20 in Latin America,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch. &#8220;In Africa, we use the label &#8216;Africa,&#8217; but we&#8217;re very much talking about 4-6 countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia who are seeing massive companies rise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. India is one.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key detail the report mentions is that most fintechs across emerging markets are crossing over to different sectors like crop insurance, credit lines for distributors and vendors, KYC, e-commerce payment gateways, medical finance, and insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Guiliani says he expects this to continue.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the pandemic has been good for anything it&#8217;s been good for the therapy business and for startups targeting mental health, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/">VCs kept very busy signing checks</a>. To wit, here&#8217;s another one: Madrid-based <a href="https://ifeelonline.com/en/">ifeel</a> has bagged €5.5 million (~$6.6M) in Series A funding, led by Nauta Capital.</p>
<p>The startup was founded back in 2017 &#8212; initially as a consumer-focused therapy platform &#8212; but last year it pivoted to a hybrid business model, tapping into demand from businesses to offer staff emotional support during the public health crisis. So it&#8217;s available both to individuals via monthly subscription or as part of employer’s or insurance provider’s cover</p>
<p>It says that pandemic pivot has resulted in 1,000% growth in its b2b business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Companies it&#8217;s signed up to offer its platform to their staff include AXA Partners, Glovo and Gympass.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a total of 400K users on the platform (b2c and b2b),&#8221; says co-founder Amir Kaplan. &#8220;We have 100,000 eligible covered who have access to ifeel as a benefit (through our insurance and wellness partners or direct with ifeel).</p>
<p>&#8220;The 100K grew 10x from September 2020 and is the largest trend we are experiencing these days. Employees of 100 companies use ifeel on a weekly basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>ifeel&#8217;s platform delivers both live therapy sessions with licensed psychologists but also provides users with self-care tool such as daily mood trackers, recommended exercises and activities to expand the support available.</p>
<p>&#8220;By combining self-care and guided therapies, <span class="il">ifeel</span> maximises engagement and retention of its users &#8212; with 90% reporting improved emotional and mental well-being after using <span class="il">ifeel</span>,&#8221; it claims.</p>
<p>The startup is using AI technology in the self-care portion of its platform &#8212; to recommend &#8220;the most relevant&#8221; content or exercise to its users, per Kaplan. But he also says it&#8217;s looking at using the tech to assist the therapist practice by developing dedicated tools inside the platform.</p>
<p>ifeel has an international founding team, hailing from three countries (Israel, Italy and Mexico), and says its main markets so far are Spain, France, Brazil and Mexico. While its b2b and insurance network coverage extends to 20 countries and four languages (English, Spanish, French and Portuguese).</p>
<p>With so much competition in the mental health tools space &#8212; from mindfulness apps, to internet-delivered CBT programs, to therapy platforms &#8212; how does ifeel see itself standing out?</p>
<p>Kaplan suggests it has an advantage of being &#8220;global from day one&#8221;, and also flags a &#8220;strong technology integration focus&#8221; which he says has allowed it to plug into insurance companies and wellness players &#8212; to become a &#8220;main service provider&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very early we partnered with global leading companies and we support them in many countries (compared to specific country players like in Germany and UK,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The platform approach is different from &#8216;online therapy&#8217; companies or &#8216;mindfulness apps&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want our users to manage their emotional well being on our platform no matter the need. In this way we create millions of engagement events that are customized to the user’s needs and allow users over time to use different parts of our platform in different life situations.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://kahoot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kahoot</a>, the popular Oslo-based edtech company that has built a big business out of gamifiying education and creating a platform for users to build their own learning games, is making an acquisition to double down on K-12 education and its opportunities to grow in the U.S. It is acquiring <a href="https://clever.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clever</a>, a startup that has built a single sign-on portal for educators, students and their families to build and engage in digital learning classrooms, currently used by about 65% of all U.S. K-12 schools. <a href="https://kahoot.com/press/2021/05/06/kahoot-acquires-clever-accelerating-vision-leading-learning-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kahoot said</a> that the deal &#8212; coming in a combination of cash and shares &#8212; gives Clever an enterprise value of between $435 million and $500 million, dependent on meeting certain performance milestones.</p>
<p>The plan will be to continue growing Clever&#8217;s business in the U.S. &#8212; which currently employs 175 people &#8212; as well as give it a lever for expanding globally alongside Kahoot&#8217;s wider stable of edtech software and services.</p>
<p>“Clever and Kahoot! are two purpose-led organizations that are equally passionate about education and unleashing the potential within every learner,” said Eilert Hanoa, CEO at Kahoot, in a statement. &#8220;Through this acquisition we see considerable potential to collaborate on education innovation to better service all our users – schools, teachers, students, parents and lifelong learners – and leveraging our global scale to offer Clever’s unique platform worldwide. I’m excited to welcome Tyler and his team to the Kahoot family.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news came on the same day that Kahoot, which is traded in Oslo with a <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/KAHOT.OL?p=KAHOT.OL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap of $4.3 billion</a>, also <a href="https://kahoot.com/investor/announcements/kahoot-asa-reports-first-quarter-2021-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced strong Q1 results</a> in which it also noted it has closed its acquisition of Whiteboard.fi, a provider of whiteboard tools for teachers, for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>The same tides that have been lifting Kahoot have also been playing out for Clever and other edtech companies.</p>
<p>The startup was originally incubated in Y Combinator and launched with a vision to be a &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/26/clever-launches-twilio-for-ed-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twilio for education</a>&#8220;, which in its vision was to create a unified way of being able to tap into the myriad of student sign-on systems and educational databases to make it easier for those building edtech services to scale their products, and bring on more customers (schools, teachers, students, families) to use them. As with payments, financial services in general, and telecommunications, it turns out that education is also a pretty fragmented market, and Clever wanted to figure out a way to fix the complexity and put it behind an API to make it easier for others to tap into it.</p>
<p>Over time it built that out also with a marketplace (<a href="https://clever.com/app-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">application gallery</a> in its terminology) of some 600 software providers and application developers that integrate with its SSO, which in turn becomes a way for a school or district to subsequently expand the number of edtech tools that it can use. This has been especially critical in the last year as schools have been forced to close in-person learning and go entirely virtual to help stave off the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Clever has found a lot of traction for its approach both with schools, and investors. With the former, Clever says that it&#8217;s used by 89,000 schools and some 65% of K-12 school districts (13,000 overall) in the U.S., with that figure including 95 of the 100 largest school districts in the country. This works out to 20 million students logging in monthly and 5.6 billion learning sessions.</p>

<div class="benefit--columns">
<div class="benefit--copy-column
        "></p>
<div class="benefit--column-copy text-black text-link-styles">
<p>The latter, meanwhile, has seen the company raise from a pretty impressive range of investors, including YC current and former partners like Paul Graham and Sam Altman, GSV, Founders Fund, Lightspeed and Sequoia. It raised just under $60 million, which may sound modest these days but remember that it&#8217;s been around since 2012, when edtech was not so cool and attention-grabbing, and hasn&#8217;t raised money since 2016, which in itself is a sign that it&#8217;s doing something right as a business.</p>
<p>Indeed, Kahoot noted that Clever projects $44 million in billed revenues for 2021, with annual revenue growth rate of approximately 25% CAGR in the last three years, and it has been running the business on &#8220;a cash flow neutral basis, redeploying all cash into development of its offerings,&#8221; Kahoot noted.</p>
<p>Kahoot itself has had a strong year driven in no small part by the pandemic and the huge boost that resulted in remote learning and remote work. It noted in its results that it had 28 million active accounts in the last twelve months representing 68% growth on the year before, with the number of hosted games in that period at 279 million (up 28%) with more than 1.6 billion participants of those games (up 24%). Paid subscriptions in Q1 were at 760,000, with 255,000 using the &#8220;work&#8221; (B2B) tier; 275,000 school accounts; and 230,000 thousand in its &#8220;home and study&#8221; category. Annual recurring revenue is now at $69 million ($18 million a year ago for the same quarter), while actual revenue for the quarter was $16.2 million (up from $4.2 million a year ago), growing 284%.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the payments company, which powers businesses with its payment API and is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> present in Nigeria and Ghana, is announcing its official launch in South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018 when we reported Paystack&#8217;s $8 million Series A (which Stripe also led), it was powering 15% of all online payments in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company had more than 10,000 businesses on its platform and expansion to other African countries was one way it planned to use the money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ghana was its next stop.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since expanding to Ghana, Paystack has grown and claims to power 50% of all online payments in Nigeria with around 60,000 customers, including small businesses, larger corporates, fintechs, educational institutions and online betting companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of its customers include MTN, SPAR and UPS, and they use the company&#8217;s software to collect payments globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The South African launch </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was preceded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a six-month pilot, which means the project kickstarted a month after Stripe acquired it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe is gearing toward a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hotly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anticipated IPO and has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggressively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding to other markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before acquiring Paystack, the company added 17 countries to its platform in 18 months, but none from Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paystack was its meal ticket to the African online commerce market, and CEO Patrick Collison didn&#8217;t mince words when talking about the acquisition in October</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is an enormous opportunity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In absolute numbers, Africa may be smaller right now than other regions, but online commerce will grow about 30% every year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And even with wider global declines, online shoppers are growing twice as fast. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe thinks on a longer time horizon than others because we are an infrastructure company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are thinking of what the world will look like in 2040-2050,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Stripe said the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/">$600 million it raised in Series H</a> this March would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for European expansion, its foray deeper into Africa has kicked off</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Paystack claims to have had a clear expansion roadmap prior to the acquisition, its relationship with Stripe is accelerating the realization of that pan-African expansion goal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Africa accounts for three of the 42 countries where Stripe currently has customers today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;South Africa is one of the continent&#8217;s most important markets, and our launch here is a significant milestone in our mission to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commerce across Africa,&#8221; said Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade of the expansion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to continue building the financial infrastructure that empowers ambitious businesses in Africa, helps them scale and connects them to global markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six-month pilot saw Paystack work with different businesses and grow a local team to handle on-the-ground operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unlike Nigeria and Ghana, where Paystack has managed to be a top player, what are the company&#8217;s prospects in the South African market where it will face stiff competition from the likes of Yoco and DPO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The opportunity for innovation in the South African payment space is far from saturated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, for instance, digital payments make up less than half of all transactions in the country,&#8221; Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo, product marketer at Paystack said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;So, the presence of competition is not only welcome; it&#8217;s encouraged. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more innovative plays there are, the faster it&#8217;ll be to realize our goal of having an integrated African market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khadijah Abu, head of product expansion, added that &#8220;for many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people compare Paystack to Africa&#8217;s newest fintech unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/flutterwave-and-paypal-partner-to-allow-african-merchants-to-accept-and-make-payments/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Flutterwave</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded a year apart, both companies help businesses accept payments from thousands of businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the latter raised its recent juggernaut <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">$170 million round</a>, it claimed to have 290,000 businesses on its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave has been high-flying </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its pan-African expansion (it has a presence in 20 African countries), Paystack has adopted a rather scrupulous approach</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said the reason behind this lies with the peculiarities each African country presents and because</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> each country has different regulations, launching at scale takes time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal isn&#8217;t to have a presence in lots of countries, with little regard for service quality. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We care </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">deeply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we deliver a stellar end-to-end payment experience in the countries we operate in,&#8221; Jogbojogbo continued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;And this takes some time, careful planning and lots of behind-the-scenes, foundational work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But being backed by Stripe and armed with millions of dollars, Paystack might need to switch things up eventually. Even as it operates independently, its pan-African vision is equally important to Stripe, and speed will be crucial, even the five-year-old company acknowledges this and said, &#8220;its pace of expansion will quicken as it expands into more African countries.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the pandemic, we’ve seen the rise of ‘Zoom investing’ &#8211; where VCs literally use remote video conference tools like Zoom and Google Meet to take pitches from entrepreneurs. Now a new European Seed fund plans to leverage that emerging behavior and bake it into their model.</p>
<p>Mattias Ljungman, the former co-founder of Atomico formed Moonfire when he left in December 2019, but few details were revealed about his new operation. Today Moonfire reveals it will be a $60 million seed-stage  &#8220;data-driven” VC that will also leverage the new advantages of remote working which entrepreneurs themselves have had to adapt to.</p>
<p>Admittedly Ljungman didn’t have much choice. Starting in January 2020, he ended up having to found, raise and close the fund, as well as invest, almost all remotely. But, he says, that means it will continue to take advantage of this &#8216;new normal&#8217;. “We are doing zoom investing. It’s the death of geography, and people are now pretty comfortable with that way of living,” he told me, literally via Zoom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moonfire’s first fund has been raised from LPs spanning the usual swathe of institutional investors, entrepreneurs, and VCs. Cendana, the US-based seed fund investment firm, is the anchor investor. It is joined by Utah School &amp; Institutional Trust Funds Office (SITFO) and Reference Capital, among others. Moonfire says the fund was significantly oversubscribed.</p>
<p>Moonfire will focus on a very broad range of areas which will include Health &amp; Wellbeing, Work &amp; Knowledge, Gaming, Community &amp; Leisure and Capital &amp; Finance. Its most recent investments across Europe include Humaans, Electric Noir Studios, Skunkworks, Pento, Awell Health, Mindstone, Business Score, Homerun, HiPeople, LoveShark, WillaPay, Oliva, Equify, and more.</p>
<p>Ljungman &#8216;knows his onions,&#8217; as the phrase goes. As a co-founder of Atomico he spent 20 years investing tech startups-turned-unicorns including Klarna, Supercell, Viagogo and Climate Corp.</p>
<p>Mike Arpaia and Candice Lo. Arpaia will partner the firm with Ljungman. Former computer scientist Arpaia joins Moonfire with experience from Etsy, Facebook, Kolide, and Workday. Lo has been an entrepreneur but is an operator turned investor with experience at Uber in Europe and China, as well as an early-stage investor with the UK&#8217;s Blossom Capital.</p>
<p>Ljungman says data will form the cornerstone of the fund. He said: “Venture will always be a relationship business, but it should be powered by data, software, and machine learning to hone and optimize everything we do from discovery, screening, and evaluation to delivering better insights for our founders. We are able to enhance traditional thesis-driven investing and make decision-making quicker and more effective.”</p>
<p>Of course, just about every VC these days says it uses data to invest &#8211; Inreach Ventures in London, for instance, is just one of many that makes a great play of this idea.</p>
<p>Over a video call, Ljungman countered: “You&#8217;re looking at utilizing software, automation, and machine learning. If you look at any industry that is what happened &#8211; software is eating it up. It touches every component of your process from discovering companies to managing them, evaluating them, helping them with support. So we still have our thesis-driven approach, but  what we&#8217;re doing is pairing it with software, like a bionic suit, so this is how to augment what we do and do it bigger and better.”</p>
<p>He added: “The European ecosystem is a lot bigger today, so relying on gut instinct, relationships, networking is not going to be efficient. Utilizing software is going to be critical for us. We have 1.4 million people already in our database. These entrepreneurs usually have a really nice history. The average entrepreneur is a lot older than it used to be, as well. If we&#8217;re looking at thousands of companies per year, there are real network effects. The more you build out your data the more you build out your portfolio, the more you make more investments, the better you are at helping and supporting your portfolio companies because you&#8217;ve institutionalized that knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Graham Pingree, Partner at Cendana Capital, said in a statement: “We’ve been watching the European start-up ecosystem mature and grow in the past year and we’re excited to have the opportunity to partner with the team at Moonfire as they look to expand their portfolio. Moonfire, like Cendana, is passionate about supporting founders at the earliest stages of their journey and they have the skills and expertise needed to nurture a new generation of founders.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NFTs were arguably already taking off when Beeple sold his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/beeples-69-million-nft-sale-marks-a-potentially-transformative-moment-for-the-art-world/">NFT artwork for $69m</a>. But another crypto project attracted attention when it bought an original Banksy artwork for $95,000.</p>
<p>The group literally burnt the artwork and sold its NFT on the OpenSea platform for $400,000. Although the stunt was covered by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/banksy-nft-injective-destroy-art-digital-token/">CBS News</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56335948">BBC News</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/mar/09/nfts-flying-cats-burning-banksy-digital-art-crypto-art-bitcoin-rocketing">The Guardian</a>, and others, it did actually make a significant point.</p>
<p>By removing the physical piece, the group &#8211; calling itself “Burnt Banksy” &#8211; proved that the value of the piece wasn’t affected by being destroyed, given that the NFT went up so much in value.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now that project is turning that stunt into an actual blockchain platform for art auctions.</p>
<p><a href="https://burnt.finance/">Burnt Finance</a> says it has raised $3 Million for a decentralized auction protocol built on the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>The project is being incubated by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/injective-protocol-raises-10m-from-pantera-capital-mark-cuban-for-its-defi-robinhood/">Injective Protocol</a> (which recently raised $10 from investors and Mark Cuban, as well as Multicoin, DeFiance, Alameda, Mechanism, Vessel Capital, Hashkey, Spartan, Do Kwon (CEO of Terra), Sandeep (COO of Polygon), and others.</p>
<p>The reason why it&#8217;s worth mentioning all this is that in trying to auction the painting, the Burnt Banksy  group stumbled on an increasing problem in the world of NFTs: the rising congestion on the Ethereum network is leading to larger and larger gas fees. This is making both the creation and bidding on NFTs increasingly expensive, just from a baseline.</p>
<p>As a result, team decided to build the Burnt Finance NFT auction platform away from Etherum and hit upon the Solana blockchain, which has comparatively good speed, performance, and lower transaction costs. It will use &#8216;Solana Wormhole’ which connects ETH and ERC20 tokens to SPL Tokens.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Burnt Finance, &#8216;Burnt Banksy’ told me: &#8220;Most auctions are Ethereum based, and currently the Ethereum gas fees are extremely high. It can cost you up to $70 to make an artwork, which doesn’t work if you&#8217;re selling an NFT for $50. We chose Solana mainly because of the ecosystem. It&#8217;s fast-growing, in addition to the technical aspect of it.”</p>
<p>There’s another reason why we may see other Crypto projects move away from Ethereum as ETH rises in price and as gas fees increase: the potential for bad faith actors in NFT auctions.</p>
<p>If a bad actor tries to leverage the congestion on Ethereum and manipulate the transaction fee, they might sway the results of an auction. This would be quite something, if the auction was for, say, $69 million…</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Einride, the Swedish startup known for its unusual-looking electric and autonomous pods that are designed to carry freight, has raised $110 million to help fund its expansion in Europe and into the United States.</p>
<p>The Series B round, which far exceeds its previous raises of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/einride-raises-10-million-to-fast-track-its-autonomous-electric-cargo-pods/">$10 million</a> in 2020 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/autonomous-trucking-startup-einride-eyes-u-s-market-with-25-million-in-new-funding/">$25 million</a> in 2019, included new investors Temasek, Soros Fund Management LLC, Northzone and Maersk Growth. The company said Thursday that existing investors EQT Ventures, Plum Alley, Norrsken VC, Ericsson and NordicNinja VC also participated in the round.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.einride.tech/">Einride</a> has raised a total of $150 million to date. The company didn&#8217;t share its post-money valuation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company, founded in 2016 by Robert Falck, Linnéa Kornehed, and Filip Lilja, has two kinds of vehicles: connected, electric heavy trucks driven by humans and its driverless Pods.</p>
<p>The electric trucks do much the freight-shuttling work today for customers like Swedish food producer Oatly, Coca-Cola, Lidl and Electrolux. The company&#8217;s pitch is that its electric trucks reduce emissions for its customers by 94% compared to driving with diesel. Einride has also developed a digital platform for carriers that handles planning, scheduling and routing as well as invoices and billing.</p>

<p>The company is perhaps best known for its Einride Pod — once called the T-Pod —  a self-driving truck that doesn&#8217;t have a cab and can be controlled remotely. The first-generation vehicle has been tested on public roads in Sweden and even carried freight in a pilot program for Oatly. In October, the <a href="https://www.einride.tech/press/einride-launches-next-generation-pod-makes-autonomous-electric-transport">unveiled a line of next-generation</a> pod freight-carrying vehicles that depending on its level of autonomy will begin shipping to customers as early as this year.</p>
<p>Einride will be using this significant injection of capital to fulfill current customer contracts, double its 100-person workforce by the end of the year  and expand in Europe and into the United States, according to CEO Robert Falck.</p>
<p>Einride will have operations up and running in the U.S. before the end of the year and are looking to set up a headquarters in Austin, Texas, and additional offices in New York and Silicon Valley, Falck said in an email. Global agreements are in place with brands such as Oatly, which includes U.S. operations, with more to be announced soon, he added.</p>

<p>As Einride continues to scale its human-powered electric trucking operation, it is also working on the long-term goal of rolling out commercial driverless Pods. Einride has said its new Pods will be available with differing levels of autonomy and functionality based on its internal Autonomous Electric Transport (AET) classification system, which ranges from levels 1 to 5.</p>
<p>Its AET 1 Pod is for closed facilities with predetermined routes that are best suited for fully-autonomous operation. The constraints expand from there with Pods at AET 2 designed for closed facility operation with an added capability to traverse public roads over short distances between destinations. Einride has said that these first two level of Pods will begin shipping to customers starting in 2021.</p>
<p>Level 3 allows for operation on backroads and less busy main roads between facilities, at a maximum operating speed of 28 mph. At Level 4, under Einride&#8217;s system, the Pod will operate autonomously on freeways and other major roads at up to 52 mph. Einride has said that Levels 3 and 4 will ship to customers in 2022 and 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While incumbent insurance providers continue to get disrupted by startups like Lemonade, Alan, Clearcover, Pie and many others applying tech to rethink how to build a business around helping people and companies mitigate against risks with some financial security, one issue that has not disappeared is fraud. Today, a startup out of France is announcing some funding for AI technology that it has built for all insurance providers, old and new, to help them detect and prevent it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shift-technology.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shift Technology</a>, which provides a set of AI-based SaaS tools to insurance companies to scan and automatically flag fraud scenarios across a range of use cases &#8212; they include claims fraud, claims automation, underwriting, subrogation detection and financial crime detection &#8212; has raised $220 million, money that it will be using both to expand in the property and casualty insurance market, the area where it is already strong, as well as to expand into health, and to double down on growing its business in the U.S. It also provides fraud detection for the travel insurance sector.</p>
<p>This Series D is being led Advent International, via Advent Tech, with participation from Avenir and others. Accel, Bessemer Venture Partners, General Catalyst, and Iris Capital &#8212; who were all part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/04/shift-technology-raises-60-million-to-detect-insurance-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shift&#8217;s Series C led by Bessemer in 2019</a> &#8212; also participated. With this round, Paris and Boston-based Shift Technology has now raised some $320 million and has confirmed that it is now valued at over $1 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company currently has around 100 customers across 25 different countries &#8212; with the list including Generali France and Mitsui Sumitomo, to give you an idea of where it&#8217;s pitching its business &#8212; and says that it has already analyzed nearly two billion claims, data that&#8217;s feeding its machine learning algorithms to improve how they work.</p>
<p>The challenge (or I suppose, opportunity) that Shift is tackling, however, is much bigger. The Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, a non-profit in the U.S., estimates that at <a href="https://insurancefraud.org/fraud-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">least $80 billion of fraudulent claims</a> are made annually in the U.S. alone, but the figure is likely significantly higher. One problem has, ironically, been the move to more virtualized processes, which open the door to malicious actors exploiting loopholes in claims filing and fudging information. Another is the fact that insurance has grown as a market, but so too has the amount of people who are in financial straights, leading to more desperate and illegal acts to gain an edge.</p>
<p>Shift is also not alone in tackling this issue: the market for insurance fraud detection technology globally was estimated to be worth $2.5 billion in 2019 and projected to be worth <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/01/22/1973834/0/en/The-global-insurance-fraud-detection-market-size-is-expected-to-grow-from-USD-2-5-billion-in-2019-to-USD-7-9-billion-by-2024-at-a-compound-annual-growth-rate-CAGR-of-25-8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as much as $8 billion by 2024</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to others in claims management tech such as Brightcore and Guidewire, many of the wave of insuretech startups are building in their own in-house AI-based fraud protection, and it&#8217;s very likely that we&#8217;ll see a rise of other fraud protection services, built out of adjacent areas like fintech to guard against financial crime, making their way to insurance. As many a fintech entrepreneur has said to me in the past, the mechanics of how the two verticals work and the compliance issues both face are very closely aligned.</p>
<p>“The entire Shift team has worked tirelessly to build this company and provide insurers with the technology solutions they need to empower employees to best be there for their policyholders. We are thrilled to partner with Advent International, given their considerable sector expertise and global reach and are taking another giant step forward with this latest investment,” stated Jeremy Jawish, CEO and co-founder, Shift Technology, in a statement. “We have only just scratched the surface of what is possible when AI-based decision automation and optimization is applied to the critical processes that drive the insurance policy lifecycle.”</p>
<p>For its backers, one key point with Shift is that it&#8217;s helping older providers bring on more tools and services that can help them improve their margins as well as better compete against the technology built by newer players.</p>
<p>“Since its founding in 2014, Shift has made a name for itself in the complex world of insurance,” said Thomas Weisman, an Advent director, in a statement. “Shift’s advanced suite of SaaS products is helping insurers to reshape manual and often time-consuming claims processes in a safer and more automated way. We are proud to be part of this exciting company’s next wave of growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Krafton, the South Korean developer of PUBG Mobile, said on Thursday that it is bringing back the popular gaming title to India under the brand name &#8216;Battlegrounds Mobile India.&#8217; The new title, which uses the color scheme of the Indian flag and is largely a replica of PUBG Mobile, will offer &#8220;a world class AAA multiplayer&#8221; and free-to-play gaming experience on mobile devices, it said.</p>
<p>The developer <a href="https://www.battlegroundsmobileindia.com/news_view/146">said</a> it will open pre-registration for Battlegrounds Mobile India &#8220;soon&#8221; ahead of its launch in the country, but didn&#8217;t share a specific date. The rebranded PUBG Mobile has been exclusively developed for the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, Krafton said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Krafton will collaborate with partners to build an esports ecosystem while bringing in-game content regularly, starting with a series of India specific in-game events at launch, to be announced later,&#8221; it said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s announcement comes months after India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/india-bans-pubg-and-over-100-additional-chinese-apps/">banned PUBG Mobile</a> &#8212; alongside 200 other apps with links to China &#8212; citing national security concerns. In the months since, Krafton has taken several steps &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/pubg-cuts-publishing-ties-with-tencent-games-in-india-a-week-after-ban/">cutting ties with its publishing partner Tencent</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/pubg-mobile-plots-return-to-india-following-ban/">inking a global cloud deal with Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/pubg-mobile-announces-return-to-india-new-game-100-million-investment/">pledging a $100 million investment in India&#8217;s mobile gaming ecosystem</a>, and earlier this year</p>
<p>&#8220;With privacy and data security being a top priority, Krafton will be working with partners, to ensure data protection and security, at each stage. This will ensure privacy rights are respected, and all data collection and storage will be in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in India and for players here,&#8221; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The firm didn&#8217;t say whether it had any conversation with New Delhi and if it had received the approval to launch the new title. Earlier this year, the Indian government said it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/india-retains-ban-on-tiktok-uc-browser-and-57-other-chinese-apps/">retaining its ban on Chinese apps</a>. This isn&#8217;t the first time Krafton has teased PUBG Mobile&#8217;s return to India.</p>
<p>Prior to being banned in India, PUBG Mobile was the most popular mobile game in the country. The app had amassed over 50 million monthly active users in the country. PUBG Mobile still had over 10 million users in India last month, according to a popular mobile insight firm. (Many have been using VPN tools and other workarounds to bypass the geo-restriction.)</p>
<p>The game helped establish an entire ecosystem of esports organisations and even a cottage industry of streamers that made the most of its spectator sport-friendly gameplay, Rishi Alwani, a long-time analyst of Indian gaming market and editor of <a href="https://in.ign.com">IGN India</a>, told TechCrunch in an earlier interview.</p>
<p>Krafton said Battlegrounds Mobile India will launch with a number of restrictions aimed at protecting the wellbeing of minors. Such users will have to provide the phone number of their parent or guardian to play the game, and the daily time and money spend will be limited to 3 hours and about $95, respectively.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/biden-white-house-semiconductor-summit/">persistent semiconductor shortage</a> that is disrupting the global automotive industry, investors remain bullish on the chips used to power next-generation vehicles.</p>
<p>Kneron, a startup that develops semiconductors to give devices artificial intelligence capabilities by using edge computing, just got funded by Delta Electronics, a Taiwanese supplier of power components for Apple and Tesla. The $7 million investment boosts the startup&#8217;s total financing to over $100 million to date.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Kneron also agreed to buy Vatics, a part of Delta Electronics&#8217; <a href="https://www.deltaww.com/en-us/news/7531">subsidiary Vivotek</a>, for $10 million in cash. The new assets nicely complement Kneron&#8217;s business as the startup extends its footprint to the booming smart car industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vatics, an image signal processing provider, has been selling system-on-a-chip (SoC) and intellectual property to manufacturers of surveillance, consumer, and automotive products for many years across the United States and China.</p>
<p>Headquartered in San Diego with a development force in Taipei, Kneron has emerged in recent years as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/kneron-foxconn-funding/">challenge to AI chip incumbents like Intel and Google</a>. Its chips boast of low-power consumption and enable data processing directly on the chips using the startup&#8217;s proprietary software, a departure from solutions that require data to be computed through powerful cloud centers and sent back to devices.</p>
<p>The approach has won Kneron a list of heavyweight backers, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/kneron-foxconn-funding/">strategic investor Foxconn</a>, Qualcomm, Sequoia Capital, Alibaba, and Li Ka-shing&#8217;s Horizons Ventures.</p>
<p>Kneron has designed chips for scenarios ranging from manufacturing, smart homes, smartphones, robotics, surveillance and payments to autonomous driving. In the automotive field, it has struck partnerships with Foxconn and Otus, a supplier for Honda and Toyota.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition, Vatics executives will join Kneron to lead its surveillance and security camera division. The merged teams will jointly develop surveillance and automotive products for Kneron going forward. Image signal processors, coupled with neural processing units, are helpful in detecting objects and ensuring the safety of automated cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;This acquisition will allow us to offer full-stack AI solutions, along with our current class-leading NPUs [neural processing units], and will significantly speed up our go-to-market strategy,&#8221; said Kneron&#8217;s founder and CEO, Albert Liu.</p>

<p>&mdash; Twitter (@Twitter) <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1390026628957417473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>On Twitter for Android or iOS, standard aspect ratio images (16:9 and 4:3) will now display in full without any cropping. Instead of gambling on how an image will show up in the timeline — and potentially ruining an otherwise great joke — images will look just like they did when you shot them.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s new system will show anyone sharing an image a preview of what it will look like before it goes live in the timeline, resolving past concerns that Twitter&#8217;s algorithmic cropping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/twitter-may-let-users-choose-how-to-crop-image-previews-after-bias-scrutiny/">was biased toward highlighting white faces</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s launch is a direct result of the feedback people shared with us last year that the way our algorithm cropped images wasn’t equitable,&#8221; Twitter spokesperson Lauren Alexander said. The new way of presenting images decreases the platform&#8217;s reliance on automatic, machine learning-based image cropping.</p>
<p>Super tall or wide images will still get a centered crop, but Twitter says it&#8217;s working to make that better too, along with other aspects of how visual media gets displayed in the timeline.</p>
<p>For visual artists like photographers and cartoonists who promote their work on Twitter, this is actually a pretty big deal. Not only will photos and other kinds of art score more real estate on the timeline, but artists can be sure that they&#8217;re putting their best tweet forward without awkward crops messing stuff up.</p>

<p>Singapore-based <a href="https://www.rainforest.life/">Rainforest</a> is one of the newest entrants in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/e-commerce-roll-ups-present-the-next-wave-of-disruption-in-consumer-packaged-goods">wave of startups</a> that “roll-up” small e-commerce brands. Launched in January by alumni from some of Southeast Asia’s top startups, including Carousell, OVO and Fave, Rainforest acquires Amazon marketplace sellers. This is similar to the Amazon-centric approach taken by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/">Thrasio</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/"> Branded Group</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">Berlin Brands Group</a>, three of the highest-profile e-commerce aggregators, but Rainforest is one of the first companies in the space to launch out of Asia and focus specifically on acquiring brands in the region. It is also laser-focused on home goods, personal care and pet items, with the goal of building the e-commerce version of conglomerate Newell Brands, whose portfolio includes Rubbermaid, Sharpie and Yankee Candle.</p>
<p>Rainforest announced today that it has raised seed funding of $36 million led by Nordstar with participation from Insignia Venture Partners. This includes equity financing of $6.5 million and a $30 million debt facility from an undisclosed American debt fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer J.J. Chai, who previously held senior roles at Carousell and Airbnb, told TechCrunch that Rainforest raised debt financing (like many other e-commerce aggregators) because it is non-dilutive and will be used to acquire about eight to 12 brands sold through Amazon’s B2B service Fulfilled By Amazon (FBA). The startup’s other co-founders are chief financial officer Jason Tan, who held the same roles at OVO and Fave, and chief technology officer Per-Ola Röst, who previously founded Amazon analytics tool provider Seller Metrix and ran a FBA brand worth seven figures.</p>

<p>Rainforest’s portfolio currently includes three brands, which it acquired for about $1 million each. The company wants to wait until its portfolio is larger to disclose what brands it owns, but Chai said they include a mattress brand that is a best seller on Amazon, a cereal maker and a kitchenware brand. Focusing on specific verticals will allow Rainforest to streamline supply chains, product design and marketing as it scales up its brands.</p>
<p>Amazon’s total gross merchandise volume in 2020 was about $490 billion. According to <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-gmv-in-2020">Marketplace Pulse</a>, $300 billion of that came from third-party sellers. Thrasio and Branded Group, which was started by Lazada co-founder and former CEO Pierre Poignant, also acquire Asian brands, but most e-commerce aggregators have so far focus on American, European or Latin American sellers (like Mexico City-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/">Valoreo</a>, which also recently raised funding). Rainforest will look at sellers in the Asia-Pacific region, including China, Southeast Asia and Australia.</p>

<p>Chai said about 30% of Amazon&#8217;s third-party sellers are based in Asia, and he expects more e-commerce aggregators to launch in the region. “All the ingredients are there and I guess it’s just a matter of time when more people figure it out and solve this problem,” he said. “Everything we’ve seen has worked out, and of course the original creators noticed this trend, which is that there is an explosion of microbrands.”</p>
<p>Rainforest looks for home goods, personal care or pet product FBA sellers that are currently doing about $5 million to $10 million in sales per year, and making a minimum 15% profit margin. Most of its pipeline of potential deals are inbound inquiries. Rainforest can give brands a valuation within two days. If they are interested in the offer, due diligence usually takes about a month, and sellers get the first tranche of their payment in about 40 days.</p>
<p>The company plans to look at other marketplaces in the future, but is starting with Amazon because its analytics allows quicker valuations. Rainforest looks at the “Three R’s,” or product reviews, ratings and ranking, to see how well a seller is performing. It also wants brands that can expand beyond Amazon into other channels and have unique intellectual property with wide appeal. “We’re looking for products that can traverse global markets,” said Chai. “So, for example, no lawnmower covers, a very American kind of thing that’s maybe less relevant in this part of the world, because our intention is to take these brands to their next level potential.”</p>

<p>Many of the brands in Rainforest’s pipeline are run by sole proprietors who have gotten to the point where they need to hire a team to continue growing, but want to exit instead so they can move on to their next venture.</p>
<p>“Being able to create a physical goods brand and build a sizable business out of it is a relatively new phenomenon. It used to be that you needed a factory, big branding, R&amp;D. The combination of online advertising, marketplaces and supply chains being disrupted has created an opportunity where individuals can create brands in the same way that the App Store allowed people to start distributing software,” said Chai. “Where we play into that trend is that there are a lot of microbrands and many will get stuck, so we can give the entrepreneurs a way to exit and bring a brand to its full potential.”</p>

<p class="p2">One of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/e-commerce-roll-ups-present-the-next-wave-of-disruption-in-consumer-packaged-goods/"> biggest funding trends of the past year</a> is companies that consolidate small e-commerce brands. Many of the most notable startups in the space, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/">Thrasio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">Berlin Brands Group</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/"> Branded Group</a>, focus on consolidating Amazon Marketplace sellers. But the e-commerce landscape is more fragmented in the Asia-Pacific region, where sellers use platforms like Tokopedia, Lazada, Shopee, Rakuten or eBay, depending on where they are. That is where<a href="https://www.una-brands.com/"> Una Brands</a> comes in. Co-founder Kiren Tanna, former chief executive officer of Rocket Internet Asia, said the startup is “platform agnostic,” searching across marketplaces (and platforms like Shopify, Magento or WooCommerce) for potential acquisitions.</p>
<p class="p2">Una announced today that it has raised a $40 million equity and debt round. Investors include 500 Startups, Kingsway Capital, 468 Capital, Presight Capital, Global Founders Capital and Maximilian Bitner, the former CEO of Lazada who currently holds the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/vestiaire-collective-raises-216-million-for-its-second-hand-fashion-platform/">same role at secondhand fashion platform Vestiaire Collective</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p class="p2">Una did not disclose the ratio of equity and debt in the round. Like many other e-commerce aggregators, including Thrasio, Una raised debt financing to buy brands because it is non-dilutive. The round will also be used to hire aggressively in order to evaluate brands in its pipeline. Una currently has teams in Singapore, Malaysia and Australia and plans to expand in Southeast Asia before entering Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p class="p2">Tanna, who also founded Foodpanda and ZEN Rooms, launched Una along with Adrian Johnston, Kushal Patel, Tobias Heusch and Srinivasan Shridharan. He estimates that there are more than 10 million third-party sellers spread across different platforms in the Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p class="p2">“Every single seller in Asia is looking at multiple platforms and not just Amazon,” Tanna told TechCrunch. “We saw a big gap in the market where e-commerce is growing very quickly, but players in the West are not able to look at every platform, so that is why we decided to focus on APAC, launch the business there and acquire sellers who are selling on multiple platforms.”</p>

<p class="p2">Una looks for brands with annual revenue between $300,000 to $20 million and is open to many categories, as long as they have strong SKUs and low seasonality (for example, it avoids fast fashion). Its offering prices range from about $600,000 to $3 million.</p>
<p class="p2">Tanna said Una will maintain acquisitions as individual brands “because what’s working, we don’t change it.” How it adds value is by doing things that are difficult for small brands to execute, especially those run by just one or two people, like expanding into more distribution channels and countries.</p>
<p class="p2">“For example, in Indonesia there are at least five or six important platforms that you should be on, and many times the sellers aren’t doing that, so that’s something we do,” Tanna explained. “The second is cross-border in Southeast Asia, which sellers often can’t do themselves because of regulations around customs, import restrictions and duties. That’s something our team has experience in and want to bring to all brands.”</p>

Since it deals with different marketplaces and platforms, Una works with much more fragmented sources of data for revenue, costs, rankings and customer reviews. To scale up, the company is currently building technology to automate its valuation process and will also have local teams in each of its markets. Despite working with multiple e-commerce platforms, Tanna said Una is able to complete a deal within five weeks, with an offer usually happening within two or three days.</p>
<p class="p2">In countries where Amazon is the dominant e-commerce player, like the United States, many entrepreneurs<a href="https://www.modernretail.co/platforms/the-value-of-an-amazon-business-is-surging/"> launch FBA brands</a> with the goal of flipping them for a profit within a few years, a trend that Thrasio and other Amazon roll-up startups are tapping into. But that concept is less common in Una’s markets, so it offers different team deals to appeal to potential sellers. Though Una acquires 100% of brands, it also does profit-sharing models with sellers, so they get a lump sum payment for the majority of their business first, then collect more money as Una scales up the brand. Tanna said Una usually continues working with sellers on a consulting basis for about three to six months after a sale.</p>
<p class="p2">“Something that Amazon players know very well is that they can find a product, sell it for four to five years, and then ideally make a multi-million deal exit and build another product or go on holiday,” said Tanna. “That’s something Asian sellers are not as familiar with, so we see this as an education phase to explain how the process works, and why it makes sense to sell to us.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China expressed concern on Wednesday over India’s move to not grant any Chinese firm permission to participate in 5G trials in the world’s second-largest internet market as the two neighboring nations struggle to navigate business ties amid their geo-political tensions.</p>
<p>India’s Department of Telecommunications earlier this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/india-grants-approval-for-5g-trials-avoids-chinese-firms/">approved over a dozen firms&#8217; applications to conduct a six-month trial</a> to test the use and application of 5G technology in the country.</p>
<p>Among those who have received the approval include international giants such as Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung that will collaborate with Indian telecom operators Jio Platforms, Airtel, Vodafone Idea and MTNL for the trial.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Huawei, ZTE and other Chinese companies that have been operating in India for several years, haven’t received the approval from the Indian government to participate in the upcoming trial. The Indian ministry said earlier this week that it granted permission to those firms that had been picked by the telecom operators.</p>

<p>Wang Xiaojian, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in India, said in a statement on Wednesday that the nation expresses &#8220;concern and regret that Chinese telecommunications companies have not been permitted to conduct 5G trials with Indian Telecom Service Providers in India.”</p>
<p>“Relevant Chinese companies have been operating in India for years, providing mass job opportunities and making contribution to India&#8217;s infrastructure construction in telecommunications. To exclude Chinese telecommunications companies from the trials will not only harm their legitimate rights and interests, but also hinder the improvement of the Indian business environment, which is not conducive to the innovation and development of related Indian industries,” added Xiaojian.</p>
<p>Last year, Airtel (India’s second-largest telecom operator) said that it was open to collaborating with global technology firms, including those from China, for components. “Huawei, over the last 10 or 12 years, has become extremely good with their products to a point where I can safely today say their products at least in 3G, 4G that we have experienced is significantly superior to Ericsson and Nokia without a doubt. And I use all three of them,” Sunil Mittal, the founder of Airtel, said at a conference last year.</p>
<p>In the same panel, then U.S. commerce secretary Wilbur Ross had urged India and other allies of the U.S. to avoid Huawei.</p>
<p>The geo-political tension between India and China escalated last year with skirmishes at the shared border. India, which early last year amended a rule to make it difficult for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/to-avoid-hostile-takeovers-amid-covid-19-india-mandates-approvals-on-chinese-investments/">Chinese firms to invest in Indian companies</a>, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/india-bans-pubg-and-over-100-additional-chinese-apps/">since banned over 200 apps, including TikTok, UC Browser and PUBG Mobile</a>, that have ties with China over national security concerns.</p>

<p>India’s move earlier this week follows similar decisions taken by the U.S., U.K. and Australia, all of which have expressed concerns about Huawei and ZTE and their ties with the Chinese government.</p>
<p>“The Chinese side hopes that India could do more to enhance mutual trust and cooperation between the two countries, and provide an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory investment and business environment for market entities from all countries, including China, to operate and invest in India,&#8221; <a href="http://in.china-embassy.org/eng/embassy_news/t1873540.htm">wrote Xiaojian</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, China expressed &#8220;serious concerns&#8221; and &#8220;firmly opposed&#8221; India&#8217;s charges that Chinese apps posed national security concerns. The Chinese Embassy had alleged that by banning apps with links to China, New Delhi was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/pubg-cuts-publishing-ties-with-tencent-games-in-india-a-week-after-ban/">engaging in &#8220;discriminatory practices&#8221; that &#8220;violated WTO rules.&#8221;</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Surprised by the revenue miss? Shocked by the profit beat? Startled by the sharp drop in the value of Uber's stock? Let's unpack the numbers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/investors-cheer-as-lyfts-q1-revenue-didnt-fall-as-much-as-expected/">followed Lyft</a> in reporting its Q1 2021 earnings this week. And like its rival, <a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-Announces-Results-for-First-Quarter-2021/">its results</a> take a little bit of work to understand. So, this afternoon, we&#8217;re going to parse them as a pair so that we both understand what&#8217;s going on at the ride-hailing and food-delivery giant.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Let&#8217;s start with the big numbers: Uber&#8217;s revenue missed sharply, while its profitability beat expectations.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the big numbers: Uber&#8217;s revenue missed sharply, while its profitability beat expectations. In numerical terms, Uber reported $2.9 billion in revenue for the three-month period, sharply under the $3.28 billion investors <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UBER/analysis?p=UBER">had expected</a>. However, while the street had anticipated that the company would post a $0.54 loss per share, Uber&#8217;s GAAP results actually came to a far more modest $0.06 per-share loss.</p>
<p>How did investors vet Uber&#8217;s performance? The company&#8217;s stock is off around 4% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Surprised by the revenue miss? Shocked by the profit beat? Startled by the sharp drop in the value of Uber&#8217;s stock? Let&#8217;s unpack the numbers.</p>
<h2>Uber&#8217;s quarter</h2>
<p>A number of things impacted Uber&#8217;s quarter. The first, of course, was COVID-19. The pandemic shows up in a host of ways across Uber&#8217;s results, but most critically it continued to negatively impact Uber&#8217;s ride business and positively impact its delivery business.</p>
<p>Turning to numbers, here&#8217;s the company&#8217;s <em>gross bookings </em>data, which includes both segments:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148200" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148200" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2148200 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-5.22.16-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="242" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-5.22.16-PM.png 705w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-5.22.16-PM.png?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-5.22.16-PM.png?resize=300,107 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-5.22.16-PM.png?resize=680,242 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-5.22.16-PM.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148200" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Uber</p></div></p>
<p>A few things to note. First, Uber&#8217;s total platform spend went up in aggregate on a year-over-year basis. That&#8217;s good. And as we look at the year-over-year changes, that delivery&#8217;s growth compared to the year-ago period was nearly legendary. (Postmates is in there, so take that into account.) The ride-hailing business&#8217;s decline feels somewhat modest in comparison. And we&#8217;d note that Uber&#8217;s freight efforts are very nearly material.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX flew the 15th prototype of its Starship fully reusable next-generation rocket today, with a test flight that included a successful climb to around 30,000 feet, as well as a controlled flip, descent and soft landing upright as planned. A very small fire appeared to break out at the base of the rocket shortly after landing but it was contained. The craft was powered by three Raptor rocket engines, which shut down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee (it&#8217;s highest point, around 10km).</p>
<p>This is a big milestone for SpaceX, which has flown prototypes before, but which hasn’t yet seen a test conclude with the test vehicle intact. Prototypes SN8 and SN9 were destroyed while trying to land, while SN10 exploded shortly after landing. It’s last test launch, SN11, ended in an explosion and total loss of the rocket just before touchdown.</p>
<p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk confirmed the good touchdown of 150-foot SN15 just after the launch livestream concluded. This is a key step in development of the Starship’s orbital capabilities, which will require the vehicle to perform this landing maneuver after it’s launched to space atop a Super Heavy booster rocket (also in development) and makes the return trip from orbit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SN15 also features a number of &#8220;vehicle improvements across structures, avionics and software&#8221; that includes &#8220;engines that will allow more speed and efficiency throughout production and flight: specifically, a new enhanced avionics suite, updated propellant architecture in the aft skirt, and a new Raptor engine design and configuration,&#8221; SpaceX said on its website.</p>
<p>SpaceX aims to use Starship for future lunar and Mars launches and landings.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/faa-authorizes-spacexs-next-three-starship-test-launches/">gave authorization</a> for SpaceX to conduct its next three test flights of its Starship program, including Wednesday&#8217;s flight. The next two will be the flights of SN16 and SN17 Starships.</p>

<p>Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.</p>
<p>Today’s entry marks the third time the new crew and I have put this note together for you. Frankly, it’s been a blast. We also want to improve the missive over time. So! <a href="mailto:alex.wilhelm@techcrunch.com">Shoot me a note directly</a> with your feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Turning to today: I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/despite-gains-gender-diversity-in-vc-funding-struggled-in-2020/">got to help write a long-form piece</a> digging into what drove 2020’s disappointing startup fundraising gender equality numbers. With that in mind, let’s get into the rest of the news. &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>Peloton treads backward</h2>
<p>Leading the site today was news that former unicorn and now public company Peloton admitted that its treadmill products are dangerous. The company is recalling them. And TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">broke the news</a> that the company has a pretty serious cybersecurity leak. Big ups to <a href="https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker?">Zack</a> for leading our reporting there.</p>
<p>Investors were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-stock-crashes-following-recalls-security-report/">incensed about the recall</a>. For both its cost, I reckon, but also because the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/17/consumer-agency-warns-against-peloton-tread-use-as-company-pushes-back/">arguing in public that consumer safeguard groups were wrong</a> just weeks ago. Imagine if you were an investor, content that Peloton knew better. And then it wound up not knowing better. And now your shares are off 13% to 14% in a single day. (<a href="https://twitter.com/bheater">Brian</a> has been great on this story, in case you’re looking for someone new to follow on Twitter. If that’s you, could I also interest you in a 45-minute Power Zone Endurance ride? I’ll be doing one with <a href="https://twitter.com/aiddya/status/1378410244716568583">Matt</a> later. Feel free to join.)</p>
<p>On a more serious note, Peloton faces a grip of competition from Tonal (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/">read our EC-1 here</a>), to Mirror (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/">which exited last year</a>), all the way back to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/gamified-connecting-rowing-machine-maker-ergatta-raises-30m/">recently funded Ergatta</a>, which wants you to row at home. With smart tech! All that’s to say that there are lots of startups and venture capital bets aiming at Peloton, and this was a very, very bad day for Big Bike.</p>
<h2>Let’s talk about some seed deals</h2>
<p>But enough about public companies and their inability to make safe products. Let’s get into some recent venture capital deals that you need to know about. Here are my favorites from the day, and one that I wrote:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/alifehealth-seed/">This startup wants to bring clarity to the complex world of IVF</a> &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha’s</a> piece on <a href="https://www.alifehealth.com/">Alife Health’s</a> $9.5 million seed round is a good reminder that fertility rates are falling around the world. It’s a big problem, er, TAM, to build a startup against.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/music-mixing-marketplace-engineears-raises-1m-with-help-from-kendrick-lamar/">Music mixing marketplace EngineEars raises $1M, with help from Kendrick Lamar</a> &#8212; The good news is that Brian figured out what Kendrick has been up to. The bad news is that it’s not a new record. Instead he’s helping fund a marketplace for audio engineers, namely a $1 million investment into <a href="https://engineears.com/">EngineEars</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/text-blaze-raises-3-3m-for-its-speed-writing-automation-service/">Text Blaze raises $3.3M for its speed-writing automation service</a> &#8212; I wrote this one, looking at a very neat startup at the intersection of automation and text. Basically, if you write a lot and often write a lot of the same stuff, <a href="https://blaze.today/">Text Blaze</a> is worth a look. (Also, its URL is blaze.today. Well, if they insist.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Closing up, a note on the amount of money that is still sloshing around the venture capital world. Early Zoom investor Emergence Capital is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/emergence-known-for-its-enterprise-bets-just-rounded-up-nearly-1-billion-across-two-new-funds/">out with two new funds</a> worth nearly $1 billion. The main vehicle is a sixth early-stage fund worth $575 million. Looking back in time, the company’s fifth fund was worth $435 million. Its fourth was worth just $335 million, <a href="https://twitter.com/cookie?lang=en">Connie</a> reports.</p>
<p>Inflation! Venture style, I suppose. Also having been to dinner at an Emergence partner’s house in a better part of San Francisco than the one I used to live in, I can confirm that some of the company’s funds have done well for both it and its backers. That or he was already rich.</p>
<h2><strong>Advice and analysis from Extra Crunch</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>One CMO’s honest take on the modern chief marketing role</strong></h3>
<p>Every C-level executive faces unique challenges, but the chief marketing officer may be the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Marketing is more art than science, which means everyone from the CEO to the person who waters the office plants can have an opinion about a PR blitz or the latest white paper.</p>
<p>That pressure takes a toll. According to management consultants Korn Ferry, the average tenure of a CMO is 3.5 years, the shortest of all C-suite roles.</p>
<p>In an exposé drawn from his own experience, Daniel Incandela, chief marketing officer of Terminus, shares his thoughts about what startups <em>really</em> expect from their lead storytellers. If you&#8217;re looking for a senior marketing role or know someone who is, read and share.</p>

<h3><strong>4 strategies for building a digital health unicorn</strong></h3>
<p>Two startups in Merck Global Health Innovation Fund&#8217;s portfolio — Preventice Holdings and Livongo — exited as unicorns last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we are expecting two more unicorn exits in 2021,&#8221; says GHI Fund President Bill Taranto.</p>
<p>Growing a health tech startup into a billion-dollar company isn&#8217;t easy, but it is somewhat straightforward, he says. For example, a CFO should be one of a digital health company&#8217;s first employees:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiring just a bookkeeper or an accountant will create headaches for you later as you look to raise capital and support business development.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Apple goes Google, naturally</h2>
<p>At this point you’ve either decided to tune into the Apple-Epic spat, or you have decided not to. If you have, here’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/epic-vs-apple-shows-the-courts-were-not-prepared-for-the-games-industrys-obsessive-secrecy">some more</a> on the matter. If you aren’t into it, we can move on.</p>
<p>But not from Apple, which is following Google into trying to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/apple-expands-its-ad-business-with-a-new-app-store-ad-slot/">juice more ad dollars</a> from its existing properties and expanding the ad density of its app store search feature. Here’s <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahintampa?lang=en">Sarah</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is introducing a new way for developers to advertise on the App Store. Previously, developers could promote their apps after users initiated a search on the App Store by targeting specific keywords. For example, if you typed in “taxi,” you might then see an ad by Uber in the top slot above the search results. The new ad slot, however, will reach users before they search.</p></blockquote>
<p>If this is what Apple is doing to its products now, imagine what comes next. Happily I don’t like apps, so I will largely avoid these ads.</p>
<p>Turning to the rest of Big Tech, we’ve seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/investors-cheer-as-lyfts-q1-revenue-didnt-fall-as-much-as-expected/">better-than-expected earnings from Lyft this week</a>, with Uber set to report after the bell today. <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">Kirsten</a> and I are cooking up something longer on both sets of results soon.</p>
<p>Also in the Big Tech bucket are a new clone from Facebook, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/facebook-neighborhoods-nextdoor/">this time of Nextdoor</a>, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/twitter-rolls-out-improved-reply-prompts-to-cut-down-on-harmful-tweets/">trying to get you to post better tweets</a>, and a new cloud framework that <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron</a> reports is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/emerging-open-cloud-security-framework-has-backing-of-microsoft-google-and-ibm/">getting a nod of approval from Microsoft and Google and IBM</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the Equity crew <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/the-morality-and-efficacy-of-going-public-earlier/">spoke to two CFOs</a> about the efficacy and morality of going public earlier. Honestly, it was a blast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chime might call itself the &#8220;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/chime-card/about/">fastest-growing fintech in the U.S.</a>,&#8221; but it has agreed to stop referring to itself as a &#8220;bank,&#8221; per a <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/chime-forced-to-scrub-use-of-word-bank-after-regulators-pushback">new report</a> out of American Banker.</p>
<p>Evidently, the eight-year-old, San Francisco-based outfit was the target of an investigation by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation after Chime used “chimebank” in its website address, as well as used “bank” and “banking” elsewhere in its advertisements, according to the agency in a <a href="https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/337/2021/04/Admin.-Action-Chime-Financial-Inc.-Settlement-Agreement.pdf">settlement agreement</a>.</p>
<p>As noted by AB, Chime made the decision to settle ahead of a deadline imposed by the regulatory body.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The development won&#8217;t surprise anyone familiar with U.S. banking laws. No outfit can represent itself as a bank or credit union unless it&#8217;s licensed to engage in the business of banking. The commission that pushed back on Chime issues such licenses and regulates state-chartered banks in the state of California through the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, and it said in the settlement that &#8220;at all relevant times herein, Chime was not licensed to operate as a bank in California or in any other jurisdiction, nor was it exempt from such licensure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chime has at times attempted to draw a distinction between itself and a bank. When the company raised its most recent round of funding &#8212; a $485 million Series F round last September that valued the business at $14.5 billion &#8212; CEO Chris Britt <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/chime-is-now-worth-14point5-billion-surging-past-robinhood-as-the-most-valuable-us-consumer-fintech-.html">told CNBC</a>: “We’re more like a consumer software company than a bank . . . It’s more a transaction-based, processing-based business model that is highly predictable, highly recurring and highly profitable.”</p>
<p>Still, Chime, like many newer fintech companies, has seemingly embraced the term &#8220;neobank&#8221; and &#8220;challenger bank,&#8221; and perhaps it&#8217;s no wonder. It&#8217;s certainly easier to convey to consumers what it is selling, which is banking services that include &#8212; in this case &#8212; debit cards, spending accounts and savings accounts, all offered through users&#8217; mobile phones.</p>
<p>Given the settlement, expect to see more startups like Chime make clearer that in <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sofi-plans-to-acquire-community-bank-to-speed-up-bank-charter-process-11615293074">most cases</a>, they do not have a bank charter and instead are being provided services by banks that do. In Chime&#8217;s case, for example, it now makes more plain on its website that it is a &#8220;financial technology company&#8221; and &#8220;not a bank&#8221; and that its services are being provided by the The Bancorp Bank and Stride Bank, which are both FDIC members.</p>
