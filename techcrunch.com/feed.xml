										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://resilience.care">Resilience</a>, a new startup that wants to help cancer treatment institutes as well as cancer patients at every step of the treatment journey. It’s an ambitious project founded by two well-known French entrepreneurs. They want to leverage their tech skills for this new healthcare startup.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, there are two co-CEOs —&nbsp;Céline Lazorthes and Jonathan Benhamou. Nicolas Helleringer and Matthieu Pozza are the two remaining co-founders acting as CTO and CPO respectively. Lazorthes previously co-founded <a href="https://www.leetchi.com">Leetchi</a>, the leading money pot company in France. She also started <a href="https://www.mangopay.com">MangoPay</a>, a marketplace payment solution, as a spinout company. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa acquired both companies.</p>
<p>Benhamou co-founded PeopleDoc, a cloud-based HR service. In 2018, his company was acquired by Ultimate Software. Following the acquisition, he served as an executive in the publicly quoted company. Shortly after, private equity firm Hellman &amp; Friedman Capital Partners acquired Ultimate Software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, they both spent a lot of time working together on a nonprofit called <a href="https://www.protegetonsoignant.com">ProtegeTonSoignant</a>. Along with 140 people, they raised €7.4 million ($8.8 million) in donations to buy personal protective equipment and deliver it to hospitals in need. It was a fundraising and logistics challenge.</p>
<p>After spending a lot of time talking with healthcare professionals, they decided to “dedicate at least the next ten years to those who save lives,” Lazorthes said.</p>
<p>It seems like an ambitious bet, and they’re aware of that. “We don’t know anything about healthcare just like we didn’t know anything about HR and finance. We’re entering a market that is highly regulated,” Benhamou told me.</p>
<p>That’s why they chose to focus on one area in particular — cancer care. While research institutes have made some tremendous progress over the past few years, it has become increasingly more complicated to treat cancer. For instance, Benhamou says he expects to see 300 new treatments over the next three years. Treatment is slowly evolving from broad spectrum treatments to targeted treatments.</p>
<p>Cancer treatment facilities face three issues. First, “a human brain can’t assimilate all this data,” Benhamou said. Second, as life expectancy increases, there are more cancer cases every year. A tumor board is going to spend a minute and a half or two minutes on a specific case to make a therapeutic decision.</p>
<p>Third, as a result of the first two problems, patients are left on their own. For instance, they suffer from side effects because there’s no dosage adjustment in their treatment.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125579" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125579" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Resilience-Team.jpg" alt="" width="1024" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2125579" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125579" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Resilience</p></div></p>
<p>Starting from there, Resilience wants to become a full-stack software solution for cancer treatment for both the medical team and patients. When it comes to practitioners, Resilience will be a software-as-a-service solution that can augment therapeutic decisions. The company will categorize scientific literature, use machine learning to find some similarities with past cases and surface clinical trials based on various criteria.</p>
<p>When it comes to patients, there will be a web and mobile app to access content and information about their cancer. In particular, Resilience could help you understand side effects and treat them.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to prove that the app can improve the quality of life of the patients,” Lazorthes said. Resilience also wants to leverage its app to ask questions and collect data to improve treatments.</p>
<p>The startup is already putting together a data science team. It will use natural language processing to parse scientific literature. It will also work with a medical team to double-check everything.</p>
<p>When it comes to finding similarities between patients, the company is signing partnerships with various hospitals to get data from past cases.</p>
<p>Resilience has raised a $6 million funding round (€5 million) led by <a href="https://singular.vc">Singular</a>, the VC firm founded by former Alven partners Raffi Kamber and Jérémy Uzan. Tech business angels Nathalie Balla (La Redoute), Xavier Niel (Free), Jean-Charles Samuelian (Alan), Roxanne Varza (Station F) and more are also participating.</p>
<p>There are also some healthcare investors in today’s funding round, such as Charles Ferté (AstraZeneca), Philippe Dabi (Bioclinic) and Thomas Clozel (Owkin).</p>
<p>Resilience is a mission-driven company — the company is partnering with a scientific board and a patient board. Gustave Roussy, one of the leading cancer research institutes in the world, is also acting as a co-founder in Resilience.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of stakeholders, but it’s the right thing to do when you’re building a healthcare company. Resilience now has the right system of checks and balance to iterate on its product and roll out a product that has a chance of actually improving cancer treatment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Montreal-headquartered Inovia Capital has raised $450 million for Growth Fund II, the firm&#8217;s second growth-stage investment fund. The close of this funding comes just a little over two years after the announcement of its first in February 2019, a $400 million pool of investment capital that marked Inovia&#8217;s first foray beyond the early stage deals [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Montreal-headquartered <a href="https://www.inovia.vc">Inovia Capital</a> has raised $450 million for Growth Fund II, the firm&#8217;s second growth-stage investment fund. The close of this funding comes just a little over two years after the announcement of its first in February 2019, a $400 million pool of investment capital that marked Inovia&#8217;s first foray beyond the early stage deals it originally focused on.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Inovia now has investments across every stage of a company&#8217;s development — including retaining stakes in some of its portfolio companies that have had successful exits to the public markets, like Lightspeed, the point-of-sale and commerce company that went public in a nearly $400 million public offering on both the NYSE and the TSX last year.</p>
<p>As with Growth Fund I, the goal of Growth Fund II is to invest in companies with a focus primarily on Canadian startups, but also looking to targets in the U.S. and EU, where Inovia also maintains offices. The firms&#8217; partners, including Chris Arsenault, Dennis Kavelman, and former Google CFO Patrick Pichette, have focused on building out a team of experienced operators to help their portfolio companies, and invest specifically in areas of particular need for startups outside the Valley, like sourcing high-demand, senior talent with high-profile tech industry experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Inovia&#8217;s original Growth Fund was based on an assumption that the firm could leverage its relationships and its experience to deliver value to its portfolio companies not just when they&#8217;re starting out, but across their growth cycles. Arsenault explained in an interview that Fund I was kind of a proof point that that this assumption was correct, which then paid big dividends when the firm went out to raise Fund II last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We basically built the team around Dennis, Patrick and myself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We really followed through on our key assumptions over why it made sense for Inovia to use its platform to actually build a growth stage fund that would benefit not only from insights into the portfolio, but also all of the relationships and the platform that we built over the last decade.&#8221;</p>
<p>What needed proving, Arsenault said, was that Inovia could stand toe-to-toe with the growth-focused firms that had acted as follow-on investors for its early stage deals over the years. That was no easy task, when you consider that Inovia provided deal flow to some of the most respected venture firms in technology, including Bessemer, KKR, TA Ventures and Sequoia.</p>
<p>Inovia hired a lot of operators with experience at high-growth companies, and focused on being able to shepherd its investments through challenges like building a real board, and engineering a cap table to properly manage and prepare secondary sales. With a plan to invest in between 10 to 12 companies with the $400 million in Fund I, Inovia began making deals – the first was with Lightspeed, and then they got into Forward (tech-enabled primary health care), Hopper and Snaptravel (two travel industry startups) and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125518" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125518" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125518" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125518" class="wp-caption-text">Inovia Capital growth partners Chris Arsenault, Dennis Kavelman and Patrick Pichette (left to right)</p></div></p>
<p>Most of the companies that Lightspeed picked with Fund I (it did 10 deals in total) ended up having a very strong 2020 – including, surprisingly, all the travel-focused startups. Based on the strength of their performance, Arsenault and his partners decided to accelerate their timetable for raising Fund II, and found LPs more than willing. They ended up capping the fund at $450 million (with a target of between 10 to 12 investments, as with Fund I) given what Arsenault says felt like the right size for managing across the investment and operating team, despite available demand to likely raise quite a bit more.</p>
<p>Arsenault noted that most of the LPs contributing to this fund also had capital in the first, though some new investors have also signed on. And while Inovia&#8217;s focus is not strictly Canadian, he added that the firm&#8217;s success, along with the makeup of its investment partners and portfolio (two-thirds of the companies it has backed are Canadian) tells a story of a changing investment landscape north of the border.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of our LPs are Canadian, and I take it to heart that it&#8217;s important to create patterns of success, so that people can look towards models and either replicate or adapt to their own situation,&#8221; Arsenault said. &#8220;I think that we need more success stories that people can look at and say, &#8216;I can do the same thing, or I can do better.&#8217; And the fact that our LPs came back with us, and when you look at, you know, what Georgian [Partners] is doing, and what Novacap is doing, and what OMERS Growth – this is nothing like the VC ecosystem and industry that I was in 10 years ago, right? We&#8217;re definitely on another level now in Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that there are examples at every stage of company-building, citing the new <a href="https://www.backboneangels.com">Backbone Angels collective</a> led by a number of post and current Shopify employees including Arati Sharma, Atless Clark, Lynsey Thornton and Alexandra Clark. Arsenault also pointed to Lightspeed&#8217;s decision to list first on the TSX before the NYSE as a sign of newfound tech industry maturity in the Canadian context.</p>
<p>Finally, Arsenault credits an unusual &#8216;X&#8217; factor in how Inovia has been able to put together this second fund and manage deep involvement in its very active portfolio companies over the last year: the mostly remote conditions brought on by the necessities of the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have been impossible to do what we did within the portfolio, with the portfolio, fundraising a new fund, generating our best year, in terms of exits last year, we had the New York Stock Exchange IPO for Lightspeed, we had a dozen transactions of acquisitions where our portfolio companies are doing the acquiring,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how we would have done what we&#8217;ve done, had we been traveling and had a normal life.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ikigai.money/">Ikigai</a>, a London fintech founded by former McKinsey partners, thinks there&#8217;s room in the crowded challenger market for a new premium offering that combines digital banking with wealth management.</p>
<p>Targeting future and present high-net-worth individuals, Ikigai is iOS-only for now and consists of a current account and savings account, with adjacent wealth management features, all combined in a single app and card. The thesis, says the founding team, is that currently there is very little on the market that provides a modern digital-first banking experience and the kind of premium banking services typically offered by legacy banks to their more affluent customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our typical client is young &#8212; usually in their late twenties or thirties,&#8221; explains Ikigai co-founder Edgar de Picciotto. &#8220;They’re entering their prime spending and earning years, and are looking to secure their financial future. Although they’re not high-net-worths yet, they have aspirations and goals &#8212; and they want to do more with their money&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IR5d9pywRy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/01/interest-ing/">Monzo launches interest-earning savings accounts</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Monzo launches interest-earning savings accounts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/01/interest-ing/embed/#?secret=IR5d9pywRy" data-secret="IR5d9pywRy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Rather than a freemium model, Ikigai charges a flat subscription fee from the get-go, and new users gain access to a relationship manager, which differentiates it from most digital-first banking. Features include an &#8220;everyday&#8221; spending account, and a saving section of the app, dubbed &#8220;nest”. The latter is separate from the spending account, including having its own account number, but can be easily topped up from the everyday account.</p>
<p>So far, quite me-too, you might conclude. However, where some more differentiation arguably comes into play is that Ikigai also offers &#8220;fully managed, globally diversified investment portfolios&#8221; under the wealth section of the app. Portfolios are built and managed by Ikigai in collaboration with asset manager BlackRock, and take into account both risk appetite and the nature of what users want to achieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We say it a lot but Ikigai was very much born from personal frustration,&#8221; says de Picciotto. &#8220;Everything on the market seemed to be slow, impersonal, full of attempts to sell lending and debt products. It felt like either the tech was there or the humanity, never both. That was the first thing we knew we wanted to solve&#8221;.</p>
<p>“Banking can also be way too time-consuming, investing even more so,&#8221; adds Maurizio Kaiser, Ikigai&#8217;s other co-founder. &#8220;There is so much for people to do when they have to do it themselves. It can basically become a second job if you’re constantly looking at different stocks and shares working out if the value is under this or over that. No one really has time for that &#8212; I certainly didn’t&#8221;.</p>

<p>Once the pair dug deeper, as management consultants are wont to do, they say they also discovered &#8220;interesting behavioural trends,&#8221; particularly when it comes to young and affluent people.</p>
<p>&#8220;This group are entering their prime earning and spending years, and they expect so much more from their banks than previous generations,&#8221; says de Picciotto. &#8220;Not only do they expect faster, fairer and better experiences, they have specific expectations and demands that current financial providers just don’t meet. This includes things like approaching personal finance as an act of self-care, like lifestyle banking over lifestage banking, and aligning their money with their goals and sense of purpose&#8221;.</p>
<p>Notably, unlike many of the first wave of challenger banks that made a virtue out of claims to be building their own core banking technology, Ikigai is primarily partnering with technology providers, including Railsbank and WealthKernel.</p>
<p>“Going with banking-as-a-service providers actually makes it easier to execute on our vision,&#8221; claims de Picciotto. &#8220;It allows us to focus on what we are good at and really matters to our customers: the user experience&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YJD76RdvMI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/25/starling-wealthify/">Challenger bank Starling adds investment service Wealthify to its in-app marketplace</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On banking competitors, Ikigai&#8217;s founders argue that existing incumbents and challengers both have &#8220;significant&#8221; failings.</p>
<p>Incumbents are too dependent on branches or telephone services, and are premised on cross-selling and up-selling services, particularly lending products, in order to make money on loss-making current accounts.</p>
<p>Challengers, on the other hand, are &#8220;faster and more accessible&#8221;. However, in a bid to keep their cost-base low, they are increasingly automating their chat support and, in some cases, hiding live chat features.</p>
<p>&#8220;Delivering a high-quality service is obviously at odds with their aim of offering banking for free,&#8221; concludes Kaiser.</p>

<p>Today it announced financing totalling €750 million (around $895 million at today&#8217;s rates), money that it will be using to continue expanding its business &#8212; specifically, for acquisitions; to launch in new markets in Europe, Latin America and Asia; and to build out the suite of services that it provides to businesses. The company is already active in 33 countries (most recently Chile, Colombia, and Romania) and has some 3 million businesses as customers.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from Goldman Sachs, Temasek, Bain Capital Credit, Crestline, and funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management. SumUp confirmed that the financing is coming in the form of debt, not equity, so there is no formal valuation of the company to disclose. To date, it&#8217;s one of the biggest financings, debt or otherwise, for any startup (that is, any privately-backed tech company) in the region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notably, Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital led a $371 million round of debt for the company in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-16/goldman-bain-back-371-million-loan-to-u-k-fintech-startup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a>.</p>
<p>Marc-Alexander Christ, one of SumUp&#8217;s co-founders (the company does not seem to use formal titles like &#8220;CEO&#8221;), said that the company opted for debt over equity because it could.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have very stable cash flow, which allows us to take on take on debt,&#8221; he said in an interview. Debt is often a route taken by bigger, scaled up companies, especially those generating a lot of cash. No dilution also means the cost of capital is lower, too.</p>
<p>The company got its start back in 2012 as one of a wave of so-called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/23/make-way-for-another-european-square-sumup-launches-with-20m-in-backing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Square &#8220;clones&#8221;</a> &#8212; companies being founded in, but mostly outside of, the U.S. and basing their service around small card payment dongles that attached to phones or tablets. Targeting businesses that were either not yet accepting card payments because they were too expensive or complicated, or were using costly traditional alternatives from banks, they quickly picked up steam and represented a new wave of tech-enabled fintech services catering to small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>As with Square, iZettle (eventually acquired by PayPal) and many others in the space, over time SumUp diversified into a range of other card- and payment-related services for their customers, including building online shops and taking payments over the web and via apps, invoicing, gift cards and wider point-of-sale solutions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also emerged as something of a consolidator in the space: in 2016 SumUp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/27/sumup-and-payleven-merge-as-european-square-clones-consolidate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired one of its bigger competitors</a>, the Rocket Internet-backed Payleven, which helped expand its footprint to a wider set of markets.</p>
<p>Over the years, SumUp has picked up a number of other startups to expand the services that it offers, as well as its markets. Most recently these deals included acquisitions of the business-focused mobile banking platform Paysolut in Lithuania, as well as Goodtill and Tiller to expand into point-of-sale for bigger venues.</p>
<p>That M&amp;A also speaks to how SumUp is approaching its product expansion strategy.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s business model is predicated primarily on taking a cut of transactions made on its platform, and so for now, its strategy is about more services for businesses and scaling up that rate of transactions, not a move into more financial services for consumers.</p>
<p>That is in contrast to companies like Square, which has picked up more than 7 million consumer customers to date by way of Square Cash; and iZettle, which never directly launched services for consumers but was acquired by one of the biggest consumer-facing digital wallet companies, PayPal. It&#8217;s an interesting example of how startups might begin looking like clones of each other, but ultimately they find their own niches and adapt to those. (That&#8217;s not to say that there are not dozens of other competitors to SumUp, including Square and iZettle.)</p>
<p>Nor is SumUp interested in cryptocurrency, another area where the other two have been active.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Square has had one of the easier onboarding experiences when it comes to making Bitcoin investments,&#8221; Christ said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s mainly a customer acquisition tool. They make some money on Bitcoin but not a lot. So I don’t think we will get to that space super soon because it doesn’t represent value for customers. It engages users logging in just to check their accounts but not doing anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>That focus has not just helped the company steadily grow at a time when more transactions are moving online and away from cash &#8212; two trends giving a major fillip by the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced stores to close in many countries, made people more reluctant to shop in person, and got everyone using cash less to contain community transmission &#8212; but it also helped it attract this funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re proud to be backing SumUp once again and we recognize the truly impressive strides made by the company over the past couple of years. We have huge admiration for what SumUp is doing for small businesses across the world in helping them to keep trading and flourishing in some of the most trying economic circumstances imaginable,&#8221; said Tom Maughan of Bain Capital Credit in a statement. &#8220;The doubling down of our investment in SumUp in this round is both a demonstration of our confidence in the company today and its strong future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is nearly impossible for businesses in some African countries to receive money from PayPal. While the payments giant has not given reasons why this is so, speculation hints at factors like insufficient regulation and poor banking security in said countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That might be a thing of the past for some businesses as African payments company <a href="https://flutterwave.com/">Flutterwave</a> today is announcing a collaboration with PayPal to allow PayPal customers globally to pay African merchants through its &#8216;Pay with PayPal&#8217; feature</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via this partnership, African businesses can connect with the more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/218493/paypals-total-active-registered-accounts-from-2010/">377 million PayPal accounts globally</a> and overcome the challenges presented by the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fragmented and complex payment and banking infrastructure on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gbagboola">Olugbenga &#8216;GB&#8217; Agboola</a>, this will happen via a <a href="https://flutterwave.com/ng/blog/pay-with-paypal-on-flutterwave">Flutterwave integration with PayPal</a> so merchants can add PayPal as a payment option when receiving money outside the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The service, which is already available for merchants with registered business accounts on Flutterwave, will be operational across 50 African countries and worldwide, the company claims</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave hopes to roll out this service to individual merchants on the platform as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In a nutshell, we&#8217;re bringing more than 300 million PayPal users to African businesses so they can accept payments across the continent,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our mission at the company has always been to simplify payments for endless possibilities, and from when we started, it has always been about global payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So despite having the largest payment infrastructure in Africa, we want to have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arguably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all the important payments systems in the world on our platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2125528 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="367" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png 1063w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png?resize=680,367 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>A PayPal spokesperson confirmed the Flutterwave collaboration with TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the company&#8217;s <a href="https://tech.africa/paypal-expands-to-more-african-countries/">expansion to Africa</a>, it has maintained a one-sided relationship with most countries on the continent, allowing them only to send money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And according to its website, only 12 African countries can send and receive money on the platform, but to varying degrees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They include Algeria, Botswana, Egypt, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Senegal, Seychelles and South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users in countries who are not afforded the luxury to do so have to rely on using </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the PayPal account of a friend or family, based in countries where payments can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be received. Next</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they request the funds via bank transfer, leading to more incurred costs or use other cross-border money platforms like WorldRemit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a pain point for these businesses, particularly in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2014/06/17/paypal-extends-payment-services-to-nigeria-9-other-countries/?sh=2c7a198f649b">finally arrived</a> Africa&#8217;s most populous country in 2014 and a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> year later, it became the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2015/03/12/nigeria-becomes-paypals-2nd-largest-market-in-africa/?sh=671a1cc765e9">second-biggest market</a> on the continent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">espite its fast adoption rate and large fintech appetite, merchants cannot still receive payments from other countries on the platform with various sources alluding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal&#8217;s decision to the country&#8217;s history with internet fraud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud or not, Nigeria&#8217;s e-commerce and that of the continent at large continues to grow at a breathtaking pace. In 2017, Africa generated $16.5 billion in revenue, and by 2022, it is expected to reach $29 billion. With numbers like this, it isn&#8217;t hard to see why PayPal wants to get in on the action, albeit not completely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, the partnership with Flutterwave. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, via its APIs, offer payment services to individuals and businesses across the continent. Since launching in 2019, the African payments company has partnered<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/flutterwave-and-visa-launch-african-consumer-payment-service-getbarter/"> with Visa</a> to launch Barter;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/flutterwave-and-alipay-partner-on-payments-between-africa-and-china/#:~:text=San%20Francisco%20and%20Lagos%2Dbased,payments%20between%20Africa%20and%20China.&amp;text=%E2%80%9CThere's%20a%20lot%20of%20trade,to%20accept%20Chinese%20customer%20payments.%E2%80%9D"> Alipay to offer digital payments</a> between Africa and China; and<a href="https://www.worldpay.com/global-selector"> Worldpay FIS</a> for payments in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this one with PayPal is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arguably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its biggest collaboration yet. Now, African businesses have more access to sell to global customers using PayPal to receive and send payments online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a way, Flutterwave absorbs most of the risk PayPal thinks it will incur if it makes its platform more open to merchants in these countries. But at the same time, it solidifies Flutterwave&#8217;s position in the eyes of multinationals looking to enter the African market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like when its partnership with Worldpay FIS coincided with its Series B funding, this announcement is also coming on the back of a raise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the payments company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">closed a $170 million Series C</a> led by Avenir Growth Capital and Tiger Global, becoming a billion-dollar company in the process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In hindsight, the mammoth raise suggests that there are a couple of projects in the company&#8217;s pipeline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Going by this partnership, we can expect the majority of them to be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> global plays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, these questions remain top of mind &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens when PayPal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows businesses from these neglected African countries to start receiving payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Will both services continue to coexist if that happens? We&#8217;ve reached out to PayPal for comment.</span></p>
<p>However that plays out, this is a step forward in the right direction for Flutterwave, which has shown time and time again the length it is willing to go for its 290,000 merchants and the ongoing quest to become a global payments company.</p>
<p>&#8220;By working with PayPal, we can further strengthen our commitment to our customers and service users as we will be enabling them to transact and expand their business operations to reach new markets. PayPal&#8217;s global reach is unrivalled, and collaborating with them allows our customers to explore new markets where PayPal is embedded,&#8221; the CEO said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the bigger startups in Europe operating a trading platform for cryptocurrency has closed a big round of funding on the heels of very rapid growth and plans to open its platform to a wider stream of assets.</p>
<p><a href="http://bitpanda.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitpanda</a>, a &#8220;neobroker&#8221; that wants to make it easier for ordinary people to invest not just in bitcoin and other digital assets, but also gold, and any established stock that takes their interest, has picked up $170 million, a Series B that catapults the company&#8217;s valuation to $1.2 billion. Bitpanda is based in Vienna, Austria and says that this equity round makes it the country&#8217;s first &#8220;unicorn&#8221; &#8212; the first startup to pass the $1 billion valuation mark.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are shifting to become a pan-investment platform, not just a crypto broker,&#8221; said Eric Demuth, the CEO of Bitpanda who co-founded it with Paul Klanschek and Christian Trummer. Bitpanda&#8217;s focus up to now has been primarily on building a platform to target investors in Europe, a largely untapped market, as it happens. &#8220;In the EU, we probably have less than 10% of the population owning stocks. Our growth goes hand in hand with that.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to Austria, Bitpanda is live in France, Spain, Turkey, Italy and Poland with plans to expand to more markets this year, building hubs in Madrid, Barcelona, London, Paris and Berlin. New investment options to back ETFs and &#8220;fractional&#8221; trades, which will let people invest small amounts of money in whichever stocks they would like to back, are due to be added in April, the company says.</p>
<p>That said, the vast majority of activity on the platform right now is related to cryptocurrency, and within that Bitcoin trading far outweighs any other digital currency.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Valar Ventures &#8212; the fund backed by Peter Thiel &#8212; with participation also from unnamed partners from DST Global (Yuri Milner&#8217;s fund). Both have been building name for themselves as significant backers of crypto startups. Valar is also an investor in Robinhood &#8212; which, like Bitpanda, has positioned itself as a platform to help a wider funnel of people engage and profit from trading &#8212; and most recently, earlier this month the pair co-invested in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/blockfi-lands-a-350m-series-d-at-3b-valuation-for-its-fast-growing-crypto-lending-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$350 million round for BlockFi</a>, which provides financial services like loans to crypto traders.</p>
<p>While DST is a new investor in Bitpanda, Valar also led a round for Bitpanda just six months ago &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/crypto-exchange-bitpanda-closes-52m-series-a-from-valar-ventures-backed-by-peter-thiel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$52 million Series A</a>. Since then, Demuth and Klanschek say that the company has seen growth skyrocket (not unlike the price of bitcoin itself).</p>
<p>KPIs like revenue and customer numbers &#8220;have been roughly 10x,&#8221; Klanschek said, with the platform adding some 700,000 users between then and now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very soon we will cross the €100 million revenue mark for the first few months of this year&#8221; said Klanschek. Annualized it will work out to around €300-400 million, he added. While the bulk of its trading is for individuals, it&#8217;s not only focused on single investors. In September, on the company&#8217;s trading volume for its &#8220;Pro&#8221; tier for companies, daily trading on the platform was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitpanda-series-a-peter-thiel-valar-ventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 million</a>. Now, it is <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitpanda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over $25 million</a>.</p>
<p>Bitpanda&#8217;s growth and enthusiasm taps into a much bigger trend in the world of trading. One of the byproducts of the Covid-19 pandemic has been consumers becoming more engaged in their own personal finance.</p>
<p>With interest rates down, professional futures less certain for some, a plethora of apps out there to do more with your money, a whole new set of investing classes thanks to cryptocurrency, and (last but not least) the juggernaut that is social media to help concepts go viral, people are dabbling in a wider range of activities, some having never done more than simply keep their money in a bank account before, and shuffling off a bit of money to their 401k&#8217;s or other pension funds.</p>
<p>Bitpanda made a decision last year to start to get more aggressive in its own fundraising to ride that wave.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are profitable, and we have been for four years, but in September we changed strategy and wanted to become ‘the’ investment platform for all of Europe,&#8221; Demuth said. &#8220;We needed more partners and more capital to get more top talent and this is why we did the Series A last year. Then over the past two months, we talked to our investors and said what do you think, it seems like there is some momentum. They said ‘we are in.&#8221; No roadshow needed, we will help you. We will call our contacts and they&#8217;ll join, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>There has been a huge wave of hype around crypto, although in the wider sense it&#8217;s still primarily an adopter phenomenon, far from being a mainstream investment, with most people having no idea how it works. Ironically, this is not that dissimilar to much of the stock market for most people although the difference these days is that apps like Robinhood, Square Cash and Bitpanda are making it easier to engage with crypto and other trading by lowering the barrier to entry, both in terms of actually putting money into the system, and also by making it possible to get engaged with only a small amount of money.</p>
<p>Whether cryptocurrency bears out in the longer term, it&#8217;s likely that the democratization will stay and become a part of the bigger process of how people manage their own money, if not by gambling all-in, then at least by creating a little diversification for themselves.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t excuse the ridiculous hype merchants on social media that potentially exploit these new traders, nor the fact that there is still a very long way to go in regulators getting better oversight of how these new exchanges work, but it does point to an interesting future and more opportunities longer term for organizations and individuals to do more with their money and their assets (NFTs being an example on the other side, of how to build assets and value for investing in the first place).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;In today’s financial world everything is connected,&#8221; said Klanschek. &#8220;We saw huge growth on Bitpanda after the Covid stock crash in March 2020.&#8221; Crypto dropped then too, with &#8220;interest high but price very low.&#8221; Yet with saving accounts and other traditional, low-key ways for people to growth their money yielding nothing, &#8220;it eventually led to huge interest in financial markets, with crypto being established as its own financial asset, its own category.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>While there are a number of platforms emerging for people to engage of that, the pace of adoption for Bitpanda in Europe is what attracted investors here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we joined the board last September, we have continued to be impressed with the work that Eric, Paul and the team are doing. One of the positive changes caused by the pandemic was an increased interest in personal finance, and Bitpanda’s broad offer and commitment to demystifying investing for a new breed of retail investors means it is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the trend,&#8221; said James Fitzgerald, Founding Partner of Valar Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;With over 700,000 new users in just 6 months, we know that people want access to the platform, and we’re excited to bring Bitpanda to every investor in Europe.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese users of the instant messenger Signal knew that the good times wouldn&#8217;t last long. The app, which is used for encrypted conversations, is unavailable in mainland China as of the morning of March 16, a test by TechCrunch shows. The website of the app has been banned in mainland China since March 15, according to censorship tracking website Greatfire.org.</p>
<p>Signal could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>The encrypted chat app was one of the few Western social networks that remained accessible in China without the use of a virtual private network. The likes of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have long been blocked. In some way, a ban is a badge of honor, signifying a foreign app has reached a substantial user base in China that catches the attention of local authorities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Signal is still available for download on Apple&#8217;s China App Store as of March 16, an indication that Apple hasn&#8217;t received a government order to remove the app, which is gradually gaining ground among China&#8217;s tech-savvy, privacy-conscious users. The app has 4.9 out of 5 from 37,000 ratings on the Chinese App Store.</p>
<p>Android stores in China are operated by a slew of third-party Chinese tech firms, which tend to comply strictly with local censors and don&#8217;t list Signal. Google Play is unavailable in the country.</p>
<p>The iOS version of Signal has been installed close to 510,000 times to date in China and recently crossed 100 million downloads across Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google Play combined globally, app analytics firm Sensor Tower told TechCrunch on March 16.</p>
<p>Signal and rival Telegram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/telegram-and-signal-china/">have seen a surge in downloads</a> after WhatsApp&#8217;s updated privacy policy sparked panic among users in January. While the impact is limited in China, where Tencent&#8217;s WeChat commands a formidable share in social networking with 1.1 billion monthly users, both Signal and Telegram have seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/telegram-and-signal-china/">small user upticks in China</a>.</p>
<p>As of January, Telegram had amassed about 2.7 million installs on China’s App Store, compared to 458,000 downloads for Signal and 9.5 million times for WhatsApp. Like Signal, both Telegram and WhatsApp are still present on the China App Store, though access appears to require virtual private networks.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s elaborate Great Firewall has made many internet users experts on censorship circumvention. App bans are often layered as the Clubhouse case shows.</p>
<p>While the drop-in audio app wasn&#8217;t found on the Chinese App Store, users discovered ways to install it in foreign App Stores and used it freely without censorship-fighting tools until the app&#8217;s API was blocked. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/clubhouse-is-now-blocked-in-china-after-a-brief-uncensored-period/">Even after that</a>, China-based users realized they could listen once they entered a chat room through a VPN, as Clubhouse&#8217;s audio technology provider Agora remains accessible in China.</p>
<p>Foreign apps and websites are occasionally cut off in China and brought back, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/microsoft-confirms-bing-is-down-in-china/">as with Microsoft&#8217;s search engine Bing</a>. It&#8217;s unclear whether the Signal ban is permanent, but given the app&#8217;s growth, this could mark the end of its short life in China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the years, Jack Ma has accumulated a media portfolio in China that rivals that of Jeff Bezos in the United States. But now the future of Ma&#8217;s media empire is in the crosshairs of the Chinese government, which is wary of the billionaire&#8217;s increasing media clout.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities have ordered Alibaba to divest some of its media assets due to growing concerns about the company&#8217;s sway over public opinion in the country, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-asks-alibaba-to-shed-its-media-assets-11615809999">The Wall Street Journal</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/china-asks-alibaba-to-sell-media-assets-amid-rising-clampdown">Bloomberg</a> reported citing sources.</p>
<p>Alibaba&#8217;s expeditions in media investments came under scrutiny when the firm announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/alibaba-completes-scmp-acquisition-and-removes-the-papers-online-paywall/">buyout of the South China Morning Post</a>, an English-language newspaper launched 118 years ago in Hong Kong. Its notable media holdings in mainland China include New York-listed technology news site 36Kr, which is <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1779476/000104746919005518/a2239638zf-1.htm">backed by</a> Alibaba&#8217;s fintech affiliate Ant Group, as well as state-owned Shanghai Media Group, which has a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150604005489/en/Alibaba-Group-Signs-Strategic-Agreement-With-Shanghai-Media-Group">strategic agreement</a> with Alibaba.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Critics have questioned Alibaba&#8217;s stake in the South China Morning Post, a prominent paper in Asia. To assuage worries, Jack Ma <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1892251/trust-us-says-jack-ma-when-asked-about-scmp-editorial-independence">has pledged</a> to preserve the editorial independence of the news outlet.</p>
<p>In other media deals, Alibaba often focuses on the potential for digital collaboration with the publications. For example, it promised to utilize its data and cloud computing expertise to help the Shanghai Media Group, an influential financial media conglomerate, develop a financial data platform.</p>
<p>Alibaba has also sought out new media upstarts, taking substantial stakes in China&#8217;s Twitter equivalent, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/07/weibo-payment/">Weibo</a>, and a video site popular amongst Chinese youths, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/alibaba-invests-8-in-bilibili/">Bilibili</a>, which counts Alibaba nemesis Tencent as a major shareholder.</p>
<p>Concerns grew when Weibo appeared to have deleted scores of posts about an <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/about/leadership-fan-jiang">Alibaba executive</a>&#8216;s extramarital affair last June. Soon after, China&#8217;s top internet regulator <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-censorship-weibo/china-punishes-microblog-platform-weibo-for-interfering-with-communication-idUSKBN23H1J2">reprimanded</a> Weibo for &#8220;interfering with online communication order&#8221; without identifying a case.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has already initiated a wave of crackdown on concentrated power in the internet economy. In December, antitrust regulators<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/china-literature-alibaba-fined/"> slammed a small fine on Alibaba and Tencent</a> respectively for failing to report past acquisitions for clearance. It remains to be seen which of Alibaba&#8217;s prized media assets needs to be shed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shared micromobility startup Bird said it is investing $150 million into a European expansion plan that will including launching in more than 50 cities this year, a move that it says will double its footprint in the region.</p>
<p>This growth plan is already underway with Bird recently bringing its scooters to Bergen, Norway, Tarragona, Spain and Palermo, Italy.</p>
<p>Bird emphasized that its European expansion will be more than just a geographic one. Bird said it is adding more scooters to its fleets in existing cities, which is nearing 50. The company also made several other promises as part of its announcement, including plans to launch new mobility products and safety initiatives, &#8220;the next generation of recycling and second-life applications for vehicles,&#8221; investing in equity programs and &#8220;securing partnerships across the region.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It isn&#8217;t clear what these new mobility products or initiatives around safety or recycling will be. A Bird spokesperson said these will be new vehicles and &#8220;transport modes&#8221; in the region. Bird didn&#8217;t provide details about what it means by securing partnerships, a phrase that could mean an extension of its franchise program called the Bird Platform or some other kind of arrangement with local governments or operators. Under the Bird Platform, which was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/for-a-small-fee-entrepreneurs-can-now-manage-their-own-fleet-of-bird-e-scooters/">introduced in November 2018</a>, the company provides independent operators with scooters to manage as they please in exchange for a percentage of the cost of each ride.</p>
<p>Bird did say plans will include programs like the <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/global-ride-pass-increases-scooter-access-millions/">subsidized ride passes</a> it announced last week.</p>
<p>Bird has promoted company insiders Renaud Fages to head of operations and Brendan O&#8217;Driscoll to global head of product to lead the effort.</p>
<p>How Bird will pay for this expansion is as interesting as what it plans to do. A Bird spokesperson told TechCrunch it&#8217;s using &#8220;existing resources&#8221; to fund these various initiatives. However, the pandemic, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/bird-confirms-acquisition-of-berlin-scooter-competitor-circ/">acquisition of Circ</a> and its effort to launch operations in new cities while maintaining existing fleets have depleted its funds. (Last June, Bird <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/bird-shuts-down-circ-operations-in-middle-east-scraps-as-many-as-10000-scooters/">shut down scooter sharing</a> in several cities in the Middle East, an operation that was managed by Circ.) The company&#8217;s last public fundraising announcements were more than a year ago. The company raised $275 million in a Series D round back in September 2019. That round was later extended to $350 million.</p>
<p>Bird was reportedly close to accessing new funds, according to a report from The Information. The media outlet reported in January that Bird was in the midst of finalizing a deal to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/after-tough-year-spacs-tempt-bird-lime">raise more than $100 million in convertible debt</a>, led by existing investors Sequoia Capital and Valor Equity Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://sherpa.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sherpa</a>, a startup from Bilbao, Spain that was an early mover in building a voice-based digital assistant and predictive search for Spanish-speaking audiences, has raised some more funding to double down on a newer focus for the startup: building out privacy-first AI services for enterprise customers.</p>
<p>The company has closed $8.5 million, funding that Xabi Uribe-Etxebarria, Sherpa&#8217;s founder and CEO, said it will be using to continue building out a privacy-focused machine learning platform based on a federated learning model alongside its existing conversational AI and search services. Early users of the service have included the Spanish public health services, which were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E65xMrrqwFM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using the platform to analyse information about COVID-19 cases</a> to predict demand and capacity in emergency rooms around the country.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from Marcelo Gigliani, a managing partner at Apax Digital; Alex Cruz, the chairman of British Airways; and Spanish investment firms Mundi Ventures and Ekarpen. The funding is an extension to the $15 million Sherpa has already raised in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/sherpa-a-spanish-voice-assistant-expands-series-a-to-15m-as-it-passes-5m-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A</a>. From what I understand, Sherpa is currently also raising a larger Series B.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The turn to building and commercializing federated learning services comes at a time when the conversational AI business found itself stalling.</p>
<p>Sherpa saw some early traction for its Spanish voice assistant, which first emerged at a time when efforts from Apple in the form of Siri, Amazon in the form of Alexa, and others hadn&#8217;t really made strong advances to address markets outside of those where English is spoken.</p>
<p>The service passed 5 million users as of 2019 &#8212; customers using its conversational AI and predictive search services include the Spanish media company Prisa, Volkswagen, Porsche and Samsung.</p>
<p>But as Uribe-Etxebarria describes it, while that assistant business is still chugging along, he came up against a difficult truth: the biggest players in English voice assistants eventually did add Spanish, and the conversational AI investments they would make over time would make it impossible for Sherpa to keep up in that market longer-term on its own.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Unless we did a big deal with a company, we wouldn&#8217;t be able to compete against Amazon, Apple and others,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That led the company to start exploring other ways of applying its AI engine.</p>
<p>It came on to federated privacy, Uribe-Etxebarria said, when it started to look at how it might expand its predictive search services into productivity applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;A perfect assistant would be able to read emails and know which actions to take, but there are privacy issues around how to make that work,&#8221; Uribe-Etxebarria said. Someone suggested to him to look at federated learning as one way to &#8220;teach&#8221; its assistant to work with email. &#8220;We thought, if we put 20 people to work, we could build something to read and respond to emails.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jMAicic8Qt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/conversational-analytics-are-about-to-change-customer-experiences-forever/">Conversational analytics are about to change customer experiences forever</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Conversational analytics are about to change customer experiences forever&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/conversational-analytics-are-about-to-change-customer-experiences-forever/embed/#?secret=jMAicic8Qt" data-secret="jMAicic8Qt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The platform that Sherpa built, Uribe-Etxebarria said, worked better than they had anticipated, and so a year later, the team decided that it could use it for more than just triaging email: it could be productized and sold to others as an engine for training machine learning models with more sensitive data in a more privacy-compliant way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the only company pursuing this approach: TensorFlow from Google also uses federated learning, as does <a href="https://fate.fedai.org/2019/10/10/fate-the-open-source-framework-of-federated-learning-is-helping-tencent-shield-sandbox-to-build-a-collaborative-ecosystem-of-data-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fate</a> (which includes cloud computing security experts from Tencent contributing to it), and <a href="https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PySyft</a>, a federated learning open-source library.</p>
<p class="p1">Sherpa is working with several companies under NDAs in areas like healthcare, and Uribe-Etxebarria said it plans to announce customers in other areas like telecoms, retail and insurance in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GitHub has reached an &#8220;amicable resolution&#8221; with the person the company fired in the aftermath of the attack on the U.S. Capitol in January, the former employee told TechCrunch.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">On the day a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, a worried GitHub employee warned his co-workers in the D.C. area to be safe. After making a comment in Slack saying, “stay safe homies, Nazis are about,” a fellow employee took offense, saying that type of rhetoric wasn’t good for work, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/fired-github-employee-who-warned-coworkers-about-nazis-is-seeking-legal-counsel/">the former employee previously told me</a>. Two days later, he was fired, with a human relations representative citing a “pattern of behavior that is not conducive to company policy” as the rationale for his termination, he previously told me.</p>
<p>Later that month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/githubs-head-of-hr-resigns-in-light-of-termination-of-jewish-employee/">GitHub COO Erica Brescia said the company’s head of HR took full responsibility for what happened and resigned from the company</a>. GitHub did not disclose the name of the person who resigned, but it’s widely known that Carrie Olesen was the chief human resources officer at GitHub. At that time, GitHub said it also &#8220;reversed the decision to separate with the employee” and was talking to his representative.</p>
<p>The fired employee, however, did not take his job back.</p>
<div>“We offered the employee his job back immediately after reviewing the investigation findings, and he declined,” a GitHub spokesperson told TechCrunch.</div>
<p>Instead, he told me, &#8220;Me and the company reached an amicable resolution. I appreciate that they have denounced white supremacy and the dangers it poses to everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not specify the terms of the resolution, but he previously told me he was seeking damages or some other form of reconciliation.</p>
<p>Below is his full statement, which he requested we publish in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>Me and the company reached an amicable resolution. I appreciate that they have denounced white supremacy and the dangers it poses to everybody.</p>
<p>We all saw on January 6 that the greatest threat to the USA is not Islam, Black Lives, or defunding police.</p>
<p>White supremacy has us all held hostage using feigned civility, bad-faith arguments/negotiations, and amtssprache*, and it does not stop until we are all dead or subjugated. I am glad that the nazi coup was a failure, and we avoided a successful Reichstag fire. That said, nazis do not give up easily.</p>
<p>Keep your families and communities safe. Connect with your neighbors and local stores. Fascism and nazism succeed when we are divided. They demand that you abandon reason, that you acquiesce to power and hierarchy, and that you shun altruism. Love yourself. Support, join or create local unions. Build community. Don’t entertain nazis.</p>
<p>I appreciate those who have supported me and my family. I wish you safety and wellness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>, a startup that helps creators sell their work, is raising $6 million at a $100 million valuation. While $1 million of that total is reserved for AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant and Basecamp founder Jason Fried, the remaining $5 million is being raised with a twist: anyone willing to fork over at least $100 bucks can invest in the round.</p>
<p>Founded by Sahil Lavingia, Gumroad is using a new SEC regulation, passed today, that increases the maximum amount of money that can be raised in an equity crowdfunding campaign. Now, investors and founders can raise up to $5 million per year from crowdfunding, up from $1.07 million the year prior.</p>
<p>The increase might not turn heads in a world of $90+ billion valuations, but Lavingia thinks the new rules could revitalize a path to raising capital for venture capitalists and founders alike. Unaccredited investors &#8212; whether its users, friends or non-accredited investors &#8212; could become the new limited partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“If this works, startup founders will start to be able to go direct more frequently,” Lavingia said.</p>
<p>Despite venture capital growing as an asset class, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/investors-discuss-alt-financing-and-the-role-of-venture-capital/">alternative ways to raise are becoming increasingly popular</a> to help founders maintain ownership and to access capital.</p>
<p>Up until this point, Gumroad has raised more than $8 million from investors, including Kleiner Perkins, First Round, Max Levchin and SV Angel, as well as others, since 2011. But today marks what Lavingia views as a long-term shift in how Gumroad raises capital. If all goes well, Gumroad will continue raising via crowdfunding on an annual basis until it goes public.</p>
<p>Now that companies can raise $5 million per year through crowdfunding, platforms like WeFunder, StartEngine, SeedInvest and Republic, which Lavingia is using, have a better chance to shake up the modern fundraise.</p>
<p>So far, Gumroad has raised $3.4 million of its $5 million goal across commitments from 3,458 investors. Investors in the crowdfund include part-time creators on Gumroad, Lavingia’s Twitter followers, YouTubers, as well as Figma founder Dylan Field and partners from VC firms. In order to promote a diversity of investors, Gumroad has capped total investments from individuals at $1,000 for the first few days.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A report card for the SEC&#8217;s new equity crowdfunding rules&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/a-report-card-for-the-secs-new-equity-crowdfunding-rules/embed/#?secret=vrqPPqDcut" data-secret="vrqPPqDcut" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup is giving up 6% of ownership as part of the financing event, and the investors will only receive equity stakes once the SAFE note turns into a round. This process could take a year, Lavingia said. The conversion round to make it happen could be an IPO, acquisition or $10 million priced round. The priced round will likely happen next year through a Reg A round, the annual limit of which is $75 million, the founder said.</p>
<p>The SAFE’s cap is placed at a present-day 3.5x revenue multiple. In 2020, Gumroad brought in $9.2 million in net revenue, up 87% from the year prior, generating $1.08 million in net profit, up 286% from the year prior.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The new, higher crowdfunding investing cap has some downsides, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/vc-democratization/">according to institutional investors.</a> A simple one is that it is an administrative burden to give hundreds of people equity in your company for a small amount of money. Another issue, one investor told TechCrunch, is that institutional investors are sometimes experts in investment areas, which is helpful in a way hundreds of smaller investors might not be. Finally, the max of crowdfunding is still $5 million a year, so the method may be less effective for later-stage companies like, say, Stripe, which needs traditional investors to buy in.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Despite these concerns, the recent Gumroad raise is a continuation of two trends of which Lavingia has been on the forefront: building in public and the democratization of venture capital. He livestreams every Gumroad board meeting through Clubhouse and Zoom, and shares business metrics that most private companies decline to report, such as revenue and profit. (In fact, I knew about this plan to raise months ago after reading one of his newsletters.)</p>
<p>Readers will also remember that Lavingia was one of the first people to use the AngelList platform to create a rolling fund, which uses a 506(c) SEC regulation that allows investors to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/gumroad-founder-sahil-lavingia-launches-new-seed-fund-in-collaboration-with-angellist/">publicly solicit investments on an ongoing basis</a>. The move was met with controversy at first, since venture capital funds have historically been raised behind closed doors.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Crowdfunding limits are poised to change next week, but most VCs aren&#8217;t paying attention &#8212; yet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/vc-democratization/embed/#?secret=WEgBR6vyax" data-secret="WEgBR6vyax" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“People were upset at the rolling fund, so imagine when they see that you are cutting out the whole industry [of venture capital],” Lavingia said, referring to a conversation he had with AngelList’s Ravikant.</p>
<p>One thing to be wary of, Lavingia says, is the<a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2021/03/173206-as-reg-cf-funding-cap-jumps-to-5-million-first-issuers-take-advantage-of-the-increased-funding-amount/"> Testing the Waters</a> dynamic. Under Reg CF and A+, startups are able to differentiate between offering and selling securities. Offering simply allows a founder to “test the waters” and see if interest is there for a crowdfunded round. Despite this guardrail, commitments aren’t capital. For example, a startup could get $1 million in commitments but wind up only raising $100,000, Lavingia said. The conversion rate for intended buys versus actual buys could leave some founders in a thorny spot.</p>
<p>His way for combating this is to be obvious about red flags and transparent, which is already in line with Gumroad’s thesis.</p>
<p>“I preceded this fundraise with a blog post that I’m the only person who works on Gumroad as an employee,” he said. “I want to scare off anyone who is like this is weird [from investing].”</p>
<p>Other than Lavingia, Backstage Capital’s Arlan Hamilton has used Republic to crowdfund her firm’s operating fees. Hamilton made history earlier this month when she raised $1 million in eight hours for her fund. Today, she similarly opened up investments in her firm in light of the new cap and has already closed $2.4 million.</p>
<p>When Hamilton spoke about the raise at TC Sessions: Justice, she said she expects another asset class to be born because venture is a “broken” and “old” system.</p>
<p>“I’ll probably pivot Backstage, we’ll find ways and we’ve already started,” she said. “If you look at our raise we did in the Republic, it didn’t exist the way we wanted it to exist, this ability to go to the crowd as a fund.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Don’t give up.</p>
<p>&mdash; Arlan <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f44a-1f3fe.png" alt="👊🏾" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@ArlanWasHere) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArlanWasHere/status/1371323662058409984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“The way it starts is not by a normal person doing it,” Lavingia said. “It’s by someone who is at the tip of the spear, someone who has an interesting angle, and then it gets sort of democratized over time.”</p>
<p>The fact that a founder turned part-time venture capitalist is using crowdfunding to raise money for his own company is a meta headache on its own. But the founder sees this as an opportunity to make crowdfunding mainstream and an attractive asset class.</p>
<p>Long-term, a public crowdfunding round in startups could be just a small drop in a startup’s financing pre-exit, but one that could empower thousands of normal people to own startup equity for the first time.</p>
<p>“I’m basically trying to become a private-market Chamath,” he said, referring to the billionaire behind Social Capital credited with the recent boom in popularity around SPACs. “I want to build a huge brand associated with investing in private equities, startups, and having an army of people that I can use and wield in different ways.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every once in a meme-ified blue moon, the wildly irrational cryptocurrency ecosystem gives birth to something that might outlive the hype.</p>
<p>The crypto art hype may be silly and expensive, but it might also empower artists from <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkd83y/people-are-spending-millions-on-jpegs-tweets-and-other-crypto-collectibles">emerging economies</a> and <a href="https://thedefiant.io/destigmatizing-the-blockchain-sex-workers-in-nft-cryptoart/">underrepresented groups</a> to access the global art market in ways that they couldn&#8217;t before.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367990471759306752?s=20">March 5</a>, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey auctioned off a blockchain receipt, called a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/if-you-havent-followed-nfts-heres-why-you-should-start/">nonfungible token</a> (NFT), for a screenshot of his first tweet in 2006, and bids for it promptly exceeded <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/07/tech/jack-dorsey-nft-twitter/index.html">$2.5 million</a>. Since 2018, people have spent roughly <a href="https://cryptoart.io/data">$237 million </a>on NFTs, with the vast majority of those funds spent since the trend exploded in January 2021.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			The crypto art hype may be silly and expensive, but it might also empower artists from emerging economies and underrepresented groups to access the global art market in ways that they couldn&#8217;t before.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Bryana Kortendick, VP of operations and communications at the NFT startup <a href="https://enjin.io/">Enjin</a>, said the platform and corresponding NFT wallet’s growth is up 100% since December 2020, now tallying more than 47,426 registered users. Her company was funded by a <a href="https://blog.enjincoin.io/enjin-coin-ico-is-a-massive-success-75-000-eth-raised-with-18-500-contributions-b757bd65c0c5">token sale in 2017</a> that amassed 75,041 ether (ETH), worth more than $130 million today. Kortendick declined to comment on how the cryptocurrency treasury is managed, other than to say they have enough runway for the startup’s continued growth because “Enjin has retained a portion of the funds raised through our ICO in ETH.”</p>
<p>As of 2021, Kortendick said the wallet app’s fastest-growing markets include the United States, Korea, the United Kingdom, Iran, Germany, Canada, India, Indonesia, Turkey and Australia. In sanctioned countries like Cuba, Iran and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkd83y/people-are-spending-millions-on-jpegs-tweets-and-other-crypto-collectibles">Venezuela</a>, NFTs provide one of the only ways for up-and-coming artists to transact with global art collectors. It can also be a way for <a href="https://twitter.com/enjin/status/1358395608269258753">dancers </a>to make money by selling NFTs with GIFs showcasing <a href="https://www.beautyinthestreetz.com/">specific moves</a> or NFTs that allow video game characters to dance a specific move.</p>
<p>“There has been an influx of new [app] users in countries like Iran, and we are working to localize the app accordingly to make it more accessible for these growing markets,” Kortendick said. “We recently saw a surge of [web] users in Cuba too, which prompted us to translate our entire website into Spanish.”</p>
<h2>A new world coming under compliance</h2>
<p>It remains to be seen if that type of market activity is sustainable, with regard to compliance across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20201230_33">penalized</a> the crypto company BitGo in 2020 for allowing users to transact with people in sanctioned countries. Maintaining financial sanctions appears to be one of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-the-biden-administration-is-approaching-crypto-regulations/"> regulator&#8217;s priorities</a> in 2021. In any case, companies can <a href="https://decrypt.co/59635/wheres-the-trust-in-the-150-million-nft-art-market">delist</a> artists and pieces, which means anyone who isn’t fluent in command-line Ethereum tricks can <a href="https://twitter.com/neitherconfirm/status/1369285946198396928">lose access</a> to their NFTs. It will still exist “on the blockchain,” yet it would be quite a stretch to call NFTs “<a href="https://mashable.com/article/nft-explainer-what-are-non-fungible-tokens/">permissionless</a>” art, as many blockchain advocates do.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid growing competition from Twitter Spaces and other newcomers, popular social audio startup Clubhouse is making a move aimed at seeding its network with more high-quality content: It&#8217;s <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/creator-first-accelerator">launching an accelerator program</a>. During its weekly town hall event on Sunday, the company detailed its plans for its inaugural accelerator called &#8220;Clubhouse Creator First,&#8221; which will initially help around 20 creators get their shows off the ground. To do so, Clubhouse said it will provide creators with anything they need to get started &#8212; whether that&#8217;s equipment like an iPhone, AirPods or an <a href="https://janoschtroehler.medium.com/how-i-get-audio-from-my-computer-into-clubhouse-2af74c7dc317">iRig</a>, promotional support or help with booking guests, or even a babysitter. Most importantly, Clubhouse is promising the participating creators an income of some sort.</p>
<p>During the town hall, Clubhouse CEO Paul Davison explained that a core part of the accelerator experience will be to help creators get paid for their work. In order to make this happen, Clubhouse will match the creator with a brand sponsor, he said &#8212; something the company believes will be possible because brands are already reaching out to Clubhouse, looking for opportunities to get involved.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today’s Town Hall Updates:<br />We are launching our first creator accelerator program, Clubhouse Creator First. We are looking to support and equip 20 creators w/ resources they need to bring their ideas and creativity to life. Details and application here: <a href="https://t.co/kmKjQvoUBK">https://t.co/kmKjQvoUBK</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Clubhouse (@joinClubhouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/joinClubhouse/status/1371152823631577089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the case that Clubhouse can&#8217;t find a brand sponsor for a particular show, the company will just guarantee a basic income of $5,000 per month during the three months the creator is participating in the program.</p>
<p>Presumably, this cushion could help people transition from other projects to focus on their Clubhouse show instead, while also giving them time to grow their audience and form the brand relationships that could sustain their shows longer term.</p>
<p>Clubhouse will also play a hands-on role in helping to develop the shows from the accelerator&#8217;s participants, we understand.</p>
<p>Already, the Andreessen Horowitz-backed social audio app has aided in the success of one of its more popular tech programs, <a href="https://www.thegoodtimeshow.club/">The Good Time Show</a><em>,</em> co-hosted by the VC firm&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/social-platform-veteran-sriram-krishnan-is-andreessen-horowitzs-latest-general-partner/">latest general partner</a>, Sriram Krishnan. His program has regularly featured guests and co-hosts either investing with the firm or connected to it somehow, and has been responsible for some of Clubhouse&#8217;s biggest celeb guests &#8212; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/">Elon Musk</a> and Mark Zuckerberg, for example.</p>
<p>That formula could be repeatable, it seems. As Davison noted during the town hall, the company will work on matching creators with guests for their shows. In other words, it&#8217;s helping produce.</p>
<p>Davison also said Clubhouse will offer directed feedback to the accelerator&#8217;s participants, including its opinion on what works and what doesn&#8217;t, and other &#8220;deep dive concept development.&#8221; When the creators&#8217; shows are ready to launch, Clubhouse will then connect them with creative services to help design promotional materials to market the shows outside of the social app. It may even give the creators invites they can dole out to potential listeners to help them build up the show&#8217;s initial audience, if need be.</p>
<p>Of course, Clubhouse has been doing some of this kind of work behind the scenes before today, but the accelerator both formalizes the arrangement and devotes dedicated resources to a larger handful of promising creators.</p>
<p>But it also puts Clubhouse in a potentially precarious position with regard to its still underdeveloped moderation practices.</p>
<p>Brands are typically hesitant to associate themselves with problematic or toxic content and will pull out of creator deals and relationships if they find that to be the case. In the past, content moderation failures have led to advertisers&#8217; exodus from top social platforms &#8212; like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/youtube-faces-brand-freeze-over-ads-and-obscene-comments-on-videos-of-kids/">YouTube brand freeze a few years ago over obscene comments</a>, which necessitated a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/youtube-bans-hateful-videos-from-making-money-via-its-advertising-network/">cleanup of the videos allowed on the YouTube ad network.</a> And last year, Facebook faced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/07/facebook-ad-boycott-rashad-robinson-interview-color-change">its largest corporate boycott to date</a> when brands<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/07/facebook-ad-boycott-rashad-robinson-interview-color-change"> protested the company&#8217;s failures</a> to properly prevent the spread of hate speech and misinformation on its platform.</p>
<p>Though small by comparison &#8212; the app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/13/this-week-in-apps-parler-denied-app-store-re-entry-walmart-doubles-down-on-tiktok-live-shopping-instagram-lite-rolls-out-worldwide/">now has 12 million global downloads</a>, App Annie says &#8212; Clubhouse has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clubhouse-moderation/from-clubhouse-to-twitter-spaces-social-media-grapples-with-live-audio-moderation-idUKKBN2AP1J2">already been called out for allowing</a> misogyny, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495419/clubhouse-conversation-antisemitism-content-moderation">anti-Semitism</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3vkde/clubhouse-app-misinformation-problem">COVID-19 misinformation</a> on the platform, despite rules against prohibiting this content. It&#8217;s also allowed for verbal abuse, with some users still being name-called or harassed in Clubhouse rooms. (We&#8217;ve heard these stories from users directly but will not name names without permission.).</p>
<p>More recently, there&#8217;s been growing concern about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQeod1vuTuk">scam artists</a> taking over Clubhouse and <a href="https://gritdaily.com/clubhouse-is-a-haven-for-self-help-content-but-with-a-toxic-catch/">the lack of accountability</a> for what&#8217;s being said. Many so-called &#8220;experts&#8221; are happy to go on the app to dole out advice, but when they wade into territory like mental health, they can spread harmful misinformation that can really hurt people.</p>
<p>All these things could potentially catch up to Clubhouse in a big way in the months to come, if the company can&#8217;t figure out a better moderation strategy to weed out the bad actors and keep the platform brand-safe.</p>
<p>Starting today, the company is allowing interested creators to <a href="https://creatorfirst.joinclubhouse.com/">apply for Clubhouse Creator First</a>. The deadline to apply is March 31, 2021.</p>

<p>The new accelerator program was one of several town hall announcements on Sunday.</p>
<p>The company also announced it has hired Netflix, OWN and Harpo Productions alum <a href="https://twitter.com/mayawatson/status/1371133952321150980">Maya Watson</a> as its new head of global marketing, and it detailed several new product updates.</p>
<p>Among those, users will now be able to invite people to the app by phone number alone, instead of having to upload their entire address book. It also now allows users to share links that point to their user profile or Club page and will now better remember a user&#8217;s language preferences when displaying its list of rooms, among other things.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kelauni Jasmyn, general partner at the new <a href="http://btn.vc">Black Tech Nation Ventures</a>, can explain her aims for the new firm quite succinctly: “The goal is to get more Black people funded.”</p>
<p>That’s something Jasmyn has been working on already with <a href="https://blacktechnation.com">Black Tech Nation</a>, a Pittsburgh-based organization that supports Black entrepreneurs with education, content, community and more. Now she’s tackling the funding size of the equation more directly by raising a $50 million first fund with her fellow GPs Sean Sebastian and David Motley.</p>
<p>“We’re really at the beginning of something brand new, that I think will be historic and offer a literal economic shift for the Black community in building generational wealth,” Jasmyn said. “We get to be the ones who mold the foundation of that.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sebastian is a partner at Birchmere Ventures, a seed fund also based in Pittsburgh, while Motley is co-founder of BlueTree Venture Fund and African American Directors Forum. Sebastian also suggested that he and Motley are involved partly to enable a “transfer of knowledge” that will empower a new generation of Black investors, starting with Jasmyn.</p>
<p>Motley, meanwhile, suggested that this is an effort to take “take the Black Tech Nation platform and combine it with the Birchmere platform.” He recalled speaking to Jasmyn for the first time at Sebastian’s urging and immediately responding, “Sean, this is the real deal.”</p>
<p>All three of BTNV’s partners emphasized that while the fund has a social mission, they’re also focused on financial returns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zLwOC6gKH1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/investors-are-missing-out-on-black-founders/">Investors are missing out on Black founders</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Investors are missing out on Black founders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/investors-are-missing-out-on-black-founders/embed/#?secret=zLwOC6gKH1" data-secret="zLwOC6gKH1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We are no different than any other fund just because you put a specific community around it,” Jasmyn said. “You shouldn’t expect any less valuable returns. We just happen to have the advantage of untapped potential.”</p>
<p>The fund will make seed and Series A investments, and Motley said they’re focused on software startups — which could be software as a service, B2B or B2B2C. These ideas can be pre-revenue and even pre-product, but they need to be “scalable and lend themselves to significant value creation.”</p>
<p>Sebastian added that although BTVN is based in Pittsburgh, they’ll look at investments across the country, particularly entrepreneurs that come from outside Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>I wondered whether the fund’s financial goals could, at times, conflict with the more inclusive approach of Black Tech Nation, but the partners<span class="Apple-converted-space"> countered</span> that the for-profit fund and nonprofit organization can actually complement each other. Motley said that Black Tech Nation “gives us more opportunities to say yes,” while Jasmyn suggested that if the venture fund has to turn someone down, she can still tell them, “Scoot over across the street [to Black Tech Nation] and maybe we can revisit this another time.”</p>

I covered the company’s original round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/fondeadora-is-a-mexican-challenger-bank-that-just-raised-14-million/">back in August 2020</a>. And now, Fondeadora is adding $14 million on top of the original $14 million it had already raised — it now represents a $28 million funding round.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.p3vc.com">Portag3</a> is investing in the extension. Google’s Gradient Ventures, an existing investor in the company, is putting more money in Fondeadora. Gokul Rajaram and Anatol von Hahn are investing as business angels as well.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Y Combinator, Scott Belsky, Sound Ventures, Fintech Collective and Ignia also participated in the first tranche of the Series A.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We received an unsolicited and unexpected term sheet three months after our Series A,” co-founder and co-CEO Norman Müller told me. The company’s valuation has doubled with the round extension as well.</p>

<p>As most people still rely heavily on cash in Mexico, creating a challenger bank represents a good opportunity. In addition to customers from legacy banks, Fondeadora can become the first bank account for many people.</p>
<p>Fondeadora doesn’t operate any branch for its banking service. When you create an account, you receive a Mastercard debit card a few days later. There are no monthly subscription fee and no foreign transaction fee.</p>
<p>Like other challenger banks, your balance is updated instantly. You can choose to receive push notifications for transactions. You can also lock and unlock your card from the app.</p>
<p>More recently, the company launched a card without any personal info or card numbers — a bit like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2019/03/25/apple-introduces-its-own-credit-card-the-apple-card/">the Apple card</a> in the U.S. On the back of the card, you can find a QR code. This way, you can show your card to your friends. They scan the code and you receive money a few seconds later.</p>
<p>Venmo launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/venmo-launches-its-first-credit-card-offering-up-to-3-cash-back-personalized-rewards/">credit card with a QR code</a> in the U.S. as well. I think challenger banks and peer-to-peer payment apps around the world should all do this as it’s a great bridge between the physical world and an app.</p>
<p>Fondeadora acquired a bank charter and now has plenty of money on its bank account. It sounds like things are working well so far and proves once again that banking is not a global industry. There&#8217;s room for plenty of local players around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From distributed homes in Cambridge, Mass. and Cambridge, England, <a href="https://inbalanceresearch.com/our-team">inBalance Research</a> is joining Y Combinator as it looks to accelerate its business as the oracle for independent energy providers, utilities and market makers.</p>
<p>Selling a service it calls Delphi, the very early-stage startup is hoping to provide analysis for power producers and utilities on the demand forecasts of energy markets.</p>
<p>The orchestration of energy load across the grid has become a more pressing issue for utilities around the country after witnessing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/severe-weather-blackouts-shows-the-grids-biggest-problem-is-infrastructure-not-renewables/">disastrous collapse of Texas&#8217; power grid</a> in response to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/no-place-is-safe-from-failing-u-s-infrastructure/">second &#8220;once-in-a-century&#8221; storm in the last decade</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YduHkmiLLF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/no-place-is-safe-from-failing-u-s-infrastructure/">No place is safe from failing US infrastructure</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;No place is safe from failing US infrastructure&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/no-place-is-safe-from-failing-u-s-infrastructure/embed/#?secret=YduHkmiLLF" data-secret="YduHkmiLLF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we want to address the solution long term, it’s a two-part solution,&#8221; said inBalance co-founder and chief executive, Thomas Marge. &#8220;It’s a combination of hardware and software. You need the right assets online and you need the right software that can ensure that markets operate when there are extreme market shocks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices for electricity change every 15 minutes, and sometimes those pries can fluctuate wildly. In some places, even without the weather conditions that demolished the Texas grid and drove some companies out of business, prices can double in a matter of hours, according to inBalance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s what makes forecasting tools important, the company said. As prices spike, asset managers of finite responsive resources such as hydro and storage need to decide if they will offer more value to the market now or later. Coming online too early or too late will decrease the revenue for their clean generation and increase peak prices for consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation is even worse, according to the company, if storage and intermittent renewables come online at the same time. That can create downward price pressure for both the storage and renewable assets, which, in turn, can lead to increased fossil fuel generation later the same day, once cleaner sources are depleted.</span></p>
<p>The software to predict those pressures is what inBalance claims to provide. Marge and his fellow co-founders, Rajan Troll and Edwin Fennell have always been interested in the problems associated with big data and energy.</p>
<p>For Marge, that began when he worked on a project to optimize operations for wind farms during a stint in Lexington, Mass.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fundamentally we’re a data-science solution,&#8221; said Marge. &#8220;It’s a combination of knowing what factors influence every single asset on every single market in North America. We have a glimpse into how those assets are going to be working one day before to one hour before in order to do price forecasting.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>So far, one utility using the company&#8217;s software in the Northeast has managed to curb its emissions by 0.2%. With a focus on renewables, inBalance is hoping to roll out larger reductions to the 3,000 market participants that are also using its forecasting tools for other services. Another application is in the work inBalance is conducting with a gas peaker plant to help offset the intermittency of renewable generation sources.</p>
<p>The reduction in emissions in New England is particularly impressive given that the company only began working with the utility there in December. Given its forecasting tools, the company is able to provide a window into which assets might be most valuable at what time &#8212; including, potentially, natural gas peaking plants, hydropower, pumped hydropower (basically an energy storage technology), battery or flywheel energy storage projects and demand response technologies that encourage businesses and consumers to reduce consumption in response to price signals, Marge said.</p>
<p>Already, six companies have taken a trip to see the Delphi software and come away as early users. They include a global renewable asset manager and one of the top 10 largest utilities in the U.S., according to Marge.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We use machine learning to accurately forecast electricity prices from terabytes of public and proprietary data. The solution required for daily power system stability is both hardware — like storage and electric vehicle charging — and the software required to optimally use it. inBalance exists to be that software solution,&#8221; the company said in a statement. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let's explore both companies' pricing intervals through our usual lens of revenue multiples, market comps and general sass.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s a busy day in IPO-land: Olo has raised its IPO range and DigitalOcean is giving us a first look at what it may be worth when it debuts.</p>
<p>That Olo raised its IPO price is not a huge surprise, given the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/understanding-toasts-expected-ipo-through-the-lens-of-olos-2020-results/">software company&#8217;s rapid growth and profits</a>. In the case of DigitalOcean, we have more work to do as its approach to growth is a bit different.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore both companies&#8217; pricing intervals through our usual lens of revenue multiples, market comps and general <del>SaaS</del> sass. We&#8217;ll do this in alphabetical order, which puts the cloud infra company up first.</p>
<h2>DigitalOcean&#8217;s IPO price range</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1582961/000119312521080474/d898181ds1a.htm#rom898181_14">its S-1/A filing</a>, DigitalOcean expects its IPO to price between $44 and $47 per share. The price range is a coup for the company&#8217;s private investors, who as recently as the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/digitalocean-raises-50m-more-from-access-industries-and-a16z/">2020 Series C</a> paid about $10.59 each for the company&#8217;s shares. Andreessen Horowitz is going to do very well, having led the company&#8217;s Series A at a per-share price of just more than $2. IA Ventures, which led DigitalOcean&#8217;s seed round, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/digitalocean-seed--7e3b8e35">according to Crunchbase</a>, paid just $0.26 per share back in the 2012-2013 time frame. That&#8217;s going to convert well.</p>
<p>In valuation terms, the company&#8217;s simple share count post-IPO will be 105,303,340, or 107,778,340 if its underwriters purchase their option. At $44 to $47 per share, DigitalOcean is worth $4.72 billion to $5.07 billion, including shares designated for its underwriters.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation is higher. At midpoint, Renaissance Capital estimates DigitalOcean&#8217;s diluted valuation is $5.6 billion. That works out to a little under $5.8 billion at $47 per share.</p>
<p>Taking a look at DigitalOcean&#8217;s Q4 2020 revenue of $87.5 million, the company closed last year on a run rate of $350 million. Or a revenue multiple of 14.5x at the upper end of its nondiluted valuation, and around 16.5x at the upper bound of its diluted worth.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might think that Clubhouse is the final word on audio-centric social networks, but a San Francisco startup called <a href="https://swell.life/">Swell</a> is launching its own iOS and Android app focused on voice conversations.</p>
<p>The big difference: While conversations on Clubhouse all happen in real time — meaning that you’ve got to listen live or miss it all (at least for now) — Swell is focused on asynchronous comments. In other words, users post a standalone audio clip that can be up to five minutes in length (with an accompanying image and links), then other users can browse, listen and leave their own audio responses in their own time.</p>
<p>Swell supports audio-only group chats and private conversations, as well as public &#8220;Swellcasts&#8221; — think of a bite-sized podcast, or a Clubhouse-style conversation that’s structured more like a comment thread than a free-for-all. Users can also promote their public posts through their own pages on <a href="https://swellcast.com/">the Swellcast website</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Swell is led by husband-and-wife team Sudha Varadarajan and Arish Ali, who previously founded e-commerce company Skava and sold it to Infosys.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pXHEgfTJjn4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Varadarajan (the startup’s CEO) described the app as an attempt to “democratize” audio content creation, with no special equipment or serious production required, and allowing users to talk about anything. (In one example, the Swellcaster was outside talking about their front lawn.)</p>
<p>At the same time, she suggested that the app was created less as a response to Clubhouse and more as a general antidote to social media, where the pair saw increasing polarization and fewer genuine conversations.</p>
<p>Audio is hardly immune to ranting and anger — just look at talk radio. But Varadarajan suggested that making the posts asynchronous doesn’t just make it easier for listeners to catch up; it also improves the quality of the conversation: “People really think about what they’re going to say.”</p>
<p>She added that the company is determined to avoid any ad-based business models and instead make money by charging for premium tools and Swellcasts.</p>
<p>Until now, Swell has only been open to a small group of users. Today it’s launching more broadly, in advance of its session tomorrow at the virtual SXSW, “<a href="https://swellcast.com/sxsw2021">Voice is transforming our online presence. Why?</a>”</p>
