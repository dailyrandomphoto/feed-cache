										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just six month after raising its first bit of outside funding, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/clickup" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="clickup">ClickUp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/clickup-raises-100m-series-b-as-demand-for-its-productivity-platform-soars-301192754.html">has closed $100 million</a> in new funding and reached a $1 billion valuation, a report in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/software-maker-clickup-reaches-1-billion-value-in-funding-round">Bloomberg</a> first reported.</p>
<p>The company has seen plenty of growth in the past several months to justify that new unicorn status, including doubling the amount of users to 2 million. In a press release the company also detailed it had grown revenue nine times over since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>This latest $100 million round was led by Canadian firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/georgian-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="georgian-partners">Georgian <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/craft-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="craft-ventures">Craft Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which led the startup&#8217;s $35 million Series A back in June. The high valuation showcases just how eager investors are to find winners in the productivity software space, which has seen massive customer gains as an industry this year, partially as a result of shifting corporate attitudes toward working from home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xf2Nn057mq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/productivity-platform-clickup-raises-35-million-from-craft-ventures/">Productivity platform ClickUp raises $35 million from Craft Ventures</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Productivity platform ClickUp raises $35 million from Craft Ventures&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/productivity-platform-clickup-raises-35-million-from-craft-ventures/embed/#?secret=xf2Nn057mq" data-secret="xf2Nn057mq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>ClickUp is aiming to further capitalize as it scales its team and product. The company of 200 has doubled in size since its last raise and is hoping to double again in the next several months, CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/zeb-brian-evans" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="zeb-brian-evans">Zeb Evans <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>ClickUp sells productivity software, but their main sell has been tying several products in that space into a single platform, aiming to reduce the number of tools their customers use. The team has recently begun integrating tools like email into their platform so that users can complete workflows inside the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just like a value play of using one app instead of three or four, it&#8217;s an efficiency play by saving so much time and frustration from having all the other different solutions,&#8221; Evans tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Even as the company continues scaling the product through weekly updates to the company&#8217;s apps, including a newly revamped iOS app which launched today (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/android" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="android">Android <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> launches tomorrow), the team is looking toward how they can build for the long-term.</p>
<p>As to how long this cash will last, Evans isn&#8217;t making any promises. &#8220;I think this will keep us going for a while, though to be honest with you I would&#8217;ve said the same thing with the Series A,&#8221; Evans says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> is tweaking its subscription plans with a new mid-tier offering called <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/revolut" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="revolut">Revolut <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Plus — it costs £2.99 per month. Like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/n26-launches-mid-tier-subscription-plan-for-e4-90-per-month/">N26 Smart</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/monzo-plus/">Monzo Plus</a>, the new plan is a pandemic-proof package that doesn’t focus as much on travel.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, challenger banks and alternatives to traditional bank accounts have been packaging additional services into paid plans. Essentially, those fintech startups are slowly becoming freemium software-as-a-service companies.</p>
<p>The majority of users don’t subscribe to paid plans. But a small portion is willing to pay a fixed monthly fee to access advanced features, get an insurance package and pay less in variable fees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Revolut already has two paid plans — Premium and Metal. Premium increases limits on free ATM withdrawals and foreign exchange. You also get overseas medical insurance, delayed baggage and flight insurance and winter sports coverage. You can also access advanced features, such as disposable virtual cards and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/revolut-launches-revolut-junior-to-help-you-manage-allowance/">Revolut Junior</a> accounts</p>
<p>With a Metal plan, your insurance package is a bit more thorough, with purchase protection and car hire excess. You get a tiny bit of cash back on purchases (0.1% in Europe, 1% outside of Europe capped at the monthly subscription price) and higher limits across various products.</p>
<p>Another big selling point has been card designs. With the Metal plan, as the name suggests, you get a metal card. It’s not that useful but some people like it. Premium subscribers can also choose between premium card designs.</p>
<p>Revolut Premium costs £6.99 per month and Revolut Metal costs £12.99 per month (or €7.99 and €13.99, respectively in Europe). You pay a bit less if you pay upfront for a year.</p>
<p>So what is Revolut Plus? It costs £2.99 per month, which makes it a lot more affordable than Revolut Premium. The main selling point is purchase protection provided by Qover. All paid plans now get purchase protection with different limits on damaged or stolen goods (up to £1,000, £2,500 and £10,000 depending on your plan). You can get a refund on purchases up to 90 days after buying eligible products. If you book a ticket and your event is cancelled, you could also get a refund.</p>
<p>In addition to a new card design, Revolut Plus subscribers can also use virtual cards. You can also create junior accounts with the new mid-tier plan.</p>
<p>As you can see, there’s no overseas travel insurance. You also don’t get unlimited free currency exchange (other than spread). Revolut Plus is focused on people who mostly use their Revolut account in their home country.</p>
<p>Revolut is also tweaking other plans, so it’s going to be important to check the terms and conditions before you renew your paid plan. The new Plus plan is available today in the U.K. and will be rolled out next week in the European Economic Area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks, formerly of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pinterest" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pinterest">Pinterest&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> policy team, alleged racial and gender discrimination at Pinterest in June, the hope was for Pinterest to make them whole and address its culture of alleged discrimination, Ozoma told TechCrunch. But that&#8217;s not what happened.</p>
<p>Just two months later, former Pinterest COO Françoise Brougher sued Pinterest, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination/">alleging gender discrimination, which yesterday resulted in a $22.5 million settlement. </a>As part of the settlement, Pinterest will pay $20 million to Brougher and her attorneys, <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001506293/3fef4e2e-328e-449a-8971-469b1f68011a.pdf">the company wrote in a filing</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about as plain a case of disparate treatment and discrimination as you can come up with,&#8221; Ozoma said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On a call with TechCrunch today, Ozoma and Banks described a double standard in their experiences compared to Brougher&#8217;s. While Brougher received a $20 million payout, Ozoma and Banks received less than one year&#8217;s worth of severance.</p>
<p>&#8220;This follows the time-honored tradition in America where Black women come forward, blazing a trail, revealing injustice and white women coming in and reaping all the benefits of that,&#8221; Banks told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/05/human-capital-googles-labor-stumbles/">Earlier this month</a>, a group of shareholders filed a lawsuit against Pinterest executives, including CEO Ben Silbermann, alleging they enabled a culture of discrimination. The complaint goes on to allege that culture of discrimination has harmed Pinterest’s reputation and led to financial harm.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bok2noK4ey"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/05/human-capital-googles-labor-stumbles/">Human Capital: Google&#8217;s labor stumbles</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Human Capital: Google&#8217;s labor stumbles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/05/human-capital-googles-labor-stumbles/embed/#?secret=bok2noK4ey" data-secret="bok2noK4ey" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For Ozoma and Banks, however, they say they&#8217;ve exhausted all of their legal options and will not pursue a lawsuit. Banks said it is important to keep in mind the fact that Brougher, a former COO, had far more resources to pursue litigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we, like in many, many, many other cases, Black women put ourselves on the line, shared absolutely everything that happened to us, then laid the groundwork for someone else to swoop in and collect &#8216;progress,&#8217; &#8221; Ozoma said. &#8220;No progress has been made here because no rights have been made with people who harm has been done to.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a part of the settlement, both Pinterest and Brougher will commit $2.5 million toward “advancing women and underrepresented communities” in the tech industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Francoise welcomes the meaningful steps Pinterest has taken to improve its workplace environment and is encouraged that Pinterest is committed to building a culture that allows all employees to feel included and supported,&#8221; Pinterest and Brougher said in a joint statement detailing the settlement.</p>
<p>Ozoma took issue with Pinterest and Brougher donating $2.5 million to charity. She said, &#8220;it smells rotten,&#8221; noting that she herself is an individual and not a charity.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Pinterest regarding Ozoma and Banks&#8217; recent statements. Pinterest declined to comment, saying the company doesn&#8217;t comment on legal matters. In June, however, Pinterest said in a statement to TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We took these issues seriously and conducted a thorough investigation when they were raised, and we&#8217;re confident both employees were treated fairly. We want each and every one of our employees at Pinterest to feel welcomed, valued, and respected. As we outlined in our statement on June 2nd, we’re committed to advancing our work in inclusion and diversity by taking action at our company and on our platform. In areas where we, as a company, fall short, we must and will do better.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/pinterest-employees-are-walking-out-today-in-light-of-discrimination-allegations/">Pinterest employees staged a walkout in August</a> shortly after Brougher filed her suit. In addition to the walkout, <a href="https://www.coworker.org/petitions/put-an-end-to-all-forms-of-discrimination-and-retaliation-at-pinterest-1">a petition circulated throughout the company demanding systemic change</a>. The change they sought entailed full transparency about promotion levels and retention, total compensation package transparency and for the people within two layers of reporting to the CEO to be at least 25% women and 8% underrepresented employees.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<p>Since then, Pinterest has made some changes at the board level. A couple of days after the walkout, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/pinterest-announces-first-black-board-member/">Pinterest announced Andrea Wishom as the company’s first-ever Black board member</a>. In October, Pinterest added its second Black board member, Salaam Coleman Smith.</p>
<p>Pinterest says it has also enhanced its hiring and interview processes to try to improve diversity at senior levels, updated its inclusion training and launched an internal wiki detailing how Pinterest makes compensation decisions.</p>
<p>Pinterest had long been considered a leader in diversity and inclusion. When asked about whether that has ever been true &#8212; if Pinterest had effectively enacted a solid DEI strategy &#8212; Ozoma was clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. If it were true, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d be having a conversation right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Discrimination, particularly toward Black women, is systemic in the tech industry. Earlier this month, Dr. Timnit Gebru <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/">said Google fired her for an email speaking out about ethics in artificial intelligence</a>. Banks and Ozoma told TechCrunch they are worried about a chilling effect on other Black women coming forward.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="D4vmmx5OUd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/">Google&#8217;s co-lead of Ethical AI team says she was fired for sending an email</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google&#8217;s co-lead of Ethical AI team says she was fired for sending an email&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/embed/#?secret=D4vmmx5OUd" data-secret="D4vmmx5OUd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One person reached out to her, Banks said, asking about what hope other Black women have.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we said something,&#8221; Ozoma said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not in a position that someone in the C-suite would have been. But our integrity means more than anything else, and if we can help other folks, we will.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not hugely surprising, both because Jane Manchun Wong <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-app-code-indicates-that-live-video-broadcasting-app-periscope-may-get-shut-down/">spotted some app code</a> suggesting that a shutdown could be coming and also because &#8230; when was the last time you thought about Periscope?</p>
<p>In an open letter, Periscope said that its current operations are &#8220;unsustainable,&#8221; and that &#8220;leaving it in its current state isn’t doing right by the current and former Periscope community or by Twitter.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nine months into the pandemic, one of the first states to institute a shut down is back at square one. Following a major spike in COVID-19 cases, California governor Gavin Newsom reinstituted major closures across the state, leaving many residents in search of new avenues to acquire essentials without leaving their home.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/robomart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="robomart">Robomart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is seemingly still a long ways away from being a fully finalized offering, but the startup has begun offering limited service in Los Angeles’ West Hollywood neighborhood. Currently being offered as an invite-only beta, the service offers essential deliveries in the back of a van. Users purchase goods from the Robomart app and the vehicle will drive out to meet them.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087712" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087712" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087712" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087712" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Robomart</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The offering is launching as a mobile pharmacy, offering 500 packs of 50 products. The list includes over-the-counter meds, toiletries and household and kitchen products, among others. A grocery version of the service is also set to launch in the neighborhood in “the coming weeks,” per Robomart.</p>
<p>The eventual plan is to make deliveries via autonomous vehicles when all of the necessary regulatory and technological hurdles have been cleared. For now, however, the startup is partnering with fleet leasing company Zeeba Vans for deliveries. The plan is to increase to 100 vans within two years. Checkouts are performed with RFID tags.</p>
<p>Investors include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wasabi-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wasabi-ventures">Wasabi Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> SOSV, HAX, Hustle Fund, Automation Fund and Archetype.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087714" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087714" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087714" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087714" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Robomart</p></div></p>
<p>“The startup world has been a bit myopic on fully autonomous driving as the only path to profitable on-demand commerce,” HAX’s Garrett Winther says in a statement to TechCrunch. “The reality is that a few shifts in the underlying local distribution model and clever operational integrations allows for ‘store hailing’ to scale much sooner than everyone expects.”</p>
<p>At the very least, the company appears to be striking while the iron is hot on this one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket launch startup <a href="https://astra.com">Astra</a> has joined an elite group of companies that can say their vehicle has actually made it to orbital space &#8212; earlier than expected. The company&#8217;s Rocket 3.2 test rocket (yes, it&#8217;s a rocket called &#8220;Rocket&#8221;) passed the Karman line, the separation point 100 km (62 miles) up that most consider the barrier between Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and space, during a launch today from Kodiak, Alaska.</p>
<p>This is the second in this series of orbital flight tests by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astra-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astra-3">Astra; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> it flew its Rocket 3.1 test vehicle in September, but while that flight was successful by the company&#8217;s own definition, since it lifted off and provided a lot of data, it didn&#8217;t reach space or orbit. Both the 3.1 and 3.2 rockets are part of a planned three-launch series that Astra said would be designed to reach orbital altitudes by the end of the trio of attempts.</p>

<p>Astra is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/why-astra-built-a-space-startup-and-rocket-factory-in-silicon-valley/">small satellite launch startup that builds its rockets in California&#8217;s East Bay</a>, at a factory it established there which is designed to ultimately produce its launchers in volume. Their model uses smaller craft than existing options like either SpaceX or Rocket Lab, but aims to provide responsive, short turnaround launch services at a relatively low cost &#8212; a bus to space rather than a hired limousine. They compete more directly with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/25/virgin-orbits-first-orbital-test-flight-cut-short-after-rocket-released-from-carrier-aircraft/">something like Virgin Orbit, which has yet to reach space with its launch craft</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087687" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087687" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087687" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EpTtwrTVoAAfLoX.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EpTtwrTVoAAfLoX.jpeg 2047w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EpTtwrTVoAAfLoX.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EpTtwrTVoAAfLoX.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EpTtwrTVoAAfLoX.jpeg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EpTtwrTVoAAfLoX.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EpTtwrTVoAAfLoX.jpeg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EpTtwrTVoAAfLoX.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087687" class="wp-caption-text">The view from Astra&#8217;s Rocket 3.2 second stage from space.</p></div></p>
<p>This marks a tremendous win and milestone for Astra&#8217;s rocket program, made even more impressive by the relatively short turnaround between their rocket loss error in September, which the company determined was a result of a problem in its onboard guidance system. Correcting the mistake and getting back to an active, and successful launch, within three months, is a tremendous technical achievement, even in the best of times, and the company faced additional challenges because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Astra was not expecting to make it as far as it did today &#8212; the startup has defined seven stages of reaching orbital flight for its development program; today it expected to achieve 1) count and liftoff; and 2) reaching Max Q, the point of maximum dynamic pressure undergone by a rocket in flight in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Third, they were looking to achieve nominal main-engine cutoff for first stage &#8212; and this is where they would&#8217;ve pegged success today, but the &#8220;rocket continued to perform,&#8221; according to CEO and founder Chris Kemp on a call following the launch.</p>
<p>Rocket 3.2 then performed a successful stage separation, and then the second stage passed through the Karman line, reaching outer space. After that, it went farther still, achieving a successful upper-stage ignition, and a nominal upper-stage engine shut off six minutes later. Even then, the rocket reached 390 km, which is its target orbital height, but then reached a velocity of 7.2 km per hours, just one half km/hour less than the 7.68 km required for orbital velocity.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Astra built a space startup and rocket factory in Silicon Valley&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/why-astra-built-a-space-startup-and-rocket-factory-in-silicon-valley/embed/#?secret=HwxmX3Qv9B" data-secret="HwxmX3Qv9B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Astra emphasized that the mix for the propellant for this stage is basically only to be nailed down while testing in situ in space, so they say this will just require some upper-stage propellant mixtures to achieve that extra velocity, and Kemp said they&#8217;re confident they can do that in the next couple of months, and start reliving payloads early next year. This won&#8217;t require any hardware or software changes, the company noted, just a tweak in the variables involved.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087759" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087759" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087759" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50724621562_a3ab79ab67_k.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50724621562_a3ab79ab67_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50724621562_a3ab79ab67_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50724621562_a3ab79ab67_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50724621562_a3ab79ab67_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50724621562_a3ab79ab67_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50724621562_a3ab79ab67_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50724621562_a3ab79ab67_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087759" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.johnkrausphotos.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Kraus for Astra <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>He added that this is a big win for the underlying theory behind Astra&#8217;s approach, which focuses on using significant amounts of automation in order to reduce costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve only been in business for about four years, and this team only has about 100 people today,&#8221; Kemp said. &#8220;This team was able to overcome tremendous challenges on the way to this success. We had a member of the team quarantining, and tested positive on the way to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kodiak" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kodiak">Kodiak, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which meant they had to quarantine the entire team, and then sent an entire backup team to replace them.&#8221; This was possible because they only use five people on the launch team.</p>
<p>&#8220;We now are at a point where just five people can go up, and set up the entire launch site and rocket, and launch in just a couple of days,&#8221; Kemp said. The team is literally just five people &#8212; including labor, rocket unloading, setup and everything on-site &#8212; the rest is run remotely from mission control in California via the cloud.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Now they will do some tuning for Rocket 3.3, which is currently in California at the Astra factory, before soon attempting that final orbital test flight with a payload on board to deploy. After that, they intend to continue to iterate with each version of Rocket launched, focusing on reducing costs and improving performance through rapid evolution of the design and technology.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While it doesn&#8217;t appear to be completely down <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/gmail-youtube-google-docs-and-other-services-go-down-simultaneously-in-multiple-countries/">like it was yesterday morning</a>, we&#8217;re hearing many reports from Gmail users that the email service is having major issues right now.</p>
<p>Some users are reporting that Gmail is particularly slow, while others are reporting constant error messages. One TechCrunch writer, meanwhile, noticed that emails he was sending to Gmail accounts <strong>appeared to immediately bounce</strong>, with Gmail&#8217;s server responding with an error reading &#8220;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-b88u0q r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">550-5.1.1</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> The email account that you tried to reach does not exist.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> confirms the issues on its <a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;v=issue&amp;sid=1&amp;iid=a8b67908fadee664c68c240ff9f529ab">services dashboard</a>, writing at 1:30 PM Pacific that they&#8217;re impacting a &#8220;significant&#8221; number of users:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re aware of a problem with Gmail affecting a significant subset of users. The affected users are able to access Gmail, but are seeing error messages, high latency, and/or other unexpected behavior.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a second update at 2:30 PM, Google says its teams are &#8220;continuing to investigate this issue&#8221;; as of 3:30 PM, the company says it expects the issues to be fixed by 4:00 PM while noting that time may change.</p>
<p><strong>Update, 4:15 PM Pacific: </strong>Google now says the problems have been resolved.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, encrypted email service ProtonMail tweets that the email bouncing issue mentioned above is widespread, with many emails sent to Gmail users bouncing permanently:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>If you&#8217;re sending an email of any importance to a Gmail user right now, you&#8217;ll want to wait until this is fully fixed; if you&#8217;ve sent one in the last few hours, double check it was actually received.</p>

<p>The deal, yet to close, is one of the largest enterprise buys of the year: Vista is getting an online training company that helps retrain techies with in-demand skills through online courses in the midst of a booming edtech market. Additionally, the sector is losing one of its few publicly traded companies just two years after it debuted on the stock market.</p>

<p>Investors and founders told Techcrunch that the Pluralsight acquisition is largely a positive signal that shows the strength of edtech’s capital options as the pandemic continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;What’s happening in edtech is that capital markets are liquidating,&#8221; said Deborah Quazzo, managing partner of GSV Advisors.</p>
<p>Quazzo, a seed investor in Pluralsight, said the ability to move fluidly between privately held and publicly held companies is a characteristic of tech sectors with deep capital markets, which is different from edtech’s &#8220;old days, where the options to exit were very narrow.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Over the icy tundra of Siberia in 2009, a derelict Russian military satellite, Kosmos-2251, slammed into an active communications satellite, Iridium 33, at speeds in excess of 26,000 miles per hour. Both were immediately smashed to smithereens.</p>
<p>As a result of this single collision, approximately 1,800 large pieces of space debris, each capable of destroying any spacecraft unfortunate enough to cross its path, remain in orbit to this day and for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Depending on who you ask, space debris is either a nonissue that will solve itself or a critical problem that threatens the future of space exploration. We interviewed dozens of experts across industry, academia and the regulatory landscape to better understand which of these viewpoints is closer to the truth, and to consider what ought to be done going forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>What is space debris?</h2>
<p>Far from homogenous, space debris includes any nonfunctional human-made object in space, including rocket parts that have been abandoned in orbit after having completed their mission, defunct satellites, fragments from <a href="https://spacenews.com/u-s-satellite-destroyed-in-space-collision/">unintentional</a> and <a href="https://www.space.com/3415-china-anti-satellite-test-worrisome-debris-cloud-circles-earth.html">intentional</a> <a href="https://www.space.com/india-anti-satellite-test-significance.html">orbital collisions</a> and items released during operations. These sources have multiplied to create a large amount of space debris orbiting Earth.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			According to NASA, there are over 30,000 objects larger than a softball in orbit, traveling at speeds up to 18,000 miles per hour.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This debris is spread across all three of the main regions of space around Earth: low-Earth orbit (LEO), medium-Earth orbit (MEO) and geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO). As its name suggests, LEO is the closest to us, extending up to 2,000 km from the Earth’s surface.</p>
<p>It is the most crowded region of the three and, in addition to hosting the International Space Station, it is the region where SpaceX, OneWeb and other well-funded companies are currently sending tens of thousands of new satellites as part of their constellations. Perhaps not surprisingly, LEO is the region with the most debris. As a result, it tends to be the focus of much of the discussion around the issue.</p>
<p>Above LEO, satellites in MEO and GEO are also threatened by space debris. This is important because these orbits host a number of crucial satellites, including navigation systems in MEO such as the American GPS and European Galileo, and critical GEO-based communication satellites. Satellites in GEO are able to maintain a single point above the Earth (this special orbit is possible because the satellite is orbiting around Earth at the same speed the Earth is rotating).</p>
<p>Given the altitude of both MEO (2,000 km-36,000 km) and GEO (~36,000 km), de-orbiting the satellite is not a viable option — the current solution when satellites retire is to move them to unused orbits called “graveyard orbits,” further contributing to the growth of space debris above us.</p>
<h2>Why does space debris matter?</h2>
<p>The existence of space debris is concerning for many reasons, with physical collisions being the most obvious. The possible risk caused by space debris is magnified by the incredible speed at which debris typically travels. According to NASA, there are over 30,000 objects larger than a softball in orbit, traveling at speeds up to 18,000 miles per hour. At that speed, any one of these objects is capable of completely destroying a spacecraft.</p>
<p>Even debris just 1 cm in diameter can disable an operational spacecraft, while even smaller fragments can cause huge problems as well. Indeed, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/05/12/tiny_space_trash_impact_cracks_window_on_international_space_station/">a fleck of paint</a> was enough to damage a window on the International Space Station, which has been forced into maneuvers to avoid larger, potentially catastrophic debris 28 times since 1999, including<a href="https://spacenews.com/space-station-maneuvers-to-avoid-debris/"> three times in 2020 alone</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, tracking all of this debris has proven to be an arduous challenge. For starters, only objects larger than 10 cm in diameter are currently tracked by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). However, there are likely 900,000 objects less than 10 cm but larger than 1 cm, and tens of millions of objects smaller than 1 cm that are not tracked by the current system but that are still capable of causing significant damage. Of particular concern is the range between 1 cm and 10 cm, which has appropriately earned the moniker of lethal nontrackable debris, or LNT.</p>
<p>Space junk poses other challenges as well. Astronomers lament that light pollution from objects in orbit hampers observation of the night sky. The reliance of observatories — often involving equipment costing hundreds of millions of dollars — on long exposures makes debris particularly problematic. Another worry is “Kessler syndrome,” which takes its name from NASA scientist Donald Kessler.</p>
<p>In 1978, Kessler postulated that more space debris would increase the likelihood of collisions, which in turn would lead to more space debris, and so on, in an exponential growth that may end up compromising orbital operations. In other words, the issue could evolve into a never-ending spiral that eventually renders LEO unusable and possibly impenetrable.</p>
<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
<p>Before considering how to respond, it is important to understand the landscape of those affected by space debris.</p>
<p>Launch providers are among the most crucial players — after all, their business models hinge on their ability to put payloads into orbit. They are also part of the problem. Launcher parts (i.e., spent upper stages) left in orbit have been, in the words of professor Lorenzo Casalino of the Polytechnic University of Turin, “piling up for decades.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Astroscale sets March 2021 for first commercial orbital debris removal demonstration&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/astroscale-sets-march-2021-for-first-commercial-orbital-debris-removal-demonstration/embed/#?secret=y559aM2071" data-secret="y559aM2071" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He believes launch providers have been “among the most critical contributors to space debris.” However, some newer launch companies, such as<a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/"> Rocket Lab</a>, do not leave any piece of their rockets in space. Instead, they de-orbit the stages, which causes them to burn up upon reentry into Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>Satellite operators are also a crucial component of the ecosystem. On one hand, they are the ones most responsible for the overcrowding of space; on the other, they are the most likely victims of space debris. Mike Safyan of Planet, which has over 150 satellites in orbit, notes that mitigating space debris is “in the interest of satellite operators,” and that many are already incorporating maneuverability and de-orbiting technologies into their satellites.</p>
<p>For example, OneWeb, a large constellation operator, is designing its satellites to be “de-orbit ready.” Darren McKnight, Technical Director at Centauri, a satellite operator, explains that operators are faced with a “significant decline in overall reliability” as their systems are increasingly affected by a constantly growing space debris cloud, and thus incentivized to act. Sara Spangelo, CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://swarm.space/tracking/">Swarm Technologies</a>, says many private companies have already started to implement measures for space debris mitigation. Swarm Technologies has proven that it can consistently track its tiny satellites and recently added active attitude and propulsion control to maneuver out of the trajectory of debris.</p>
<p>These strategies help ensure that while the 10 cm by 10 cm by 2.8 cm (the size of a grilled cheese sandwich) satellites are providing connectivity around the world, they do not contribute to the growth of the space debris cloud.</p>
<p>An interesting role is played by insurance companies. Chris Quilty, a commercial space expert, notes that while satellite insurance remains relatively uncommon — fewer than a tenth of satellites in LEO are covered by insurance — insurers are likely to play an increasingly large role as the risk of collisions becomes more likely. Chris Kunstadter, global head of space at AXA XL, a major commercial insurance provider, adds that insurers have been active in terms of pushing for stricter regulation, as insurance is often a key component of regulatory proposals.</p>
<p>One group that is often overlooked, but that has the potential to strongly affect the future path toward the sustainable use of space, is comprised of the end users of space-based services. This encompasses anyone from telecommunications customers to users of imaging data to transportation companies relying on satellites to track their ships and planes. As OneWeb’s VP of Regulatory Affairs Ruth Pritchard-Kelly points out, if end users demand sustainability, as they have in other sectors (e.g., retail, mining, etc.), it would likely force launch providers and satellite operators to act.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a new stakeholder that is trying to solve the challenge of space debris. Startups such as <a href="https://astroscale.com/">Astroscale</a> and <a href="https://www.dorbit.space/">D-Orbit</a> are making progress toward commercializing the removal, or at least mitigation, of space debris. Another example is <a href="https://www.leolabs.space/">LeoLabs</a>, a ground-based space mapping provider, whose phased-array radars are capable of tracking debris as small as 2 cm. Dan Ceperley, founder and CEO of LeoLabs, believes his company’s advanced tracking capabilities will allow launch providers and satellite operators to be responsible for the objects they put into space. If mapping, mitigating and removing space debris turn out to be profitable endeavors, the private sector may already have the incentives it needs to clean up its act.</p>
<h2>Regulatory considerations</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding the promise of space debris mitigation technology, it is possible that regulators will be forced into action. Due to the intricacies of the space sector and the many stakeholders, regulatory bodies could provide stability and a guiding framework for companies around the world. However, the regulatory picture is uncertain given how decentralized space regulation tends to be.</p>
<p>While the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) exists to promote international cooperation in outer space, it is lacking in its ability to enforce regulations at the international level, being limited to providing secretarial support to the COPUOS (Committee for Peaceful Use of Outer Space). As a result, regulation in the industry has always been a tricky patchwork of country-level rules, with parties occasionally resorting to adopting “flags of convenience” in search of the nation offering the most favorable regulatory conditions.</p>
<p>In spite of this patchwork, the United States has emerged as the most powerful potential source of regulation given both its weight within the industry as well as its International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). ITAR is a U.S. regulatory regime controlling the manufacture, sale, distribution and use of defense and space-related articles that has made it costly and difficult — if not impossible — for U.S. players in the space industry to flag-shop or otherwise do business without adhering to U.S. regulations. As a result, any effective regulations governing space debris are likely to emerge from the U.S.</p>
<p>One of the many observations that has echoed through numerous interviews revolves around how U.S. regulations have not kept up with the rapid development of technology, with rules and guidelines dating back to a period when only NASA and the Soviet space program launched satellites into space, and when the idea of private entities possessing the ability to easily and inexpensively access space was “unthinkable,” in the words of Alessandro Rossi of the Italian National Research Council.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, launch costs have decreased by an order of magnitude; this, combined with the development of CubeSats and other miniature satellites, has dramatically lowered the cost of sending payloads to space. The private sector has responded by promising to send thousands of satellites into LEO over the next few years. It is unlikely that rules designed to regulate a handful of satellites the size of school buses will be adequate for this new reality.</p>
<p>Within the U.S., several agencies deal with the use of space, and the best source of future regulation remains a point of contention. A<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/space-policy-directive-3-national-space-traffic-management-policy/"> 2018 White House directive</a> sought to make the Commerce Department the “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/23/satellites-collisions-tracking-space/?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories_satellites-725am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans">traffic cop</a>” of space. Meanwhile,<a href="https://govmatters.tv/regulating-satellites-in-space/#:~:text=The%20White%20House%20has%20given,to%20the%20Federal%20Aviation%20Administration."> some believe</a> the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which already regulates launches and reentries, is in the best position to effect change. Another key player is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is responsible for regulating satellite transmissions.</p>
<p>According to Laura Montgomery, an expert in space law and the former head of the FAA’s space law branch, the FCC “certainly interprets its regulatory mandate as extending to space debris.”</p>
<p>The experts we spoke to generally seemed to believe that these agencies are unlikely to aggressively pursue new regulations in the near term. Professor Montgomery noted that regulators “tend to move slowly,” and that the collisions that have happened to date have “yet to lead to Congressional action” on this issue. Professor Zac Manchester of Carnegie Mellon University suggested regulatory agencies are “often understaffed and lacking the technical expertise” to address the problem of space debris anytime soon.</p>
<p>Others noted that while the<a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-363486A1.pdf"> FCC implemented new rules</a> to mitigate orbital space debris back in April, these rules did little to change the status quo — operators will now be required to submit more safety disclosures, but the body “<a href="https://spacenews.com/fcc-punts-controversial-space-debris-rules-for-extra-study/">stopped short of introducing stricter orbital debris criteria</a>.” To summarize, it appears that new overarching regulations are unlikely to be implemented anytime soon.</p>
<p>Where many see regulatory bodies as the ones holding the stick, there has been a push toward the creation of a carrot, an incentive for stakeholders to play an active role in addressing space debris. This is what the World Economic Forum (WEF), together with MIT’s Space Enabled Research Group at their Media Labs, European Space Agency, University of Texas at Austin, and Bryce Space and Technology, has been working on with the development of the Space Sustainability Rating (SSR).</p>
<p>WEF’s Nikolai Khlystov describes the SSR as a voluntary rating system for space (not dissimilar to what already exists for the energy class of home appliances or LEED for buildings) that aims at incentivizing good behavior. The hope is that the SSR, or a similar system, will be widely adopted by the industry. As an example, the WEF sees insurance companies making good use of the rating, as it could be used to determine premiums, offer discounts or even refuse insurance for underperformers.</p>
<h2>The case for action</h2>
<p>At this point, the space industry and its stakeholders have two options. They can either set up a framework that can address the problem of space debris, or continue on the current path, with little regulatory oversight and even less enforceability on a global level surrounding the sustainable use of space.</p>
<p>Looking at the history of space debris, we can safely assume that if nothing changes, the amount of debris will continue to grow, particularly within the more crowded LEO orbits. Without a comprehensive framework for end-of-life, it is only a matter of time before more collisions like the Kosmos-Iridium one will cause an order of magnitude increase in space debris, making it nearly impossible to clean up LEO.</p>
<p>There is a saying in aviation: “Regulations are written in blood.” The implication is that regulations are often founded on lessons learned from events that cost property or lives. One more major collision could force the hand of the international space community and lead to harsh regulations that could be negative for those within the private space industry that have not already adopted sustainability as a business imperative.</p>
<h2>The case for caution</h2>
<p>On the other hand, the space industry and regulatory bodies could come together to shape guiding transparent rules to deal with the challenges posed by space debris without hindering progress in the private space sector.</p>
<p>Any framework addressing the issue of space debris should be a cooperative, international effort. Regulatory bodies can leverage the fact that the sustainable use of space is in the interest of all market participants — after all, space debris is a costly problem, as well as a potential safety issue, for both operators and users. Today, many companies in the private space sector are in favor of greater accountability for this reason.</p>
<p>In addition, the case could be made that private companies would be more effective than governments at removing space debris from highly congested orbits. The technology of space debris removal is still in its early stages — Astroscale and other startups have not yet launched their services. However, they are<a href="https://astroscale.com/astroscale-takes-next-step-toward-launch-of-worlds-first-commercial-active-debris-removal-mission/"> beginning to make significant progress</a>, and it is hard to imagine a future where this industry will not be critical in cleaning up space debris.</p>
<h2>The path forward</h2>
<p>Ideally, we hope to see the private sector rise to the occasion. Surely market participants acknowledge the long-term importance of keeping space free of debris, and we believe this represents an attractive problem for startups to tackle. We would also welcome creative ideas, such as prizes for researchers who come up with the best solutions for removing space debris.</p>
<p>However, at some point, it is likely that the issue of space debris will need to be addressed with regulation. In particular, we would urge the regulators best-positioned to act — those in the United States — to tackle the issue, as they stand the best chance of crafting enforceable regulation.</p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles currently is that different agencies touch different parts of the satellite ecosystem (e.g., the Commerce Department, the FAA and the FCC) and responsibilities often overlap. We would encourage Congress to clarify this issue and empower a single agency to take the lead in setting rules to address the issue of space debris.</p>
<p>We would, however, caution against sweeping regulation that fails to consider the long-term consequences of such action. Professor Montgomery puts it best, “As a former writer of regulations, I know that they tend to get set in stone, and this has the potential to hamper innovation.”</p>
<p>This was the key issue with the debacle surrounding the Kicksat-2 project, says Professor Manchester. The project was meant to demonstrate the cutting-edge technology of microsatellites in a safe manner, but was delayed for years due to concerns from the FCC before being approved in 2019 with zero modifications to the original design. Montgomery adds that, “If regulators act too quickly, they run the risk of creating rules that are not ideal and that are almost impossible to fix.”</p>
<p>For this reason, we would encourage regulators to take their time to understand the issue and to work closely with other stakeholders to develop a set of guidelines over time, rather than rushing to a conclusion too soon.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we hope regulators and the commercial players can work together to find a lasting solution in the relatively near future, rather than waiting for a catastrophic failure before taking action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.boxcast.com/">BoxCast</a>, a Cleveland-based company aiming to make it easy to live stream any event, has raised $20 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Gordon Daily said that when the company first launched in 2013, &#8220;streaming wasn&#8217;t something that everyone understood,&#8221; and you needed professional help to live stream anything. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boxcast" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boxcast">BoxCast <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is supposed to make that process accessible to anyone.</p>
<p>The company has created several different video encoder devices, but Daily said the &#8220;small box&#8221; is just a one piece of BoxCast platform, which is designed to cover all your live-streaming needs, with support for 1080p broadcasting; streaming to Facebook Live, YouTube and your own website; analytics and more — plus there are add-ons like automatic scoreboard displays and event ticketing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pricing starts at $99 per month for the &#8220;essential&#8221; streaming plan, plus $399 for a BoxCast encoder. (You can also just stream from an iOS device.)</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s no surprise that 2020 has been a &#8220;watershed moment&#8221; for the company, as Daily put it, with BoxCast now live streaming millions of events per year — everything from sports to religious services to <a href="http://www.dailynews.lk/2020/11/24/finance/234279/sri-lanka-tourism’s-wildlife-streaming-event-“couch-safari’">virtual safaris offered by Sri Lanka&#8217;s tourism board</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087627" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087627" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2087627" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg?w=680" alt="BoxCast dashboard" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087627" class="wp-caption-text">BoxCast dashboard</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;When you can&#8217;t even meet in-person &#8230; we knew that there was going to be higher usage,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What caught me off-guard was the volume increase — it’s new customers, it&#8217;s existing customers, at peak times there&#8217;s a 10x increase [from pre-pandemic usage].&#8221;</p>
<p>And while in-person events will hopefully become more common next year, Daily said live streams will still be a valuable tool to reach audiences who can&#8217;t attend, and to promote your business or organization with new kinds of programming.</p>
<p>COO Sam Brenner added that while BoxCast employed fewer than 40 people before the pandemic, the team has grown to 56, and will likely double within the next 12 months.</p>
<p>The Series A was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/updata-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="updata-partners">Updata Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from audio equipment manufacturer Shure.</p>

<p>“​The live streaming video market has grown dramatically over the last decade, and COVID-19 has accelerated adoption in recent months. ​BoxCast offers a unique end-to-end platform that makes live streaming easy,&#8221; said Updata&#8217;s Carter Griffin in a statement. &#8220;We’re excited to partner with Gordon and his team, and look forward to contributing to their vision of making live events accessible to all.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following recent reports, Periscope announced today that it will end operations as a standalone app by March 2021. The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned company referred to its current operations as &#8220;unsustainable&#8221; in an open letter <a href="https://periscope.medium.com/farewell-periscope-164db2742b7c">posted today</a>. It also cited a decline in usage in recent years as a driving factor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leaving it in its current state isn’t doing right by the current and former Periscope community or by Twitter,&#8221; the company noted.</p>
<p>Twitter, which acquired the livestreaming app back in 2015, has been building out its own video offerings in recent months, rendering much of Periscope&#8217;s features redundant as a standalone app. A line of code that popped up in the Twitter app last week appeared to point to periscope&#8217;s eventual closure. At the time, however, Twitter refused to comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Periscope was purchased in its infancy, as Twitter looked to address the rapid growth of competitor Meerkat. Of course, the live video landscape has evolved by leaps and bounds in recent years, and eventually it made the most sense to begin to incorporate such features directly into the native Twitter app. But even as livestreaming has grown, Periscope&#8217;s own fortunes as a standalone app have been diminishing for a number of years, as the company itself notes.</p>
<p>The company adds that all of this likely would have occurred even sooner, but the worst year ever got in way of those plans. &#8220;We probably would have made this decision sooner if it weren’t for all of the projects we reprioritized due to the events of 2020,&#8221; Twitter explains.</p>
<p>Sensor Tower notes that Periscope has had around 101 million installs over its life time, including the App Store and Google Play. It also tells TechCrunch, &#8220;Year-to-date, Periscope has seen approximately 6.8 million installs globally, down 7% year-over-year from about 7.3 million during the same period from January to December 14, 2019.&#8221;</p>
<p>Periscope will be removed from app stores in March, and the ability to create new accounts will be disabled with the next software update. Existing Broadcasts that were shared on Twitter will continue to exist on that app as replays. The company is also offering users the ability to download an archive of their content before it all goes away in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The past eight or so months have been profoundly difficult for musicians. With touring ground to a halt and streaming services offering fractions of cents, livelihoods have been utterly upended for countless artists. Since March, however, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bandcamp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bandcamp">Bandcamp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been a rare beacon for many musicians.</p>
<p>On the first Friday of every month, the service has waved its fees, letting artists and labels reap the benefits in the process. Over the course of nine such Fridays, the service has generated some $40 million, as nearly 800,000 people have purchased music on those days. Artists have received, on average, 93% of the proceeds (transaction fees making up the remainder), versus 82% on normal days.</p>
<p>While the arrival of vaccines are a reason to be hopeful, it’s clear we’re not out of the woods yet. As such, the service announced today that Bandcamp Fridays will be extended at least through May of 2021. Those dates include, February 5, March 5, April 2, and May 7.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Other online services have been less proactive. In July, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told the media, “Some artists that used to do well in the past may not do well in this future landscape, where you can’t record music once every three to four years and think that’s going to be enough.”</p>

<p>By the end of 2025, Airbnb is aiming for 20% of its U.S. workforce to be underrepresented minorities, which includes folks who self-identify as American Indian or Alaska Native, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Currently, underrepresented minorities make up just 12% of the company&#8217;s employee base.</p>
<p>The second goal is to increase the representation of women to 50% by the end of 2025. Currently, Airbnb says it is 46.9% female worldwide, but it&#8217;s worth noting <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/2018-eeoc/">Airbnb has not released a full diversity report</a> since 2019 when it disclosed its 2018 numbers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These goals come after <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/fighting-discrimination-and-making-airbnb-more-diverse/">Airbnb committed in June to making its board of directors and executive team 20% people of color by the end of 2021</a>. Currently, Airbnb has one Black director on its board, Kenneth Chenault, and one Black person on its executive team, Melissa Thomas-Hunt, who is head of global diversity and belonging.</p>
<p>This is also not the first time Airbnb has set goals. In 2016, Airbnb committed to increasing the percentage of employees from underrepresented groups from 9.64% to 11% by the end of 2017. Airbnb achieved that goal, which supports the claim that setting goals are helpful in increasing DEI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zoox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zoox">Zoox, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the autonomous vehicle company that was acquired this year by Amazon, revealed this week the product of six years of work: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazons-zoox-unveils-electric-robotaxi-that-can-travel-up-to-75-mph/">A purpose-built self-driving vehicle designed to carry people</a> — and someday maybe even packages — in dense urban environments.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s story has captured the attention of skeptics and supporters alike, perhaps because of its secretive nature and outsized mission. Unlike its rivals, Zoox is developing the self-driving software stack, the on-demand ride-sharing app and the vehicle itself. Zoox also plans to own, manage and operate its robotaxi fleet.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>

	</div>
	</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been an expensive pursuit that almost led to its demise before Amazon snapped it up — and the mission is still far from over. But today, as an independent Amazon subsidiary, it has the financial support of one of the world&#8217;s most valuable public companies.</p>
<p>TechCrunch interviewed Zoox co-founder and CTO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jesse-levinson-ph-d" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jesse-levinson-ph-d">Jesse Levinson <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> about the company&#8217;s milestone, the vehicle design, its exit to Amazon and what lies ahead.</p>
<p><em>This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: What was your trick or how did you remain focused for six years on something that is futuristic, expensive and possibly could fail? What did you personally do to keep that focus?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Jesse Levinson</strong>: Well, doing something like this is definitely challenging and it requires patience. I think the advice I would give is first to convince yourself that what you&#8217;re doing makes sense and is important and worth doing. If you&#8217;re starting a company because your goal is to make as much money as possible, if it turns out to be hard it&#8217;s going to be really difficult to convince yourself and your team and investors to stick with the idea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the great things about Zoox is that the idea itself just makes a lot of sense. From first principles, there&#8217;s really a compelling reason to solve the problem the way we&#8217;ve been solving it and the market opportunity is unquestionably enormous. So armed with those facts and a team of wonderful employees and investors who strongly believed in that, we were able to weather some of the ups and downs of the industry, even though it&#8217;s not always been an easy ride.</span></p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s go back in time to the very first concept when you started to think of what a purpose-built vehicle would look like. Those early drawings showed a very, very different looking type of vehicle.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you referring to maybe like the sports-car-looking vehicle? We were actually never planning on launching a sports car as our first product; that was more of like a vision statement. Honestly, if you&#8217;re trying to move people around cities, it makes much more sense to have the kind of compact carriage like we showed this morning. We were never actually building a sports car. </span></p>
<p><strong>What is it like to create a long-term, cutting-edge product that exists at the edge of regulation? It seems like a very unique problem. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would say that if you have a big idea and you&#8217;re confident that it makes sense, you should at least explore the idea, rather than giving up because the current regulations aren&#8217;t designed for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, it&#8217;s very important to be respectful of the regulatory process, and you can&#8217;t assume that you can ignore it. I think companies that have tried that approach have usually found that doesn&#8217;t work very well either. We&#8217;ve taken a very proactive approach to working with regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal level, and we&#8217;ve been very forthcoming with &#8220;this is how we look at the problem&#8221; and &#8220;this is what we want to do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve also been fortunate because over time the regulations on the local, state and federal level have really evolved to accommodate what we&#8217;ve been working on since 2014, even though when we started the company in 2014, those regulations did not exist. </span></p>
<p><strong>The vehicle today, was that </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>what you had in your mind, or what the team had in mind, from the very beginning? Or was it a bit different?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, honestly, there have been very few substantive changes to the vehicle’s design since we started working on it in 2014 and 2015. Obviously, we refined it and actually had to make it work from an engineering and crash perspective. But if you look at some of the drawings that we were exploring in 2014 and 2015, it&#8217;s extremely similar.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://withfrank.org/">Frank</a>, a startup best known for helping college students secure and manage financial aid, is expanding into a new part of the edtech world. Namely, finding and taking online classes, with the company helping students deploy their financial aid money to open digital slots at more than 100 colleges.</p>
<p>As a company, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/frank-financial-aid" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="frank-financial-aid">Frank <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> straddles the ground between consumer fintech, which helps regular people better manage their money, and edtech, the application of tech to the venerable business of learning. TechCrunch covered the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/04/investors-are-pouring-money-into-frank-a-turbotax-for-student-loan-applications/">company&#8217;s 2017-era Series A</a>, and recently discussed the company when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/frank-raises-5m-more-in-its-quest-to-get-students-max-financial-aid/">raised $5 million earlier in the year</a>.</p>
<p>According to its CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/charliejavice?lang=en">Charlie Javice</a>, her company has grown by around a factor of three this year. And, with Javice telling TechCrunch that Frank&#8217;s new class-finding service &#8212; dubbed <a href="https://classfinder.withfrank.org/">Classfinder</a> &#8212; could become &#8220;a primary driver&#8221; for her startup in time, we decided to dig in a little.</p>
<h2>Classfinder</h2>
<p>Frank is teaming up with colleges to offer discounted classes, hoping to match its users with unfilled slots in classes that are already set to take place. And the startup will help its user base utilize financial aid to help pay for their selected classes, possibly helping folks take more credits without extra debt.</p>
<p>There are 125 schools offering classes on the platform today, out of a rotating cadre of over 350. The Classfinder website claims 7,520 courses up for selection as of today.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Javice if offering access to online classes was a deviation from Frank&#8217;s better-known effort to help more students get more financial assistance in their college pursuit. In the CEO&#8217;s view, Classfinder fits inside what she views as her company&#8217;s mission, namely higher-education affordability.</p>
<p>If Classfinder works as well as the company hopes, that could bear out, even if the new product does appear to be more an evolution of Frank&#8217;s product lineup than merely a continuation of its initial vision.</p>
<p>Provided the model works, it could net out to a win for all involved parties. Colleges have spare digital capacity for students, and lots of students don&#8217;t have money for school, so if Frank can help those same kids get financial aid and deploy it to discounted, accredited classes, no one loses.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was curious about transferring credits &#8212; would classes taken with Classfinder count at other schools? Per the company, yes, and Frank will help prepare the needed information. Of course, some colleges may balk, but for some students the system could be a way to boost college affordability while not sacrificing learning.</p>
<p>Digital education became the norm this year, to middling results. Amongst children, the move to online schooling has been widely panned. But for higher education, online instruction was already an evolved industry even before the pandemic. Perhaps it will become even more normal in time.</p>
<p>How large the addressable market is for taking one-off classes is unclear, though the success of Guild Education could point to a large pool of potential students. Guild, which became a unicorn in 2019 after raising a $157 million Series D, helps corporate employees take continuing education classes to help bolster their careers. Even as the world of online classes clutters up, Frank&#8217;s decision to focus on college instead of the broader life-long learning market means that it thinks higher ed isn&#8217;t disappearing as fast as some edtech enthusiasts might think.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll check back in with Frank in a quarter or two to see how the new product is helping, or not, its growth trajectory. If it does, Frank could raise a Series B in the next few quarters. Chegg, a public edtech company that previously backed the company, is worth $11 billion as of today&#8217;s trading. So if Frank keeps growing, there should be money available to it.</p>

<p>The hit game just launched on the gaming platform after becoming a surprise hit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally launched in 2018, the game found an eager audience during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and its popularity is still soaring.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good chance one of my kids is playing the game right now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news came from Nintendo&#8217;s latest Indie World Showcase, where the gaming company highlights titles from smaller companies. The company left this title for the end of the presentation. And for good reason. Among Us is without question one of the hottest titles available right now, attracting gamers from all platforms. Prior to the election Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used the game as a platform to drive voters to the polls and, at one point, drew 435,000 concurrent viewers.</p>
<p>The game costs $5.00 and is now available as a digital purchase through Nintendo&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/among-us-switch/">eShop</a>.</p>

<p>The pandemic is, and remains, a global disaster of epic proportions that&#8217;s forced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/how-3-remote-friendly-tech-companies-plan-to-return-to-the-office/">billions of people into lockdown</a>, left economies in tatters with companies (including startups) struggling to stay afloat. The mass shifting of people working from home brought security challenges with it, like how to protect your workforce when employees are working outside the security perimeter of their offices. But it&#8217;s forced us to find and solve solutions to some of the most complex challenges, like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/election-day-cyberattacks-misinformation/"> pulling off a secure election</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/microsoft-russia-north-korea-hackers-coronavirus-vaccine/"> securing the supply chain</a> for the vaccines that will bring our lives back to some semblance of normality.</p>
<p>With 2020 wrapping up, much of the security headaches exposed by the pandemic will linger into the new year. This is what to expect.</p>

<p>The sudden lockdowns in March drove millions to work from home. But hackers quickly found new and interesting ways to target big companies by targeting the employees themselves. VPNs were a big target because of outstanding vulnerabilities that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/corporate-vpn-flaws-risk/">many companies didn&#8217;t bother to fix</a>. Bugs in enterprise software left corporate networks open to attack. The flood of personal devices logging onto the network — and the influx of malware with it — introduced fresh havoc.</p>
<p>Sophos says that this mass decentralizing of the workforce has turned us all into our own IT departments. We have to patch our own computers, install security updates, and there&#8217;s no IT just down the hallway to ask if that&#8217;s a phishing email.</p>
<p>Companies are having to adjust to the cybersecurity challenges, since working from home is probably here to stay. Managed service providers, or outsourced IT departments, have a &#8220;huge opportunity to benefit from the work-from-home shift,&#8221; said Grayson Milbourne, security intelligence director at cybersecurity firm Webroot.</p>
<h2>Ransomware has become more targeted and more difficult to escape</h2>
<p>File-encrypting malware, or ransomware, is getting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">craftier and sneakier</a>. Where traditional ransomware would encrypt and hold a victim&#8217;s files hostage in exchange for a ransom payout, the newer and more advanced strains first steal a victim&#8217;s files, encrypt the network and then threaten to publish the stolen files if the ransom isn&#8217;t paid.</p>
<p>This data-stealing ransomware makes escaping an attack far more difficult because a victim can&#8217;t just restore their systems from a backup (if there is one). CrowdStrike&#8217;s chief technology officer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/crowdstrike-michael-sentonas/">Michael Sentonas</a> calls this new wave of ransomware &#8220;double extortion&#8221; because victims are forced to respond to the data breach as well.</p>
<p>The healthcare sector is under the closest guard because of the pandemic. Despite promises from some (but not all) ransomware groups that hospitals would not be deliberately targeted <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-to-stop-attacking-health-orgs-during-pandemic/">during the pandemic</a>, medical practices were far from immune. 2020 saw several high profile attacks. A ransomware attack at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/universal-health-services-ransomware/">Universal Health Services</a>, one of the largest healthcare providers in the U.S., caused widespread disruption to its systems. Just last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/us-fertility-ransomware-attack/">U.S. Fertility confirmed a ransomware attack</a> on its network.</p>
<p>These high-profile incidents are becoming more common because hackers are targeting their victims very carefully. These hyperfocused attacks require a lot more skill and effort but improve the hackers&#8217; odds of landing a larger ransom — in some cases earning the hackers millions of dollars from a single attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;This coming year, these sophisticated cyberattacks will put enormous stress on the availability of services — in everything from rerouted healthcare services impacting patient care, to availability of online and mobile banking and finance platforms,&#8221; said Sentonas.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When large companies like Netflix or <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> want to test the resilience of their systems, they use chaos engineering tools designed to help them simulate worst-case scenarios and find potential issues before they even happen. Today at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/keynotes/?trk=wwwgooglecom">AWS re:Invent</a>, Amazon CTO Werner Vogels introduced the company&#8217;s Chaos Engineering as a Service offering called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fis/">AWS Fault Injection Simulator</a>.</p>
<p>The name may lack a certain marketing panache, but Vogels said that the service is designed to help bring this capability to all companies. &#8220;We believe that chaos engineering is for everyone, not just shops running at Amazon or Netflix scale. And that&#8217;s why today I&#8217;m excited to pre-announce a new service built to simplify the process of running chaos experiments in the cloud,&#8221; Vogels said.</p>
<p>As he explained, the goal of chaos engineering is to understand how your application responds to issues by injecting failures into your application, usually running these experiments against production systems. AWS Fault Injection Simulator offers a fully managed service to run these experiments on applications running on AWS hardware.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;FIS makes it easy to run safe experiments. We built it to follow the typical chaos experimental workflow where you understand your steady state, set a hypothesis and inject faults into your application. When the experiment is over, FIS will tell you if your hypothesis was confirmed, and you can use the data collected by CloudWatch to decide where you need to make improvements,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>While the company was announcing the service today, Vogels indicated it won&#8217;t actually be available until some time next year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are other similar services out there by companies, like <a href="https://www.gremlin.com/">Gremlin</a>, which are already providing a broad Chaos Engineering Service as a Service offering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it first launched nearly three years ago, <a href="https://fifthwall.com/">Fifth Wall</a> had a vision of leveraging capital limited partners from across the real estate development and construction business to back the technologies the industry needed most.</p>
<p>That early vision resonated so well that the firm has grown from managing one fund of $212 million to holding roughly $1.2 billion in assets under management. It has also come to the realization that the investment vehicles they&#8217;re currently managing have one huge blind spot &#8212; climate-related technologies.</p>
<p>With that deficit in mind, the firm has set out to raise a new climate-focused investment vehicle with at least a $200 million target, and has brought on a new partner to help invest that capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, the firm announced that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/greg-smithies" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="greg-smithies">Greg Smithies, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a former partner at BMW iVentures and longtime investor in climate-related technologies, would be joining the firm to help Tyson Woeste invest <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fifth-wall-ventures-management" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fifth-wall-ventures-management">Fifth Wall&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> newly raised capital.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087449" style="width: 950px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087449" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2087449" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/greg-smithies-big.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="522" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/greg-smithies-big.jpg 717w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/greg-smithies-big.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/greg-smithies-big.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/greg-smithies-big.jpg?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/greg-smithies-big.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087449" class="wp-caption-text">Real estate tech investment firm Fifth Wall&#8217;s newest partner, Greg Smithies. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> Fifth Wall</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;A year ago, real estate investors began asking questions around climate and sustainability,&#8221; said Fifth Wall co-founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/brendan-wallace" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="brendan-wallace">Brendan Wallace <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. These questions were motivated by three main concerns from commercial and residential property developers.</p>
<p>The first concern stemmed from the financial investors that typically finance these projects demanding that developers pay closer attention to low-carbon or no-carbon real estate developments. Regulators became a second pain point as elected officials in hubs like New York and Los Angeles began to enact carbon neutrality laws mandating the decarbonization of real estate. And finally, the customers who rent and buy space among real estate developers had their own demands around decarbonization, Wallace said.</p>
<p>And the technologies that are being deployed have a far more technical bent than some of the firm&#8217;s existing portfolio was used to.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Smithies, a former employee at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/neuralink" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="neuralink">Neuralink <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and the Boring Company and most recently in charge of climate investing at BMW iVentures, has joined the firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What excites me about this space is that there&#8217;s so much low-hanging fruit. And there&#8217;s $260 trillion worth of buildings,&#8221; Smithies said. &#8220;The vast majority of those are nowhere up to modern codes. We&#8217;re going to have a much bigger opportunity by focusing on some not-so-sexy stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>Decarbonizing real estate can also make a huge difference in the fight against global climate change. &#8220;Real estate consumes 40% of all energy. The global economy happens indoors,&#8221; said Wallace. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate will be the biggest spender on climate tech for no other reason than its contribution to the carbon problem.&#8221; </span></p>
