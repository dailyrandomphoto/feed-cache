										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“There are three common blunders that most SaaS marketers make time and again when it comes to clarity and high-converting content,” says Konrad Sanders, founder and CEO of The Creative Copywriter, “1. Not differentiating from competitors. 2. Not humanizing &#8216;tech talk.&#8217; 3. Not tuning their messaging to prospects’ stage of awareness at the appropriate stage of the funnel.”</p>
<p>In an oversaturated market, how can you differentiate yourself? This week in marketing, Sanders took the time to answer that, break down B2B SaaS marketing, and tell us how marketers can do it right. Anna Heim, Extra Crunch daily reporter, interviewed Robert Katai, a Romanian marketing expert, as part of our TechCrunch Experts series. If there’s a growth marketer that you think we should know about, fill out our <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">survey</a> and tell us why!</p>

<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“Exceptional SEO expertise. My e-comm startup relies 100% on SEO traffic and three years ago we were delisted from Google because we didn&#8217;t understand about duple content. One Net fixed our site and optimized it for Google, which allowed us to get back into the SERPs. Bottom line is: They saved our business.”</p>

<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“Natalia is someone with an out-of-the-box approach to growth drivers and experimentation, full of creative solutions and many ideas that she quickly tests through experimentation. Rather than focusing on one area, she tries to verify what makes the most sense to a business and designs experiments that are crucial not only short but also long term. She is an ethical growth manager, likes to know that the business brings real value and is ready to pivot in every direction, [which] she does fast, however, with a focus on the team&#8217;s well-being, professional growth and always avoiding burnout.”</p>

He dove into what SaaS marketers are getting wrong, how to stand out in the crowded industry and the importance of how to approach each section of your funnel. Sanders says, “By creating content for every stage of the funnel, you’ll address your prospects’ concerns at the appropriate point in the buyer journey and increase the chances that when they do come to make a purchase, it’s with you.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Friday, August 27, 2021. What a week! In the last 24 hours we’ve had big news from around the world, including China’s latest regulatory push, Apple making modest concessions regarding the App Store and, of course, startup news aplenty.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/canva-ceo-melanie-perkins-will-tell-us-about-the-journey-to-a-15b-valuation-at-disrupt/">Canva CEO Melanie Perkins is coming to Disrupt</a>. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/china-proposes-strict-control-of-algorithms/">China to crack down on algorithms:</a> </strong>The push to more closely regulate and control China’s domestic technology market continued Friday with a government body announcing a draft set of rules for algorithms. The new rules come as China seeks to limit corporate data collection and more. Irony, of course, is dead.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/corporate-venture-capital-follows-the-same-trend-as-other-vc-markets-up/">Corporations can’t get enough startup equity:</a></strong> That’s our takeaway from digging into the recent, record results from the corporate venture capital (CVC) world. CVCs are taking part in more, bigger startup funding rounds. We dug into the why and the how of the latest data.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/"><strong>Apple makes smallest App Store concession:</strong></a> Per a settlement today, TechCrunch reports that Apple will now allow apps to “share information on how to pay for purchases outside of their iOS app or the App Store.” Apple called the change a clarification, which was interesting. Apple’s grip on the App Store is still tight, but we may be seeing indicators that its hold is slipping modestly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Up top, let’s talk about a16z, the venture capital conglomerate. Sure, it has crypto funds and main funds and other funds aplenty. But today the group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/andreessen-horowitz-just-rolled-out-a-400-million-fund-thats-expressly-for-seed-deals/">announced a $400 million capital pool just for seed deals</a>. The fund size indicates that a16z is either expecting to pay lots for seed equity or that it is going to make a host of bets. We’ll see.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/electric-vehicle-company-rivian-has-confidentially-filed-for-an-ipo/"><strong>Rivian files to go public:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In case you were looking for yet another EV company to add to your personal investments, good news! Rivian has filed privately to go public! Frankly, we&#8217;re excited by this deal; Lordstown this is not. The company recently closed $2.5 billion in external capital, bringing it to more than $10 billion in total. We want to know what all that funding has bought the firm in terms of results.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/forbes-jumps-into-hot-media-liquidity-summer-with-a-spac-combo/">Forbes is also going public:</a></strong> Via a SPAC, we should note, but yes, Forbes the media-and-magazine company is taking advantage of the boom in blank-check combinations to take itself public. We dug into its deck to see what the company has coming up and how heavily COVID-19 impacted its results.</li>
<li>Toast is also going public, but your humble servant failed to get a post up on the matter by the time it was newsletter o’clock. More to come on TechCrunch.com.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/zeal-banks-13m-to-offer-employers-a-build-your-own-payroll-product-infrastructure/"><strong>Payroll API startup Zeal raises Series A:</strong></a> The embedded fintech space is busy, and competitive, which makes what Zeal is building rather interesting. Is there a big enough market for just a payroll API product? A few years ago I would have quibbled, but if the OKR startup world has taught me anything, it’s to not underestimate how much demand there is in the world for software.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/as-5g-demand-grows-sitenna-helps-telcos-find-more-cell-tower-locations-faster/"><strong>Sitenna wants to help telcos place 5G antennas:</strong></a> Coming in the next batch of Y Combinator-backed startups, Sitenna is looking for a piece of the capital wave that will push 5G mobile connectivity into our lives. The startup is neat, so read the post, but also keep in mind that demo day for YC is next week, so we’re heading into a very heavy news cycle over the next few days.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/sastrify-snags-7m-to-help-smes-manage-saas-buying/">Sastrify raises $7M:</a> </strong>Based in Cologne, Sastrify wants to help companies buy and manage their SaaS spend. Why does the world need this? Well, now that all software is a subscription fee, not overpaying and generally knowing what one is paying for is a big deal. And big deals plus some founder work equals a startup. Notably, Sastrify is already cash-flow-positive despite its youth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The pre-pitch: 7 ways to build relationships with VCs</h2>
<p>Many founders must overcome a few emotional hurdles before they&#8217;re comfortable pitching a potential investor face-to-face.</p>
<p>To alleviate that pressure, Unicorn Capital founder Evan Fisher recommends that entrepreneurs use pre-pitch meetings to build and strengthen relationships before asking for a check:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the &#8216;we actually aren’t looking for money; we just want to be friends for now&#8217; pitch that gets you on an investor’s radar so that when it’s time to raise your next round, they’ll be far more likely to answer the phone because they actually know who you are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pre-pitches are good for more than curing the jitters: These conversations help founders get a better sense of how VCs think and sometimes lead to serendipitous outcomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors are opportunists by necessity,&#8221; says Fisher, &#8220;so if they like the cut of your business’s jib, you never know — the FOMO might start kicking hard.&#8221;</p>

Well, your share price goes down, and you hope that Monday will wind up much better than how Friday went.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/tesla-wants-to-sell-electricity-in-texas/"><strong>Tesla wants to sell power:</strong></a> This is a fun one.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has banned the popular ‘milk crate challenge’ from its platform due to concerns that users participating in the trend could be seriously injured. The challenge saw TikTok users stacking milk crates into a pyramid and then attempting to climb across the unstable structure.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from the company told TechCrunch in an email that &#8220;TikTok prohibits content that promotes or glorifies dangerous acts, and we remove videos and redirect searches to our Community Guidelines to discourage such content. We encourage everyone to exercise caution in their behavior whether online or off.”</p>
<p>In most videos depicting the trend, TikTok users are seen tumbling to the ground as they try to climb up one side of the makeshift pyramid and down the other. The ban comes after several healthcare workers took to social media to voice their concerns about the trend and the danger it poses to those participating in it.</p>
<p>Searching for the<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=milkcratechallenge&amp;lang=en"> trend’s hashtag on the app</a> now brings up a “no results found” notice. The search results page notifies users that “this phrase may be associated with behavior or content that violates our guidelines. Promoting a safe and positive experience is TikTok&#8217;s top priority.” However, some videos depicting the trend are still visible on the app if users search for incorrect spellings of keywords associated with the challenge, such as ‘milk craate’ or ‘milk cratee.’ It’s worth noting that although these videos don’t have a significant amount of views, they&#8217;ve still managed to slip through the cracks of the ban and remain on the app.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s rise to popularity has seen numerous dangerous challenges go viral on the platform over the past few years. In 2019, a popular &#8216;throw it in the air&#8217; trend involved TikTok users forming a circle where nobody is allowed to move and then putting a phone on the floor to record them throwing an item up in the air on top of themselves to see who the object hits on its way down. Last year, a popular &#8216;skull-breaker&#8217; trend that went viral on the app <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/04/tiktok-challenge-skull-breaker/">prompted criminal charges</a> after a teen was hospitalized as a result of the challenge. The trend involved tricking a person to fall backwards on their head.</p>
<p>Dangerous trends like these, including the most recent milk crate challenge, have forced TikTok to take action to prevent its users from putting themselves in harmful situations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Forget what you&#8217;ve heard: There are <em>many</em> shortcuts to success.</p>
<p>Tapping into someone else&#8217;s experience is a tried-and-true method, which is why two-time Y Combinator participant Chris Morton wrote a guest post for Extra Crunch with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/you-cant-hack-your-yc-application-but-heres-what-to-avoid/">advice for founders hoping to be accepted</a> by the famed accelerator.</p>
<p>Morton, who has also reviewed thousands of YC applications, shares his thoughts on when to submit an application, what to do if you miss the deadline and whether you&#8217;ll need to relocate if accepted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember that your application should be good enough to get an interview, not win a prize,&#8221; says Morton. &#8220;Go back to work instead of spending more time perfecting an application.”</p>

<p>In an interview with reporter Anna Heim, Romania-based marketer Robert Katai discussed some of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/romanian-marketing-expert-robert-katai-explains-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-content/">the methods he uses to help clients refine their content and branding strategies</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, content creation is free — everybody can do it. The hard part is how you distribute and amplify that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Katai also shared his impressions of Romania&#8217;s startup ecosystem, suggestions for maintaining top-of-mind status with customers, and reinforced the often-overlooked need to continually repurpose content to grab mindshare.</p>
<p>Like our other growth marketing interviews, there&#8217;s no paywall.</p>

<p>Latin America&#8217;s increasingly dynamic venture capital scene has been making headlines of late. To learn more about why investors are so enthusiastic, senior reporter Mary Ann Azevedo spoke to several who are actively engaged with the region:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shu Nyatta, managing partner, SoftBank</li>
<li>Ethan Choi, partner, Accel</li>
<li>Julie Ruvolo, director of venture capital, LAVCA</li>
<li>Bill Cilluffo, partner, QED Investors</li>
<li>Ana Cristina Gadala-Maria, principal, QED Investors</li>
<li>Ross Darwin, principal, Owl Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>“I am not surprised by all the activity,” Mary Ann writes. “However, I am a bit taken aback by the sheer number of rounds, the caliber of firms leading them and the sky-high valuations.</p>
<p>“It seems that the region is finally, and deservedly, being taken seriously. This is likely just the beginning.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Corporations are not remaining on the sidelines of the fiery 2021 venture capital game, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim note in The Exchange.</p>
<p>After parsing data from CB Insights and Stryber and chatting with a handful of investors, Alex and Anna concluded that the corporate venture capital market looks a lot like other VC markets.</p>
<p>“Perhaps this should not be a surprise,” they write. “We’ve seen non-venture funds flow into the later stages of startup land, pushing VCs toward earlier-stage and more venture-y deals. Why would CVCs be immune to the same trend?”</p>

<p>Corporate spending management startup Brex raised a $300 million Series C and acquired Buyer just a week after rival Brex announced it had acquired Israeli fintech Weav.</p>
<p>Ryan Lawler and Alex Wilhelm dug into the Ramp-Brex rivalry, and what those acquisitions say about their diverging strategies.</p>
<p>“From a high level, all of the recent deal-making in corporate cards and spend management shows that it’s not enough to just help companies track what employees are expensing these days,” they write.</p>
<p>“As the market matures and feature sets begin to converge, the players are seeking to differentiate themselves from the competition.”</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim interviewed VCs and corralled data to present a detailed picture of Boston&#8217;s startup funding scene.</p>
<p>“Boston is benefiting from larger structural changes to at least the U.S. venture capital market, helping close historical gaps in its startup funding market and access funds that previously might have skipped the region,” they write.</p>
<p>“And local university density isn’t hurting the city’s cause, either, boosting its ability to form new companies during a period of rich investment access.”</p>

<p>Half of the companies offering instant grocery delivery in Europe were founded last year as the pandemic reshaped most aspects of our existence.</p>
<p>To date, they&#8217;ve raised about $2 billion, but Picus Capital&#8217;s Alexander Kremer says startup lessons from China suggest that “instant delivery is not the magic bullet to crack the dominance” of old-school grocery players.</p>
<p>“If the performance of online grocery platforms in China (a market five to seven years ahead of Europe in terms of online retail) is anything to go by, a range of B2C business models would be more likely to displace the traditional grocery retailers.”</p>

<p>For The Exchange, Alex Wilhelm examines the S-1 filing from Warby Parker, “a consumer hardware company with two main sales channels, largely attractive economics, falling losses and rising adjusted profitability. You could even argue that it handled the pandemic well, despite COVID-19’s negative impact on its operations.”</p>
<p>But how are its growth prospects?</p>

<p><strong>I received a conditional green card after my wife and I got married in 2019. Recently, we have made the difficult decision to end our marriage. I want to continue living and working in the United States.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is it still possible for me to complete my green card based on my marriage through the I-751 process or do I need to do something else, like ask my employer to sponsor me for a work visa?</strong></p>

<p>Marketing automation can help boost key metrics, but it can also be a disservice to brands by perpetually devaluing goods and services, ShareThis’ Michael Gorman writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>Companies with a narrow focus on driving conversions are missing the bigger picture: AI can help create richer experiences that identify consumer actions and intent while also improving customer experiences.</p>
<p>“We live in a world rich with data, and insights are growing more vibrant every day,” he writes.</p>

<p>Fintech startups based in Israel raised more than $1.8 billion in 2019, but in Q1 2021, companies in the category raised $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Facilitating a wide range of services, more than a dozen fintech unicorns have already emerged in a country that has a population slightly smaller than Los Angeles County, many of them started by entrepreneurs who lacked financial backgrounds.</p>

<p>Technical jargon is one of the most annoying aspects of technology marketing.</p>
<p>Sadly, it tends to perpetuate itself: Marketers are terrified of making a wrong move, so they tend to copy what everyone else is doing.</p>
<p>If you want to attract customers and drive higher conversions, cut the jargon.</p>
<p>“Do everything you can to be immediately understood and you’ll have a much better chance of cutting through the noise and pushing clear and persuasive benefits in a way no prospect can resist,” advises Konrad Sanders, CEO of The Creative Copywriter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Linux is set for a big release this Sunday August 29, setting the stage for enterprise and cloud applications for months to come. The 5.14 kernel update will include security and performance improvements.</p>
<p>A particular area of interest for both enterprise and cloud users is always security and to that end, Linux 5.14 will help with several new capabilities. Mike McGrath, vice president, Linux Engineering at Red Hat told TechCrunch that the kernel update includes a feature known as core scheduling, which is intended to help mitigate processor-level vulnerabilities like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/03/kernel-panic-what-are-meltdown-and-spectre-the-bugs-affecting-nearly-every-computer-and-device/"> Spectre and Meltdown</a>, which first surfaced in 2018. One of the ways that Linux users have had to mitigate those vulnerabilities is by disabling hyper-threading on CPUs and therefore taking a performance hit.</p>
<p>&#8220;More specifically, the feature helps to split trusted and untrusted tasks so that they don’t share a core, limiting the overall threat surface while keeping cloud-scale performance relatively unchanged,&#8221; McGrath explained.</p>
<p>Another area of security innovation in Linux 5.14 is a feature that has been in development for over a year and a half that will help to protect system memory in a better way than before. Attacks against Linux and other operating systems often target memory as a primary attack surface to exploit. With the new kernel, there is a capability known as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28241033">memfd_secret ()</a> that will enable an application running on a Linux system to create a memory range that is inaccessible to anyone else, including the kernel.</p>
<p>&#8220;This means cryptographic keys, sensitive data and other secrets can be stored there to limit exposure to other users or system activities,&#8221; McGrath said.</p>
<p>At the heart of the open source Linux operating system that powers much of the cloud and enterprise application delivery is what is known as the Linux kernel. The kernel is the component that provides the core functionality for system operations.</p>
<p>The Linux 5.14 kernel release has gone through seven release candidates over the last two months and benefits from the contributions of 1,650 different developers. Those that contribute to Linux kernel development include individual contributors, as well as large vendors like Intel, AMD, IBM, Oracle and Samsung. One of the largest contributors to any given Linux kernel release is IBM&#8217;s Red Hat business unit. IBM <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/">acquired</a> Red Hat for $34 billion in a deal that closed in 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;As with pretty much every kernel release, we see some very innovative capabilities in 5.14,&#8221; McGrath said.</p>
<p>While Linux 5.14 will be out soon, it often takes time until it is adopted inside of enterprise releases. McGrath said that Linux 5.14 will first appear in Red Hat&#8217;s Fedora community Linux distribution and will be a part of the future Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 release. Gerald Pfeifer, CTO for enterprise Linux vendor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/suse-is-once-again-an-independent-company/">SUSE</a>, told TechCrunch that his company&#8217;s openSUSE Tumbleweed community release will likely include the Linux 5.14 kernel within &#8220;days&#8221; of the official release. On the enterprise side, he noted that SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP4, due next spring, is scheduled to come with the 5.14 kernel.</p>
<p>The new Linux update follows a major milestone for the open source operating system, as it was 30 years ago this past Wednesday that creator Linus Torvalds (pictured above) first publicly announced the effort. Over that time Linux has gone from being a hobbyist effort to powering the infrastructure of the internet.</p>
<p>McGrath commented that Linux is already the backbone for the modern cloud and Red Hat is also excited about how Linux will be the backbone for edge computing — not just within telecommunications, but broadly across all industries, from manufacturing and healthcare to entertainment and service providers, in the years to come.</p>
<p>The longevity and continued importance of Linux for the next 30 years is assured in Pfeifer&#8217;s view. He noted that over the decades Linux and open source have opened up unprecedented potential for innovation, coupled with openness and independence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will Linux, the kernel, still be the leader in 30 years? I don&#8217;t know. Will it be relevant? Absolutely,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Many of the approaches we have created and developed will still be pillars of technological progress 30 years from now. Of that I am certain.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Most founders fall into an extremely common trap: Just because you produced outstanding results for the last round of investors doesn&#8217;t mean new investors will believe you. This new cohort hasn’t seen that performance firsthand, and they have no reason to trust you yet.</p>
<p>As a founder approaching your next round, it&#8217;s common to wonder, &#8220;How do I get this new group of investors to trust that I will perform?&#8221;</p>
<p>In our experience, founders who fundraise successfully are great at building relationships, and they usually deliver what we call &#8220;the pre-pitch.&#8221; This is the &#8220;we actually aren’t looking for money; we just want to be friends for now&#8221; pitch that gets you on an investor’s radar so that when it’s time to raise your next round, they’ll be far more likely to answer the phone because they actually know who you are.</p>
<p>But the concept of the pre-pitch goes deeper than just having potential investors be aware of your existence. Building relationships with potential future investors requires you to think less like a founder and more like a marketer — much of the relationship heavy lifting comes long before it’s time to ask for a capital commitment.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If an investor has made a deal in your space, there’s a good chance they know an earlier-round investor who could potentially be a good fit for you today.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>There’s a host of advantages to the pre-pitch approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good practice: You’re not asking for money. Instead, you’re offering a sneak peek. Since your relationship-builder pre-pitch doesn’t have millions on the line, you’ll invariably be less anxious, which leads to better relationships. Remember: If it’s not a good fit, who cares?</li>
<li>Candid feedback: When you’re not asking for money, you’re more likely to receive honest feedback that you might not get in a high-stakes environment.</li>
<li>Set the baseline: You should go over where you’re currently at, why it’s actually not time to raise capital quite yet (the inverse of “Why Now”), and what you still have to accomplish until the time is right.</li>
<li>Performance-based trust: Put your performance where your mouth is by showing your potential investor where you are today and what you expect to do in the short term. Later on, you can prove to them that you achieved what you said you would.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7 ways to build relationships with VCs</h2>
<p>Now you’re probably wondering, &#8220;What the heck do I say to build a good relationship with that next-round investor?&#8221; Here are a few notes on how to approach the pre-pitch:</p>
<h3>Seek the relationship, not the money</h3>
<p>Acknowledge you’re early, but mention that you think it could potentially be a good fit later on. State it up front that you’re seeking a relationship and want to find out if you could eventually be a good fit for one another. Don’t sneak in an ask; let the relationship blossom organically.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example: &#8220;We’re actually not raising yet, and we’re probably too early for you. But I think this is something you might be very interested in, and thought it made sense to reach out, open up a relationship and see if there might be a fit.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of September 18, Microsoft is discontinuing support for Office (which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Outlook) on Chromebook. Microsoft is not, however, abandoning the popular mobile device altogether. Instead of an app that is downloaded, Microsoft is encouraging users to go to the web instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In an effort to provide the most optimized experience for Chromebook customers, Microsoft apps (Office and Outlook) will be transitioned to web experiences (Office.com and Outlook.com) on September 18, 2021,&#8221; Microsoft wrote in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft&#8217;s statement also noted that &#8220;this transition brings Chromebook customers access to additional and premium features.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Microsoft web experience will serve to transition its base of Chromebook users to the Microsoft 365 service, which provides more Office templates and generally more functionality than what the app-based approach provides. The web approach is also more optimized for larger screens than the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of how Microsoft wants Chromebook users to get access to Office and Outlook, the plan is for customers to, &#8220;&#8230;sign in with their personal Microsoft Account or account associated with their Microsoft 365 subscription,&#8221; according to the statement. Microsoft has also provided</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-install-and-run-microsoft-office-on-a-chromebook-32f14a23-2c1a-4579-b973-d4b1d78561ad"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">online documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to show users how to run Office on a Chromebook.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chromebooks run on Google&#8217;s Chrome OS, which is a Linux-based operating system. Chromebooks also enable Android apps to run, as Android is also Linux based, with apps downloaded from Google Play. It&#8217;s important to note that while support for Chromebooks is going away, Microsoft is not abandoning other Android-based mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those Chromebook users that have already downloaded the Microsoft Office apps, the apps will continue to function after September 18, though they will not receive any support or future updates. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With more than 270,000 stickers, Stipop&#8217;s library of colorful, character-driven expressions has a little something for everyone.</p>
<p>The company offers keyboard and social app stickers through ad-supported mobile apps on iOS and Android, but it&#8217;s recently focused more on providing stickers to developers, creators and other online businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to gather so many artists because we actually began as our own app that provided stickers,&#8221; <a href="https://stipop.io/">Stipop</a> co-founder Tony Park told TechCrunch. The team took what they learned from running their own consumer-facing app — namely that collecting and licensing hundreds of thousands of stickers from artists around the world is hard work — and adapted their business to help solve that problem for others.</p>
<p>Stipop was the first Korean company to go through Yellow, Snapchat&#8217;s exclusive accelerator. The company is also part of Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 cohort.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1RFqmpYo3I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Stipop&#8217;s sticker library is accessible through an SDK and an API, letting developers slot the searchable sticker library into their existing software. The company already has more than 200 companies that tap into its huge sticker trove, which offers a &#8220;single-day solution&#8221; for a process that would otherwise necessitate a lot more legwork. Stipop launched a <a href="https://developers.stipop.io/">website</a> recently that helps developers integrate its SDK and API through quick installs.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can just add a single line of code inside their product and will have a fully customized sticker feature [so] users will be able to spice up their chats,&#8221; Park said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Park points out that stickers encourage engagement — and for social software, engagement means growth. Stickers are a playful way to send characters back and forth in chat, but they also pop up in a number of other less obvious spots, from dating apps to e-commerce and ridesharing apps. Stipop even drives the sticker search in work collaboration software Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>The company has already partnered with Google, which uses Stipop&#8217;s sticker library in Gboard, Android Messages and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/google-acquires-gif-platform-tenor/">Tenor</a>, a GIF keyboard platform that Google bought in 2018. That partnership drove 600 million sticker views within the first month. A new partnership between Stipop and Coca-Cola on the near horizon will add Coke-branded stickers to its sticker library and the company is <a href="https://stipop.io/brands">opening its doors to more brands</a> that understand the unique appeal of stickers in messaging apps.</p>
<p>Park says that people tend to compare stickers and gifs, two ways of wordlessly expressing emotion and social nuance, but stickers are a world unto themselves. Stickers exist in their own creative universe, with star artists, regional themes and original casts of characters that take on a life of their own among fans. &#8220;Sticker creators have their own profession,&#8221; Park said.</p>
<p>Visual artists can also find a lot of traction releasing stickers, even without sophisticated illustrations. And since they&#8217;re all about meaning rather than refinement, non-designers and less skilled artists can craft hit stickers too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stickers are great for them because it [is] so easy to go viral,&#8221; Park said. The company has partnered with 8,000 sticker creators across 25 languages, helping those artists monetize their creations and generate income based on how many times a sticker is shared.</p>
<p>Stickers command their own visual language around the world, and Park has observed interesting cultural differences in how people use them to communicate. In the West, stickers are often used in place of text, but in Asia, where they&#8217;re used much more frequently, people usually send stickers to enhance rather than replace the meaning of text.</p>
<p>In East Asia, users tend to prefer simple black and white stickers, but in India and Saudi Arabia, bright, golden stickers top the trends. In South America, popular stickers take on a more pixelated, unique quality that resonates culturally there.</p>
<p>&#8220;With stickers, you fall in love with [the] characters you send&#8230; that becomes you,&#8221; Park said.</p>

<p>A Harvard Business Review study found that <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/11/9-out-of-10-people-are-willing-to-earn-less-money-to-do-more-meaningful-work">knowledge workers are more fulfilled</a> when they understand what organizations are trying to achieve and how their work lifts up their workplaces as a whole. In other words, meaning motivates your digital workforce.</p>
<p>On the surface, communicating your organization’s overarching mission, its reason for being, seems like a simple enough task. But I challenge you to ask each one of your team members to define your organization’s mission. If you have 10 employees, I bet you get nine or 10 different answers.</p>
<p>Instead of expecting employees to find your organization’s mission and vision on PowerPoint decks or on the website’s “about us” page, use the proven objectives and key results (OKRs) methodology.</p>
<p>The next piece of the puzzle helps you raise the visibility around <em>why</em> your employees are doing what they’re doing every day and creates a culture of motivation through meaning. Collaborate with your employees to create individual OKRs that identify goals and metrics for achievement. These OKRs should detail exactly how each employee contributes to the organization’s success and become the impetus behind<em> everything </em>an employee does.</p>
<p>I tell my workforce to review their OKRs every morning to help them focus on what’s important. It is like daily meditation for your business. So I didn’t worry when my director of marketing recently moved and had a baby. Because we had worked together to set thoughtful OKRs, my team member’s objectives and results were well defined. She knew where to focus her limited time. No distractions from the cacophony of requests. No anxiety over letting down her team. Just peace of mind that she was focusing on the right tasks.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The design space has undergone major changes in the last decade. What once was dominated by a single player in Adobe has now become a burgeoning software landscape, with a handful of major players answering the needs of designers across every industry.</p>
<p>One such player is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/canva/">Canva</a>, the startup valued at over $15 billion. The company started out with a consumer-facing product, making design accessible to non-designers. But on the back of launching an enterprise-centric suite of tools, the growth of Sydney-based Canva has been staggering.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Canva co-founder and CEO Melanie Perkins join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt (Sept 21-23)</a> for a fireside chat.</p>
<p>Since launching the company in 2013, Perkins has led its growth to now see more than 55 million users each month, ranging from individual creators to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to Perkins about how she shifted the company from individual creators to a B2B platform, what it&#8217;s like to run an industry-specific startup in the midst of a fundamental evolution — see: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/design-may-be-the-next-entrepreneurial-gold-rush/">Design may be the next entrepreneurial gold rush</a> — and how she&#8217;s handled this period of monumental growth for the company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’ve seen non-venture funds flow into the later stages of startup land, pushing VCs toward earlier-stage and more venture-y deals. Why would CVCs be immune to the same trend?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the global market for startup investing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">presses to new heights in terms of dollars invested this year</a>, and deal volume ticks up in several regions, corporations are diving into the action.</p>
<p>Data from <a href="http://cbinsights.com">CB Insights</a> and <a href="https://stryber.com/">Stryber</a> indicate that corporate investors are taking part in deals worth more than ever, even if corporate venture capital (CVC) deal activity is not up uniformly around the world.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>In a sense, it’s not surprising that CVCs are seeing the deals that they participate in rising in size &#8212; the global venture capital market has trended toward larger deals and more dollars for some time now. But questions lie inside the eye-popping figures: How are corporate investors adapting to a more rapid-fire and expensive venture capital market? We also wanted to know if CVCs are shaking up their deal sourcing, and whether the classic corporate venture tension between strategic investing and deploying capital for financial return is seeing a focus mix shift.</p>

(TechCrunch last covered CVC outfit WIND Ventures <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/wind-ventures-gears-up-to-invest-in-startups-looking-at-latin-america/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Let’s talk data and then dig into the nuance behind the numbers.</p>
<h2>A boom in deal value</h2>
<p>Precisely measuring CVC activity is interestingly difficult. When we discuss the value of venture capital deals, for example, what counts and what doesn’t is a matter of taste. For example, how to treat the SoftBank Vision Fund. Do deals that it leads that include venture capital participation count toward larger VC activity for a given period of time? What about investments led by crossover funds?</p>
<p>No matter what you choose, aggregate venture capital data will always include dollars invested by non-venture entities. So you do the best you can. CVC has the same problem, amplified. Because CVCs are often participatory to deals, instead of leading them, especially in the later stages of startup investing today, tallying concrete corporate venture investment is difficult. So we proceed in the same manner as we do with aggregate venture data counting, including deals that a particular investor type participated in.</p>
<p>Perfect, no. But it’s consistent, which is what we likely care about more. All that’s to say that when we observe the following deal and dollar data, CB Insights notes plainly that for its purposes, “‘CVC-backed funding’ and ‘CVC-backed deals’ refer to corporate venture capital participation in these funding rounds.”</p>
<p>Fair enough. Per <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/corporate-venture-capital-trends-h1-2021">CB Insights&#8217; H1 2021 CVC report</a>, CVCs participated in $78.7 billion in funding activity in the first half of 2021, a record for a half-year period. That dollar figure was derived from some 2,099 deals around the world. Precisely how strong those figures are is not clear from their absolute scale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk’s Tesla is looking beyond electric vehicles, solar panels and energy storage and wants to now supply electricity directly to customers, according to an application filed with Texas electricity regulators earlier this month. <a href="http://www.energychoicematters.com/stories/20210816z.html">Energy Choice Matters</a> first reported on the application.</p>
<p><a href="http://interchange.puc.texas.gov/Documents/52431_1_1147491.PDF">The application</a>, filed with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas on August 16, is a request to become what’s called a “retail electric provider” (REP) under its subsidiary Tesla Energy Ventures. On the deregulated, idiosyncratic Texas power market, REPs generally purchase wholesale electricity from power generators and sell it to customers. More than 100 REPs currently compete on the open market.</p>
<p>The company also filed separate applications for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/teslas-utility-scale-batteries-are-coming-to-texas/">several utility-scale batteries</a> in the Lone Star state: a 250-megawatt battery situated near its Gigafactory outside Austin, and a 100 MW separate project outside Houston. These projects are unrelated to the company’s efforts to become an electric provider, but taken as a whole, they reveal an ambitious roadmap for Tesla’s energy businesses.</p>
<p>Imagine: Tesla could not only sell electricity to customers, but it could also broker customers selling their excess energy &#8212; generated from Tesla Powerwall or Solar panel products, of course &#8212; back to the grid. It’s certainly one way to fulfill Musk’s vision of turning every home into a distributed power plant.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The latest request to the PUC comes just six months after an unprecedented winter storm shut down large parts of Texas’ power grid for days, leaving millions without power during a string of sub-freezing days. A handful of REPs shut down after the storm, which jammed wholesale electricity prices up to $9,000 per megawatt-hour (the seasonal average is around $50).</p>
<p>Musk, who moved many operations to Texas from California, including SpaceX’s sprawling facility in Boca Chica, criticized the state’s grid operator on Twitter at the time:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">.<a href="https://twitter.com/ERCOT_ISO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ERCOT_ISO</a> is not earning that R</p>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1361962505573031938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p>He said the company was not “earning that R” – referring to the R in the acronym, which stands for Electric Reliability Council of Texas.</p>
<p>Tesla Energy Ventures told PUC regulators that it would use Tesla’s existing energy division to help drive sales, including leveraging the company’s mobile app and website. “Specifically, [Tesla Energy Ventures] will target its existing customers that own Tesla products and market the retail offer to customers through the mobile application and Tesla website,” the application says. “In addition to the Tesla mobile application and Tesla website, the applicant&#8217;s existing &#8216;Tesla Energy Customer Support&#8217; organization will be trained to provide support and guidance to customers in customer acquisition efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ana Stewart is listed as president of Tesla Energy Ventures. She’s been with Tesla since 2017 as the director of regulatory credit trading. Prior, she worked at Tesla-acquired SolarCity.</p>
<p>The application is listed under docket number 52431.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Tuesday, Peloton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/peloton-tread-arrives-next-week-with-enhanced-safety-features-following-recall/">announced</a> the upcoming release of its entry-level Tread device. The news came ahead of a disappointing earnings report and after recalls of both of its treadmill products. Today, the connected fitness company noted in a filing with the SEC that it has been subpoenaed by both the U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Both subpoenas are part of investigations around the way the company reported injuries from its treadmills. It’s seemingly another sign that, in spite of the return of one of its two Tread products to market, the larger implications are far from over for the company.</p>
<p>Peloton writes <a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/d84f3085-8c04-45d0-b6ab-0550de50c7ad">in the filing:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Injuries sustained by Members or their friends and family members, or others who use or purchase our Connected Fitness Products, could subject us to regulatory proceedings and litigation by governance agencies and private litigants brought against us, that regardless of their merits, could harm our reputation, divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees and other costs. For example, we are presently subject to a CPSC investigation and other litigation related to injuries sustained by Members and others who use or purchase the Tread+, and we have reporting obligations to safety regulators in all jurisdictions where we sell Connected Fitness Products, where reporting may trigger further regulatory investigations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company declined to comment further on the investigations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Peloton was, notably, at odds with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)’s initial warning to stop using its treadmill products after an accident with the Tread+ resulted in a child’s death. At the time, Peloton said it was &#8220;troubled&#8221; by the reporting and insisted that &#8220;there is no reason to stop using the Tread+, as long as all warnings and safety instructions are followed.&#8221; In May, CEO John Foley apologized for the pushback and agreed to work with the CPSC on a recall.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Commission cited more than 70 incidents in all, noting, “a six-year-old child recently died after being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. In addition, Peloton has received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.”</p>
<p>The cheaper Tread model, meanwhile, was at the center of separate issue wherein the product’s touchscreen could detach and cause injury during use. The new version of the device features a reinforced screen. The recalls impacted around 125,000 Tread+ systems and more than 5,500 Treads, which were in early release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian, the electric vehicle startup backed by a host of institutional and strategic investors, including Ford and Amazon, has confidentially filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to go public.</p>
<p>The size and price range for the proposed offering have yet to be determined. The initial public offering is expected to take place after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions, the brief statement said.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The confidential filing comes less than two months since Rivian announced it had closed a $2.5 billion private funding round led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, D1 Capital Partners, Ford Motor and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Third Point, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Dragoneer Investment Group and Coatue also participated in that round.</p>

<p>The company did not share a post-money valuation at the time of the July 2021 announcement.</p>
<p>The electric automaker, which now employs 7,000 people, is preparing to deliver its R1T pickup truck in September. The road to produce the R1T and an accompanying SUV requires capital, which Rivian has had little trouble raising.</p>
<p>Rivian has raised roughly $10.5 billion to date. In January, the company brought in $2.65 billion from existing investors T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Fidelity Management and Research Company, Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund, Coatue and D1 Capital Partners. New investors also participated in that round, which pushed Rivian&#8217;s valuation to $27.6 billion, a source familiar with the investment round told TechCrunch at the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With so much startup activity in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) space it can be a challenge for businesses to figure out which of these SaaS (SaaSes?) are actually useful and worth continuing to shell out for. Well, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Cologne-based startup </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.sastrify.com">Sastrify</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> is here to help &#8212; offering what it describes as a &#8220;highly automated&#8221; platform (covering some 20,000+ SaaS solutions) to help other businesses with procurement and management of third-party services.</span></p>
<p>It may not sound the sexist startup business to be in, but despite only launching earlier this year, Sastrify is already cash-flow positive &#8212; and can tout &#8220;a high six-digit recurring revenue&#8221; just a few months post-launch. Not bad for a startup that was only founded last summer.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Today it&#8217;s announcing closing a $7 million seed</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> round from HV Capital and the founders of FlixMobility, Personio and SumUp. </span>That follows a $1.3 million pre-seed raised back in late 2020, ahead of its launch.</p>
<p>Sastrify tells us it has around 50 customers at this stage &#8212; including &#8220;unicorn startups like Gorillas&#8221;. It says its approach works best for growing companies with 100+ employees, and is perhaps especially suited to European tech scale-ups.</p>
<p>On the competitive front the startup points to U.S.-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/vendr-raises-huge-60m-series-a-as-its-saas-purchasing-service-scales/"><span aria-invalid="spelling">Vendr</span></a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/tropic-picks-up-25m-to-streamline-software-procurement-experiences/">Tropic</a>, which may further explain the regional focus (although it&#8217;s not only selling in Europe).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uJlCAL4HgO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/vendr-raises-huge-60m-series-a-as-its-saas-purchasing-service-scales/">Vendr raises huge $60M Series A as its SaaS-purchasing service scales</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Vendr raises huge $60M Series A as its SaaS-purchasing service scales&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/vendr-raises-huge-60m-series-a-as-its-saas-purchasing-service-scales/embed/#?secret=uJlCAL4HgO" data-secret="uJlCAL4HgO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sastrify&#8217;s sales pitch to SMEs includes that current customers have seen an average 6.5x return on their investment &#8212; in addition to what it bills as &#8220;thousands of working hours&#8221; saved from &#8220;wasted&#8221; activities related to SaaS procurement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cost savings are another carrot &#8212; which the startup is claiming its customers are &#8220;typically&#8221; saving around 20-30% of their SaaS cost.</p>
<p>So how does it actually make it easier for businesses to navigate the pros &amp; cons of the smorgasbord of SaaS(es) now out there?</p>
<p>&#8220;Our main mantra is: &#8216;Effective procurement asks the right questions at the right time&#8217;,&#8221; says co-founder Sven Lackinger, who previously co-founded a SaaS startup himself of course (evopark), exiting that company back in 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;To ensure that we&#8217;ve defined and implemented a five-step process into our platform, covering the whole life-cycle of SaaS applications within enterprises. Our clients can search for the suitable SaaS solutions while we guide them through the right evaluation process per use case and tool (e.g. what are similar companies using?).</p>
<p>&#8220;We then take over the whole buying process, aka automatically reaching out to different vendors, AI-/OCR-based comparing and benchmarking for offers. Once the tool is implemented, we make sure to track usage frequently (via regular, automated surveys to tool owners) and re-evaluate over time so there is no ongoing waste of licenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a more automated platform [than Vendr and Tropic] and can also resell licenses to our customers directly (e.g. for Google, Microsoft and others) to ensure best prices and fast delivery,&#8221; he also tells us. &#8220;This allows us to offer a faster and cheaper solution which is more suited to the European market (where the average SaaS expense per company is still smaller than in the US).&#8221;<i> </i></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re outsourcing all this other stuff to SaaS providers, why not get a specialist service to stay on top of how you do that too, is the basic idea.</p>

<p>The 30-strong Sastrify team will be using the seed funding to accelerate sales, marketing and product dev so it can expand its SaaS management service to more companies in Europe and beyond.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Commenting on the funding in a statement, Jasper Masemann, partner at HV Capital, added: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“Cloud software adoption is massively accelerating and almost every company nowadays uses SaaS products but does not buy and manage them efficiently. Sastrify’s astonishing growth underlines the broad customer value the team has already created. It is early days but Sastrify could create an SAP Arriba with a payment solution for SMB – a massive market just in Europe.”</span></p>

<p><strong>You gotta pay to play:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">Buy your pass to Disrupt 2021 here</a> and open a door to opportunity.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about the special breakout sessions, which are hosted by our partners. These smaller sessions deliver real value and, according to attendee feedback, that holds true across all TechCrunch events.</p>
<blockquote><p>I enjoyed the big marquee speakers from companies like Uber, but it was the individual breakout presentations where you really started to get into the meat of the conversation and see how these mobile partnerships come to life. — Karin Maake, senior director of communications at FlashParking</p>
<p>There was always something interesting going on in one of the breakout sessions, and I was impressed by the quality of the people participating. Partners in well-known VC firms spoke, they were accessible, and they shared smart, insightful nuggets. You will not find this level of people accessible and in one place anywhere else. — Michael McCarthy, CEO of Repositax</p></blockquote>
<p>Now’s the time to start planning your <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">Disrupt 2021 schedule</a>, and you don’t want to miss out on these informative presentations.</p>
<h3>The Missing Block to Bring Crypto to the Masses</h3>
<p><em>With the emergence of concepts such as NFT and GameFi, socialization prosperities are bringing new energy to the crypto world. Known as the People’s Exchange, KuCoin is committed to exploring disruptive technologies and genius ideas to bring crypto closer to the masses. In this session, you will hear from KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu on what is the outlook of the evolving crypto market and how to achieve better trading experience for cryptocurrency investors. Brought to you by KuCoin.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Humanizing AI: How Brands Are Revolutionizing Customer Experience in an increasingly Digital World</h3>
<p><em>Empathy deficit is the largest imminent threat to a businesses’ growth, but there’s hope. Humanized AI is allowing brands to create empathetic customer experiences by offering uniquely personal interactions with digital people. But what is empathy, really? And how can it help brands and storytellers better connect with their audiences in a cookie-less world? Soul Machines’ co-founder and CBO Greg Cross explains how embracing AI could be just the competitive advantage your brand needs. Brought to you by Soul Machines.</em></p>
<h3>Revolutionizing the Global Metaverse Economy</h3>
<p><em>Together Labs is leveraging the power of blockchain technology to create the new metaverse economy where users can buy, sell, invest and shape its future. Earlier this year, Together Labs launched VCOIN, the first global, digital currency that can be used in and out of the metaverse. VCOIN makes it possible for users to play to earn real value and then convert that value to cash. Soon, Together Labs will introduce additional blockchain offerings to accelerate the transition to a complete blockchain economy, setting the economic model for other metaverses to follow. Brought to you by VCOIN.</em></p>
<h3>Securing Your journey to IPO from the start</h3>
<p><em>Without the right governance tools in place at a company’s inception, a business becomes susceptible to risks as it scales. Adopting governance practices early in a business’s growth process sets them up for long-term growth and a successful IPO. Hear leadership perspectives for securing your business growth in a time of rapid change. Brought to you by Diligent Corporation.</em></p>
<h3>You’ve Raised Your Seed Round — Now What? Preparing for Your Series A</h3>
<p><em>The first hurdle has been cleared: initial funding is in the bank. You’re hiring more talent, seeing the beginnings of a finished product with clear evidence of traction and experiencing the coveted growth that previously felt just out of reach. Before you know it, the decision to raise for what is arguably the most competitive round is staring you in the face. In this panel, join Samsung Next’s David Lee alongside founders Kadie Okwudili (Agapé), Andy Hoang (Aviron), and Jim Bugwadia (Nirmata) as they discuss the learnings and nuances of bridging seed to Series A. Brought to you by Samsung Next.</em></p>
<h3>Korea Pavilion Pitch Session &#8211; Hosted by KOTRA</h3>
<p><em>We present the 13 pioneering Korean companies that will enrich our lives with their innovative edge. The companies specialize in various technologies, including Green Tech, AR/VR, 3D Display, AI &amp; Big Data and Cybersecurity. Don&#8217;t miss your chance to catch a glimpse of ingenuity from the technology powerhouse. Brought to you by KOTRA.</em></p>
<h3>Eliminating Styrofoam Protective Packaging</h3>
<p><em>Over 380 million tons of plastic are produced every year and 50% of that is for single-use purposes such as product packaging. Until now, companies have been hard-pressed to find a replacement for Styrofoam for protecting fragile items like electronics and appliances. John Felts of Cruz Foam will discuss the development of bio-benign, compostable alternative materials. Tom Chi of At One Ventures will talk about the importance of investing in environmental and climate entrepreneurs. Moderator Scott Cassel of PSI will lead the discussion on how the packaging value chain can create a truly circular economy. Brought to you by Cruz Foam.</em></p>
<h3>Powering What’s Next: Insights from the Enterprise Software Market</h3>
<p><em>Spurred by digital transformation and the recent shift to remote work, the enterprise software industry has gone from strength-to-strength and competition for deals and valuations are at all-time highs. While investor appetite for enterprise software may be strong, it doesn’t mean that all tech businesses make worthy investments. In this panel, hear from Michael Fosnaugh and Monti Saroya, co-heads of Vista’s Flagship investment strategy, and a selection of Vista CEOs on the hallmarks of best-in-class software companies and trends driving the industry. Brought to you by Vista Equity Partners.</em></p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/venky-adivi-0a548b4/">Venky Adivi</a> is director of strategic capture and proposal management at <a href="https://canonical.com/"> Canonical</a>, publisher of Ubuntu.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In recent years, the private sector has been spurning proprietary software in favor of open source software and development approaches. For good reason: The open source avenue saves money and development time by using freely available components instead of writing new code, enables new applications to be deployed quickly and eliminates vendor lock-in.</p>
<p>The federal government has been slower to embrace open source, however. Efforts to change are complicated by the fact that many agencies employ large legacy IT infrastructure and systems to serve millions of people and are responsible for a plethora of sensitive data. Washington spends tens of billions every year on IT, but with each agency essentially acting as its own enterprise, decision-making is far more decentralized than it would be at, say, a large bank.</p>
<p>While the government has made a number of moves in a more open direction in recent years, the story of open source in federal IT has often seemed more about potential than reality.</p>
<p>But there are several indications that this is changing and that the government is reaching its own open source adoption tipping point. The costs of producing modern applications to serve increasingly digital-savvy citizens keep rising, and agencies are budget constrained to find ways to improve service while saving taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>Sheer economics dictate an increased role for open source, as do a variety of other benefits. Because its source code is publicly available, open source software encourages continuous review by others outside the initial development team to promote increased software reliability and security, and code can be easily shared for reuse by other agencies.</p>
<p>Here are five signs I see that the U.S. government is increasingly rallying around open source.</p>
<h2>More dedicated resources for open source innovation</h2>
<p>Two initiatives have gone a long way toward helping agencies advance their open source journeys.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>, a team within the General Services Administration that acts as consultancy to help other agencies build digital services, is an ardent open source backer. Its work has included developing a new application for accessing Federal Election Commission data, as well as software that has allowed the GSA to improve its contractor hiring process.</p>
<p>18F — short for GSA headquarters’ address of 1800 F St. — reflects the same grassroots ethos that helped spur open source’s emergence and momentum in the private sector. &#8220;The code we create belongs to the public as a part of the public domain,&#8221; the group says on its website.</p>
<p>Five years ago this August, the Obama administration introduced a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf">Federal Source Code Policy</a> that called on every agency to adopt an open source approach, create a source code inventory, and publish at least 20% of written code as open source. The administration also launched <a href="https://code.gov/#/">Code.gov</a>, giving agencies a place to locate open source solutions that other departments are already using.</p>
<p>The results have been mixed, however. Most agencies are now consistent with the federal policy’s goal, though many still have work to do in implementation, <a href="https://code.gov/agency-compliance/compliance/dashboard">according to</a> Code.gov’s tracker. And a <a href="https://github.com/GSA/code-gov/blob/master/docs/FederalSourceCodeStudy/FederalSourceCodeStudy.pdf">report</a> by a Code.gov staffer found that some agencies were embracing open source more than others.</p>
<p>Still, Code.gov says the growth of open source in the federal government has gone farther than initially estimated.</p>
<h2>A push from the new administration</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text">American Rescue Plan</a>, a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill that President Biden signed in early March 2021, contained $9 billion for the GSA’s <a href="https://tmf.cio.gov/">Technology Modernization Fund</a>, which finances new federal technology projects. In January, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/legislation/2021/01/20/president-biden-announces-american-rescue-plan/">said</a> upgrading federal IT infrastructure and addressing recent breaches such as the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/985439655/a-worst-nightmare-cyberattack-the-untold-story-of-the-solarwinds-hack">SolarWinds hack</a> was “an urgent national security issue that cannot wait.”</p>
<p>It’s fair to assume open source software will form the foundation of many of these efforts, because White House technology director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidrecordon/">David Recordon</a> is a long-time open source advocate and once led Facebook’s open source projects.</p>
<h2>A changing skills environment</h2>
<p>Federal IT employees who spent much of their careers working on legacy systems are starting to retire, and their successors are younger people who came of age in an open source world and are comfortable with it.</p>
<p>About 81% of private sector hiring managers <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OpenSourceJobsReport_2020_Final-1.pdf">surveyed</a> by the Linux Foundation said hiring open source talent is a priority and that they’re more likely than ever to seek out professionals with certifications. You can be sure the public sector is increasingly mirroring this trend as it recognizes a need for talent to support open source’s growing foothold.</p>
<h2>Stronger capabilities from vendors</h2>
<p>By partnering with the right commercial open source vendor, agencies can drive down infrastructure costs and more efficiently manage their applications. For example, vendors have made great strides in addressing security requirements laid out by policies such as the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act">Federal Security Security Modernization Act</a> (FISMA), <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/current-fips">Federal Information Processing Standards</a> (FIPS) and the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/">Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program</a> (FedRamp), making it easy to deal with compliance.</p>
<p>In addition, some vendors offer powerful infrastructure automation tools and generous support packages, so federal agencies don’t have to go it alone as they accelerate their open source strategies. Linux distributions like Ubuntu provide a consistent developer experience from laptop/workstation to the cloud, and at the edge, for public clouds, containers, and physical and virtual infrastructure.</p>
<p>This makes application development a well-supported activity that includes 24/7 phone and web support, which provides access to world-class enterprise support teams through web portals, knowledge bases or via phone.</p>
<h2>The pandemic effect</h2>
<p>Whether it’s accommodating more employees working from home or meeting higher citizen demand for online services, COVID-19 has forced large swaths of the federal government to up their digital game. Open source allows legacy applications to be moved to the cloud, new applications to be developed more quickly, and IT infrastructures to adapt to rapidly changing demands.</p>
<p>As these signs show, the federal government continues to move rapidly from talk to action in adopting open source.</p>
<p>Who wins? Everyone!</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> were joined by none other than TechCrunch&#8217;s own <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo</a>, in her first-ever appearance on the show. She&#8217;s pretty much the best person and we&#8217;re <em>stoked</em> to have her on the pod.</p>
<p>And it was good that Mary Ann was on the show this week as she wrote about half the dang site. Which meant that we got to include all sorts of her work in the rundown. Here&#8217;s the agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding rounds from: Ramp, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">raised $300 million at a $3.9 billion valuation</a>; NoRedInk, which put together <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/noredink-raises-50-million-series-b-to-help-students-become-better-writers/">an impressive $50 million Series B</a>; and Playbook, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/playbook-which-aims-to-be-the-dropbox-for-designers-raises-4m-in-round-led-by-founders-fund/">building a sort of Dropbox for designers</a>. Each company gave us something different to noodle on, be it the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-and-brex-draw-diverging-market-plans-with-ma-strategy/">diverging strategies at Ramp and Brex</a>, how NoRedInk is different from Grammarly, and why Dropbox is not the Dropbox for designers.</li>
<li>Then we spun the globe to narrow our focus to Latin America, a booming startup scene that Mary Ann <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/">recently profiled for Extra Crunch</a>. In a nutshell, venture capital is helping drive an enormous wave of startup activity in the region &#8212; or perhaps a wave of startup activity is driving a boom in venture investment? &#8212; leading to huge companies, and perhaps some tech-powered inclusion of more folks into the modern banking and digital economy. (For more, here are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/">notes on the Brazilian market&#8217;s rising exit tally</a>! And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/mexican-neobroker-flink-raises-57m-from-lightspeed-the-chainsmokers-to-boost-financial-inclusion-in-latam/">Flink raised</a>, which was worth chewing on as well.)</li>

<ul>
<li>We quickly pivoted to the hot-button issue of the moment for every startup (and business): hiring. Natasha noted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/workstreams-text-based-recruitment-tool-gets-a-48m-bet-from-bond-and-beyond/">how startups used to focus on runway</a>, and now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/how-to-hire-is-the-new-how-to-conserve-runway/">they are looking to fill empty seats amid the great resignation. </a></li>
<li>Finally, we nattered about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">huge venture results from Boston</a>, big numbers from Austin and what increasingly feels like an everything bubble.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The buildout of 5G networks continues apace, with wide-scale deployments across much of the developed world. Yet, one of the largest challenges with closing the gaps in coverage maps are constraints on 5G transmissions. Because of the spectrum that 5G technology uses compared to 4G, telecom operators need to install many times more towers to deliver the advertised bandwidth with the same quality signal that users expect.</p>
<p>Installing cell towers is a daunting proposition though. An operator has to find exactly the right location in terms of line of sight to users, then make sure the location has power and internet access, and then negotiate a contract with the property owner to keep the tower there for a decade or more. Now repeat tens of thousands of times (and maybe even more).</p>
<p><a href="https://sitenna.com">Sitenna</a>, which will debut next week as part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2021 Demo Day, wants to radically speed up the process of selecting tower sites and securing contracts, creating a marketplace for landlords, tower operators and telcos alike.</p>
<p>Tower siting and access to poles have in some cases emerged as national infrastructure priorities. In the United States, the challenges around installing new towers — and new towers quickly — became a top priority of the FCC during the Trump administration, which <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-354326A1.pdf">launched a 5G FAST Plan</a> to try to ease regulations around tower installation.</p>
<p>Sitenna’s founders Daniel Campion and Brian Sexton saw an opportunity with such programs to help with the movement. Over the past year, they have built out what is essentially a marketplace that on one hand helps property owners figure out if they have an asset that’s worth investigating for telecom usage, and on the other, helps tower operators select and digitally sign deals for installation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195013" style="width: 515px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195013" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2195013" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Daniel-Campion.jpg?w=505" alt="" width="505" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Daniel-Campion.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Daniel-Campion.jpg?resize=111,150 111w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Daniel-Campion.jpg?resize=223,300 223w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Daniel-Campion.jpg?resize=505,680 505w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Daniel-Campion.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195013" class="wp-caption-text">Sitenna co-founder and CEO Daniel Campion. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sitenna</p></div></p>
<p>The company launched in the United Kingdom in June, and “it kind of resonated,” Campion said, noting that 65,000 real estate assets and roughly 15% of the towers in the U.K. are now on the platform. The company has kicked off two pilots with Vodafone and its tower provider <a href="https://www.cornerstone.network">Cornerstone</a>. He said the company intends to enter the U.S. market in the first quarter of next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the company is starting with a marketplace, like many startups today, it is also augmenting that marketplace with B2B SaaS tools. In its case, that means tools for telcos to manage the process of onboarding a new tower location and then managing the asset. “Once they find the site, they ping pong emails back and forth,” Campion said. “So we have built some tools to help them on their workflows.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195011" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195011" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2195011" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="373" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png 1013w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195011" class="wp-caption-text">Sitenna&#8217;s platform allows landlords and tower operators to inspect and transact tower locations. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sitenna</p></div></p>
<p>While there is definitely a large wave of tower installations underway now with the transition to 5G wireless, that wave doesn’t mean that tower installation will suddenly dry up in a few years. Campion notes that there is a “continual refresh of 15-20% on the carrier side” due to everything from changing usage patterns and building redevelopment to just standard hardware replacement.</p>
<p>And of course, there is always 6G, which while completely amorphous today, is a real thing that I get invites to conferences for. There’s always going to be a next generation of wireless, and Sitenna wants to become the center for managing that infrastructure.</p>
