										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple didn&#8217;t announce that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?sref=gni836kR">rumored</a> combined Apple TV device that would combine the set-top box with a HomePod speaker during its WWDC keynote, but it did announce a few features that will improve the Apple TV experience &#8212; including one that involves a HomePod Mini. Starting this fall, Apple said you&#8217;ll be able to select the HomePod Mini as the speaker for your Apple TV 4K. It also introduced a handful of software updates for Apple TV users, including a new way to see shows everyone in the family will like, and support for co-watching shows through FaceTime.</p>
<p>The co-watching feature is actually a part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-facetime-updates-at-wwdc-2021/">larger FaceTime update</a>, which will let users stream music, TV, and screen share through their FaceTime calls. The Apple TV app is one of those that&#8217;s supported through this new system,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-introduces-shareplay-for-co-watching-streaming-and-screen-sharing-over-facetime/"> called SharePlay</a>. It will now include a new &#8220;Shared with You&#8221; row that highlights the shows and movies your friends are sharing, as well.</p>
<p>Another feature called &#8220;For All of You&#8221; will display a collection of shows and movies based on everyone&#8217;s interests within Apple TV&#8217;s interface. This is ideal you&#8217;re planning to watch something as a family &#8212; like for movie night, for example. And you can fine tune the suggestions based on who&#8217;s watching.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A new Apple TV widget is also being made available, which now includes iPad support.</p>
<p>And the new support for HomePod Mini will help deliver &#8220;rich, balanced sound&#8221; and &#8220;crystal clear dialog,&#8221; when you&#8217;re watching Apple TV with the Mii set up as your speakers, Apple said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has announced the next major version of macOS at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/wwdc-2021/">WWDC 2021</a> —&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-macos-12-monterey/">macOS Monterey</a>. Among other features, Apple is going to release Shortcuts on macOS. It’s going to look and work a lot like Shortcuts on iOS and iPadOS.</p>
<p>“The Mac has a long history of automation with command line, shell scripts, Apple scripts and Automator. And on iOS, we&#39;ve made automation even easier with Shortcuts,” SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said. “And this year we&#39;re bringing Shortcuts to the Mac.”</p>
<p>In the new Shortcuts app, you can see a gallery of popular shortcuts. It’s going to be interesting to see what exactly you can trigger with shortcuts, but you can expect to be able to launch apps, create GIFs, send a message, create an email, launch a website, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After that, you can trigger your shortcuts in the right column of the Finder, in the menubar and in Spotlight. You can also trigger them with Siri.</p>
<p>With this announcement, Apple is also setting the stage for the end of Automator. “This is just the start of a multi-year transition Automator will continue to be supported, and you can import Automator workflows into beginning one with shortcuts,” Federighi said.</p>
<p>If you read between the lines, it sounds like Apple doesn’t plan to add new features to Automator. Shortcuts is the future of automation on macOS, iOS and iPadOS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple kicked off its global annual developer conference, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/WWDC-2021/">WWDC</a>, with a ton of new features and technologies. TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/WWDC-2021/">all the coverage here</a> from the keynote. As with previous years, Apple has dropped a number of new security and privacy features.</p>
<h3>New privacy dashboard keeps tabs on app tracking requests</h3>
<p>Apple is bringing a new privacy dashboard to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-ios-15-with-new-features-for-facetime-and-better-notifications/">iOS 15</a> to make it easier to see which apps are collecting your data and when. It&#8217;s a continuation of Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">App Tracking Transparency feature</a> that it rolled out earlier this year to block apps from siphoning off and selling your data to advertisers and data brokers. In iOS 15, you will be able to see which apps you have given permission to access your data — such as your location, microphone, contacts, and photos — and how often it&#8217;s accessed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162495" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162495" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2162495" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg 2203w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=768,559 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=680,495 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=1536,1118 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=2048,1490 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162495" class="wp-caption-text">(Image: TechCrunch / screenshot)</p></div></p>
<h3>Mail will block invisible email trackers</h3>
<p>Emails are not as private as you might think. Most marketing emails contain hidden pixel-sized images that know when you&#8217;ve opened an email. These trackers also collect information about you, including your IP address, which can be used to infer your location. Some browser extensions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/these-6-browser-extensions-will-immediately-improve-your-privacy-online/">already block</a> these invisible email trackers. But Apple said it&#8217;s bringing privacy features to the Mail app, which will make it more difficult for emails — and ad trackers — from knowing what emails you&#8217;ve opened.</p>
<h3>Siri will process speech on the device</h3>
<p>Siri, Apple&#8217;s voice assistant, requires the internet to work, but will soon work offline. Apple said Siri will soon process speech on the device so that audio never leaves the device. Apple said this will help prevent unwanted audio recording, but will also help make Siri respond to requests faster.</p>
<p>Apple also has a few new security and privacy features baked into its new iCloud+ premium service, including private relay, which encrypts your Safari internet traffic.</p>
<p>As part of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-icloud-with-privacy-focused-features/">new premium iCloud+ service</a>, Apple is also rolling out private relay browsing, which encrypts your Safari traffic and routes it so that it&#8217;s more difficult to track which websites you visit. TechCrunch&#8217;s Romain Dillet has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-icloud-with-privacy-focused-features/">more</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The past year has seen some of the most dramatic updates to Macs in recent memory. At last year’s WWDC, Apple announced its long-awaited move from Intel chip’s to its own first party silicon. By the end of the year, the company launched the first three M1 Macs, along with Big Sur, one of the biggest updates to macOS.</p>
<p>At this morning’s kickoff to WWDC, the company unveiled macOS 12 &#8212; named, you guessed it, Monterey. Universal Control is the top line new feature here, which further bridges the gap between desktop and tablet. Sticking the iPad next to a Mac, you can move the cursor between devices using the same trackpad and keyboard. The feature works on up to three devices at once.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2162507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AirPlay to Mac also blurs that let&#8217;s you cast content directly to your big desktop screen &#8212; that&#8217;s nice for weirdos like me who don&#8217;t have a TV. Shortcuts are also now available on macOS, allowing for simpler automation that the existing Automater. Users will be able to import Automater workflows directly to the desktop version of the popular mobile app. It will be a multi-year transition, but rip Automater &#8212; you will be missed (kind of). Shortcuts will be coming to Siri, Spotlight, the menu bar and Finder to start.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2162516" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Safari is getting some updates, of course. The biggest piece of news on the browser front is the arrival of Tab Groups &#8212; which is more or less as it sounds. Users can group tabs into bundles, which can be shared with other users. That&#8217;s a lot of content and will probably require a rethink of many users workflows. But at least the tab bar itself is getting cleaner and more streamlined.</p>
<p>Also new are desktop extensions that can now be with iOS and iPadOS. Desktops also now support Spatial Audio on the AirPods Pro, LaunchPad now features a games folder to get that content all in one place and Memojis can be displayed on the login screen.</p>
<p>Some nice additions, but as expect, Monterey doesn&#8217;t represent as big an update as Big Sur. There are some nice new features here, but it seems likely that much of the big news is happening under the hood, as the company continues to refine the Apple Silicon experience across its new systems.</p>
<p>Public beta will go live next month. Monterey will be available for all users this fall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You weren’t expecting to make it through this year’s WWDC without some big watchOS news, were you? Apple’s wearable isn’t quite doing iPhone numbers, but Watch has been massively successful for the company, utterly dominating the smartwatch market.</p>
<p>Surprising absolutely no one, the company is taking a more focused approach to mindfulness. Apple&#8217;s not ready to kill Calm or Headspace just yet, but the popular breathe feature is getting a much needed upgrade with new animations reminding users to reflect and be more mindful.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2162465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Also new is respiratory tracking, which thus far had been more of a background feature. It&#8217;s being surfaced in the watchOS experience, for tracking over time and more notifications.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be a watchOS update without some new faces, of course. Here the company is adding a portrait mode to faces to offer more depth for shots as the lock screen. The Watch Photos app is getting a new layout, as well, along with the share images from the watch to first-party apps like Mail and Messages.</p>
<p>Fitness+ is getting a bunch of new content, as well, including artist musical spotlights for workouts including Alicia Keys, Lady Gaga and Keith Urban. Tai chi and pilates are also being added to the list of workouts tracked by the wearable.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least for many, watchOS is also getting GIF support. Public beta will go live next month. watchOS 8 will be available for all users this fall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is rolling out some updates to iCloud under the name iCloud+. The company is announcing those features at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/wwdc-2021/">its developer conference</a>. Existing paid iCloud users are going to get those iCloud+ features for the same monthly subscription price.</p>
<p>In Safari, Apple is going to launch a new privacy feature called Private Relay. It sounds a bit like the new DNS feature that Apple has been developing with Cloudflare. Originally named <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cloudflare-and-apple-design-a-new-privacy-friendly-internet-protocol/">Oblivious DNS-over-HTTPS</a>, Private Relay could be a better name for something quite simple — a combination of DNS-over-HTTPS with proxy servers.</p>
<p>When Private Relay is turned on, nobody can track your browsing history — not your internet service provider, anyone standing in the middle of your request between your device and the server you’re requesting information from. We’ll have to wait a bit to learn more about how it works exactly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wy0M0eyAvo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cloudflare-and-apple-design-a-new-privacy-friendly-internet-protocol/">Cloudflare and Apple design a new privacy-friendly internet protocol</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cloudflare and Apple design a new privacy-friendly internet protocol&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cloudflare-and-apple-design-a-new-privacy-friendly-internet-protocol/embed/#?secret=wy0M0eyAvo" data-secret="wy0M0eyAvo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The second iCloud+ feature is ‘Hide my email’. It lets you generate random email addresses when you sign up to a newsletter or when you create an account on a website. If you’ve used ‘Sign in with Apple’, you know that Apple offers you the option to use fake iCloud email addresses. This works similarly, but for any app.</p>
<p>Finally, Apple is overhauling HomeKit Secure Video. With the name iCloud+, Apple is separating free iCloud users from paid iCloud users. Basically, you used to pay for more storage. Now, you pay for more storage <em>and</em> more features. Subscriptions start at $0.99 per month for 50GB (and iCloud+ features).</p>

<p>More generally, Apple is adding two much needed to iCloud accounts. Now, you can add a friend for account recovery. This way, you can request access to your data to your friend. But that doesn’t mean that your friend can access your iCloud data — it’s just a way to recover your account.</p>
<p>The last much-needed update is a legacy feature. You’ll soon be able to add one or several legacy contacts. Data can be passed along when you pass away. And this is a much needed feature as many photo libraries become inaccessible when someone close to you passes away.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today introduced the next version iPadOS with more widgets and a better multitasking system. The announcement was by Apple SVP, Craig Federighi at Apple&#8217;s annual developer&#8217;s conference, WWDC21. The features announced today are welcomed updates, but fall short from the major rework the iPad sorely deserves. The new iPad features come in addition to the bevy of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-refines-ios-15-notifications-with-focus-summary-features/">features and updates found in iOS 15</a>, which were also announced today.</p>
<p>&#8220;With iPad OS, we [want to] build distinct capabilities making it possible for the iPad to become whatever you need it to be,&#8221; said Apple SVP, Craig Federighi in a pre-recorded video.</p>
<p>iPadOS 15 retains the overall look and feel of the current iPad operating system. The updates in the new OS are mostly centered around multitasking. The iPad&#8217;s widget support gets a big update with iPadOS 15. The widgets are larger, more immersive, and dynamic. iOS&#8217;s App Library is finally available on the iPad where it tweaks the overall user experience. The feature, added to the iPhone in 2020, presents the user with an organized view of the apps on the iPad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2162378 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" />iPadOS 15 adds a new multitasking system. Called Split View, a drop-down menu at the top of the screen unlocks several multi-tasking, multi-window options. Called Split View, the system seems much smoother than the current multiscreen option on iPad OS, which is clunky and hidden. With Split View a feature called Shelf makes it easy to switch between different screens and screen grouping.</p>

<p>Apple updated the note taking system in iPad OS to better take advantage of the iPad&#8217;s large screen. One new feature, called Quick Notes, allows users to float a note-taking window anywhere overtop of another app. That way, a user can take notes without having to switch between apps. This feature is seperate Split View, showing Apple is slowly (and finally) embracing a desktop experience.</p>
<p>iPadOS 15 sports a new version of Swift Playgrounds that allows users to learn, build, and submit iPad and iPhone apps to the App Store. This represents a large step forward in Apple&#8217;s app development world. Now, a user can learn Swift and submit apps without the need of a Mac.</p>
<p>These features come just weeks after Apple started selling its more powerful iPad yet with many tech pundits calling on Apple to update the iPad&#8217;s operating system to better match the potential of the new hardware. iPad OS 15 is the evolution of the iPad and not the revolution many want.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Weather remains one of the most-used apps on mobile devices, and yet so often it&#8217;s also one of the least dynamic when it comes to updates and new features (ironic especially if you live in a country like the UK, like I do, where the weather is a near-national obsession and does really change within the course of an hour. Captive audience!). So today during WWDC it was great to see Apple finally giving its own native weather app some love with a significant update.</p>
<p>Possibly its biggest since long ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/22/why-apple-dropped-yahoo-for-its-weather-app-in-ios-8/#:~:text=But%20the%20Weather%20Channel%20wasn,the%20future%2C%20directly%20to%20Apple." target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropping Yahoo for Weather Channel as its key data provider</a>?</p>
<p>The company has completely refreshed the interface with an animated layout that reflects what state the weather happens to be in at the moment and place you are searching, similar to what Apple displayed in its last update but significant more dynamic, with more wind, rain, sun and smog (sorry). There are now thousands of variations that Apple says more accurately represent sun position, clouds and rain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2162386" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-3.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-3.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-3.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-3.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-3.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-3.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-3.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-3.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-3.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In addition to this, Apple now shows off a pretty extensive dashboard of more datapoints &#8212; taking the information way beyond basics of temperature and precipitation. Graphics now include wind, UV index and barometric pressure. Alongside this you now get full-screen weather maps, high resolution images that animate the progress of rain and clouds, air quality, and temperature &#8212; sort of like your own personal weather assistant.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2162387" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Some of this has been a long time coming but also unsurprising, and not just because of how perennially popular weather apps are.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/apple-acquires-dark-sky-android-version-shutting-down-in-july/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 2020</a>, it emerged that Apple made a key acquisition of a weather app startup, Dark Sky, easily one of the best weather apps on iOS and Android before Apple shut it down.</p>
<p>Again, given how surprisingly neglected weather apps tend to be, especially considering how passively popular they are, it was possibly always a low bar that was going to be bettered by someone. But Dark Sky, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/27/dark-sky-is-ready-to-be-the-default-weather-app-on-your-iphones-homescreen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began as a Kickstarter of all things</a>, really did the effort justice.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why it too so long for Apple to make it rain on its weather app after that acquisition, but it&#8217;s good that it finally has.</p>
<p>Of course Apple&#8217;s still not magical enough to bring you guaranteed sunshine for that camping weekend you have coming up, but the update will mean that the data nerds among us might have a lot more fun figuring out what will happen next, and hopefully get a more accurate picture of the details that will help you decide whether you absolutely have to make room for wellies in the car or not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.br.iq/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briq</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which has developed a fintech platform used by the construction industry, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $30 million dollars in a Series B funding round led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing is among the largest Series B fundraises by a construction software startup, according to the company, and brings Briq’s total raised to $43 million since its January 2018 inception. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Eniac Ventures and Blackhorn Ventures also participated in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briq CEO and co-founder Bassem Hamdy is a former executive at construction tech giant Procore (which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/investors-help-procore-build-a-decacorn-valuation-in-public-debut/">went public</a> and has a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> market cap of $10.4 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) Canadian software giant CMIC. Wall Street veteran Ron Goldshmidt is co-founder and COO.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briq describes its offering as a financial planning and workflow automation platform that “drastically reduces” the time to run critical financial processes, while increasing the accuracy of forecasts and financial plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briq has developed a toolbox of proprietary technology that it says allows it to extract and manipulate financial data without the use of APIs. It also has developed construction-specific data models that allows it to build out projections and create models of how much a project might cost, and how much could conceivably be made. Currently, Briq manages or forecasts about $30 billion in construction volume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Briq has two main offerings: Briq&#8217;s Corporate Performance Management (CPM) platform, which models financial outcomes at the project and corporate level and</span> <a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/briq-launches-first-payment-rewards-card-for-construction/598403/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BriqCash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a construction-specific banking platform for managing invoices and payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Briq aims to allow contractors “to go from plan to pay” in one platform with the goal of solving the age-old problem of construction projects (very often) going over budget. Its longer-term, ambitious mission is to “manage 80% of the money workflows in construction within 10 years.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s strategy, so far, seems to be working.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From January 2020 to today, ARR has climbed by 200%, according to Hamdy. Briq currently has about 100 employees, compared to 35 a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briq has 150 customers, and serves general and specialty contractors from $10 million to $1 billion in revenue.  They include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cafco Construction Management, WestCor Companies and Choate Construction and Harper Construction. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is currently focused on contractors in North America but does have long-term plans to address larger international markets, Hamdy told TechCrunch.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some context</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamdy came up with the idea for Santa Barbara, California-based Briq after realizing the vast amount of inefficiencies on the financial side of the construction industry. His goal was to do for construction financials what Procore did to document management, and PlanGrid to construction drawing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He started Briq with his own cash, amassed through secondary sales as Procore climbed the ranks of startups to become a construction industry unicorn.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2161794" style="width: 515px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161794" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2161794" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="505" height="303" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg 2374w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=1536,920 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=2048,1227 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2161794" class="wp-caption-text">Briq CEO and co-founder Bassem Hamdy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wanted to figure out how to bring the best of fintech into a construction industry that really guesses every month what the financial outcomes are for projects,” Hamdy told me at the time of the company’s last raise – a $10 million Series A led by Blackhorn Ventures announced in May of 2020. “Getting a handle on financial outcomes is really hard. The vast majority of the time, the forecasted cost to completion is plain wrong. By a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, according to </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Capital%20Projects%20and%20Infrastructure/Our%20Insights/The%20next%20normal%20in%20construction/The-next-normal-in-construction.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinsey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an astounding 80 percent of projects run over budget, resulting in significant waste and profit loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So at the end of a project, contractors often find themselves having doled out more money and resources than originally planned. This can lead to negative cash flow and profit loss. Briq’s platform aims to help contractors identify outliers, and which projects are more at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Briq has proven to be “extremely valuable” to contractors, Hamdy said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In an industry where margins are so thin, we have given contractors the ability to truly understand where they stand on cash, profit and labor,” he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Among many updates coming to iOS 15, Apple Maps will receive a number of upgrades that will bring more detailed maps, improvements for transit riders, AR experiences and other changes to the platform. The improvements build on the new map Apple begin rolling out two years ago, which had focused on offering richer details, and &#8212; in response to user feedback and complaints &#8212; more accurate navigation.</p>
<p>Since then, Apple Maps has steadily improved.</p>
<p>The new map experience has since launched in the U.S., U.K., Ireland and Canada and will now make its way to Spain and Portugal, starting today. I will then arrive in Italy and Australia later this year, Apple announced during its keynote address during its Worldwide Developer Conference on Monday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2162335" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162335" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2162335" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?w=680" alt="maps driving" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162335" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, Apple said iOS 15 Maps will include new details for commercial districts, marinas, buildings, and more. Plus, Apple has added things like elevation, new road colors and labels, as well as hundreds of custom designed landmarks &#8212; for example, for places like the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
<p>Apple also built a new nighttime mode for Maps with a &#8220;moonlit glow,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For drivers, Apple added new road details to the map, so it can help drivers as they move throughout a city to better see and understand important things like turn lanes, medians, bus and taxi lanes, and other things. The changes are competitive with some of the updates Google has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/google-maps-adds-street-level-details-in-select-cities-more-colorful-imagery-worldwide/">making as of late to its own Google Maps platform</a>, which brought street-level details in select cities. These allowed people &#8212; including those navigating on foot, in a wheelchair, on a bike, or on a scooter, for example &#8212; to better see things like sidewalks and intersections.</p>
<p>Apple is now catching up, saying it, too, will show features like crosswalks and bike lanes.</p>
<p>It will also render things like overlapping complex interchanges in 3D space, making it easier to see upcoming traffic conditions or what lane to take. These features will come to CarPlay later in the year.</p>

<p>For transit riders, meanwhile, Maps has made improvements to help users find nearby stations.</p>
<p>Users can now pin their favorite lines to the top, and even keep track on their Apple Watch so they don&#8217;t have to pull out their phone. The updated Maps app will automatically follow your transit route and notify you when it&#8217;s time to disembark, making the app more competitive to third-party apps often favored by transit takers, like Citymapper, for instance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162343" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162343" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2162343" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-train-stop.jpg?w=680" alt="maps train stop" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-train-stop.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-train-stop.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-train-stop.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-train-stop.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-train-stop.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-train-stop.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-train-stop.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-train-stop.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162343" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>When you exit your station, you can also now hold up your iPhone to scan the buildings in the area and Maps will generate an accurate position, offering direction in augmented reality. This is similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-maps-gets-improved-live-view-ar-directions/">the Live View AR directions Google announced</a> last year.</p>
<p>This feature is launching in select cities in 2021 with more to come in the year ahead, Apple said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has introduced a new feature to its camera system that automatically recognizes and transcribes text in your photos, from a phone number on a business card to a whiteboard full of notes. Live Text, as the feature is called, doesn&#8217;t need any prompting or special work from the user — just tap the icon and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>
<p>Announced by Craig Federighi on the virtual stage of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/WWDC-2021/">WWDC</a>, Live Text will be arriving on iPhones with iOS 15. He demonstrated it with a couple pictures, one of a whiteboard after a meeting, and a couple snapshots that included restaurant signs in the background.</p>
<p>Tapping the Live Text button in the lower right gave detected text a slight underline, and then a swipe allowed it to be selected and copied. In the case of the whiteboard, it collected several sentences of notes including bullet points, and with one of the restaurant signs it grabbed the phone number, which could be called or saved.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.21.21-PM-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2162295" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.21.21-PM-1.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a phone selecting text in an image." width="1024" height="573" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.21.21-PM-1.jpg 1528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.21.21-PM-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.21.21-PM-1.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.21.21-PM-1.jpg?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.21.21-PM-1.jpg?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.21.21-PM-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The feature is reminiscent of many found in Google&#8217;s long-developed Lens app, and the Pixel 4 added more robust scanning capability in 2019. The difference is that the text is captured more or less passively in every photo taken by an iPhone running the new system — you don&#8217;t have to enter scanner mode or launch a separate app.</p>
<p>This is a nice thing for anyone to have, but it could be especially helpful for people with visual impairments. A snapshot or two makes any text, otherwise difficult to read, able to be dictated or saved.</p>
<p>The process seems to take place entirely on the phone, so don&#8217;t worry that this info is being sent to a datacenter somewhere. That also means it&#8217;s fairly quick, though until we test it for ourselves we can&#8217;t say whether it&#8217;s instantaneous or, like some other machine learning features, something that happens over the next few seconds or minutes after you take a shot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over a year into a global pandemic, Apple announced some major updates to its FaceTime app at WWDC 2021, which will be available in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-ios-15-with-new-features-for-facetime-and-better-notifications/">iOS 15</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, Android users will now be able to join in on FaceTime calls, posing some competition to apps like Zoom and Google Meet, which have boomed during lockdown. This FaceTime makeover will also include links to join calls, which can be sent via Calendar invites in advance of your meeting. These links work across platforms, whether you&#8217;re on the web, an Android phone, or your iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple is also adding updates that make the experience of video chatting on FaceTime more closely resemble real life conversations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When talking in person, our brains process hundreds of social auditory and visual cues when talking on a video call. Many of those signals can get lost, leaving us feeling drained. So this year, we&#8217;ve set out to make FaceTime calls feel more natural, comfortable, and lifelike,&#8221; said Craig Federighi, Apple&#8217;s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering.</p>
<p>Through a spatial audio feature, FaceTime calls will sound like you&#8217;re sitting in the same room with your friends – that means if someone is on the left side of your screen, their audio will come through the left side of your speaker. This functionality might not translate well to smaller devices like an iPhone, but could be interesting on devices like an iMac. The person speaking will have a white ring appear around their video while they&#8217;re talking, and users will be able to select a grid view to see the other people on the call, which seems quite similar to Zoom.</p>
<p>Next, Apple announced voice isolation, which will improve the speaker&#8217;s audio quality when calling from a noisy area. The demo video that was shown during the WWDC announcement featured a child walking into the video frame with a leaf blower. In TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/live-from-apples-wwdc-2021-keynote/">liveblog</a>, Darrell Etherington pointed out that the video seemed heavily edited.</p>
<p>Finally, a feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-introduces-shareplay-for-co-watching-streaming-and-screen-sharing-over-facetime/">SharePlay</a> will come to FaceTime, which makes it easier for friends to watch streaming videos together. SharePlay allows for group listening, watching, and screensharing, and Apple shared partners for SharePlay including Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, NBA, Twitch, TikTok, MasterClass, ESPN+, Paramount+, and PlutoTV. The SharePlay API will be available so that all video app makers can access it and integrate their own apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of its FaceTime update in iOS 15, Apple introduced a new set of features designed for shared experiences &#8212; like co-watching TV shows or TikTok videos, listening to music together, screen sharing and more &#8212; while on a FaceTime call. The feature, called SharePlay, enables real-time connections with family and friends while you&#8217;re hanging out on FaceTime, Apple explained, by integrating access to apps from within the call itself.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162251" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162251" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2162251" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-shareplay.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-shareplay.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-shareplay.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-shareplay.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-shareplay.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-shareplay.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-shareplay.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-shareplay.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-shareplay.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162251" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Apple demonstrated the new feature during its Worldwide Developer Conference keynote this afternoon, showing how friends could press play in Apple Music to listen together, as the music streams to everyone on the call. Shared playback controls also let anyone on the call play, pause or jump to the next track.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also showed off watching video from its Apple TV+ streaming service, where the video was synced in real-time between call participants. This was a popular trend during the pandemic, as people looked to virtually watch movies and TV with family and friends, prompting services like Hulu and Amazon Prime Video to add native co-watching features.</p>
<p>But Apple&#8217;s SharePlay goes much further than streaming music and video from just Apple&#8217;s own services.</p>
<p>The company announced a set of launch partners for SharePlay including Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, NBA, Twitch, TikTok, MasterClass, ESPN+, Paramount+, and Pluto TV. It&#8217;s also making an API available to developers so they can integrate their own apps with SharePlay.</p>

<p>Users can screen share via SharePlay, too, so you can do things like browse Zillow listings together or show off a mobile gameplay, Apple suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Screen sharing is also a simple and super effective way to help someone out and answer questions right in the moment, and it works across Apple devices,&#8221; noted Apple SVP of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi.</p>
<p>The feature will roll out with iOS 15.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of the update to iOS 15, Apple will allow iPhone users to better customize how they want to be notified about incoming calls, texts or updates from apps based on their current status. With the new Focus feature instead of just silencing calls and notifications through Do Not Disturb, you&#8217;ll be able to set different types of notification preferences based on your status &#8212; like whether you&#8217;re driving, working, sleeping or through the use of custom categories of your own choosing.</p>
<p>The system also uses on-board AI to help determine what your status is at a given time. For example, the phone might suggest you turn off notifications when you&#8217;re arriving at the gym.</p>
<p>With the new Focus feature, you can customize how you want to be notified and when. For example, you could choose to only be notified by coworkers or by apps like Mail, Calendar, or Slack. You can even dedicate a page on your homescreen to match your focus and organize your apps and widgets in a way that reduces temptations by making only your work apps visible. When you use Focus, it will sync to all your other Apple devices, too, Apple notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notifications have a new look too, with contact photos for people and larger icons for apps, making them easier to identify.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2162279" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.18.41-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="573" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.18.41-PM.jpg 1528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.18.41-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.18.41-PM.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.18.41-PM.jpg?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.18.41-PM.jpg?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.18.41-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In 2019, Tim Cook <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJl0_JDDcrQ">admitted</a> that he himself had silenced many notifications, famously saying that &#8220;Apple never wanted to maximize user time. We’ve never been about that.&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/tim-cook-wants-you-to-put-down-your-iphone/">But we disputed that was the case</a>, saying Apple could have designed a system that delivered notifications on a schedule, not in real-time.</p>
<p>Apparently, Apple has now has: it&#8217;s called Notification Summary, which bundles and prioritizes incoming notifications, based on things like time of day. You can schedule this summary to be delivered at any time you choose, like in the morning or evening, for example.</p>
<p>Apple says it uses device intelligence based on how you use your apps to arrange this summary, making it easier to quickly catch up. The most important notifications appear above the less important notifications in the summary.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162275" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162275" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2162275" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.17.58-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.17.58-PM.jpg 1528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.17.58-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.17.58-PM.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.17.58-PM.jpg?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.17.58-PM.jpg?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.17.58-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162275" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>In another change, Do Not Disturb has been integrated directly into iMessage, so other users will know when you don&#8217;t want to be bothered by incoming notes.</p>
<p>Now, when you&#8217;re using Do Not Disturb, your status is automatically displayed in iMessage. When you reach out to someone who&#8217;s indicated they don&#8217;t want to be disturbed, you&#8217;ll be reminded in that moment. And for truly urgent messages, there&#8217;s still a way to get through, Apple noted.</p>
<p>The system can also be set up to send you a briefing as a big chunk during a time of day, making the lock screen notification a more interactive experience than in previous iOS versions.</p>
<p>These features, which involve better personalizing the phone to the user, somewhat recall the smart launchers that had been popular on Android devices many years ago, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/07/yahoo-announces-that-it-has-acquired-intelligent-homescreen-startup-aviate/">Aviate</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/24/everythingme-launches-its-contextual-launcher-globally/">EverythingMe</a>, among others, which customized your device based on what you were doing, the time of day, and other factors. These apps never took off on iOS because Apple doesn&#8217;t allow third-party apps to deeply integrate with its mobile operating system or reconfigure the device&#8217;s homescreen and the trend later fizzled out.</p>
<p>But Apple more recently has been customizing its iPhone to better reflect user preferences, including with the introduction of widgets and Siri Suggestions, which can even be a widget of suggested apps on the homescreen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the virtual keynote of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/wwdc-2021/">WWDC</a>, Apple shared the first details about iOS 15, the next major version of iOS that is going to be released later this year. There are four pillars with this year&#8217;s release: staying connected, focusing without distraction, using intelligence and exploring the world.</p>
<p>“For many of us, our iPhones have become indispensable,” SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said. “Our new release is iOS 15. It&#8217;s packed with features that make the iOS experience adapt to and complement the way you use iPhone, whether it&#8217;s staying connected with those who matter to you most, finding the space to focus without distraction, using intelligence to discover the information you need, or exploring the world around you.”</p>

<h2>FaceTime gets a bunch of new features</h2>
<p>Apple is adding spatial audio to FaceTime. Now the voices are spread out depending on the position of your friends on the screen. For instance, if someone appears on the left, it&#8217;ll sound like they&#8217;re on the left in your ears. In other FaceTime news, iOS now detects background noise and tries to suppress it so that you can hear your friends and family members more easily. That&#8217;s an optional feature, which means that you can disable it in case you&#8217;re showing a concert during a FaceTime call for instance.</p>
<p>Another FaceTime feature is &#8216;Portrait mode&#8217;. Behind this term, Apple means that it can automatically blurs the background, like in &#8216;Portrait mode&#8217; photos. In case you want to use FaceTime for work conferences, you can now generate a FaceTime link and add it to a calendar invite. FaceTime will also work in a web browser, which means that people without an Apple device can join a FaceTime call. All of these features make FaceTime more competitive with other video call services, such as Zoom and Google Meet.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-links.jpg" alt="WWDC 2021 - Facetime Link" width="1024" height="576" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2162248" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-links.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-links.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-links.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-links.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-links.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-links.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-links.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-facetime-links.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>FaceTime is a big focus as Apple is also introducing SharePlay. With this feature, you can listen together to a music album. Press play in Apple Music and the music will start for everyone on the call. The queue is shared with everyone else, which means anyone can add songs, skip to the next track, etc.</p>
<p>SharePlay also lets you watch movies and TV shows together. Someone on the call starts a video and it starts on your friend&#8217;s phone or tablet. It is also compatible with AirPlay, picture-in-picture and everything you&#8217;d expect from videos on iOS.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just compatible with videos in the Apple TV app. Apple said there will be an API to make videos compatible with SharePlay. Partners include Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, Twitch, TikTok and more. Here&#8217;s a screenshot of the initial partners:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-shareplay-platforms.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2162260" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-shareplay-platforms.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-shareplay-platforms.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-shareplay-platforms.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-shareplay-platforms.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-shareplay-platforms.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-shareplay-platforms.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-shareplay-platforms.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-shareplay-platforms.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s switch to Messages. The app is getting better integration with other Apple apps like News, Photos and Music. Items shared via Messages show up in those apps. In other words, Messages (and iMessage) is acting as the social layer on top of Apple&#8217;s apps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-summary.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2162278" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-summary.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-summary.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-summary.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-summary.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-summary.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-summary.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-summary.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-summary.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>A new notification summary</h2>
<p>Apple is going to use on-device intelligence to create summaries of your notifications. Instead of being sorted by apps and by date, it is sorted by priority. For instance, notifications from friends will be closer to the top.</p>
<p>When you silence notifications, your iMessage contacts will see that you have activated &#8216;Do not disturb&#8217;. It works a bit like &#8216;Do not disturb&#8217; in Slack. But there are new settings. Apple calls this Focus mode. You can choose apps and people you want notifications from and change your focus depending on what you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>For instance, if you&#8217;re at work, you can silence personal apps and personal calls and messages. If it&#8217;s the weekend, you can silence your work emails. Your settings sync across your iCloud account if you have multiple Apple devices. And it&#8217;ll even affect your home screen by showing and hiding apps and widgets.</p>

<h2>New smart features</h2>
<p>Apple is going to scan your photos for text. Called Live Text, this feature lets you highlight, copy and paste text in photos. It could be a nice accessibility feature as well. iOS is going to leverage that info for Spotlight. You can search from text in your photos directly in Spotlight. These features are handled on device directly.</p>

<p>With iOS 15, memories are getting an upgrade. &#8220;These new memories are built on the fly. They are interactive and alive,&#8221; Chelsea Burnette, Senior Manager, Photos Engineering. Memories are those interactive movies that you can watch in the Photos app. Now, you can tap with your finger to pause the movie. While music still plays in the background, your photo montage resumes when you lift your finger.</p>
<p>You can now search for a specific song to pair with a memory. It&#8217;s going to be interesting to see in details what&#8217;s new for the Photos app.</p>

<h2>Wallet, Weather and Maps</h2>
<p>After a recap of all the features of Apple Wallet, the company announced that you&#8217;ll be able to scan your ID and store it in Wallet. It&#8217;ll be available in participating states so it&#8217;s going to be a slow rollout. When a government service wants some info from your ID, you can choose to share some data with this service directly on your iPhone.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Weather app, it has been updated to include many of the features that were available in Dark Sky, a popular weather app that has been acquired by Apple. Expect a new design and more data.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather.jpg" alt="WWDC 2021 - weather app" width="1024" height="576" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2162332" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>As for Apple Maps, the new mapping data has been rolled out in several countries and Apple is still rolling it out in Europe. Apple has added a ton of new details to some areas, such as San Francisco. You can see bus and taxi lanes, crosswalks, bike lanes, etc. On highways, you see complex interchanges in 3D. All of this is also coming to Car Play later this year.</p>
<p>With transit, users can pin their favorite lines and view info on their Apple Watch. When you&#8217;re in a subway or bus, you can see your location in real time. It sounds a bit like Citymapper&#8217;s itinerary feature.You can also get directions in augmented reality by holding your phone in front of you.</p>

<h2>AirPods software update</h2>
<p>Apple is also announcing a bunch of new features for users who also have AirPods. There&#8217;s a new conversation mode that makes it a smart hearing aid to boost conversation volume. You&#8217;ll also get more notifications if you&#8217;ve activated the &#8216;Announce notifications&#8217; setting. You can tweak that settings to limit it to certain apps and change depending on your focus mode.</p>
<p>You can also find your AirPods with the Find My app with audio notifications even when they&#8217;re in the case. Spatial audio is coming to the Apple TV and Macs with an M1 chip. As announced a few weeks ago, spatial audio for Apple Music is launching right now.</p>
<p>As you can see, iOS 15 is packed with new features. Apple is releasing a developer beta with an initial release today. The public beta phase will start in July. You can expect beta updates throughout the summer and a final release this fall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">And we’re back. Well, not back-back. But we’re here in the San Jose McEnery Convention Center of the mind. The parking is awful and the hotels all got booked up five months ago, so we’re taking the CalTrain in from Redwood City (of the mind).</p>
<p>We’ve got a full house at this morning’s virtual kick-off to Apple’s annual developer conference. And good thing, too. It’s shaping up to be a packed event. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/what-to-expect-from-wwdc-2021/">read more about that here</a>. You can also check out Apple’s own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-live-stream-livestream-wwdc-event-keynote-2021-ios-ipados-15/">livestream here</a>. And, of course, we’ll be breaking out the biggest news into bite-sized chunks.</p>
<p>As always, the kick-off event is focused on Apple’s (numerous) operating systems: iOS/iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS and, perhaps, a new homeOS. Oftentimes that also comes with some new hardware. After all, you’ll need something to run those operating systems on.</p>
<p>Matthew will be leading the show, with help from various members of the TC team. Things kick off today at <strong>10AM PT/1PM ET.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, Apple is holding a (virtual) keynote on the first day of its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/">developer conference</a>, and the company is expected to talk about a ton of software updates. At <strong>10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris)</strong>, you’ll be able to watch the event right here as the company is streaming it live.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TD96VTf0Xs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>As usual with Apple’s developer conferences, you can expect to learn more about the next major updates of the company’s operating systems. Get ready for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, a new version of macOS and some updates for watchOS and tvOS as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Apple could also use this opportunity to unveil some new products that are particularly popular with developers. Apple has already shipped several laptops and desktop computers with its own ARM-based M1 chip.</p>
<p>High-end models haven’t been updated yet. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/what-to-expect-from-wwdc-2021/">Rumor has it</a> that Apple could use today’s opportunity to unveil a new iMac Pro, updated MacBook Pro models or even a new external display.</p>
<p>You can watch the live stream directly on this page, as Apple is streaming its conference on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you have an Apple TV, you don’t need to download a new app. You can open the Apple TV app and find the Apple Events section. It lets you stream today’s event and rewatch old ones.</p>
<p>And if you don’t have an Apple TV and don’t want to use YouTube, the company also lets you live stream the event from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events section</a> on its website. This video feed now works in all major browsers — Safari, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Germany technology and parts supplier Robert Bosch opened a €1 billion ($1.2 billion) chip factory in Dresden, Germany on Monday, the single largest investment in the company’s history. The plant, which will mainly supply automotive customers, is a major signal that connected and electric vehicles are here to stay.</p>
<p>“Regardless of which powertrain we talk about … always we need a semiconductor and sensor,” Bosch’s executive vice president of automotive electronics Jens Fabrowsky told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The plant will handle front-of-the-line processing, or wafer fabrication, in the semiconductor manufacturing process. The 300-millimeter wafers will be sent to partners, typically in Asia, to do packaging and assembly of the semiconductors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>300 millimeters is a “new field of technology,” Fabrowsky explained. As opposed to the 150- or 200-millimeter wafers that are produced at Bosch’s nearby factory in Reutlingen, Germany, the larger wafer size offers greater economies of scale because you can produce more individual chips per wafer.</p>
<p>The 77,500-square-foot plant will run on what Bosch calls “AIoT,” a term that combines artificial intelligence and Internet of Things to denote a fully connected and data-driven system that’s unique to the facility. Bosch will not only have real-time data on the approximately 100 machines, but also on the power, water and other aspects of the facility — up to 500 pages of data per second, Fabrowsky said. The AI-driven algorithm should detect an anomaly from any of the connected sensors immediately.</p>
<p>Despite its high levels of automation, the plant will employ around 700 people once it is fully operational.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the plant will help resolve the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, which has forced automakers like General Motors and Ford to slash production volumes and temporarily shutter manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p>“At the point when we decided [to build the plant] it was purely driven by technology,” Fabrowsky said. “It was clear we needed to go into 300 [millimeters], and we needed to invest in some more capacity.”</p>
<p>The facility will begin production in July with chips for power tools before beginning production on automotive chips in September. It generally takes over 20 weeks to make a semiconductor chip, Fabrowsky said, including 600 individual steps in the wafer facility alone.</p>
<p>The company will also be investing €50 million ($61 million) to extend the clean room facilities at its Reutlingen plant, Bosch board member Harald Kroeger said at a media briefing Monday.</p>
<p>Bosch has applied to Germany&#8217;s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy under a microelectronics investment program to subsidize expenditures for the plant of up to €200 million ($244 million). It must submit evidence of expenditures before it receives the funds, a Bosch spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As remote work became the default for many companies during the pandemic, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that services like Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Virtual Desktop, which gives users access to a fully managed Windows 10 desktop experience from virtually anywhere, saw a lot of interest from large enterprises and a new crop of small businesses that suddenly had to find ways to better support their remote workers. That&#8217;s pretty much what Microsoft saw, too, which had originally targeted Windows Virtual Desktop at some of the world&#8217;s largest enterprises. And so as the user base changed, Microsoft&#8217;s vision for the product changed as well, leading it to now changing its name from <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/">Windows Virtual Desktop</a> to Azure Virtual Desktop.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first went GA with Windows Virtual Desktop, about a year and a half ago, the world was a very different place,&#8221; said Kam VedBrat, Microsoft&#8217;s general manager for Azure Virtual Desktop. &#8220;And to be blunt, we looked at the service and what we were building, who we were building it for, pretty differently. No one at that time had any idea that this global pandemic was going to happen and that it would cause so many organizations around the world and millions of people to have to essentially leave the office and work from home &#8212; and the role the service would play in enabling a lot of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the original idea was to help enterprises move their virtual desktop environments from their data centers to the cloud, the pandemic brought a slew of new use cases to <del>Windows</del> Azure Virtual Desktop. It now hosts anything from virtual school labs to the traditional remote enterprise use cases. These new users also have somewhat different needs and expertise from those users the service was originally meant for, so on top of today&#8217;s name change, the company is also launching a set of new features that should make it easier for new users to get started with using Azure Virtual Desktop.</p>
<p>Among those is a new Quickstart experience, which will soon launch in public preview. &#8220;One piece of feedback that we saw is that as so many organizations are looking at Azure Virtual Desktop to enable new scenarios for hybrid work, they want to get these environments up and running quickly to understand how they work, how their apps behave in them, how to think about app groups and host pools and some of the new concepts that are there,&#8221; VedBrat explained. Ideally, it should now only take a few clicks to set up a full virtual desktop environment from the Azure portal.</p>
<p>Also new in Azure Virtual Desktop is support for managing multi-session virtual machines (VMs) with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-endpoint-manager">Microsoft Endpoint Manager</a>, Microsoft&#8217;s unified service for device management. This marks the first time Endpoint Manager is able to handle multi-session VMs, which are one of the biggest selling points for Azure Virtual Desktop, since it allows a business to host multiple users on the same machine running Windows 10 Enterprise in the cloud.</p>
<p>In addition, Azure Virtual Desktop now offers enhanced support for Azure Active Directory, in addition to a new per-user access pricing option (in addition to the cost of running on the Azure infrastructure) that will allow users to deliver apps to external users. This, Microsoft argues, will allow software vendors to deliver their apps as a SaaS solution, for example.</p>
<p>As for the name change, VedBrat argues that while Windows is obviously at the core of the experience, a lot of the service&#8217;s users care about the underlying Azure infrastructure as well, be that storage or networking, for example. &#8220;They look at that broader environment that they&#8217;re creating &#8212; that window estate that they&#8217;re creating in the cloud &#8212; and they see that as a larger thing and they look at a lot of Azure as part of that. So we felt like the right thing to do at this point, in order to address that broader view that our customers are taking, was to look at the new name,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>I thought Windows Virtual Desktop explained the core concept just fine, but nobody has ever accused me of being a marketing genius.</p>
