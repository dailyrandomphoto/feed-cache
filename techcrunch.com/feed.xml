										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just like that, they came back.</p>
<p>The Inspiration4 crew made a triumphant splashdown on Saturday evening off the east coast of Florida, marking the close of the first completely private, all-civilian space mission. SpaceX’s Go Searcher recovery ship hauled the Crew Dragon capsule, dubbed Resilience, a little less than an hour after splashdown. The crew was then ferried via helicopter to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, where they received standard medical checks.</p>
<p>The successful completion of the mission is a major triumph for Elon Musk and SpaceX (and, more peripherally, NASA, which funded the development of the tech), who conducted the entirety of the mission. It’s also perhaps our clearest signal that a new dawn of space travel is officially here.</p>
<p>Benji Reed, SpaceX’s senior director for human-spaceflight programs, told reporters that the company is seeing an increased number of inquiries from potential customers for private missions. The company could fly “three, four, five, six times a year at least,” he said.</p>
<p>Of course, mission commander Jared Isaacman is not the first billionaire to go to space. This summer, both Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos conducted their own orbital joy-rides in vehicles developed by their respective companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/virgin-galactic-and-richard-branson-celebrate-launch-of-first-passengers-into-space/">Virgin Galactic</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">Blue Origin</a>. But those trips were significantly shorter – Bezos and his three crewmates went to space and back in under fifteen minutes, essentially traveling in a long parabolic arc.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Inspiration4 crew spent three days orbiting Earth at an altitude that went as high as 590 kilometers – that’s higher than the International Space Station, meaning they were the most ‘outer’ of all the people in space. Over the course of their mission, they travelled around the Earth an average of fifteen times per day.</p>
<p>While in orbit, the crew conducted a handful of science experiments, mostly capturing data on themselves with the aim of furthering our understanding of the effects of spaceflight on the human body. The crew also spent some time in the large glass domed window, which SpaceX calls the “cupola,” snapping pictures of space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">View from Dragon’s cupola <a href="https://t.co/Z2qwKZR2lK">pic.twitter.com/Z2qwKZR2lK</a></p>
<p>— SpaceX (@SpaceX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1438359359898066944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Other than Isaacman, who made his fortune from his payment processing company Shift4 payments, the crew included physician assistant and childhood cancer survivor Hayley Arceneaux; geoscientist Sian Proctor; and Lockheed Martin engineer Chris Sembroski. Among the other firsts for the crew, Arceneaux is the youngest American to go to space and the first person with a prosthesis to go to space; Proctor is the first Black woman to pilot a space mission.</p>
<p>The historic mission was paid for entirely by Isaacman, though both he and SpaceX are staying mum on how much it cost in total. Instead, the mission was being framed as a $200 million fundraiser for St. Jude Research Hospital, to which Isaacman donated $100 million and Musk donated $50 million. The fundraiser received an additional $60.2 million in public donations.</p>
<p>This is the second time the Resilience spacecraft has safely carried humans to and from space. The first mission, Crew-1, carried four astronauts (three from NASA, one from the Japanese space agency) to the ISS and returned them back to Earth in May. SpaceX will be conducting another handful of crewed missions over the next six months, including another mission to the ISS on behalf of NASA and the European Space Agency, as well as the private <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/axiom-space-and-nasa-detail-first-fully-private-human-launch-to-the-space-station-set-for-january-2022/">AX-1 mission</a> on behalf of Axiom Space.</p>
<p>“Thanks so much SpaceX, that was a heck of a ride for us,” Isaacman said moments after the capsule landed. “We’re just getting started.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>The future of transportation beat was flooded with news this week as per ushe. There are two stories that I want to highlight here. First up, is that the first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/rivians-first-production-r1t-electric-pickup-truck-rolls-off-the-line/"><strong>Rivian</strong> R1T electric pickup truck</a> in &#8220;Rivian blue&#8221; rolled off the assembly line at the company&#8217;s factory in Normal, Illinois. The R1T and the upcoming R1S SUV are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/rivian-vehicles-are-now-ready-for-sale-in-all-50-states-following-key-certifications/">also now certified</a> to be sold in all 50 states (at least online).</p>
<p>This marks a milestone more than a decade in the making for the automaker and its founder and CEO, RJ Scaringe, who started the company in 2009 as Mainstream Motors before adopting the Rivian name two years later. Rivian has undergone explosive growth in terms of people, backers and partners in the past few years. If the company has a successful IPO, which it confidentially filed for recently, it could grow even faster.</p>
<p>Next up, is <strong>Tesla</strong> and its &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; beta software, which is about to become accessible to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/tesla-will-open-controversial-fsd-beta-software-to-owners-with-a-good-driving-record/">a lot more owners</a>.</p>
<p>The FSD Beta v10.0.1 software update, which has already been pushed out to a group of select owners, will become more widely available starting September 24. Tesla CEO Elon Musk issued a caveat that personal driving metrics captured over a seven-day period via telemetry data will determine whether owners who have paid for its FSD software can access the latest beta version that promises more automated driving functions.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/nt2qkb/ive_been_doing_some_more_reverse_engineering/">Reddit post</a> from several months ago provides hints on what data will be used. The poster, who has reversed engineered the Tesla app, found that the company was getting ready to implement insurance directly into the app. There will be a new safety rating page that will track an owner&#8217;s vehicle and is linked to their insurance. It&#8217;s possible that this is what Musk was referring to when he tweeted &#8220;beta button will request permission to assess driving behavior using Tesla insurance calculator. If driving behavior is good for 7 days, beta access will be granted.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to the Redditor, the app will track the number of times the ABS is activated, average number of hours driven daily, number of times Autopilot is disabled because alert is ignored, forward collision warnings, amount of time spent at an unsafe following distance and intensity of acceleration and braking.</p>
<p>This release on September 24, which will mean potentially thousands of Tesla owners trying out beta software on public roads, is going to test the will of regulators. Jennifer Homendy, the new head of the National Transportation Safety Board, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-push-to-expand-teslas-driver-assistance-to-cities-rankles-a-top-safety-authority-11632043803?mod=hp_lead_pos3">told the WSJ</a> that Tesla shouldn&#8217;t roll out this latest software update until it can address &#8220;basic safety issues.&#8221; NTSB is not a regulator; it investigates crashes and issues safety recommendations. So while her voice matters and is listened to, the NTSB cannot prevent Tesla from pushing this software update, or any other one, to owners.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwv5uKBhD6ARIsAGv9a-xR8h0mWH_jvVGR99vn6hgaBSMn1drRlYxeykQ7bQ4_jUhf2sZMseQaAkLxEALw_wcB"><strong>TechCrunch Disrupt is here</strong></a>! The event kicks off Tuesday and I hope to see you all there. There&#8217;s even a photo booth (virtual) and I want you to share your photos if you use it.</p>

<p>Lane detection, pedestrian detection, advanced braking systems. These sound like driver assistance features you might find in a new SUV, sedan or truck. These days, this tech is creeping into electric scooters.</p>
<p>The pressure on operators to build scooters that are robust, safe and combat issues like sidewalk clutter has prompted companies to develop and equip their vehicles with advanced driver assistance features. Operators like <strong>Voi</strong>, <strong>Spin</strong>, <strong>Superpedestrian</strong>, <strong>Zipp</strong> and<strong> Bird</strong> have all started to integrate tech that can detect when someone is riding on the sidewalk or parking a scooter where it shouldn&#8217;t be. Whether through camera-based computer vision or through really accurate geopositioning software, these scooters not only know exactly where a rider is, but they can also put the brakes on or slow them down if they&#8217;re breaking the rules.</p>
<p>The question is, is it necessary? My view is that this wouldn&#8217;t be necessary if cities stopped offloading the cost of safety onto operators and instead invested in protected bike lanes.</p>
<p>Check out my ExtraCrunch story that looks deeper into the tech, which I&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/">dubbed scooter ADAS</a>.</p>
<h3>Bird launches its shared e-bike in San Diego</h3>
<p>Bird has an exclusive micromobility contract with San Diego State University. Bird&#8217;s bike share operation, which was officially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/bird-launches-shared-e-bikes-and-opens-its-app-to-local-shared-operators/">launched in June</a>, will be available to the 34,000 students on campus.</p>
<h3>Brooklyn Bridge gets a dedicated bike lane</h3>
<p>Bikers these days don&#8217;t know how good they&#8217;ve got it. I remember when I had to ring my bike bell like a mad woman trying to get pedestrians to part for me as I attempted to ride over the busy <strong>Brooklyn Bridge</strong>. Now, the iconic bridge has its own dedicated two-way bike lane. This is huge news. HUGE. I only wish I were back home to see it. And the best part is that the lane was taken from cars and given back to the people!</p>
<h3>Compact, foldable and made in Japan</h3>
<p>A company called <strong>Shaero</strong> just <a href="https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/tokyo-has-a-new-electric-moped-sharing-service-with-stations-around-the-city-091321">launched in Tokyo</a> with a docked shared tiny moped that can be folded and stored inside lockers between trips. Forget scooter ADAS &#8212; more of this please!</p>
<h3>Tax break for e-bikes</h3>
<p>The <strong>U.S. House Ways and Means Committee</strong> proposed creating a <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/files/documents/Section%20by%20Section%20Subtitle%20F%2C%20G%2C%20H%2C%20%26%20J.pdf">15 percent tax credit</a> for e-bike purchases if you earn less than $75,000 per year. This is down from a 30 percent rebate with no income limits in the last version of the bill, which would have been way better, but I guess baby steps?</p>
<h3>The latest e-bikes</h3>
<p>This week a lot of new e-bikes launched. Here&#8217;s a bit of a roundup:</p>
<p>The <strong>Crown Cruiser</strong> is a retro-futuristic looking e-bike with inbuilt smart technologies like anti-theft tech and a gyro and accelerometer sensor that detects impact. The lightweight frame is made out of carbon fiber, it&#8217;s got long-range swappable 36V or 48V batteries with a range of 100 miles or more and its DC hub motor is so powerful the bike can hit top speeds of 31 mph. The Cruiser is currently<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/crowncruiser-carbon-fiber-e-bike#/"> fundraising on Indiegogo</a>, and has received a £139,000 Sustainable Innovation grant from the UK government.</p>
<p><strong>Daymak</strong> has announced the release of their Terra e-bike, part of the company&#8217;s Avvenire series. The bike comes in the Terra Deluxe (targeted MSRP of $3,495) and Terra Ultimate (targeted MSRP of $7,999). With two 15W solar panels that trickle life into the battery and multi-level pedal assist, it can get up to 60miles of range and a max speed of 20 mph. The Terra comes with built-in Bluetooth speakers and a drink holder. It also has launched with RidePoints and Daymak Drive X capabilities, which according to Daymak mean that riders can collect redeemable points via the company&#8217;s EV reward program for just riding around, and that the bike is blockchain-enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Harley-Davidson</strong> is going to offer limited sales through its ebike spinoff<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> <a href="https://www.serial1.com/">Serial 1</a>, of vintage-inspired electric bike model known as the limited edition </span>S1 Series ebike.</p>
<p><strong>Zaiser Motors</strong> announced that it reached its <a href="https://wefunder.com/zaiser.motors">Wefunder campaign goals</a> and has released the specs for its platform redesign, which includes the addition of a second sportier electric motorcycle, the Arrow. Its first &#8220;Electrocycle&#8221; is called the Silhouette and and has 300 miles of range with a 120 mph top speed. Both designs look like something you might make Yoshi drive on Mario Kart, complete with a shiny and bubbly red chassis. The Arrow is designed for city riders, is priced at $8,500 and has an expected range of 160 miles with a 100 mph top speed.</p>
<p>Active lifestyle brand <strong>Retrospec</strong> has released the <a href="https://retrospec.com/products/valen-rev-electric-bike">Valen Rev</a>, a moto-style electric bike that makes me want to cruise alongside a boardwalk on a California beach. Honestly, it&#8217;s a really cute-looking bike, with a retro vibe to it, a tan leather saddle and a choice between fog blue, olive green or black &#8212; all matte. It&#8217;s got a 48V motor, 6 levels of pedal assist and a 50-mile range, all for the reasonable price of $1,799.99.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the number of mobility-related SPAC deals had slowed. That brief pause was broken by Gogoro, the 10-year-old Taiwanese company best known for its electric scooters and swappable battery infrastructure.</p>
<p>The company has agreed to merge with Poema Global, a SPAC affiliated with Princeville Capital, in a deal that sets its enterprise valuation at $2.35 billion. If approved by shareholders. the company will trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the symbol GGR.</p>
<p>Gogoro stands to make $550 million in proceeds, assuming as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gogoro-will-go-public-on-nasdaq-after-2-35b-spac-deal/">TechCrunch Catherine Shu reports</a>, there are no redemptions. (A growing trend I really need to address in this newsletter). Those funds include an oversubscribed private investment in public equity of more than $250 million and $345 million held in trust by Poema Global. Investors in the PIPE include strategic partners like Hon Hai (Foxconn) Technology Group and GoTo, the Indonesian tech giant created through the merger of Gojek and Tokopedia, and new and existing investors like Generation Investment Management, Taiwan&#8217;s National Development Fund, Temasek and Dr. Samuel Yin of Ruentex Group, Gogoro&#8217;s founding investor.</p>
<p>So why now? Founder and CEO Horace Luke provided a curious answer that I know will cause a few of my institutional investor friends to raise an eyebrow or two. Luke first explained that with fresh partnerships in place — Yadea and DCJ in China to build a battery-swapping network and Hero MotoCorp in India to launch scooters — it was time to take the company to the next level.</p>
<p>And he added that Gogoro decided to go the SPAC route because &#8220;you can talk a lot deeper about what the business opportunity is, what the structure is, what the partnerships are, so you can properly value a company rather than a quick roadshow. Given our business plans, it gives us a great opportunity to focus on the expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huh. Anyone ever heard of a &#8220;quick roadshow?&#8221; Comments from some founders who have taken the traditional IPO path would suggest the contrary.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to policy corner. Remember the safety probe the <strong>National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration</strong> opened into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">Tesla Autopilot</a> in August? In case your memory needs refreshing: NHTSA opened a preliminary investigation into 12 (originally eleven) incidents of Tesla cars crashing into parked emergency vehicles. The regulator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/tesla-ordered-to-share-autopilot-data-with-the-us-traffic-safety-agency/">ordered Tesla</a> to hand over detailed data on the ADAS by October 22 or risk facing a fine of up to $115 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, NHTSA sent letters to 12 automakers &#8212; including <strong>Ford</strong>, <strong>VW</strong>, and <strong>General Motors</strong> &#8212; requesting data on their Level 2 ADAS to aid it in its investigation. The <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/525253207/NHTSA-Ford-letter#from_embed&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673497/tesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-data-ford-gm-vw-toyota&amp;xcust=___vg__p_22437538__t_w__r_theverge.com/cars__d_D">letter to Ford</a> says the information request is &#8220;to gather information in support of [the agency&#8217;s] comparative analysis amongst production vehicles equipped with the ability to control both steering and braking/accelerating simultaneously under some circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the data NHTSA is interested in obtaining: the number of vehicles equipped with ADAS the automaker has manufactured; how the company approaches the enforcement of driver attentiveness; other details about the system, like the conditions that would require driver take-over; as well as any consumer complaints, lawsuits, or crash reports related to the system.</p>
<p>Why is this news in policy corner? Well, similar to how each <strong>Supreme Court</strong> adjudication creates the law, the results of NHTSA&#8217;s investigations could also set a precedent for how ADAS is regulated writ large. The agency leveraging its broad authority to gather information could result in new standards or rules for how automakers develop and deploy ADAS in millions of cars now and into the future.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that NHTSA really is empowered with a huge amount of authority &#8212; they could issue a recall of every Tesla on the road, if they so deemed that its Autopilot was sufficiently unsafe.</p>
<p>Speaking of Tesla and GM &#8230; it looks likely that the per-manufacturer cap disqualifying the two automakers&#8217; vehicles from the so-called &#8220;30D&#8221; $7,500 tax credit may be removed soon. They&#8217;re disqualified because each automaker has sold more than 200,000 EVs. Anyway, there are two separate proposals being debated in Congress, one in the House and one in the Senate, as part of a larger effort to overhaul and potentially dramatically expand the 30D credit (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/toyota-honda-urge-congress-to-reject-expanded-tax-incentive-that-would-benefit-ford-gm-stellantis/">I wrote about it here</a>). While the proposals have a few significant differences, removing the manufacturer cap isn&#8217;t one of them. What that means is a Tesla Model 3 or a new Cadillac EV would once again qualify.</p>
<p><strong>One more note &#8230;</strong> Evidently, the <strong>New Jersey Board of Public Utilities</strong> <a href="https://www.njspotlight.com/2021/09/nj-ev-electric-car-incentive-so-popular-paused-so-enough-cash-for-those-already-applied/">halted the approval</a> of new applications for its grant program for purchasing an electric vehicle &#8212; because the $30 million earmarked to cover the program is already nearly out of money! Under the Charge Up New Jersey program, people can apply for grants of up to $5,000 for an EV. But demand is so high that that money is already nearly gone.</p>

<p><strong>Let&#8217;s dig into the news of the week &#8230;</strong></p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Walmart</strong> has tapped <strong>Argo AI</strong> and <strong>Ford</strong> to launch an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/walmart-to-launch-autonomous-delivery-service-with-ford-and-argo-ai/">autonomous vehicle delivery service</a> in Austin, Miami and Washington, D.C. The service will allow customers to place online orders for groceries and other items using Walmart&#8217;s ordering platform. Argo&#8217;s cloud-based infrastructure will be integrated with Walmart&#8217;s online platform, routing the orders and scheduling package deliveries to customers&#8217; homes. Initially, the commercial service will be limited to specific geographic areas in each city and will expand over time. The companies will begin testing later this year.</p>
<h3>Batteries</h3>
<p><strong>Redwood Materials</strong>, the company started by former Tesla co-founder and CTO JB Straubel that aims to create a circular supply chain for batteries, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/jb-straubels-redwood-materials-is-expanding-into-the-battery-materials-business/">expanding beyond recycling</a>. Redwood announced plans to simplify the supply chain by producing critical battery materials and is currently scouting a location for a new million-square-foot factory, at a cost of over $1 billion.</p>
<p>That factory will be dedicated to the production of cathodes and anode foils, the two essential building blocks of a lithium-ion battery structure &#8212; up to a projected volume of 100 gigawatt-hour per year&#8217;s worth of materials, enough for one million electric vehicles, by 2025.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Ford Motor</strong> announced plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck/">invest another $250 million</a> and add 450 jobs to increase production capacity of its upcoming F-150 Lightning to 80,000 all-electric trucks annually. The announcement comes after receiving more than 150,000 pre-orders for the all-electric pickup truck. The additional funds and jobs will be spread out across its new Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center and Rawsonville Components Plant.</p>
<p><strong>Lucid Group</strong>, the all-electric automaker slated to go public this year, said one variant of its upcoming luxury Air sedan has an EPA range of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/lucid-air-snags-the-longest-range-ev-title-surpassing-tesla/">more than 520 miles</a>. The official rating of the Lucid Air Dream Edition Range variant pushes Lucid past Tesla, a company that has long dominated in this category. This announcement not only gives Lucid bragging rights, it reveals a bit about the company&#8217;s strategy to offer a variety of versions of the Air sedan with prices ranging between $169,000 and $77,400.</p>
<p>The <strong>National Transportation Safety Board</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/NTSB_Newsroom/status/1438960100027338753?s=20">announced via Twitter</a> it will investigate a Tesla vehicle crash that killed two people in Coral Gables, Florida. It is not clear if the company&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system Autopilot was engaged at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Polestar</strong> has shared a few more details of its future electric SUV, including that it will have only two rows of seats, offer single-motor and dual-motor versions and have a powertrain that goes beyond EV versions of the Volvo XC90, <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a37575612/polestar-3-suv-details/">Car and Driver reported</a>.</p>
<h3>People news</h3>
<p><strong>Clive Sinclair</strong>, the British entrepreneur and inventor behind the ZX personal computer, pocket calculator and numerous other consumer electronics, died at age 81. Sinclair was also interested in electric vehicles. He invented the infamous Sinclair C5 electric trike, which would spectacularly fail in 1982 only to gain a cult following many years later. Sinclair would invent other electric vehicles, including the electric bike called Sinclair Zike in 1992. He actually spent much of his time in the past 12 years working on personal transportation vehicles like the <a href="http://a-bike.co.uk/">foldable A bike</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ford Motor</strong> has hired Mike Amend as its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/ford-hires-new-chief-digital-information-officer-as-it-seeks-to-expand-into-software-and-services/">chief digital and information officer</a> as the automaker seeks to expand into software, subscriptions and in-vehicle connectivity. Amend, who was president of Lowe&#8217;s Online for three years, will focus on Ford&#8217;s &#8220;use of data, software and technology&#8221; &#8212; all areas central to Ford&#8217;s new Ford+ strategy.</p>
<h3>Misc. bits</h3>
<p><strong>CNBC</strong> writes about headlights and how they&#8217;re undergoing a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/car-headlights-are-more-high-tech-than-ever-tripping-up-regulators.html">technological revolution</a> that has regulators trying to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>Hyundai</strong>, which owns a controlling interest in Boston Dynamics, announced the arrival of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/boston-dynamics-owner-hyundai-deploys-spot-for-factory-safety-monitoring/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">&#8220;Factory Safety Service Robot</a>,&#8221; essentially a modded up version of Spot designed for safety inspections at factories. Naturally, Hyundai is starting close to home, rolling out its first pilot at a Seoul plant for subsidiary, Kia.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Financial Corp.</strong>, the car subscription startup, is considering bankruptcy to eliminate debt, <a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/can-online-retailing-save-fair-technologies?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FBreakingNews+%28Automotive+News+Breaking+News+Feed%29">reported Automotive News</a>. The company now wants to start a vehicle retailing platform called Fair Technologies.</p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"><strong>Reilly Brennan</strong> of Trucks VC has launched a jobs board called <a href="https://mobilityjobs.com">Mobility Jobs </a></span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">that is focused on the future of transportation. Reilly, who has his own well regarded newsletter, is also fan of TechCrunch and so he&#8217;s giving us this code: THESTATION, which gives you dear reader 100% off if you post a job using that special code.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facetune developer <a href="https://www.lightricks.com/">Lightricks</a>, which operates over a dozen subscription-based photo and video editing apps across iOS and Android, now has $130 million in new funding to further grow its business. The company&#8217;s newly announced Series D round includes $100 million in primary and $30 million in secondary funding, and now values the company at $1.8 billion. To date, Lightricks has raised $335 million.</p>
<p>The new round was co-led by New York-based VC firm Insight Partners and Hanaco Venture Capital and includes new investors Migdal Insurance, Altshuler Shaham, and Shavit Capital. Existing investors Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Clal Tech, Harel Insurance and Finance, and Greycroft, also participated.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s last round of funding was its pre-pandemic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/the-maker-of-popular-selfie-app-facetune-just-landed-135-million-at-a-unicorn-valuation/">raise of $135 million</a>, which minted the company as a unicorn.</p>
<p>Based in Jerusalem, Lightricks has been best known for its photo-editing app Facetune, which puts Photoshop-like retouching tools into the hands of consumers. The app quickly gained traction as online influencers tweaked their Instagram photos to look more polished, perfected, and blemish-free. This growth wasn&#8217;t without controversy, however, as some argued how image editing apps like Facetune <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate">took airbrushing too far,</a> contributing to body image issues that now, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">Facebook&#8217;s internal research indicates</a>, could have a negative effect on teenagers&#8217; mental health.</p>
<p>But Facetune was only the beginning for what&#8217;s since become a mobile editing empire for Lightricks, at a time when everyone is trying to look their best online and create compelling content. Over the years, the company has rolled out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/28/facetune-2-puts-a-powerful-photo-editor-in-your-pocket/">more powerful Facetune 2</a>, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/06/facetune-makers-newest-app-enlight-photofox-is-a-powerful-image-editor/">other creativity</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/facetune-makers-latest-app-quickshot-helps-you-take-better-photos/">mobile photo apps</a> that weren&#8217;t focused on selfies. It also expanded its product lineup beyond the creator crowd to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/facetune-maker-lightricks-expands-with-a-trio-of-apps-for-small-businesses/">bring a suite of tools</a> to online marketers and small businesses. And last year, Lightricks more directly responded to the growth in online video as a form of self-expression with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/facetune-maker-lightricks-brings-its-popular-selfie-retouching-features-to-video/">new selfie retouching tool called Facetune Video</a> &#8212; essentially the Facetune for the TikTok era.</p>

<p>The company benefitted from Covid-19 lockdowns, as well, as more people participated online and creators, as a group, became more well-established as a way for brands to reach consumers. During peak lockdowns, the company saw a 90% increase in usage across its apps in the U.S. Meanwhile, downloads for its popular Videoleap video editing apps jumped 70% since the start of the pandemic, as TikTok adoption also grew.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Across its suite of apps, the company now touts 29 million monthly active users, where over 5 million are paid subscribers. Its users average around 78 million monthly exports, indicating Lightricks&#8217; sizable impact on the creator economy. In 2021, Lightricks is on track for over $200 million in revenue and plans to grow that figure by 40% in the year ahead.</p>
<p>To do so, the company&#8217;s strategy will change. Instead of just developing its own apps, it&#8217;s now on the hunt for potential acquisitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our plan is to grow into a one-stop-shop creator platform, supporting creators throughout their journey, from content creation to monetization,&#8221; says Zeev Farbman, CEO and Co-Founder of Lightricks. &#8220;To do so, we are broadening our acquisition activity, while developing other services in-house—our overall M&amp;A objective is advancing our shift into the creator&#8217;s platform. To begin, we are planning between three to five acquisitions, each with a budget of tens of millions of dollars. However, we are also on the lookout for larger ticket size deals if there is enough conviction on both sides,&#8221; he notes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2204983" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2204983" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2204983" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facetune-app-store-screens.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="232" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facetune-app-store-screens.png 4038w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facetune-app-store-screens.png?resize=150,51 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facetune-app-store-screens.png?resize=300,102 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facetune-app-store-screens.png?resize=768,262 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facetune-app-store-screens.png?resize=680,232 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facetune-app-store-screens.png?resize=1536,523 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facetune-app-store-screens.png?resize=2048,697 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facetune-app-store-screens.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2204983" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lightricks</p></div></p>
<p>The company will also enhance its own technology to develop tools and services that will help all creators with content production and monetization, and it will grow its team.</p>
<p>Currently, Lightricks has 460 employees and plans to add 60 more by the end of 2021. The longer-term goal is to grow the team to 1,000 employees by the end of 2023, across roles that include developers, designers, and marketing. While most of this growth to date has taken place in Jerusalem, over the next two years, the company plans to grow its teams locally in Haifa, as well as internationally in  London and Shenzhen. It may add on other locations through M&amp;As, as well.</p>
<p>The U.K. office is now the largest outside of Lightricks&#8217; headquarters, with 23 people. This number is expected to climb to 35 by year-end and be closer to 50 or 60 by the end of 2022, with growth focused on the production of the company&#8217;s new photography app plus Customer Experience and Marketing teams, which were previously only in Israel.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Lightricks is focused on content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our U.S.-based activity will focus mostly on our content efforts that will provide a vast array of original, acquired, and co-produced content to inspire, educate and entertain creators across the entirety of their careers,&#8221; notes Farbman. &#8220;This includes written, video, audio, short and long-form, fun and informative content,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Investors say they see the potential for Lightricks to continue to grow as the creator economy booms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The creator economy has changed the way we, as a society, experience social networks,&#8221; said Pasha Romanovski, Co-Founding Partner of Hanaco Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Audiences constantly consume information through the different content channels daily. Lightricks’ platform enables creators to have a broader, more professional, and higher-quality set of tools to optimize content. At a time when we are seeing content creators monetize content on social media at new levels, it is clear that Lightricks&#8217; platform has the ability to create a one-stop shop that will be meaningful to its users,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, TechCrunch is excited to announce the 20 startups pitching on stage in this year&#8217;s Startup Battlefield. Selected from the most competitive batch in TC history, selected founders from across the globe will pitch on the virtual stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>. Startups will be competing for $100,000 in equity-free prize money and the attention of international press and top investors from around the world.</p>
<p>With just over a 1.5% acceptance rate, the startups in this year&#8217;s cohort are phenomenal. From lithium battery chemical recycling to smart media, blockchain infrastructure to student-centric educational software, and Sub-Saharan African fin tech to cultured meat production, this batch of companies is sure to wow the investors and the audience. Startups featured range across all verticals with groundbreaking innovation in ag tech, women&#8217;s genetics and lifestyle based therapeutics, cyber security, lasers, fin tech and consumer hardware.</p>
<p>TC aims to pick companies from a range of industries. It&#8217;s apparent that this next wave of founders are very much focused on building unicorns and also building deeply impactful technologies.  A unique highlight of this batch are more companies in both the healthtech/medtech space and clean tech/sustainability space.</p>
<p>Each founder has trained with the Startup Battlefield team to develop their pitch, craft their stories, polish their launch strategy, strengthen their go to market and create amazing live product demos so <em>you</em> can see the innovation first hand. Each team will have six minutes to pitch followed by a six-minute Q&amp;A with our esteemed panel of judges &#8211; all experts in VC and successful companies. On Thursday, a select few startups will pitch in the Startup Battlefield Final Round &#8212; with a new panel of expert judges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Business, now more than ever before, is going digital, and today a startup that&#8217;s building a vertically integrated solution to meet business banking needs is announcing a big round of funding to tap into the opportunity. <a href="https://www.airwallex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airwallex</a> &#8212; which provides business banking services both directly to businesses themselves, as well as via a set of APIs that power other companies&#8217; fintech products &#8212; has raised $200 million, a Series E round of funding that values the Australian startup at $4 billion.</p>
<p>Lone Pine Capital is leading the round, with new backers G Squared and Vetamer Capital Management, and previous backers 1835i Ventures (formerly ANZi), DST Global, Salesforce Ventures and Sequoia Capital China, also participating.</p>
<p>The funding brings the total raised by Airwallex &#8212; which has head offices in Hong Kong and Melbourne, Australia &#8212; to date to $700 million, including a $100 million injection that closed out its Series D just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/cross-border-fintech-airwallex-raises-100m-series-d-extension-at-new-valuation-of-2-6b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six months ago</a>.</p>
<p>Airwallex will be using the funding both to continue investing in its product and technology, as well as to continue its geographical expansion and to focus on some larger business targets. The company has started to make some headway into Europe and the UK and that will be one big focus, along with the U.S.</p>
<p>The quick succession of funding, and that rising valuation, underscore Airwallex&#8217;s traction to date around what CEO and co-founder Jack Zhang describes as a vertically integrated strategy.</p>
<p>That involves two parts. First, Airwallex has built all the infrastructure for the business banking services that it provides directly to businesses with a focus on small and medium enterprise customers. Second, it has packaged up that infrastructure into a set of APIs that a variety of other companies use to provide financial services directly to their customers without needing to build those services themselves &#8212; the so-called &#8220;embedded finance&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to own the whole ecosystem,&#8221; Zhang said to me. &#8220;We want to be like the Apple of business finance.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That seems to be working out so far for Airwallex. Revenues were up almost 150% for the first half of 2021 compared to a year before, with the company processing more than US$20 billion for a global client portfolio that has quadrupled in size. In addition to tens of thousands of SMEs, it also, via APIs, powers financial services for other companies like GOAT, Papaya Global and Stake.</p>
<p>Airwallex got its start like many of the strongest startups do: it was built to solve a problem that the founders encountered themselves. In the case of Airwallex, Zhang tells me he had actually been working on a previous start-up idea. He wanted to build the &#8220;Blue Bottle Coffee&#8221; of Asia Pacific out of Australia, and it involved buying and importing a lot of different materials, packaging and of course coffee from all around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that making payments as a small business was slow and expensive,&#8221; he said, since it involved banks in different countries and different banking systems, manual efforts to transfer money between them and many days to clear the payments. &#8220;But that was also my background &#8212; payments and trading &#8212; and so I decided that it was a much more fascinating problem for me to work on and resolve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually one of his co-founders in the coffee effort came along, with the four co-founders of Airwallex ultimately including Zhang, along with Xijing Dai, Lucy Liu and Max Li.</p>
<p>It was 2014, and Airwallex got attention from VCs early on in part for being in the right place at the right time. A wave of startups building financial services for SMBs were definitely gaining ground in North America and Europe, filling a long-neglected hole in the technology universe, but there was almost nothing of the sort in the Asia Pacific region, and in those earlier days solutions were highly regionalized.</p>
<p>From there it was a no-brainer that starting with cross-border payments, the first thing Airwallex tackled, would soon grow into a wider suite of banking services involving payments and other cross-border banking services.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;In last 6 years, we&#8217;ve built more than 50 bank integrations and now offer payments across 95 countries payments through a partner network,&#8221; he added, with 43 of those offering real-time transactions. From that, it moved on the bank accounts and &#8220;other primitive stuff&#8221; with card issuance and more, he said, eventually building an end-to-end payment stack. </span></p>
<p>Airwallex has tens of thousands of customers using its financial services directly, and they make up about 40% of its revenues today. The rest is the interesting turn the company decided to take to expand its business.</p>
<p>Airwallex had built all of its technology from the ground up itself, and it found that &#8212; given the wave of new companies looking for more ways to engage customers and become their one-stop shop &#8212; there was an opportunity to package that tech up in a set of APIs and sell that on to a different set of customers, those who also provided services for small businesses. That part of the business now accounts for 60% of Airwallex&#8217;s business, Zhang said, and is growing faster in terms of revenues. (The SMB business is growing faster in terms of customers, he said.)</p>
<p>A lot of embedded finance startups that base their business around building tech to power other businesses tend to stay arm&#8217;s length from offering financial services directly to consumers. The explanation I have heard is that they do not wish to compete against their customers. Zhang said that Airwallex takes a different approach, by being selective about the customers they partner with, so that the financial services they offer would never be the kind that would not be in direct competition. The <a href="https://www.goat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOAT</a> marketplace for sneakers, or Papaya Global&#8217;s HR platform are classic examples of this.</p>
<p>However, as Airwallex continues to grow, you can&#8217;t help but wonder whether one of those partners might like to gobble up all of Airwallex and take on some of that service provision role itself. In that context, it&#8217;s very interesting to see Salesforce Ventures returning to invest even more in the company in this round, given how widely the company has expanded from its early roots in software for salespeople into a massive platform providing a huge range of cloud services to help people run their businesses.</p>
<p>For now, it&#8217;s been the combination of its unique roots in Asia Pacific, plus its vertical approach of building its tech from the ground up, plus its retail acumen that has impressed investors and may well see Airwallex stay independent and grow for some time to come.</p>
<p>“Airwallex has a clear competitive advantage in the digital payments market,” said David Craver, MD at Lone Pine Capital, in a statement. “Its unique Asia-Pacific roots, coupled with its innovative infrastructure, products and services, speak volumes about the business’ global growth opportunities and its impressive expansion in the competitive payment providers space. We are excited to invest in Airwallex at this dynamic time, and look forward to helping drive the company&#8217;s expansion and success worldwide.”</p>
<p><em>Updated to note that the coffee business was in Australia, not Hong Kong.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Weeks after Amazon introduced an updated Fire TV lineup that included, for the first time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/amazon-is-releasing-its-own-tvs-with-alexa-built-in/">its own TVs</a>, Roku today is announcing its own competitive products in a race to capture consumers&#8217; attention before the holiday shopping season. Its updates include a new Roku Streaming Stick 4K and Roku Streaming Stick 4K+ &#8212; the latter which ships with Roku&#8217;s newer hands-free voice remote. The company is also refreshing the Roku Ultra LT, a Walmart-exclusive version of its high-end player. And it announced the latest software update, Roku OS 10.5, which adds updated voice features, a new Live TV channel for home screens, and other minor changes.</p>
<p>The new Streaming Stick 4K builds on Roku&#8217;s four-year-old <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/roku-unveils-a-new-streaming-player-lineup-plus-roku-os-9-2-launch/">product</a>, the Streaming Stick+, as it offers the same type of stick form factor designed to be hidden behind the TV set. This version, however, has a faster processor which allows the device to boot up to 30% faster and load channels more quickly, Roku claims. The Wi-Fi is also improved, offering faster speeds and smart algorithms that help make sure users get on the right band for the best performance in their homes where network congestion is an increasingly common problem  &#8212; especially with the pandemic-induced remote work lifestyle. The new Stick adds support for Dolby Vision and HDR 10+, giving it the &#8220;4K&#8221; moniker.</p>

<p>This version ships with Roku&#8217;s standard voice remote for the same price of $49.99. For comparison,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/amazon-is-releasing-its-own-tvs-with-alexa-built-in/"> Amazon&#8217;s new</a> Fire TV Stick Max with a faster processor and speedier Wi-Fi is $54.99. However, Amazon is touting the addition of Wi-Fi 6 and support for its game streaming service, Luna, as reasons to upgrade.</p>
<p>Roku&#8217;s new Streaming Stick 4K+ adds the Roku Voice Remote Pro to the bundle instead. This is Roku&#8217;s new remote, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/roku-launches-a-rechargeable-hands-free-voice-remote-and-other-devices-rolls-out-roku-os-10/">launched in the spring</a>, that offers rechargeability, a lost remote finder, and hands-free voice support via its mid-field microphone, so you can just say things like &#8220;hey Roku, turn on the TV,&#8221; or &#8220;launch Netflix,&#8221; instead of pressing buttons. Bought separately, this remote is $29.99. The bundle sells for $69.99, which translates to a $10 discount over buying the stick and remote by themselves.</p>

<p>Both versions of the Streaming Stick will be sold online and in stores starting in October.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Roku Ultra LT ($79.99), built for Walmart exclusively, has also been refreshed with a faster processor, more storage, a new Wi-Fi radio with up to 50% longer range, support for Dolby Vision, Bluetooth audio streaming, and a built-in ethernet port.</p>
<p>Plus, Roku notes that TCL will become the first device partner to use the reference designs it introduced at CES for wireless soundbars, with its upcoming Roku TV wireless soundbar. This device connects over Wi-Fi to the TV and works with the Roku remote, and will arrive at major retailers in October where it will sell for $179.99.</p>
<p>The other big news is Roku&#8217;s OS 10.5 software release. The update isn&#8217;t making any dramatic changes this time around, but is instead focused largely on voice and mobile improvements.</p>
<p>The most noticeable consumer-facing change is the ability to add a new Live TV channel to your home screen which lets you more easily launch The Roku Channel&#8217;s 200+ free live TV channels, instead of having to first visit Roku&#8217;s free streaming hub directly, then navigate to the Live TV section. This could make the Roku feel more like traditional TV for cord-cutters abandoning their TV guide for the first time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2204894" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-OS-10.5.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-OS-10.5.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-OS-10.5.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-OS-10.5.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-OS-10.5.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-OS-10.5.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-OS-10.5.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Other tweaks include expanded support for launching channels using voice commands, with most now supported; new voice search and podcast playback with a more visual &#8220;music and podcast&#8221; row and Spotify as a launch partner; the ability to control sound settings in the mobile app; an added Voice Help guide in settings; and additional sound configuration options for Roku speakers and soundbars (e.g. using the speaker pairs and soundbar in a left/center/right) or in full 5.1 surround sound system).</p>
<p>A handy feature for entering in email and passwords in set-up screens using voice commands is new, too. Roku says it sends the voice data off-device to its speech-to-text partner, and the audio is anonymized. Roku doesn&#8217;t get the password or store it, as it goes directly to the channel partner. While there are always privacy concerns with voice data, the addition is a big perk from an accessibility standpoint.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2204891" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2204891" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2204891" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-Audio_3.1-configuration.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-Audio_3.1-configuration.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-Audio_3.1-configuration.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-Audio_3.1-configuration.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-Audio_3.1-configuration.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-Audio_3.1-configuration.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-Audio_3.1-configuration.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-Audio_3.1-configuration.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2204891" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roku</p></div></p>
<p>One of the more under-the-radar, but potentially useful changes coming in OS 10.5 is an advanced A/V sync feature that lets you use the smartphone camera to help Roku make further refinements to the audio delay when using wireless headphones to listen to the TV. This feature is offered through the mobile app.</p>
<p>The Roku mobile app in the U.S. is also gaining another feature with the OS 10.5 update with the addition of a new Home tab for browsing collections of movies and shows across genres, and a &#8220;Save List, which functions as a way to bookmark shows or movies you might hear about &#8212; like when chatting with friends &#8212; and want to remember to watch later when you&#8217;re back home in front of the TV.</p>
<p>The software update will roll out to Roku devices over the weeks ahead. It typically comes to Roku players first, then rolls out to TVs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Flippa uses a proprietary business valuation tool and algorithm to match online business owners to qualified buyers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://flippa.com/">Flippa</a>, an online marketplace to buy and sell online businesses and digital assets, announced its first venture-backed round, an $11 million Series A, as it sees over 600,000 monthly searches from investors looking to connect with business owners.</p>
<p>OneVentures led the round and was joined by existing investors Andrew Walsh (former Hitwise CEO), Flippa co-founders Mark Harbottle and Matt Mickiewicz, 99designs, as well as new investors Catch.com.au founders Gabby and Hezi Leibovich; RetailMeNot.com founders Guy King and Bevan Clarke; and Reactive Media founders Tim O’Neill and Tim Fouhy.</p>
<p>The company, with bases in both Austin and Australia, was started in 2009 and facilitates exits for millions of online business owners, some that operate on e-commerce marketplaces, blogs, SaaS and apps, the newest data integration being for Shopify, Blake Hutchison, CEO of Flippa, told TechCrunch.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Berlin Brands Group, now valued at $1B+, raises $700M to buy and scale merchants that sell on marketplaces like Amazon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/berlin-brands-group-now-valued-at-1b-raises-700m-to-buy-and-scale-merchants-that-sell-on-marketplaces-like-amazon/embed/#?secret=f0sr5ir0o6" data-secret="f0sr5ir0o6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He considers Flippa to be “the investment bank for the 99%,” of small businesses, providing an end-to end platform that includes a proprietary valuation product for businesses — processing over 4,000 valuations each month — and a matching algorithm to connect with qualified buyers.</p>
<p>Business owners can sell their companies directly through the platform and have the option to bring in a business broker or advisor. The company also offers due diligence and acquisition financing from Thrasio-owned Yardline Capital and a new service called Flippa Legal.</p>
<p>“Our strategy is verification at the source, i.e. data,” Hutchison said. “Users can currently connect to Stripe, QuickBooks Online, WooCommerce, Google Analytics and Admob for apps, which means they can expose their online business performance with one-click, and buyers can seamlessly assess financial and operational performance.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/e-commerce-sales-retail-sales-ten-year-review/">Online retail, as a share of total retail sales</a>, grew to 19.6% in 2020, up from 15.8% in 2019, driven largely by the global pandemic as sales shifted online while brick-and-mortar stores closed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/amazon/number-of-sellers">Amazon has 6 million sellers</a>, and <a href="https://popupsmart.com/blog/shopify-statistics#:~:text=Shopify%20Stats%3A%20Your%20Questions%20Answered,-How%20many%20Shopify&amp;text=Shopify%20merchants%20run%20over%201%2C000%2C000%20businesses%20in%20175%20different%20countries.">Shopify sellers</a> run over 1 million businesses. This has led to an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/berlin-brands-group-now-valued-at-1b-raises-700m-to-buy-and-scale-merchants-that-sell-on-marketplaces-like-amazon/">emergence of e-commerce aggregators</a>, backed by venture capital dollars, that are scooping up successful businesses to grow, finding many through Flippa’s marketplace, Hutchison said.</p>
<p>Flippa has over 3 million registered users and added 300,000 new registered users in the past 12 months. Overall transaction volume grows 100% year over year. Though being bootstrapped for over a decade, the company’s growth and opportunity drove Hutchison to go after venture capital dollars.</p>
<p>“There is a huge movement toward this being recognized as an asset class,” he said. “At the moment, the asset class is undervalued and driving a massive swarm as investors snap up businesses and aggregate them together. We see the future of these aggregators becoming ‘X company for apps’ or ‘X for blogs.’ ”</p>
<p>As such, the new funding will be used to double the company’s headcount to more than 100 people as it builds out its offices globally, as well as establishing outposts in Melbourne, San Francisco and Austin. The company will also invest in marketing and product development to scale its business valuation tool that Hutchison likens to the “Zillow Zestimate,” but for online businesses.</p>
<p>Nigel Dews, operating partner at OneVentures, has been following Flippa since it started. His firm is one of the oldest venture capital firms in Australia and has 30 companies in its portfolio focused on healthcare and technology.</p>
<p>He believes the company will create meaningful change for small businesses. The team combined with Flippa’s ability to connect buyers and sellers puts the company in a strong leadership position to take advantage of the marketplace effect.</p>
<p>“Flippa is an incredible opportunity for us,” he added. “You don’t often get a world-leading business in a brand new category with incredible tailwinds. We also liked that the company is based in Australia, but half of its revenue comes from the U.S.”</p>

<p>To be sure, a huge chunk of Netflix&#8217;s Emmy harvest came from the 34 Creative Arts Emmys it won last week. However, it still took a further 10 primetime Emmys including acting awards for Olivia Colman, Gillian Anderson and Josh O&#8217;Connor in <em>The Crown</em>, along with Ewan McGregor in <em>Halston</em>. <em>The Crown</em> also won for writing and directing, while taking the prestigious best drama series prize. Netflix&#8217;s The Queen&#8217;s Gambit, starring Anya Taylor-Joy, won for best limited series.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Apple TV+ had its best Emmys yet with 10 total, including seven in primetime. It dominated the comedy series category with seven wins for <em>Ted Lasso</em>, including three in the acting category for Brett Goldstein and Hannah Waddingham (best supporting actors) along with Jason Sudeikis (best actor). <em>Ted Lasso</em> also took the award for best comedy series.</p>
<p>Thanks in large part to that series, Apple TV+ fared much better than its rivals. Disney+ did beat it with 14 awards total, up from eight in 2020, but only one of those was a primetime Emmy (<em>Hamilton</em> for best pre-recorded variety special). Amazon and Hulu were completely shut out in 2021, after both won Emmys in 2020.</p>
<p>HBO and HBO Max led all rivals with 130 nominations and took 19 Emmys, including 9 in primetime. The biggest winners last night were Jean Smart for <em>Hacks</em> (best actress in a comedy series) and Kate Winslet for <em>Mare of Easstown</em>(best actress in a limited series). After she was controversially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-and-the-crown-win-big-at-the-golden-globe-awards-091701851.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">shut out</a> of the Golden Globes nominations, Michaela Coel took the prize for best writing in a limited series for <em>I May Destroy You</em>.</p>
<p>It was notable in 2018 when Netflix managed to tie a cable network, HBO (pre-HBO Max), for the most Emmy wins. This year, it beat all rivals by a long way, and streaming platforms overall took the top four spots. Whether that can continue when the pandemic starts to wane — and subscription growth declines — remains to be seen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eli Electric Vehicles, an early stage compact EV manufacturer, announced the start of production on its flagship Eli Zero, a micro &#8220;neighborhood electric vehicle&#8221; that is built for city commuting. The company plans to roll out small batches of the two-seater EV to distributors across 13 European countries over the next few months with a starting price of $11,999.</p>
<p>Micro-electric vehicles are on the rise with other compact quadricycles coming to market recently, including the <a href="https://www.renault.co.uk/electric-vehicles/twizy.html">Renault Twizy</a>, the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Citro%C3%ABn+Ami.&amp;oq=Citro%C3%ABn+Ami.&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30l9.1372j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Citroën Ami</a>, the <a href="https://newatlas.com/urban-transport/triggo-tilting-electric-quadricycle/">tilting Triggo EV</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/squad-mobility-eyes-shared-platforms-as-target-for-its-compact-solar-electric-quadricycle/">Squad Mobility solar-assisted car</a>. In terms of pricing, the Eli is at the higher end of the spectrum along with the Twizy at a starting price of around $16,000. For comparison, the Ami costs around $6,000 and the Squad car costs $6,790.</p>
<p>While Eli is based in Los Angeles, its manufacturing partner is in China, and ongoing geopolitical tensions are part of  the reason the company is pursuing a European strategy initially. The varied laws per state on what maketh a street legal vehicle also make it difficult to go to market in the U.S. first, according to Marcus Li, CEO and founder of Eli. In Europe, the Zeros are street legal and there is already a culture around smaller, compact cars that don&#8217;t go too fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a lot of European cities, for example in Paris, they now have very strict legal speed limit of 30 kilometers per hour (19 mph), and I think we see that being a trend in European cities like Vienna and Amsterdam,&#8221; Li told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The Zero, which is built of recyclable polypropylene and high-strength aluminium, has a top speed of 25 miles per hour. It&#8217;s about 7 feet long, 4.5 feet wide and 5 feet high with a storage capacity of 160 liters. The batteries have a 5.8 kWh capacity, a range of 50 miles and can charge from 0 to 100 percent in 2.5 hours at 220 volts.</p>
<p>The micro-vehicle also has power-assisted braking and steering, a rear camera, a parking sensor and other internal features like a USB charging port, cup holders, heat and cooling, a tiltable sunroof and a 7 inch dashboard display. The basic colors are pearl white and silver, and the premium colors available are graphite and baby blue.</p>
<p>Eli also recently announced its equity crowdfunding campaign<a href="https://www.startengine.com/eli"> via StartEngine platform</a>. At the time of publishing this article, the company had raised $224,705 that it will use to fund further production. Li said the company has more reservations than it does vehicles at the moment, which he reckons is a good problem to have.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eli had previously raised around $1.4 million on StartEngine&#8217;s platform and to date, has raised over $6.5 million. Li said the company had attempted to seek VC funding last year, but VCs only wanted to invest if Eli would use its vehicle for car sharing.</p>
<p>&#8220;At some point, to be honest, we did think about pivoting to car sharing because that&#8217;s just the feedback from most institutional investors,&#8221; said Li. &#8220;Their business model is a little different from conventional hardware companies in terms of return on investment, and they would have preferred that we go more into a car sharing and high valuation model to see a return three years down the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>Li said one investment group was ready to invest if Eli agreed to do the operations of a car sharing platform themselves, but this was just before the pandemic and ultimately, he&#8217;s glad the company didn&#8217;t pivot in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re taking a very traditional approach to sales,&#8221; said Li. &#8220;We&#8217;re not doing B2C. We&#8217;re selling through an established distributor called KSR Group and they have their launch strategy first to Austria, Germany and Switzerland and then to more countries in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using a distributor helps Eli as an early stage startup so they can outsource things like servicing, deliveries and test drives, says Li.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to revolutionize urban trips, connect cities and communities in a new way that reduces congestion and pollution.,” said Li in a statement. “As urban areas continue to grow along with a rapidly changing climate, opening up a space for micro-EVs like Eli ZERO that is energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The virtual diabetes clinic is designed to provide people living with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes access to personalized care and affordable medications from their homes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founders like to create companies around what they know, and Frank Westermann and Anton Kittelberger know diabetes.</p>
<p>They met and bonded over both having type 1 diabetes — Westermann was diagnosed over 25 years ago — and started the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/11/digital-health-startup-mysugr-gets-4-8m-to-make-diabetes-suck-less/">MySugr</a> app for diabetes self-management in 2012 (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/06/mysugr-wins-techcrunch-vienna-as-the-city-proves-its-startups-mettle/">they won a TC pitch-off back in 2011</a>). Four years later, Westermann moved to the U.S. from Austria to introduce MySugr stateside before the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/07/diabetes-platform-mysugr-exits-to-roche-for-as-much-as-100m/">acquired by Roche</a> for $100 million in 2017.</p>
<p>The pair moved on to their next journey, also in diabetes, starting <a href="https://www.9am.health/">9am.health</a> in April, a virtual diabetes clinic designed to provide people living with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes access to personalized care and affordable medications from their homes. 9am.health’s clinic was launched in August.</p>
<p>Today, the San Diego-based company announced a $3.7 million seed round from Founders Fund, Define Ventures, Speedinvest and iSeed Ventures to target the <a href="https://www.livescience.com/10195-1-3-americans-diabetes-2050-cdc.html">1 in 3 people living with diabetes in the United States</a>, Westermann told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We understand the day-to-day challenges that people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes have,” he added. “Access to care is the real issue, and rather than have patients wait weeks to get an appointment, we send a kit with tests to your home, and you send it back to us.”</p>

<p>9am.health kicked off in Texas and California, and is now available in 33 states. It is finding patients through digital outreach, community work and hospitals.</p>
<p>Even with insurance, the average person living with diabetes<a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/early/2018/03/20/dci18-0007"> spends about $16,750 per year</a> on medical expenses and has approximately<a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/early/2018/03/20/dci18-0007"> 2.3 times higher</a> the costs than if they didn’t have the disease. Instead, patients can subscribe to 9am.health for $40 per month; that includes online prescription shipping, unlimited personal medical care, medications to manage diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidemia and at-home lab tests.</p>
<p>Westermann sees other companies working in the diabetes space, but says 9am.health is unique in providing “a digital front door for entire diabetes care,” while others focus on specific pain points. By taking that whole approach, he sees opportunity in going beyond diabetes to the general chronic disease realm as many living with diabetes — 98% of Americans in fact — also have other comorbidities like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and mental health issues, he added.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to grow its team and carve out some of the <a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/digital-diabetes-management-market-2021-growth-analysis-top-trends-and-forecasts-till-2027/">digital diabetes market share</a> that was valued at $13 billion in 2020 and is forecasted to grow annually by 18.8% through 2027. 9am.health will also invest in advancing its virtual screening ability and expand the types of medication it can offer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2204649" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2204649" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2204649" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg 3839w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2204649" class="wp-caption-text">9am.health diabetes kit</p></div></p>
<p>“We want to tear down the barriers and make care as easy as possible and managing diabetes part of life,” Westermann said. “When you live with chronic illness, it is an everyday thing, and sometimes you feel good, and others days you don’t. That’s why we named the company 9am.health because you can wake up at 9 a.m. and start your diabetes journey all over again.”</p>
<p>Lynne Chou O’Keefe, founder and managing partner at Define Ventures, says the future of healthcare is going to be more consumer-focused and will be wrapped around the patient’s care journey. She considers 9am.health to be leading this type of care with a platform that bundles education, community, coaching and care that is direct-to-consumer.</p>
<p>Chou O’Keefe has been investing in healthcare her entire VC career, and sat on the board of Livongo for four years. Through that experience she learned how patients struggle with their care decisions, and finds 9am.health’s founders to have a similar deep expertise and understanding in diabetes, especially with the success they had with MySugr.</p>
<p>“The last place you should receive healthcare is in the doctor’s office, while the first place should be wherever you are,” she added. “This is a very different way than what the healthcare system is today. We feel that people want to manage their diabetes, but then go on and live their lives.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s lead privacy regulator in Europe has raised concerns about a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/facebook-debuts-its-ray-ban-stories-smart-sunglasses/">pair of &#8216;smart&#8217; Ray-Ban sunglasses</a> the tech giant is now selling. The glasses include a face-mounted camera which can be used to take pictures and short videos with a verbal cue.</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) said <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/latest-news/data-protection-commission-statement-concerning-facebook-view-glasses">Friday</a> that it&#8217;s asked the tech giant to demonstrate that an LED indicator light also mounted on the specs &#8212; which lights up when the user is taking a video &#8212; is an effective way of putting other people on notice that they are being recorded by the wearer.</p>
<p>Italy&#8217;s privacy watchdog, the Garante, already<a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9698698"> raised concerns</a> about Facebook&#8217;s smart glasses &#8212; but Ireland has an outsized role as a regulator for the tech giant owing to where the company&#8217;s regional base is located.</p>
<p>Facebook announced what it couched as the &#8220;next step&#8221; on the road to making a pair of augmented reality &#8216;smart&#8217; glasses a full <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/facebook-ar-glasses-2021/">year ago</a> &#8212; saying initial specs would not include any AR but announcing a multi-year partnership luxury eyewear giant Luxottica, as it seemingly planned for a pipeline of increasingly feature-loaded &#8216;smart&#8217; eyewear.</p>
<p>The first Facebook Ray-Ban-branded specs went on sale earlier this month &#8212; looking mostly like a standard pair of sunglasses but containing two 5 MP cameras mounted on the front that enable the user to take video of whatever they&#8217;re looking at and upload it to a new Facebook app called View. (The sunglasses also contain in-frame speakers so the user can listen to music and take phone calls.)</p>
<p>The specs also include a front mounted LED light which is supposed to switch on to indicate when a video is being recorded. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">However European regulators are concerned that what the DPC describes as a &#8220;very small&#8221; indicator is an inadequate mechanism for alerting people to the risk they are being recorded.</span></p>
<p>Facebook has not demonstrated it conducted comprehensive field testing of the device with a view to assessing the privacy risk it may pose, it added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;While it is accepted that many devices including smart phones can record third party individuals, it is generally the case that the camera or the phone is visible as the device by which recording is happening, thereby putting those captured in the recordings on notice. With the glasses, there is a very small indicator light that comes on when recording is occurring. It has not been demonstrated to the DPC and Garante that comprehensive testing in the field was done by Facebook or Ray-Ban to ensure the indicator LED light is an effective means of giving notice,&#8221; the DPC wrote.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s lead EU data protection regulator goes on to say it is calling on the tech giant to &#8220;confirm and demonstrate that the LED indicator light is effective for its purpose and to run an information campaign to alert the public as to how this new consumer product may give rise to less obvious recording of their images&#8221;.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Facebook has been contacted with questions. </span>It is not clear whether Facebook engaged with any EU privacy regulators during the design of the smart glasses. Nor whether or when they might launch in more markets across Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>A Facebook spokesperson said: “We know people have questions about new technologies and how they work and it’s important to us that we are part of this conversation. We will be working together with our regulatory partners, including the Irish DPC as our lead regulator, to help people understand more about how this new technology works, and the controls they have.”</p>
<p>The company also claimed that it engaged with the DPC ahead of the launch of the specs and said it continues to do so.</p>
<p>It also pointed out that the glasses include an off switch.</p>
<p>The specs went on sale earlier this month &#8212; costing $299 in the US. Facebook confirmed they are also currently on sale in Ireland and Italy in the EU and in the UK.</p>
<p>Over the years, Facebook has delayed (or even halted) some of its product launches in Europe following regulatory concerns &#8212; including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/facebook-turns-off-facial-recognition-in-the-eu-gets-the-all-clear-from-irelands-data-protection-commissioner-on-its-review/">facial tagging feature</a> (which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/20/just-say-no/">later reintroduced in another form</a>).</p>
<p>The launch of Facebook&#8217;s dating service in Europe was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-dating-launches-in-europe-after-9-month-delay-over-privacy-concerns/">delayed for more than nine months</a> &#8212; and arrived with some claimed changes after an intervention by the DPC.</p>
<p>There are also<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/14/whatsapp-will-not-share-user-data-with-facebook-until-it-complies-with-gdpr-ico-closes-investigation/"> ongoing limits</a> on how the Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp can share data with Facebook itself in Europe, again owing to regulatory push back. Although plenty of data does still flow from WhatsApp to Facebook in the EU and &#8212; zooming out &#8212; scores of privacy complaints against the tech giant remain under investigation in the region, meaning these issues are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/">undecided and unenforced</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">Earlier this month</a> Ireland&#8217;s DPC did announce its first decision against a Facebook company (under the EU&#8217;s GDPR)  &#8212; hitting WhatsApp with a $267 penalty related to transparency failures. However the DPC has multiple unresolved complaints against Facebook or Facebook-owned businesses still on its desk.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">January</a> the Irish regulator also agreed to &#8220;swiftly&#8221; resolve a (pre-GDPR) 2013 complaint against Facebook&#8217;s data transfers out of the EU to the US. That <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/facebook-loses-last-ditch-attempt-to-derail-dpc-decision-on-its-eu-us-data-flows/">decision is still pending too</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Speaking of Amazon &#8212; which is reportedly conducting an investigation to find whether its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/amazon-starts-probe-over-bribe-to-govt-officials-by-its-lawyers-in-india-report-says/">lawyers bribed government officials in India</a> &#8212; the company announced today it plans to roll out the voice shopping experience feature in the Hindi language in the South Asian market ahead of the Diwali festival in early November.</p>
<p>The e-commerce giant, which rolled out the voice shopping experience in English last year, said the feature in the Hindi language &#8212; which will roll out in “coming weeks” &#8212; will enable users to search for products and check their order status using voice commands such as “joote dikhao,” which is Hindi for ‘show me shoes.’</p>
<p>Only 10% of India’s 1.3 billion people speak English. And in recent years, voice search has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-typing-the-internets-next-billion-users-will-use-video-and-voice-1502116070">dramatically surged in India</a> as many new internet users find it difficult to type on virtual keyboards. Scores of tech companies &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/flipkart-hindi-free-video-streaming/">Amazon&#8217;s rival, Flipkart</a> &#8212; have in recent years made push to add support for more regional languages, or introduce support for voice queries &#8212; and in some cases, do both.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s voice shopping experience will be available to only Android users, the company said.</p>
<p>“Since the launch of voice shopping in 2020, we are humbled to see by the adoption of voice by Amazon.in customers to fulfil their shopping needs has grown by 2X year-on-year. We will continue to focus on bringing new features for our customers on voice to make their shopping experience exciting and fulfilling,” said Kishore Thota, Director of Customer Experience and Marketing at Amazon India, in a statement.</p>
<p>The new rollout is part of a broader localization push from the company. Amazon said today that its website and apps are now also available in Marathi and Bengali. The website already supports five additional regional languages &#8212; Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu.</p>
<p>“Our aim with regional language shopping experience is to make ecommerce accessible, relevant and convenient for customers. Every month, tens of millions of customers visit Amazon.in in regional languages and 90% of the customers are from tier 2 and below cities. This festive season we are happy to expand the Amazon.in experience for our customers in Marathi and Bengali,” said Thota.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indian news outlet The Ken <a href="https://the-ken.com/story/amazons-alexa-is-building-payments-from-india-for-the-world/">reported last week</a> that Amazon was also working on building a voice-based payments authentication system. The company declined to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has launched an investigation into the conduct of its legal representatives in India following a complaint from a whistleblower who alleged that one or more of the company&#8217;s reps had bribed government officials, Indian news and analysis outlet the Morning Context <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/amazon-whistleblower-alleges-india-lawyers-bribed-officials">reported on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>The company is investigating whether legal fees financed by it was used for bribing government officials, the report said, which cited unnamed sources and didn&#8217;t identify the government officials. Amazon has placed Rahul Sundaram, a senior corporate counsel, on leave, the <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/amazon-whistleblower-alleges-india-lawyers-bribed-officials">report</a> (paywalled) added.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson said the company has “zero tolerance” for corruption, but didn&#8217;t comment on the investigation.</p>
<p>“We take allegations of improper actions seriously, investigate them fully, and take appropriate action. We are not commenting on specific allegations or the status of any investigation at this time,” the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>India is one of the key overseas markets for Amazon. The American e-commerce firm has invested <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">over $6.5 billion in its South Asian nation’s operations</a> and aggressively expanded to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/amazon-announces-250-million-venture-fund-for-indian-startups/">multiple categories in recent years</a>.</p>
<p>The new development comes months after Reuters reported that Amazon had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/indian-trader-group-calls-for-ban-on-amazon-following-dodging-regulations-claims/">secretly favored big sellers</a>, misrepresented its ties with those firms, and used such arrangements to circumvent the South Asian nation&#8217;s foreign investment rules.</p>
<p>Amazon is also subject of an ongoing antitrust investigation in India. A top level executive at the company, which made an unsuccessful attempt to appeal against that investigation, was summoned and questioned earlier this year by local police over allegations that one of its political dramas on Prime Video hurt religious sentiments and caused public anger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/amazon-issues-rare-apology-in-india-over-drama-series/">later issued a rare apology</a> to users in India over the nine-part mini series.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">FloBiz, an Indian startup that is building a neobank for small- and medium-sized businesses in the South Asian market, said on Monday it has raised $31 million in a new financing round as it works to broaden its product offerings.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital India and Think Investments co-led the 18-month-old startup’s Series B financing round. Existing investors Elevation Capital and Beenext also participated in the round, which brings <a href="https://flobiz.in">FloBiz</a>&#8216;s all-time raise to over $41 million.</p>
<p>The startup’s marquee offering &#8212; called myBillBook &#8212; helps small- and medium-sized businesses digitize their invoicing, streamline business accounting, and automate workflows of their enterprises.</p>
<p>India, the world’s second largest internet market, is home to millions of small- and medium-sized businesses. Scores of startups have launched neobanks in the country in recent years to focus on serve millennials or businesses.</p>
<p>“SME-focussed neobanks are building engagement with business- clients through their ability to provide solutions like automated invoicing, collections/payments, accounting, inventory and sales management, taxes and in some cases interest on current deposits as well (banks can&#8217;t pay interest). This may help to ramp- up and upfront their monetisation prospects,” analysts at Jefferies wrote in a report to clients last week.</p>
<p>myBillBook, which supports Hindi, Gujarati and Tamil as well as English, will add support for “at least” five more regional languages within the next six months, the startup said, adding that the app has been downloaded over 5 million times.</p>
<p>“The product will also see deeper use of technologies like AI &amp; image processing to make the onboarding process for the less tech-savvy SMB owners in tier 2 and tier 3 cities of India a delightful first step to digital accounting,” the startup said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Scores of high-profile entrepreneurs &#8212; including Vijay Shekhar Sharma of Paytm, Kunal Shah of CRED, Jiten Gupta of Jupiter, Amrish Rau of Pine Labs, Krishnan Menon of BukuKas, and Nitin Gupta of Uni Cards &#8212; have also backed FloBiz in the new financing round.</p>
<p>“Small businesses are the real heroes of our economy. In order to power the SMB economy with technology, one needs deep understanding, instinct and empathy for this audience,” said Tejeshwi Sharma, Managing Director of Sequoia Capital India, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are really impressed by the user centricity, product focus and experimentative approach of the FloBiz founders. There is almost a perfect founder market fit. The team is stoked to partner with FloBiz on their mission of building a neobank for the growing SMBs of India.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rahul Raj, co-founder and chief executive of FloBiz, said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to “accelerate projects which have been in the works up till now &#8211; building personalisable modules &amp; features into myBillBook, diversifying core product offerings and preparing to roll out financial services. We have a slew of developments in the pipeline to further delight our SMB partners in the next 12 months.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.xata.io">Xata</a>, a startup with a new take on managed databases. The company runs your database for you and turns it into an API so that you can query and update it from your serverless app. Xata has raised a $5 million funding round. Its product is not yet ready for prime time but the company is sharing details.</p>
<p>Xata seems particularly well suited for Jamstack websites. Jamstack has been a popular way of developing and deploying websites at scale. Popular Jamstack hosting platforms include <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a> and <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a>.</p>
<p>Applications are deployed on a global edge network and most of the logic is handled by API calls. The result is a website or an application that loads quickly and can handle a lot of traffic.</p>
<p>Deploying a Jamstack website is quite easy as it often integrates tightly with your Git repository. When you commit code changes, serverless platforms take care of deploying your application. Integrating with API-based developer tools is relatively effortless as well as you don’t manage the logic yourself.</p>
<p>For instance, deploying a website with static content and a Stripe checkout module doesn’t require a ton of effort —&nbsp;Stripe manages the payment servers for you. It gets a bit more complicated if you want to use a live database and interact with it. Traditional database software doesn’t rely on API calls across the internet to add a row, search through multiple rows and find data.</p>
<p>Xata is focusing on databases and want to make it easier to integrate a database with your serverless app. You don’t have to take care of the underlying infrastructure as Xata can scale the database for you. You don’t have to update software, move data to a new server, etc.</p>
<p>Your database is distributed across multiple data centers to improve response times and redundancy. It supports many data types including images. After that, interacting with the database works like any RESTful API out there.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup is also drawing some inspiration from popular no-code startups, such as Airtable. You can open your database in a web browser and interact with your data directly from there. For instance, you can filter the current view, sort data using a specific criteria and get the API query that you can use in your code.</p>
<p>If you store a lot of data in your database, you can search through your data using a free-text search feature. You can also leverage Xata for analytics by creating charts and visualizations.</p>
<p>The ability to interact with your data from a web browser is Xata’s competitive advantage. Many companies rely on Airtable as their first backend to prototype a new project. Xata could become a production-ready version of this Airtable-as-a-backend data management model.</p>
<p>The $5 million round was led by Index Ventures. Operator Collective, SV Angel, X-Factor and firstminute capital also participated. Some business angels, such as Shay Banon and Uri Boness from Elastic, Neha Narkhede from Confluent, Guillermo Rauch from Vercel, Elad Gil from Color Genomics and Christian Bach and Mathias Biilmann from Netlify also invested.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by Monica Sarbu, who used to be the Director of Engineering at Elastic. So she probably knows a thing or two about scaling databases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The used car market is getting another major infusion of venture capital today, with one of the faster scaling startups out of India picking up a major round of financing to double down on growth: <a href="https://www.cars24.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cars24</a> &#8212; a site and app that sells users cars and used two-wheeled motorbikes &#8212; has raised $450 million, a Series F of $340 million and $110 million in debt. The investment values Cars24 at $1.84 billion post-money, the company said, making it one of the more valuable privately-held used car startups globally.</p>
<p>DST Global, Falcon Edge and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 co-led the Series F, with Tencent and existing investors Moore Strategic Ventures and Exor Seeds also participating.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The debt round came from a mix of financial institutions. This fundraise, now confirmed and official, was <a href="https://www.vccircle.com/cars24-raises-fresh-funding-from-softbank-others/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> in past weeks, although at a smaller amount: it didn&#8217;t include the debt portion, and some reports were based on regulatory filings for less than the sum ultimately raised.</span></p>
<p>Vikram Chopra, the CEO who co-founded the company in Gurugram with Mehul Agrawal, Ruchit Agarwal and Gajendra Jangid, said that the plan will be to use the funds across a range of areas.</p>
<p>They include national and international expansion (it&#8217;s already operating in India, Australia and UAE, and has its eyes on more markets); technology (specifically areas like further expanding its virtual appraisal process, as well as more data science around pricing and other details related to sales and after-sales); and financing both to buy in vehicles, as well as to help consumers make purchasing a vehicle a viable economic option.</p>
<p>Cars24 is active more than 200 cities in India, and it has sold 400,000 vehicles to date (both cars and motorbikes) with upwards of 13 million monthly visitors on its site. All this gives it claim to being the largest platform of its kind in India. But its ambition is to improve the inefficiencies of selling a car, or buying a used car, in many parts of the globe, not just its home market.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Buying or selling a car is hard anywhere in the world,&#8221; Chopra said in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s just a broken experience everywhere, so we are trying to solve for this.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">This is also where the financing and technology figure significantly. When Cars24 first started out in 2015 in India, Chopra said, it faced the added issue (or opportunity?) of a tricky economic landscape with very low car ownership penetration overall &#8212; just 2%, or 2 cars per 100 people, compared to typically between 50 and 80 cars per 100 people in Europe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;But buying a used car in India is a way for a person to own <em>any</em> car,&#8221; Chopra said. In a country like India, &#8220;we want to take the penetration to 10 or 15.&#8221; He added that the car resale market today in India is around $25 billion, but is on track to soon get to $100 billion.</p>
<p class="p1">Cars24 has been built around a &#8220;buying-in, fixing up, and then reselling&#8221; model similar to that of the real-estate juggernaut Opendoor: it appraises vehicles from individuals looking to sell them; buys them up if an agreed price can be reached; reconditions them; and then re-sells and delivers them to new owners. This model, Chopra said, gives Cars24 an edge over some of the shortcomings that exist with traditional players (both on and offline).</p>
<p>First, it provides a centralized platform, cars24.com and its corresponding app, where users can browse a one-stop-shop inventory that goes beyond their local areas (and local dealers). That inventory is curated and made discoverable using a number of algorithms, and pricing is also determined by Cars24&#8217;s technology.</p>
<p>“Cars24 is building a data-enabled tech platform that is organizing the fragmented used car market in India,&#8221; said Munish Varma, managing partner, SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. &#8220;We have been closely tracking its approach and efforts that have disrupted the used car retailing in India.”</p>
<p>“We believe Cars24 is enhancing the customer experience in the used car industry with its sharp focus on technology,&#8221; said Sumer Juneja, partner, SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. &#8220;We will continue to support this growth given our expertise in e-commerce businesses across markets”.</p>
<p>Second, when consumers do make a purchase, they can keep and try out a vehicle for up to seven days &#8220;and return it if you don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, Chopra continued, is in contrast to other used-car sales sites, as well as physical dealers: either they don&#8217;t offer trial runs, or (in the case of physical dealers or individual offline sellers), they might give a driver 10 or 15 minutes tops, with someone attending you as you drive the vehicle around: not a great way to discover what you like or don&#8217;t like about a vehicle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a model that investors believe will give Cars24 an edge over competitors.</p>
<p>“We have studied used car platforms globally and are struck by the similarities we see between Cars24 and analogous businesses that have scaled successfully,&#8221; said Navroz D. Udwadia, co-founder of Falcon Edge Capital, in a statement. &#8220;Cars24 has cemented its first-mover advantage by building wide-ranging supply side moats, which in turn drive demand liquidity on the platform. In positioning itself as a buying and selling solution for consumers, Cars24 drives immense top-of-mind recall. It is rare to find a business as focused on the consumer experience and as driven to ensure it is outstanding via the use of data science and technology. Finally, we are deeply impressed by the founders’ leadership, and are thrilled to back them as they transform the used car industry in India and scale internationally across MENA and SE Asia.&#8221;</p>
<p>A used-vehicle sales platform raising a huge amount of money is somewhat ironic given some of the bigger trends in the world of transportation.</p>
<p>Some have theorized that a wave of factors &#8212; they include the rise of ubiquitous e-hailing apps like Uber; on-demand car-sharing services like Getaround or Zipcar; a push in urban centers encouraging people to use a wider array of transportation options to offset traffic; and bigger environmental trends that are leading some to eschew gas guzzling autos &#8212; would push the world <em>away </em>from car ownership. Yet essentially, Cars24 (and others like it) are extending the life of a lot of older models to keep more vehicles in circulation and private hands.</p>
<p>But using Uber can get pricey and is not the same as having your own wheels, and the desire to have your own vehicle is perhaps at a high-point right now because of Covid-19 and people concerned about spreading or catching the virus, Chopra said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely not the case in India that less people want to own cars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;During the pandemic, we have seen a lot of demand, in India specifically.&#8221; On new, greener vehicle technology, this is also interesting and will simply present another class of vehicles on Cars24 as adoption of electric vehicles increases, he added. But it&#8217;s not all quite there, yet.</p>
<p>The strength of the current opportunity is partly why it seems that we&#8217;ve found ourselves crowded with startups and scale-ups hoping to define the new generation of used-car-sale platforms.</p>
<p>Others in the same space that have recently raised money include close competitors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/indias-spinny-raises-65-million-to-expand-its-online-platform-for-selling-used-cars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spinny</a>, also out of India; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/uks-cazoo-will-list-on-the-nyse-by-way-of-a-spac-valuing-it-at-7b-and-raising-1-6b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cazoo</a> in the UK, which has now gone public; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/brazilian-digital-auto-marketplace-instacarro-revs-up-with-23m-in-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InstaCarro</a> out of Brazil; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/mexican-unicorn-kavak-raises-a-485m-series-d-at-a-4b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavak</a> out of Mexico; and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2021/09/01/malaysias-carsome-reaches-13-billion-valuation-in-funding-round-from-mediatek-and-others/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carsome</a> from Malaysia, among many others. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CVNA?p=CVNA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carvana</a>, one of the biggest used-car platforms, is also publicly listed and is now valued at nearly $28 billion.</p>
<p>What has been interesting is that each of these big players have up to now carved out very strong markets for themselves in their home countries, and they are only more recently moving to expand internationally. Cars24 has attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in funding (it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/business/startups/news/cars24-is-indias-latest-unicorn-as-it-raises-200-million-from-dst-global-and-existing-investors/articleshow/79388631.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also raised $200 million</a> less than a year ago) in part because its investors think it has what it takes to export, and thus scale, its model beyond the huge market of India.</p>
<p>“Cars24 is at the forefront of transforming the way consumers buy and sell cars by providing a unique end-to-end digital shopping and transaction experience,&#8221; said Rahul Mehta, managing partner at DST Global, in a statement. &#8220;They have emerged as the undisputed leader in the used car space in India and early traction in international markets is exceeding expectations. We love backing founders who are bold and ambitious thinkers and couldn’t be more excited to enter the second innings of our long-lasting partnership with Cars24.”</p>
<p><em>Updated to change, at Cars24&#8217;s request, its description as &#8216;marketplace&#8217; and the number of active cities to 200 from 130. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taha-ahmed-8884a292/">Taha Ahmed</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rooshan-aziz-04710875/">Rooshan Aziz</a> left their jobs in strategy consulting and investment banking in London earlier this year in order to found a mobile-only education platform startup, <a href="https://maqsad.io/">Maqsad</a>, in Pakistan, with a goal &#8220;to make education more accessible to 100 million Pakistani students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having grown up in Karachi, childhood friends Ahmed and Aziz are aware of the challenges about the Pakistani education system, which is notably worse for those not living in large urban areas (the nation’s student-teacher ratio is 44:1). Pakistani children are less likely to go to school for each kilometer of distance between school and their home &#8212; with girls being four times affected, Maqsad co-founder Aziz said.</p>
<p>Maqsad announced today its $2.1 million pre-seed round to enhance its content platform growth and invest in R&amp;D.</p>
<p>The pre-seed round, which was completed in just three weeks via virtual meetings, was led by Indus Valley Capital, with participation from Alter Global, Fatima Gobi Ventures and several angel investors from Pakistan, the Middle East and Europe.</p>
<p>Maqsad will use the proceeds for developing in-house content, such as production studio, academics and animators, as well as bolstering R&amp;D and engineering, Aziz told TechCrunch. The company will focus on the K-12 education in Pakistan, including 11th and 12th grade math, with plans to expand into other STEM subjects for the next one-two years, Aziz said.</p>
<p>Maqsad&#8217;s platform, which provides a one-stop shop for after-school academic content in a mix of English and Urdu, will be supplemented by quizzes and other gamified features that will come together to offer a personalized education to individuals. Its platform features include adaptive testing that alter a question&#8217;s level of difficulty depending on users’ responses, Aziz explained.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;maqsad&#8221; means purpose in Urdu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe everyone has a purpose. Maqsad&#8217;s mission is to enable Pakistani students to realize this purpose; whether you are a student from an urban centre, such as Lahore, or from a remote village in Sindh: Maqsad believes in equal opportunity for all,&#8221; Aziz said.</p>
<p>“We are building a mobile-first platform, given that 95% of broadband users in Pakistan are via mobile. Most other platforms are not mobile optimized,&#8221; Aziz added.</p>

<p>“It’s about more than just getting students to pass their exams. We want to start a revolution in the way Pakistani students learn, moving beyond rote memorization to a place of real comprehension,” said co-founder Taha Ahmed, who was a former strategy consultant at LEK.</p>
<p>The company ran small pilots in April and May and started full-scale operations on 26 July, Aziz said, adding that Maqsad will launch its mobile app, currently under development, in the coming months in Q4 2021 and has a waitlist for early access.</p>
<p>“Struggles of students during the early days of the pandemic motivated us to run a pilot. With promising initial traction and user feedback, the size of the opportunity to digitize the education sector became very clear,” Aziz said.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped the education industry, heating up the global edtech startups that made online education more accessible for a wider population, for example in countries like India and Indonesia, Aziz mentioned.</p>
<p>The education market size in Pakistan is estimated at $12 billion and is projected to increase to $30 billion by 2030, according to Aziz.</p>
<p>It plans to build the company as a hybrid center offering online and offline courses like Byju&#8217;s and Aakash, and expand classes for adults such as MasterClass, the U.S.-based online classes for adults, as its long-term plans, Aziz said.</p>
<p>“Maqsad founders’ deep understanding of the problem, unique approach to solving it and passion for impact persuaded us quickly,” the founder and managing partner of Indus Valley Capital, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aatifawan/">Aatif Awan</a>, said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pakistan&#8217;s edtech opportunity is one of the largest in the world and we are excited to back Maqsad in delivering tech-powered education that levels access, quality and across Pakistan&#8217;s youth and creates lasting social change,&#8221; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-mukhtar-842327139/?originalSubdomain=pk">Ali Mukhtar</a>, general partner of Fatima Gobi Ventures said.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ess-andrew-tang/">Andrew Tang</a> is vice president of energy storage and optimization at <a href="https://www.wartsila.com/energy">Wärtsilä Energy</a>, which provides solutions for renewable energy integration and EV charging infrastructure development.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As electric vehicles (EVs) become the new standard, charging infrastructure will become a commonplace detail blending into the landscape, available in a host of places from a range of providers: privately run charging stations, the office parking lot, home garages and government-provided locations to fill in the gaps. We need a new energy blueprint for the United States in order to maintain a stable grid to support this national move to EV charging.</p>
<p>The Biden administration announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/">500,000 charging stations</a> to be installed nationally and additional <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/">energy storage</a> to facilitate the shift to EVs. Integrating all of this new infrastructure and transitioning requires balancing the traffic on the grid and managing increased energy demand that stretches beyond power lines and storage itself.</p>
<p>The majority of EV infrastructure pulls its power from the grid, which will add significant demand when it reaches scale. In an ideal situation, EV charging stations will have their own renewable power generation co-located with storage, but new programs and solutions are needed in order to make it available everywhere. A <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/4-emerging-ways-pair-electric-vehicles-and-renewable-energy">range of scenarios</a> for how renewables can be used to power EV charging have been piloted in the U.S. in recent years. Eventually, EVs will likely even <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-04-27/more-evs-are-being-designed-to-push-power-to-the-electrical-grid">provide power to the grid</a>.</p>
<p>These technological advances will happen as we progress through the energy transition; regardless, EV infrastructure will heavily rely on the U.S. grid. That makes coordination across a range of stakeholders and behavior change among the general public essential for keeping the grid stable while meeting energy demand.</p>
<p>The White House’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/">fact sheet for EV charging infrastructure</a> points to a technical blueprint that the Department of Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute will be working on together. It is critical that utilities, energy management and storage stakeholders, and the general public be included in planning — here’s why.</p>
<h2>Stakeholder collaboration</h2>
<p>Charging infrastructure is currently fragmented in the U.S. Much of it is privatized and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan">there are complaints</a> that unless you drive a Tesla, it is hard to find charging while on the road. Some EV owners have even returned to driving gas-powered vehicles. There’s reason to be hopeful that this will rapidly change.</p>
<p>ChargePoint and EVgo are two companies that will likely become household names as their EV networks expand. A coalition made up of some of the largest U.S. utilities &#8212; including American Electric Power, Dominion Energy, Duke Energy, Entergy, Southern Company and the Tennessee Valley Authority &#8212; called the Electric Highway Coalition, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aep-dominion-energy-duke-energy-entergy-southern-company-and-tva-plan-to-add-electric-vehicle-fast-chargers-to-connect-gulf-coast-midwest-and-atlantic-state-destinations-301238938.html">announced</a> plans for a regional network of charging stations spanning their utility territories.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Networks that swap out private gas stations for EV charging is one piece of the puzzle. We also need to ensure that everyone has affordable access and that charging times are staggered &#8212; this is one of the core concerns on every stakeholder’s mind. Having charging available in a range of places spreads out demand, helping keep power available and the grid balanced.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EV charging solutions will become an asset, not a liability, to the grid&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/ev-charging-solutions-will-become-an-asset-not-a-liability-to-the-grid/embed/#?secret=DXob3z3iNL" data-secret="DXob3z3iNL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Varying consumer needs including location and housing, work schedules and economic situations require considerations and new solutions that make EVs and charging accessible to everyone. What works in the suburbs won’t suit rural or urban areas, and just imagine someone who works the night shift in a dense urban area.</p>
<p>Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/">plan</a> includes, “$4 million to encourage strong partnerships and new programs to increase workplace charging regionally or nationally, which will help increase the feasibility of [plug-in electric vehicle] ownership for consumers in underserved communities.” Partnerships and creative solutions will equally be needed.</p>
<h2>An opportunity to fully engage technologies we already have</h2>
<p>“Fifty percent of the reductions we have to make to get to net-zero by 2050 or 2045 are going to come from technologies that we don&#8217;t yet have,&#8221; John Kerry <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2021/05/17/climate-change-technologt-john-kerry/">said</a> recently, causing a stir. He later clarified that we also have technologies now that we need to put to work, which received less air time. In reality, we are just getting started in utilizing existing renewable and energy transition technologies; we have yet to realize their full potential.</p>
<p>Currently, utility-scale and distributed energy storage are used for their most simplistic capabilities, that is, jumping in when energy demand reaches its peak and helping keep the grid stable through services referred to as balancing and frequency regulation. But as renewable energy penetration increases and loads such as EVs are electrified, peak demand will be exacerbated.</p>
<p>The role that storage plays for EV charging stations seems well understood. On-site storage is used daily to provide power for charging cars at any given time. Utility-scale storage has the same capabilities and can be used to store and then supply renewable power to the grid in large quantities every day to help balance the demand of EVs.</p>
<p>A stable power system for EVs combines utilities and utility-scale storage with a network of subsystems where energy storage is co-located with EV charging. All of the systems are coordinated and synchronized to gather and dispatch energy at different times of the day based on all the factors that affect grid stability and the availability of renewable power. That synchronization is handled by intelligent energy management software that relies on sophisticated algorithms to forecast and respond to changes within fractions of a second.</p>
<p>This model also makes it possible to manage the cost of electricity and EV demand on the grid. Those subsystems could be municipal-owned locations in lower-income areas. Such a subsystem would collect power in its storage asset and set the price locally on its own terms. These systems could incentivize residents to power up there at certain times of the day in order to make charging more affordable by providing an alternative to the real-time cost of electricity during peak demand when using a home outlet, for example.</p>
<h2>Behavior change</h2>
<p>The greatest challenge for utilities will be how to manage EV loads and motivate people to stagger charging their vehicles, rather than everyone waiting until they are home in the evening during off-peak renewable generation periods. If everyone plugged in at the same time, we&#8217;d end up cooking dinner in the dark.</p>
<p>While there’s been talk of incentivizing the public to charge at different times and spread out demand, motivators vary among demographics. With the ability to charge at home and skip a trip to the “gas station” &#8212; or “power station,” as it may be referred to in the future &#8212; many people will choose convenience over cost.</p>
<p>The way we currently operate, individual energy usage seems like an independent, isolated event to consumers and households. EVs will require everyone &#8212; from utilities and private charging stations to consumers &#8212; to be more aware of demand on the grid and act more as communities sharing energy.</p>
<p>Thus, a diverse charging network alone won’t solve the issue of overtaxing the grid. A combination of a new blueprint for managing energy on the grid plus behavior change is needed.</p>
