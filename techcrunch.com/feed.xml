										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>I don’t have a good answer to the question. Knowing full well that I’m talking <a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/">back to an algorithm</a> &#8212; even one asking the same question of everyone with a different band mad-libbed in &#8212; doesn’t soften the blow. Am I? Are we? Is anyone, really?</p>
<p>In this case, it’s referring to Waxahatchee. I mean, yeah, I totally listened to a lot of Waxahatchee this year. Waxahatchee is good. Saint Cloud was one of my favorite albums of the year. Katie Crutchfield’s music doesn’t exist in the Elliott Smith, Leonard Cohen bin for me. It’s not time to send up the signal flares when you see the band all over my <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spotify">Spotify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> social feed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Spotify roasting AI that’s been making the rounds this week is a fun exercise in music snobbery. It also may be brushing against some larger truth here. Something I think we all considered at least in passing this year when Spotify offered its annual “Wrapped” year in review.</p>
<p>What’s the soundtrack to the worst year, ever? What do we listen to while the world burns? In 2009, a former CNN intern stumbled across a video tape in the archives labeled with the title, <a href="https://jalopnik.com/this-is-the-video-cnn-will-play-when-the-world-ends-1677511538">&#8220;Turner Doomsday Video.”</a> The minute-long video features a band playing, &#8220;Nearer My God To Thee,” believed to be the final song played by the band on the Titanic. It carried the explicit instructions, “HFR [Hold for Release] till end of the world confirmed.”</p>
<p>Barring any sort of last-minute surprise, it seems likely we’ll make it through 2020 shy of a full-on apocalypse (in spite of, perhaps, the best efforts of some). But for me, Spotify’s year in review was a testament to hell year, just as my Apple Watch exercise bars saw a zeroing out in late-March and April, as the pandemic bore down on my home of Queens, New York and I dealt with some personal health issues.</p>
<p>What was pitched as a celebratory aggregation of my listening habits over the previous 12 months exited the machine as a testament to the long stretches of time where engaging with music felt like an impossibility. Ambient music and post-rock got me listening again when lyrics seemed like too much to process. And I’m sure I’m not alone in having listened to some comfort tracks with an alarming frequency.</p>
<p>Looking back is a useful reminder of the role music played in what undoubtedly qualifies as the worst year to date for many. It would be an overstatement to suggest that music saved my life in 2020, but it certainly cushioned the blow of one too many emotional gut punches.</p>
<p>“Music can lift us out of depression or move us to tears – it is a remedy, a tonic, orange juice for the ear,” the late-neurologist, Oliver Sacks wrote. “But for many of my neurological patients, music is even more – it can provide access, even when no medication can, to movement, to speech, to life. For them, music is not a luxury, but a necessity.”</p>
<p>Louis Armstrong put it even more succinctly: “music is life itself.”</p>
<p>It’s a cruel irony that, in a year when music has meant so much to so many, most musicians have struggled to make ends meet. The musical field certainly isn’t unique in that respect this year, but their struggles have been pronounced in an era when streaming revenues offer fractions of cents what musicians make in record sales, and touring has become the most important revenue stream for all but the biggest names. For the past 10 months, that all but dried up.</p>
<p>“The pandemic utterly decimated the live-music industry,” Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeff-tweedy-on-covid-19and-its-impact-on-live-music-11608062400">noted in a recent interview</a>. “There’s been almost an entire year now of absolutely zero revenue.”</p>
<p>In May, a <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/19-per-cent-of-musicians-are-considering-abandoning-their-careers-due-to-lack-of-government-support-during-coronavirus-2670463">survey from the Musician’s Union</a> noted that 19% of musicians said they might end up giving up their careers due to the impact of COVID-19. Seven months later, one wonders whether that figure might have been optimistic.</p>
<p>Tweedy adds, “There will be places to play. But the landscape won’t ever look the same. I imagine that a lot of the more intimate music venues will be gone, just like a lot of small businesses and restaurants.”</p>

<p>Bandcamp has been a beacon for many. The service’s “Bandcamp Fridays,” which waive its revenue cut, have raised $40 million to date. The site has promised to continue offering the feature at least through May of next year.</p>
<p>This year’s struggles have served to highlight concerns over streaming royalties. Spotify has understandably been the focal point for this conversation, all while the company has spent hundreds of millions to bolster its podcast programming. CEO Daniel Ek didn’t do himself any favors in July when he noted, “Some artists that used to do well in the past may not do well in this future landscape, where you can’t record music once every three to four years and think that’s going to be enough.”</p>

<p>In October, Justice at Spotify rep (and Galaxie 500 member) Damon Kurkowski told me “[R]esponse from certain corners of the industry has been as cold as we expected: ‘You’re just musicians and don’t understand business,’ is the basic gist of it. To which I would say: The problem we are calling attention to is precisely that musicians have been left out of the conversation! We always come last in payment and in consultation — even though our work is what the streaming business is built on.”</p>
<p>The struggle to survive on music is nothing new, of course. Jazz genius Thelonious Monk famously had a benefactor in Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter. But just because we’ve failed musicians in the past doesn’t mean we can’t and shouldn’t do better.</p>
<p>Am I okay? I’m still not sure, but listening to music seems to help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This was going to be the year of 5G. It was going to be the year the next-generation wireless technology helped reverse some troubling macro trends for the industry &#8212; or at the very least helped stem the bleeding some.</p>
<p>But the best laid plans, and all that. With about a week left in the year, I think it’s pretty safe to say that 2020 didn’t wind up the way the vast majority of us had hoped. It’s a list that certainly includes the lion’s share of smartphone makers. Look no further than a recent report published by Gartner to answer the question of just how bad 2020 was for smartphone sales.</p>

<p>It was so bad that a 5.7% global decline year-over-year for the third quarter constituted good news. In a normal year, that wouldn’t qualify as good news for too many industries outside of wax cylinder and asbestos sales. But there are few standards by which 2020 was a normal year, so now we’ll take some respite in the fact that a 5.7% drop was a considerably less pronounced drop than the ~20% we saw in Qs 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Some context before we get into the whys here. A thing that’s important to note up front is that mobile wasn’t one of those industries where everything was smooth sailing before everything got upended by a pandemic. In 2019 I wrote a not insignificant number of stories with headlines like “Smartphone sales expected to drop 2.5% globally this year” and “Smartphone sales declined again in Q2, surprising no one.” And even those stories were a continuation of trends from a year prior.</p>
<p>The reasons for the decline should be pretty familiar by now. For one thing, premium handsets got expensive, routinely topping out over $1,000. Related to that, phones have gotten good. Good news for consumers doesn’t necessarily translate to good news for manufacturers here, as upgrade cycles have slowed significantly from their traditional every two years (also an artifact of the carrier subscription model). Couple that with economic hardships, and you’ve got a recipe for slowed growth.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5G devices were less than 1% of US smartphone purchases in 2019&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/5g-devices-were-less-than-1-of-us-smartphone-purchases-in-2019/embed/#?secret=y68ycXDHFN" data-secret="y68ycXDHFN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This March, I wrote an article titled “5G devices were less than 1% of US smartphone purchases in 2019.” There was, perhaps, a certain level of cognitive dissonance there, after many years of 5G hype. There are myriad factors at play here. First, there just weren’t a ton of different 5G models available in the States by year’s end. Second, network rollout was far from complete. And, of course, there was no 5G iPhone.</p>
<p>I concluded that piece by noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, it remains to be seen how COVID-19 will impact sales. It seems safe to assume that, like every aspect of our lives, there will be a notable impact on the number of people buying expensive smartphones. Certainly things like smartphone purchases tend to lessen in importance in the face of something like a global pandemic.</p></blockquote>
<p>In hindsight, the answer is “a lot.” I’ll be the first to admit that when I wrote those words on March 12, I had absolutely no notion of how bad it was about to get and how long it would last (hello month nine of lockdown). In the earliest days, the big issue globally was on the supply side. Asia (China specifically) was the first place to get hit and the epicenter of manufacturing buckled accordingly. Both China and its manufacturing were remarkably fast to get back online.</p>
<p>In the intervening months, demand has taken a massive hit. Once again, there are a number of reasons for this. For starters, people aren’t leaving their homes as much &#8212; and for that reason, the money they’ve allotted to electronics purchases has gone toward things like PCs, as they’ve shifted to a remote work set-up. The other big issue here is simple economics. So many people are out of work and so much has become uncertain that smartphones have once again been elevated to a kind of luxury status.</p>
<p>There are, however, reasons to be hopeful. It seems likely that 5G will eventually help right things &#8212; though it’s hard to say when. Likely much of that depends on how soon we’re able to return to “normal” in 2021. But for now, there’s some <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-iphone-12-supercycle-may-be-happening-after-all-new-data-shows/">positive to be seen in early iPhone sales</a>. After Apple went all in on 5G this year, the new handset (perhaps unsurprisingly) topped sales for all other 5G handsets for the month of October, according to analysts.</p>
<p>The company will offer a more complete picture (including the ever-important holiday sales) as part of its earnings report next month. For now, at least, it seems that thing are finally heading in the right direction. That trend will, hopefully, continue as the new year sees a number of Android launches.</p>
<p>Perhaps 2021 will be the year of 5G &#8212; because 2020 sure wasn’t.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is set to significantly ramp up its Starship development program in the new year, in more ways than one. SpaceX CEO and founder Elon Musk noted on Twitter on Thursday that the company will seek to make use of both of its two launch pads at its development facility in Boca Chica, Texas with prototype rockets set up on each, and that it will begin flight testing its Super Heavy booster (starting with low-altitude &#8220;hops&#8221;) as quickly as &#8220;a few months&#8221; from now.</p>
<p>Recently, SpaceX set up its SN9 prototype of Starship (the ninth in the current series) at Pad B at its Texas testing facility, which is on the Gulf of Mexico. SN9 will be next to undergo active testing, after SpaceX successfully flew its predecessor SN8 to an altitude of around 40,000 feet, and then executed a crucial belly flop maneuver that will be used to help control the powered landing of the production version. SN8 was destroyed when it touched down harder than expected, but SpaceX still achieved all its testing goals with the flight &#8212; and more.</p>
<p>SN9 will now undergo ground tests before hopefully doing its own flight test later on. That&#8217;ll provide the team with even more valuable data to carry on to further tests &#8212; with the ultimate goal of eventually achieving orbit with a Starship prototype vehicle. Musk&#8217;s<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1342062363105759232"> tweet that two prototypes</a> will be stood up next to each other on Pad A and Pad B at the Boca Chica site could indicate the pace of these test flights might speed up, to match the fast clip at which SpaceX is constructing new rocket iterations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, news that Super Heavy could be undergoing testing soon is also reason to get excited about 2021 for SpaceX and Starship. Super Heavy is the booster that SpaceX will eventually use to fly Starship for orbital launches, and to eventually help propel it to deep space &#8212; for destinations including Mars. Super Heavy will be around 240 feet tall, and will include 28 Raptor engines to provide it with the lift capacity needed to break Earth&#8217;s gravity when it&#8217;s stacked with a Starship loaded down with cargo.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The end of the year is looming and with it one of your most important tasks as a manager. Summarizing the performance of 10, 20 or 50 developers over the past 12 months, offering personalized advice and having the facts to back it up — is no small task.</p>
<p>We believe that the only unbiased, accurate and insightful way to understand how your developers are working, progressing and — last but definitely not least — how they’re feeling, is with data. Data can provide more objective insights into employee activity than could ever be gathered by a human.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It’s still very hard for many managers to fully understand that all employees work at different paces and levels.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Consider this: Over two-thirds of employees say they would put more effort into their work if they felt more appreciated, and 90% want a manager who&#8217;s fair to all employees.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest. It’s hard to judge all of your employees fairly if you’re (1) unable to work physically side-by-side with them, meaning you’ll inevitably have more contact with the some over others (e.g., those you’re more friendly with); and (2) you’re relying on manual trackers to keep on top of everyone’s work, which can get lost and take a lot of effort to process and analyze; (3) you expect engineers to self-report their progress, which is far from objective.</p>
<p>It’s also unlikely, especially with the quieter ones, that on top of all that you’ll have identified areas for them to expand their talents by upskilling or reskilling. But it’s that kind of personal attention that will make employees feel appreciated and able to progress professionally with you. Absent that, they’re likely to take the next best job opportunity that shows up.</p>
<p>So here’s a run down of why you need data to set up a fair annual review process; if not this year, then you can kick-start it for 2021.</p>
<h2>1. Use data to set next year’s goals</h2>
<p>The best way to track your developers’ progress automatically is by using Git Analytics tools, which track the performance of individuals by aggregating historical Git data and then feeding that information back to managers in minute detail.</p>
<p>This data will clearly show you if one of your engineers is over capacity or underworked and the types of projects they excel in. If you’re assessing an engineering manager and the team members they’re responsible for have been taking longer to push their code to the shared repository, causing a backlog of tasks, it may mean that they’re not delegating tasks properly. An appropriate goal here would be to track and divide their team’s responsibilities more efficiently, which can be tracked using the same metrics, or cross-training members of other teams to assist with their tasks.</p>
<p>Another example is that of an engineer who is dipping their toe into multiple projects. Indicators of where they’ve performed best include churn (we’ll get to that later), coworkers repeatedly asking that same employee to assist them in new tasks and of course positive feedback for senior staff, which can easily be integrated into Git analytics tools. These are clear signs that next year, your engineer could be maximizing their talents in these alternative areas, and you could diversify their tasks accordingly.</p>
<p>Once you know what targets to set, you can use analytics tools to create automatic targets for each engineer. That means that after you’ve set it up, it will be updated regularly on the engineer’s progress using indicators directly from the code repository. It won’t need time-consuming input from either you or your employee, allowing you both to focus on more important tasks. As a manager you’ll receive full reports once the deadline of the task is reached and get notified whenever metrics start dropping or the goal has been met.</p>
<p>This is important — you’ll be able to keep on top of those goals yourself, without having to delegate that responsibility or depend on self-reporting by the engineer. It will keep employee monitoring honest and transparent.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Three Git metrics can help you understand true performance quality</h2>
<p>The easiest way for managers to “conclude” how an engineer has performed is by looking at superficial output: the number of completed pull requests submitted per week, the number of commits per day, etc. Especially for nontechnical managers, this is a grave but common error. When something is done, it doesn’t mean it’s been done well or that it is even productive or usable.</p>
<p>Instead, look at these data points to determine the actual quality of your engineer’s work:</p>
<ol>
<li>Churn is your number-one red flag, telling you how many times someone has modified their code in the first 21 days after it has been checked in. The more churn, the less of an engineer&#8217;s code is actually productive, with good longevity. Churn is a natural and healthy part of the software development process, but we’ve identified that any churn level above the normal 15%-30% indicates that an engineer is struggling with assignments.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the United States entered its first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns, there were wide expectations in startup land <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/07/vcs-warn-coronavirus-will-impact-fundraising-for-the-next-2-quarters/">that a reckoning had arrived</a>. But the expected comeuppance of high-burn, high-growth startups fueled by cheap capital provided by venture capitalists <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/founders-fund-confirms-3-billion-in-new-capital-across-two-funds/">raising</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/index-raises-1-2b-growth-fund-and-800m-to-invest-in-emerging-startups/">ever-larger funds</a>, failed to arrive.</p>
<p>Instead, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/saas-earnings-rise-as-pandemic-pushes-companies-more-rapidly-to-the-cloud/">very opposite came to pass</a>.</p>
<p>Layoffs happened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/the-second-wave-of-unicorn-layoffs-is-brutal/">swiftly and aggressively</a> during the early months of the pandemic era. But by the middle of Q2, venture activity had warmed and third quarter dealmaking felt <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/extension-rounds-help-some-startups-play-offense-during-covid-19/">swift and competitive</a>, with some investors describing it as the hottest summer in recent years.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Venture capital as an asset class has survived the pandemic’s stress test.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But somewhat lost amongst the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/how-robinhood-and-chime-raised-2b-in-the-last-year/">splashy megarounds</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/unpacking-the-c3-ai-ipo-filing/">high-interest IPOs</a> that can dominate the news cycle were seed-stage startups. The raw little companies that represent the grist that will shape itself into the next set of giants.</p>
<p>TechCrunch explored what happened in seed investing to uncover what was missed amidst the storm and fury of late-stage startup activity. According to a TechCrunch analysis of <a href="https://pitchbook.com/">PitchBook data</a> and a survey of venture capitalists, a few trends became clear.</p>
<p>First, the pattern of <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/more-supergiant-seed-rounds-are-sprouting-up/">rising seed-check sizes</a> seen in prior years continued despite the tumultuous business climate. Second, more expensive and larger seed deals were not only caused by excessive capital present in the private markets. Instead, COVID-19 shook up which startups were considered attractive by private investors. And the changeup did not necessarily raise their number.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the data and see what it can teach us about this wild year. Then we’ll hear from <a href="https://eniac.vc/">Eniac Ventures</a>’ <a href="https://twitter.com/nihalmehta">Nihal Mehta</a>, <a href="https://freestyle.vc/">Freestyle’s</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jennylefcourt">Jenny Lefcourt</a>,<a href="https://www.pear.vc/"> Pear VC’s</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/marhershenson?lang=en">Mar Hershenson</a> and <a href="https://contrarycap.com/">Contrary Capital’s</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/etarczynski?lang=en">Eric Tarczynski</a> about what they saw in 2020 while writing a chunk of the checks that our data encompasses.</p>
<h2>The American seed market in 2020</h2>
<p>If you didn’t think much about seed in 2020, you’re not alone. Late, huge rounds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/how-unicorns-helped-venture-capital-get-later-and-bigger/">consumed most of the media’s oxygen</a>, leaving smaller startups to compete for scraps of attention. There was so much late-stage activity &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/late-stage-deals-made-q3-2020-a-standout-vc-quarter-for-us-based-startups/">around 90 $100 million or larger rounds in Q3, for example</a> &#8212; it was difficult for smaller investments to command attention.</p>
<p>But despite living in the background, the dollars invested into seed-stage startups in the United States had an up-and-down year that was fascinating:</p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/seed-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="seed-2">Seed <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> dollar volume fell as Q1 progressed, reaching a 2020 nadir in April, the start of Q2. But as May arrived, the pace at which investors put money into seed-stage startups accelerated, recovering to January levels &#8212; which is to say, pre-pandemic &#8212; by June. The COVID dip, for seed, then, was a short-term affair.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the portfolio of a corporate venture capital firm can be taken as a signal for the strategic priorities of their parent companies, then <a href="https://www.nationalgridus.com/Default.aspx">National Grid</a> has high hopes for automation as the future of the utility industry.</p>
<p>The heavy emphasis on automation and machine learning from one of the nation&#8217;s largest privately held utilities with a customer base numbering around 20 million people is significant. And a sign of where the industry could be going.</p>
<p>Since its launch, National Grid&#8217;s venture firm, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-m-lambert-141448/">National Grid Partners</a>, has invested in 16 startups that featured machine learning at the core of their pitch. Most recently, the company backed AI Dash, which uses machine learning algorithms to analyze satellite images and infer the encroachment of vegetation on National Grid power lines to avoid outages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another recent investment, Aperio, uses data from sensors monitoring critical infrastructure to predict loss of data quality from degradation or cyberattacks.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mlcJaDuL6v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/07/aperio-raises-a-4-5m-seed-round-to-protect-power-plants-from-hackers/">Aperio raises a $4.5M seed round to protect power plants from hackers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Aperio raises a $4.5M seed round to protect power plants from hackers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/07/aperio-raises-a-4-5m-seed-round-to-protect-power-plants-from-hackers/embed/#?secret=mlcJaDuL6v" data-secret="mlcJaDuL6v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, of the $175 million in investments the firm has made, roughly $135 million has been committed to companies leveraging machine learning for their services.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;AI will be critical for the energy industry to achieve aggressive decarbonization and decentralization goals,&#8221; said Lisa Lambert, the chief technology and innovation officer at National Grid and the founder and president of National Grid Partners.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">National Grid started the year off slowly because of the COVID-19 epidemic, but the pace of its investments picked up and the company is on track to hit its investment targets for the year, Lambert said.</p>
<p>Modernization is critical for an industry that still mostly runs on spreadsheets and collective knowledge that has locked in an aging employee base, with no contingency plans in the event of retirement, Lambert said. It&#8217;s that situation that&#8217;s compelling National Grid and other utilities to automate more of their business.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Most companies in the utility sector are trying to automate now for efficiency reasons and cost reasons. Today, most companies have everything written down in manuals; as an industry, we basically still run our networks off spreadsheets, and the skills and experience of the people who run the networks. So we&#8217;ve got serious issues if those people retire. Automating [and] digitizing is top of mind for all the utilities we’ve talked to in the Next Grid Alliance.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To date, a lot of the automation work that&#8217;s been done has been around basic automation of business processes. But there are new capabilities on the horizon that will push the automation of different activities up the value chain, Lambert said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“ ML is the next level &#8212; predictive maintenance of your assets, delivering for the customer. Uniphore, for example: you’re learning from every interaction you have with your customer, incorporating that into the algorithm, and the next time you meet a customer, you’re going to do better. So that’s the next generation,&#8221; Lambert said. &#8220;Once everything is digital, you&#8217;re learning from those engagements &#8212; whether engaging an asset or a human being.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lambert sees another source of demand for new machine learning tech in the need for utilities to rapidly decarbonize. The move away from fossil fuels will necessitate entirely new ways of operating and managing a power grid. One where humans are less likely to be in the loop.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“In the next five years, utilities have to get automation and analytics right if they’re going to have any chance at a net-zero world &#8212; you’re going to need to run those assets differently,&#8221; said Lambert. &#8220;Windmills and solar panels are not [part of] traditional distribution networks. A lot of traditional engineers probably don’t think about the need to innovate, because they’re building out the engineering technology that was relevant when assets were built decades ago &#8212; whereas all these renewable assets have been built in the era of OT/IT.”</p>

The goal for this episode was to reflect on a year that no one could have ever predicted, but with a specific angle, as always, on venture capital and startups.</p>
<p>We asked about the biggest surprise, non-portfolio companies to watch, and trends they got wrong and right. There was also banter on Zoom investing (Alex came up with Zesting, but we&#8217;re taking suggestions if anyone comes up with a better moniker) and startup pricing.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s who we asked to call into our super Fancy Equity Hotline:</p>
<ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From the beginning, the plan for <a href="https://www.sidewalklabs.com/">Sidewalk Labs</a> (a subsidiary of Alphabet and &#8212; by extension &#8212; a relative of Google) to develop a $1.3 billion tech-enabled real estate project on the Toronto waterfront was controversial.</p>
<p>Privacy advocates had justified concerns about the Google-adjacent company&#8217;s ability to capture a near-total amount of data from the residents of the development or any city-dweller that wandered into its high-tech panopticon.</p>
<p>But <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alphabet" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="alphabet">Alphabet, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sidewalk-labs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sidewalk-labs">Sidewalk Labs&#8217; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> leadership and even Canada&#8217;s popular prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had high hopes for the project.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Startups working in real estate technology managed to nab a record $3.7 billion from investors in the first quarter of the year.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>“Successful cities around the world are wrestling with the same challenges of growth, from rising costs of living that price out the middle class, to congestion and ever-longer commutes, to the challenges of climate change. Sidewalk Labs scoured the globe for the perfect place to create a district focused on solutions to these pressing challenges, and we found it on Toronto’s Eastern Waterfront — along with the perfect public-sector partner, Waterfront Toronto,&#8221; said Sidewalk Labs chief executive Dan Doctoroff, the former deputy mayor of New York, <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/sidewalk-toronto-ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/13214335/Sidewalk-Toronto-Press-Release.pdf">in a statement announcing the launch in 2017</a>. &#8220;This will not be a place where we deploy technology for its own sake, but rather one where we use emerging digital tools and the latest in urban design to solve big urban challenges in ways that we hope will inspire cities around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>From Sidewalk Labs&#8217; perspective, the Toronto project would be an ideal laboratory that the company and the city of Toronto could use to explore the utility and efficacy of the latest and greatest new technologies meant to enhance city living and make it more environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s stated goal, back in 2017 was &#8220;to create a place that encourages innovation around energy, waste and other environmental challenges to protect the planet; a place that provides a range of transportation options that are more affordable, safe and convenient than the private car; a place that embraces adaptable buildings and new construction methods to reduce the cost of housing and retail space; a place where public spaces welcome families to enjoy the outdoors day and night, and in all seasons; a place that is enhanced by digital technology and data without giving up the privacy and security that everyone deserves.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a purely engineering perspective, integrating these new technologies into a single site to be a test case made some sense. From a community development perspective, it was a nightmare. Toronto residents began to see the development as little more than a showroom for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t12UqYl5SA">a slew of privacy-invading innovations</a> that Sidewalk could then spin up into companies &#8212; or a space where startup companies could test their tech on a potentially unwitting population.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1t12UqYl5SA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>So when the economic implications of the global COVID-19 pandemic started to become clear back in March of this year, it seemed as good a time as any for Sidewalk Labs to shutter the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;[As] unprecedented economic uncertainty has set in around the world and in the Toronto real estate market, it has become too difficult to make the 12-acre project financially viable without sacrificing core parts of the plan we had developed together with Waterfront Toronto to build a truly inclusive, sustainable community,&#8221; <a href="https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/why-were-no-longer-pursuing-the-quayside-project-and-what-s-next-for-sidewalk-labs-9a61de3fee3a">Doctoroff said in a statement</a>. &#8220;And so, after a great deal of deliberation, we concluded that it no longer made sense to proceed with the Quayside project.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The State Administration for Market Regulation said Thursday in a brief <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202012/t20201224_324638.html">statement</a> that it is investigating Alibaba over its &#8220;choosing one from two&#8221; policy, in which merchants are forced to sell exclusively on Alibaba and skip rivaling platforms JD.com and Pinduoduo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, Alibaba Group has received notification from the State Administration for Market Regulation that an investigation has been initiated into the Company pursuant to the Anti-Monopoly Law. Alibaba will actively cooperate with the regulators on the investigation,&#8221; Alibaba said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Alibaba&#8217;s shares tumbled more than 8% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday.</p>
<p>On the same day, state-backed Xinhua <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2020-12/24/c_1126900017.htm">reported</a> that Ant Group, Alibaba&#8217;s affiliate, has been summoned by a group of finance authorities to discuss its &#8220;compliance&#8221; work. Ant, which operates the popular Alipay e-wallet and works as an intermediary for financial services and customers, has pledged to take measures to curb debt risks after Chinese <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">authorities abruptly </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">called off</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> its colossal initial public offering last month.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Today, Ant Group received a meeting notice from regulators. We will seriously study and strictly comply with all regulatory requirements and commit full efforts to fulfill all related work,&#8221; the firm <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nxNILHzQytiglFoKHtB22A">said</a> in a statement.</p>
<p>Some argue that the clampdown is a long time coming for China&#8217;s internet giants, which have been allowed to grow under a relatively loose regulatory environment. The Alibaba case is a &#8220;significant step&#8221; in China&#8217;s anti-monopolistic regulations on the internet industry, said an opinion piece published in the official newspaper of China&#8217;s ruling Communist Party. Assuaging worries that stricter regulations could deal a blow to the industry, the piece said the probe into Alibaba &#8220;is beneficial to restoring orders and promoting long-term, healthy development of the platform economy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is currently under fire for apparently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/">pushing out a researcher whose work warned of bias in AI</a>, and now <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-research-focus-idUSKBN28X1CB">a report from Reuters</a> says others doing such work at the company have been asked to &#8220;strike a positive tone&#8221; and undergo additional reviews for research touching on &#8220;sensitive topics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reuters, citing researchers at the company and internal documents, reports that Google has implemented new controls in the last year, including an extra round of inspection for papers on certain topics and seemingly an increase in executive interference at later stages of research.</p>
<p>That certainly appears to have been the case with Dr. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/timnit-gebru" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="timnit-gebru">Timnit Gebru, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> an AI researcher at Google whose resignation seems to have been forced under confusing circumstances following friction between her and management over work that her team was doing. (I&#8217;ve asked Gebru and Google for comment on the story.)</p>
<p>
		<div class="embed breakout" id="vidible_div_0" data-pid="56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a" data-bcid="564f313b67b6231408bc51ee" data-video="5bac337dbf4885293903f4f0"></div>
		<span><script type="text/javascript" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/themes/techcrunch-2017/features/shortcodes/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0"></script></span>
		</p>
<p>Among the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; topics, according to an internal web page seen by Reuters, are: &#8220;the oil industry, China, Iran, Israel, COVID-19, home security, insurance, location data, religion, self-driving vehicles, telecoms and systems that recommend or personalize web content.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that many of these issues are indeed sensitive, though advising researchers to take care when addressing them seems superfluous considering the existence of ethics boards, peer review and other ordinary controls on research. One researcher who spoke to Reuters warned that this sort of top-down interference from Google could soon get &#8220;into a serious problem of censorship.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is in addition to the fundamental issue of vital research being conducted under the auspices of a company for which it may or may not be in their interest to publish. Naturally large private research institutions have existed for nearly as long as organized scientific endeavor, but companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft and others exert an enormous influence over fields like AI and have good reason to avoid criticism of lucrative technologies while shouting their usefulness from every rooftop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch’s 2020 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We’re here to help! </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2020/"><em>You can find our other guides right here.</em></a></p>
<p>SURPRISE! It&#8217;s December 23rd. How? Because time doesn&#8217;t make sense anymore and last week was really a month ago and April was yesterday.</p>
<p>Last-minute shopping is always pretty dreadful, but this year particularly so. No one should be dropping their social distancing practices just to battle crowds for a twice-returned air fryer. Online retailers, meanwhile, have been warning of shipping delays since before December even started.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fortunately, subscription boxes and services exist. They&#8217;re easy to order at the very last minute, easy to give from afar and they&#8217;ll spread the gifting fun out over weeks and months.</p>
<p>Need some ideas? Here&#8217;s some inspiration:</p>
<h2>For the puzzle/escape room fan: Hunt A Killer</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2090690" style="width: 514px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090690" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090690" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?w=504" alt="" width="504" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png 504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=300,298 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090690" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hunt A Killer</p></div></p>
<p>THERE&#8217;S BEEN A (fictional) MURDER!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve been contacted by a detective who needs your help, and your job is to figure out whodunnit through the process of elimination. Each month brings another slice of the story via a box filled with puzzles, newspaper clippings, audio recordings, props and other clues that lead you to the criminal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done a few of these sets with family, and we&#8217;ve very much enjoyed them as a way to lose ourselves in a fictional world for a few hours. It&#8217;s paced in such a way that no single box is a commitment of more than an hour or two, so you can just drop back in whenever you&#8217;ve got the time. You can also expedite the next month&#8217;s box if you don&#8217;t want to wait, which is great.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.huntakiller.com">Varies, but the six-month prepay option gets you one full game for around $165.</a></p>
<h2>For the crafters and scrapbookers: Pipsticks</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2090691" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090691" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090691" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="279" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg 1020w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg?resize=300,123 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg?resize=768,315 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg?resize=680,279 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090691" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pipsticks</p></div></p>
<p>Got a friend whose childhood love for stickers never faded? Pipsticks will send them a bundle of (really, really nice!) stickers each month. They&#8217;ve got a &#8220;Kids Club&#8221; plan meant specifically for the little ones, or a &#8220;Pro Club&#8221; pack for anyone looking to buff up their journaling/scrapbooking/crafting sticker collection.</p>

<h2>For the dog owners: Barkbox</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2090692" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090692" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090692" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/barkbox.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="386" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/barkbox.jpg 766w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/barkbox.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/barkbox.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/barkbox.jpg?resize=680,386 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/barkbox.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090692" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Barkbox</p></div></p>
<p>Spoiling dogs is fun. Barkbox brings &#8217;em a constant rotation of treats and toys, all tailored around each month&#8217;s theme, like &#8220;Dogsgiving&#8221; in November or &#8220;Lick or Treat&#8221; back in October. Boxes are tailored to the size of the dog, and they&#8217;ve got a slightly pricier &#8220;Super Chewer&#8221; box with ultra-durable picks for dogs that chomp right through anything you put in front of them.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.barkbox.com">Starts at $23 per month</a></p>
<h2>For the highly caffeinated: Coffee subscriptions</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2003668" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2003668" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2003668" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2003668" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tetra Images <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a whole world of coffee to explore out there, but it&#8217;s way too easy to pick up whatever bag looks pretty and stick with that brand until the end of time. Got a friend that&#8217;s been buying the same red plastic tub of grounds for 10 years? Encourage them to branch out a bit!</p>
<p>There are so, <em>so</em> many options for coffee subscriptions, but a few that our team has tried and can vouch for are: <a href="https://www.yesplz.coffee">YesPlz</a>, <a href="https://www.drinktrade.com">Trade Coffee</a>, <a href="https://www.mistobox.com">Mistobox</a>, <a href="https://www.redbaycoffee.com">Red Bay Coffee</a> and <a href="https://angelscup.com/pages/subscribe">Angel&#8217;s Cup</a></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Varies</p>
<h2>For the one who wants to read more: Book of the Month</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2090694" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090694" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090694" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BOTM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BOTM.jpg 758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BOTM.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BOTM.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BOTM.jpg?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BOTM.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090694" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Book of the Month</p></div></p>
<p>They vet the books, you read them. Each month you pick from one of five genre-spanning options and it&#8217;s dropped at your door. Running short on time and haven&#8217;t finished last month&#8217;s pick, or just not into this month&#8217;s selections? You can skip a month quite easily.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong> <a href="https://www.bookofthemonth.com">Starts at $50 for three months of books</a></p>
<h2>For the new human (and their parents): Lovevery Play Kits</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2090720" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Lovevery.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="295" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Lovevery.jpg 1237w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Lovevery.jpg?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Lovevery.jpg?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Lovevery.jpg?resize=768,333 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Lovevery.jpg?resize=680,295 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Lovevery.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Got a friend with a newborn and have no idea what to get them? Lovevery takes the subscription box concept and breaks it down month-by-month for the first stretch of a kid&#8217;s life. The newborn box, for example, focuses on high contrast items and things that&#8217;ll make tummy time a little more fun, whereas later boxes bring in toys that help with finer motor skills like stacking and grasping. They also offer boxes for toddlers, introducing concepts like rhyming, matching and counting. The boxes are a bit pricey, but the company makes huge efforts to keep things sustainable and baby safe.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://gifting.lovevery.com/home">Around $80 per box</a></p>
<h2>For the TechCrunch reader: Extra Crunch</h2>

<p>My handwriting is a joke, but I still absolutely love a good pen. One of my favorite stores to just wander around — back when that was a thing we could do — is Maido. Owned by the Japanese bookstore chain Kinokuniya, Maido offers up a carefully curated collection of pens and stationary in a way that&#8217;s exhaustive but not overwhelming.</p>
<p>With the pandemic greatly limiting aimless retail store exploration, Maido has started producing monthly themed boxes where they bring their best goods to you. I&#8217;ve ordered a few of these so far, and each box has been just wonderful. If you&#8217;ve got a friend that has ever spent 20 minutes talking about their favorite pen, this one&#8217;s for them.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://usa.kinokuniya.com/featured-stationery-maido-in-a-box">$35</a></p>
<h2>For the would-be green thumb: Succulent Studios</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2090699" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090699" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090699" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/succulent.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="277" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/succulent.jpg 691w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/succulent.jpg?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/succulent.jpg?resize=300,122 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/succulent.jpg?resize=680,277 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/succulent.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090699" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Succulent Studios</p></div></p>
<p>I love plants! Sadly, I also tend to kill plants pretty much immediately. I was very proud this year to grow a whole FOUR grape tomatoes before my tomato plant fell over and died. What the hell am I supposed to do with four grape tomatoes?</p>
<p>As a result, our house and yard are filled with all of the succulents we can find — they&#8217;re super pretty and, thankfully, incredibly hard to kill. A lot of ours came from Succulent Studio, a service that does a wonderful job of finding new plants (with fun names like Lime Sparkler and Superbum) and delivering them safely to your door. If one does happen get beat up en route, they&#8217;ll teach you how to revive it&#8230; or, failing that, they&#8217;ll replace it.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://succulent.studio">$16.50 for two plants a month</a></p>
<h2>For the folks who like wine: MORE WINE</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1963351" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1963351" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1963351" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-946327882.jpeg?w=680" alt="A bottle of wine escaping from a gift box.

<p>As with coffee, there are SO many different wines to try and so many different services that want to help you try them all. It&#8217;s tough to narrow it down, but there are plenty of services with proven track records. <a href="https://www.winc.com">Winc</a> has you take a quiz that aims to analyze your tastes and pair accordingly. <a href="https://www.cellarswineclub.com">Cellars Wine Club</a> lets you pick a theme (Imports? Sweet? Sparkling? Reds only?) <a href="https://www.getvinebox.com">Vinebox</a> sends wine by the glass in cute little test tube lookin&#8217; vials so you don&#8217;t have to commit to a whole bottle. TechCrunch&#8217;s own Darrell Etherington likes <a href="https://gargoylewineclub.com/products/wine-club">Gargoyle Wine Club</a>, with the caveat that it only ships to Canada.</p>

<p>One of my favorite parts about traveling is wandering into a local grocery store and trying all of the regional staples — all of the snacks, candies and other goodies I&#8217;ve never seen at home. That sort of exploration isn&#8217;t super feasible in 2020, a year when many of us haven&#8217;t even left our own state.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, Try the World brings all of those goodies from around the globe straight to your doorstep. I&#8217;ve had boxes contain regional-favorite hot sauces, teas, spices, mustards and more. The only catch? If you find something you love, finding where to buy more can be tough.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.trytheworld.com">Starts at $40 a month</a></p>
<h2>For the snazzy dresser: Gentleman&#8217;s Box</h2>

<p>As written by our Editorial Director Henry Pickavet, who I can confirm is often dressed much more nicely than me:</p>
<blockquote><p>I consider myself to be a fairly decent dresser. I tend to lean on ties, tie bars, pocket squares and the like to spruce up a button-down or a gray jacket.</p>
<p>But the choices! The sheer number of accessories, color schemes and levels of fancy can be overwhelming. Which is why I was pretty excited when I came across Gentleman’s Box.</p>
<p>Each month, I receive a small box that includes five to six items: a tie and a pair of socks, as well as a combination of a random mix of a number of other things that alternate from month to month, such as a tie bar, cuff links, a lapel pin and a pocket square. I’ve also received a few watches, a few pairs of sunglasses, a wallet, a tray for odds and ends and money clip. Fancy, right?</p>
<p>Each box also comes with an editorially curated booklet that includes details about how the selections of the month fit together, as well as pictures from customers showing their wares in the wild. I look forward to the end of the pandemic for a number of reasons, and on that list is to be able to go out again and get my dapper on.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Depending on what you&#8217;re looking for, <a href="https://gentlemansbox.com/">ranges from $35 to $100+ per box</a></p>

<p>Why give &#8217;em just one game when you can give them access to <em>tons</em> of games? A lot of the big names in gaming all have Netflix-style on-demand games services now, and they&#8217;re actually pretty dang solid. Sony has PS Now (check out Horizon Zero Dawn, Hollow Knight and the God of War series if you haven&#8217;t already), and Microsoft has Xbox Game Pass (Gears 5! MotoGP 20! Celeste!).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following through on his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/">previous threat</a>, President Trump has vetoed the $740 million National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a major bill that allocates military funds each year.</p>
<p>In tweets early this month, Trump said he would sink the NDAA if it wasn&#8217;t altered to include language &#8220;terminating&#8221; Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, an essential and previously obscure internet law that the president has had in his crosshairs for the better part of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your failure to terminate the very dangerous national security risk of Section 230 will make our intelligence virtually impossible to conduct without everyone knowing what we are doing at every step,&#8221; Trump said in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/presidential-veto-message-house-representatives-h-r-6395/">statement</a> on the veto. It&#8217;s not clear what the president meant, or what he was referring to in criticizing the military funding bill as a &#8221; &#8216;gift&#8217; to China and Russia.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Section 230, which is a liability shielding gift from the U.S. to “Big Tech” (the only companies in America that have it &#8211; corporate welfare!), is a serious threat to our National Security &amp; Election Integrity. Our Country can never be safe &amp; secure if we allow it to stand&#8230;..</p>
<p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1333965375193624578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The president cited &#8220;bipartisan calls&#8221; for a Section 230 repeal in his decision, in spite of the NDAA&#8217;s overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress and the fact that Section 230 reform was never seriously considered in the unrelated military spending bill. Trump also claimed that Section 230 &#8220;facilitates the spread of foreign disinformation online,&#8221; a threat that the president, who frequently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/trump-flu-covid-misinformation-facebook-and-twitter/">spreads dangerous misinformation online</a>, has historically expressed little concern for.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trump&#8217;s odd new attack on Section 230 is probably doomed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/embed/#?secret=cBnMFUPl62" data-secret="cBnMFUPl62" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Section 230 became a hot topic in 2020 as lawmakers, states and the federal government made major moves to rein in the tech industry&#8217;s biggest, most powerful companies. The law protects internet companies from liability for the content they host and is widely credited with opening the doors for internet companies big and small to grow their online business over the years.</p>
<p>Looking for leverage over tech platforms that policed his content, Trump zeroed in on Section 230 — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media/">and Twitter in particular</a> — early this year. In May, the president signed an unusual but largely toothless <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/trump-social-media-executive-order/">executive order</a> attacking tech&#8217;s liability shield. &#8220;The choices Twitter makes when it chooses to edit, blacklist, shadowban are editorial decisions, pure and simple,” Trump said when he signed the order.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Trump&#8217;s position on Section 230 and the NDAA was never particularly tenable. While the NDAA is a massive piece of legislation, the kind that rolls up many disparate things, altering it to somehow repeal Section 230 was never on the table. It&#8217;s also hard to overstate the unpopularity of the position the president has staked out here. The NDAA funds many parts of the military beyond combat and this year&#8217;s bill includes pay raises for the troops and additional health support for Vietnam veterans.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s views on Section 230 are similarly extreme, even relative to many other members of his party. While there is support for changing Section 230 on both sides of the aisle, Congress is far from a consensus on what needs to change and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/section-230-hearing-big-tech/">complex bipartisan reform effort</a> is ongoing. Throwing Section 230 out altogether is very unlikely to be the end result of whatever kind of reform Congress comes up with in the coming year.</p>
<p>The House plans to convene on Monday to override the president&#8217;s exercise of veto powers, an effort that would require a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress. The House approved the NDAA earlier this month with a veto-proof 355-78 vote, including broad support from the vast majority of House Republicans. The Senate passed the legislation along to the president with a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/11/senate-passes-defense-bill-444579">similarly strong bipartisan 84-13 vote</a> in favor of the bill on December 11.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The value of one of the world&#8217;s most valuable cryptocurrencies is crashing and a recently filed SEC complaint is at the root of the free fall. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the XRP token&#8217;s value has declined more than 42% in the past 24 hours and is down more than 63% from its 30-day high of $0.76. It now sits at just $0.27.</p>
<p>XRP&#8217;s price volatility has rivaled the most capricious of cryptocurrencies. Since reaching an all-time-high of $3.84 back in January of 2018, the coin has spent much of the past two years drifting closer and closer to pennies. In the past month, on the back of major rallies from other cryptocurrencies, XRP has seen its biggest rally in years, but those gains were all erased this week by the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ripple-labs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ripple-labs">Ripple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Brad Garlinghouse&#8217;s admission that the SEC was planning to file a sweeping lawsuit against the company during the current administration&#8217;s final days.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2020/comp-pr2020-338.pdf">fundamental argument</a> is that XRP has always been a security and that it should have been registered with the commission from the beginning more than seven years ago. The SEC claims that the defendants in the case &#8212; namely the company Ripple, CEO Bran Garlinghouse and executive chairman Chris Larsen &#8212; generated more than $1.38 billion from sales of the XRP token.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ripple was recently valued at $10 billion following a $200 million funding round. Ripple and the XRP token are technically separate, but Ripple maintains a significant total of the currency&#8217;s market cap and at one point the XRP token itself was referred to as &#8220;ripple&#8221; and shared a logo with the company.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KxC6K6W1qZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/ripple-raises-200-million-to-improve-global-payments/">Ripple raises $200 million to improve global payments</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ripple raises $200 million to improve global payments&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/ripple-raises-200-million-to-improve-global-payments/embed/#?secret=KxC6K6W1qZ" data-secret="KxC6K6W1qZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s line has been that XRP is not a security but is, in fact, a tool for financial institutions, though the coin&#8217;s volatility has discouraged banks from actually adopting the token. Meanwhile, XRP is present on a number of cryptocurrency exchanges, a fact which could expand the scope of this legal complaint and affect more players in the space.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/the-secs-attack-on-crypto-in-the-united-states/">blog post</a> published yesterday that went live shortly after the SEC&#8217;s suit was filed, Garlinghouse wrote that the SEC&#8217;s claims were &#8220;completely wrong on the facts and law'&#8221; and that the company was &#8220;confident&#8221; they would &#8220;ultimately prevail before a neutral fact-finder.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous delivery startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nuro-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nuro-2">Nuro <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is allowed to launch commercial driverless services on public roads in California — the first company to clear this hurdle — after receiving a permit from the state&#8217;s Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Nuro, which was founded in June 2016 by Google alums <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/dave-ferguson-3" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="dave-ferguson-3">Dave Ferguson <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Jiajun Zhu, plans to start commercial delivery operations early next year. The so-called Autonomous Vehicle Deployment permit will allow Nuro to operate commercial services — meaning it can charge for delivery — in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. The intention is to start with its autonomous Toyota Prius vehicles in one city and one partner in the early part of 2021, Nuro&#8217;s chief legal and policy officer David Estrada said. The company will eventually transition to its purpose-built R2 delivery bots for its commercial service as well as add more partners and expand geographically.</p>
<p>While Nuro wouldn&#8217;t name the partner or city, it&#8217;s worth noting that the company is headquartered in Mountain View and has previously expressed a desire to start operations close to its main office.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Issuing the first deployment permit is a significant milestone in the evolution of autonomous vehicles in California,” DMV Director Steve Gordon said in a press release issued Wednesday. “We will continue to keep the safety of the motoring public in mind as this technology develops.”</p>
<p>The deployment permit grants Nuro permission to use a fleet of light-duty driverless vehicles for a commercial delivery service on surface streets within designated parts of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, which includes the cities of Atherton, East Palo Alto, Los Altos Hills, Los Altos, Menlo Park, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale and Woodside, according to the DMV. The vehicles have a maximum speed of 25 mph and are only approved to operate in fair weather conditions on streets with a speed limit of no more than 35 mph.</p>
<p>The announcement caps a milestone year for Nuro, which earlier Wednesday announced it had acquired self-driving trucks startup Ike. Nuro also raised another $500 million, which pushed its post-money valuation to $5 billion, and secured some key state and federal regulatory victories.</p>

<p>Nuro has followed a long and winding path to secure the deployment permit. In 2017, the California DMV, the agency that regulates autonomous vehicles in the state, issued Nuro an AV testing permit that required the company to have a human back-up driver behind the wheel. Initially, the company used modified Toyota Prius sedans for testing as well as for pilot grocery deliveries in Arizona and Texas.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/nuro-deploys-autonomous-delivery-cars-without-safety-drivers/">transitioned in December 2018</a> to the R1, the first step toward a vehicle designed exclusively for packages. Its second-generation vehicle, called the R2, was introduced in February 2020. The R2, which was designed and assembled in the U.S. in partnership with Michigan-based Roush Enterprises, is equipped with lidar, radar and cameras to give the “driver” a 360-degree view of its surroundings. Importantly, Nuro received a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/nuros-new-delivery-r2-bot-gets-the-first-driverless-vehicle-exemption-from-feds/">driverless exemption</a> from NHTSA for its R2 vehicle. The exemption allows the vehicle to operate even though it doesn’t have side-view mirrors, a windshield and a rear-view camera that shuts off when driving forward.</p>
<p>Nuro received in April 2020 a permit from the CA DMV to test driverless vehicles, which meant it could finally put its R2 delivery bots on public roads. While dozens of companies have an active permit with the CA DMV to test autonomous vehicles with a human safety driver, AutoX, Cruise, Nuro, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/waymo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="waymo">Waymo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zoox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zoox">Zoox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> are the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/driverlesstestingpermits">only companies allowed</a> to test driverless vehicles on California’s public roads.</p>
<p>Still, Nuro wasn&#8217;t able to charge for delivery until it received the deployment permit that was issued Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nuro has a slightly cleaner path to commercial operations than autonomous vehicle companies aiming to shuttle people in robotaxi-type operations. Commercial ridesharing services using driverless vehicles also have to secure permits from the California Public Utilities Commission to be able to shuttle passengers. Another additional permit by the CPUC is required to charge for rides.</p>

<p>Getting permission to charge for rides wasn&#8217;t even possible until last month. The CPUC approved in November two new programs to allow permitted companies to provide and charge for shared rides in autonomous vehicles. The automated vehicle technology industry had lobbied the CPUC for months to consider the rule change that would allow for operators to charge a fare and offer shared rides in driverless vehicles. While the decision was widely cheered, some in the industry have warned that the approval process could further delay commercial robotaxi operations.</p>
<p>Potential robotaxi operators have to receive the proper permits from the CPUC and the California DMV as well as meet several reporting requirements. Participating companies also have to submit a safety plan and quarterly reports to the CPUC with aggregated and anonymized information about the pickup and drop-off locations for individual trips, the availability and volume of wheelchair accessible rides, service levels to disadvantaged communities and supply data such as the fuel type used by the vehicles, miles traveled and passenger miles traveled.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new mobile app called <a href="https://honk.me/">Honk</a> aims to make messaging with friends a more interactive, real-time experience. Instead of sending texts off into the void and hoping for a response, friends on Honk communicate via messages that are shown live as you type, with no saved chat history and no send button. The end result is a feeling of being more present in a conversation, as Honk will notify users the moment someone leaves a chat. And if you really want to get someone&#8217;s attention, you can send them a &#8220;Honk&#8221; &#8212; a hard-to-miss notification to join your chat.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s even more urgent, you can even spam the Honk button by pressing it repeatedly. This sends notifications to a friend&#8217;s phone if they&#8217;re off the app, or a flood of colorful emoji if they have the app open.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f5e3.png" alt="🗣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Need to get someone&#39;s attention fast? Honk them! They&#39;ll get a notification to come to the chat. If it&#39;s super important, you can spam the Honk button — that&#39;s hard to miss. <a href="https://t.co/VqcinmeeT2">pic.twitter.com/VqcinmeeT2</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Honk (@usehonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/usehonk/status/1341497424959795200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>After setting up an account by customizing your profile pic, selecting a username and adding friends, you can then tap on a friend&#8217;s name in your list to send them a message.</p>
<p>When you enter a chat in Honk, you&#8217;ll be presented with two large conversation bubbles. The gray one on the top is where your friend&#8217;s messages are shown, while you type in the blue one. (You can change the colors and theme, if you choose.)</p>
<p>As you type, the other person will see the text you&#8217;re entering into this box in real-time &#8212; including the pauses and typos that would normally be missed. This &#8220;live typing&#8221; experience is reminiscent of older communication technology, like the early instant messaging app ICQ, or the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/05/28/google-wave-drips-with-ambition-can-it-fulfill-googles-grand-web-vision/">innovative collaboration tool Google Wave</a>, for example.</p>
<p>In Honk, you&#8217;re given 160 characters to type out your thoughts, and this is counted down on the right side of screen below the conversation bubbles. But you don&#8217;t tap a &#8220;Send&#8221; button to share the message &#8212; the recipient saw the text as it was entered, after all. Instead, you just tap the double arrow &#8220;refresh&#8221; button to clear the screen and type something new.</p>
<p>There are also buttons for sending emoji, snapping a photo or accessing photos from your Camera Roll to share in the chat. The emoji here work more like iMessage&#8217;s &#8220;Send with Echo&#8221; screen effect, as you&#8217;re not just sending a single emoji when you use this feature &#8212; you&#8217;re sending several huge emoji that temporarily fill the screen.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> With Magic Words, you can assign any emoji to any word or phrase, which automatically trigger effects as you type. It&#39;s the best way to personalize your chats and bring them to life. Set up to 50 unique Magic Words per chat! <a href="https://t.co/2BYUyNrEzz">pic.twitter.com/2BYUyNrEzz</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Honk (@usehonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/usehonk/status/1341581571116056576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>You can also optionally assign emoji to any word or phrase within an individual chat, using a &#8220;Magic Words&#8221; feature that will trigger effects as you type (see above). Plus, you can customize chat themes on a per-conversation basis or turn off notifications from an individual user, if you don&#8217;t want to hear from them as much.</p>
<p>None of the conversations are stored and there&#8217;s no history to look back on. This is similar to messaging apps like Snapchat or<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/facebooks-snapchat-like-vanish-mode-feature-arrives-on-messenger-and-instagram/"> Messenger&#8217;s Vanish Mode</a>, for instance. (Honk hasn&#8217;t clarified its position on security, however, so proceed with caution before getting into riskier content.)</p>

<p>And, of course, if you need to get someone&#8217;s attention, you can tap &#8220;Honk&#8221; to flood them with notifications.</p>
<p>If this all seems somewhat silly, then you&#8217;re probably not the target market for the Honk messaging experience.</p>
<p>The app is clearly aiming for a young crowd of largely teenage users. When Honk asks for your age during setup, in fact, you can select an exact number from the list that appears &#8212; unless you&#8217;re &#8220;old,&#8221; that is. The last option on the list of ages is &#8220;21+&#8221; &#8212; the &#8220;older folks&#8221; age bracket, which may sting a bit for the millennial crowd who often still think of themselves as the online trendsetters.</p>
<p>But Honk is aiming to grab Gen Z&#8217;s interest, it seems. It&#8217;s even <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@usehonk">marketing to them on TikTok</a>, where it&#8217;s already generated some 140K+ &#8220;Likes,&#8221; as of the time of writing, despite having only uploaded its first video yesterday. Honk founder Benji Taylor also noted on Twitter the app has seen 550,000 &#8220;Honks&#8221; sent so far, as of Wednesday, December 23, 2020, shortly after noon Eastern. By the time of this article’s publication, that number was 1 million.</p>

<p>Per its website, Honk is the flagship product from software company and app publisher <a href="https://lfe.org/about">Los Feliz Engineering (LFE)</a>, which is backed by investors including Naval Ravikant, Elad Gil, Brian Norgard, David Tisch, Jeff Fagnan, Ryan Hoover, Sarah Downey, Josh Hannah, Sahil Lavingia and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s exceptionally well designed,&#8221; said Product Hunt founder and Weekend Fund investor <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ryan-hoover" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ryan-hoover">Ryan Hoover, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> about Honk. &#8220;[Honk founder] Benji [Taylor] and team labored over the small details, from the animations to the sounds. They&#8217;re also super focused on speed,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Taylor declined a full interview when TechCrunch reached out, noting the team was focused on building the product for the time being.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been working on Honk for a while now. Our goal is to make messaging fun, and empower people to communicate in new, creative ways that take relationships deeper,&#8221; Taylor told TechCrunch. &#8220;Ultimately though, we’re a small team building this for ourselves and our friends. If other people like it, all the better,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Honk, we should note, has been <a href="https://twitter.com/usehonk/status/1341490665083924480">struggling</a> under the load of new signups at launch and high usage. Honk users report the app will sometimes say they&#8217;re offline when they&#8217;re not, for example, among other <a href="https://twitter.com/mitch_troy/status/1341588518976573441">bugs</a>. Honk <a href="https://twitter.com/usehonk/status/1341531287471837184">acknowledged</a> the issues on its Twitter and says it&#8217;s been working to resolve them.</p>
<p>The app is currently <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honk/id1458452703">a free download on iOS.</a> It does not include in-app purchases or have any obvious business model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’re probably investing in an email newsletter these days, whether you’re an international brand, a nonprofit or a local news publisher.</p>
<p>Maybe email is even your focus now, because you got burned by Facebook, Google or other closed platforms during the past decade. The problem is that the tools you have available are probably too generic, or are built specifically for marketers. What if you want to make money from the newsletter content itself?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tryletterhead.com/">Letterhead</a> is slicing through the vast market of existing email SaaS products, betting that a cross-section of revenue and collaboration needs are not being met properly for newsletter creators of all types. Instead, it puts all ad sales, paid subscriptions and newsletter content management into a single, streamlined product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its viewpoints on the future of newsletters — and its customer base so far — are intriguingly different from your typical SaaS startup in Silicon Valley. And there’s a reason for that. Letterhead is actually a product spinout of a community publisher in Miami called <a href="https://www.whereby.us/">WhereBy.Us</a> that began life in 2014 by launching a local media site, <a href="https://thenewtropic.com/">The New Tropic</a>. The publication became a rare success in online local news, once it focused on the email newsletter format.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090591" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090591" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2090591" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/letterhead-herogif01-large.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="511" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090591" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.tryletterhead.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Letterhead <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>“Initially, our goal was to create a local media product that would help people learn about the city, get more involved and serve a new generation of local news users,” co-founder and CEO Chris Sopher tells me by video chat. “Our ideas had included opening a bar, events and all kinds of other stuff. We quickly pared that back to the things that were working, and email was at the top of the list.”</p>
<p>Advertising inventory in these emails was in high demand, so the company built out a self-service payment system for advertisers, which allowed its newsletter writers to easily publish the correct ads in the correct place.</p>
<p>With this business model and technology as a foundation, it launched or acquired newsletters in <a href="https://theevergrey.com/">Seattle</a>, <a href="https://bridgeliner.com/">Portland</a>, <a href="https://pulp.town/">Orlando</a> and <a href="https://theincline.com/">Pittsburgh</a>. Through this process, it has continued to improve the tool itself.</p>
<p>It also discovered the broader demand.</p>
<p>“People would reach out to us and say ‘I love this newsletter, what tools do you use?’ because it was such a pain to produce emails with all of the different tools out there,” Sopher explains.</p>
<p>(Those tools, in this author’s experience, generally include a combination of Mailchimp, Constant Contact or Sailthru, together with your main web publishing CMS like WordPress, your separate subscription software like Piano and however you are managing ads.)</p>
<p>“We’d tell people that we used our own internal tools and they’d say ‘oh, can we use those, too? And we’d say ‘no, that’s not what we’re doing.’ Eventually, we said no enough that we looked at each other and said, ‘we should figure out how to get to yes on this.’ And that’s where Letterhead came from.”</p>

<p>Today, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whereby-us-the-new-tropic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whereby-us-the-new-tropic">WhereBy.Us <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is one of the few success stories from a catastrophic decade in local news. Sopher says that its five city newsletters are comfortably profitable via ads overall — having recovered from a pandemic dip earlier this year — and are continuing to grow.</p>
<p>But the new focus is on Letterhead’s tools, including the ad system, a new paid subscription feature that lets you do things like add paywalled subsections of emails, easy-to-use text editing and template formatting, and soon, analytics.</p>
<p>“Sponsorships and ads were [needs] we heard about most, so that’s where we started,” co-founder and COO Rebekah Monson said by email. “The bigger vision is to create a set of tools and services that feed into each other in one easy place, and help all of those revenue streams grow, eventually branching out from email. We&#8217;re seeing demand for that not just from traditional media publishers, but also from marketers, nonprofits, universities, professional associations — all these folks who have engaged communities and want to deepen those relationships and bring in revenue through that engagement.”</p>
<p>On the spectrum of email newsletter products, Letterhead’s focus on revenues and team collaboration places it adjacent to Substack’s focus on the individual writer, and to other products like Lede designed specifically around subscription news organizations.</p>
<p>Letterhead is explicitly a hosted software solution that you pay for your organization to use, not an open-source project like Ghost. Like how Shopify provides a suite of white-label e-commerce features for anyone who wants to run an online business, it wants to be the engine humming away under the hood of your newsletter.</p>
<p>On the much broader spectrum of all email solutions in the SaaS world, Letterhead is betting that its understanding of the market and its product design can beat out the brutally competitive world of SaaS email products.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090592" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090592" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2090592" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/letterhead-herogif02-large.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="511" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090592" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.tryletterhead.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Letterhead <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Since soft-launching earlier this year, Sopher says it has already been signing up a broad range of customers. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples he cited include startups (</span><a href="https://www.shootmytravel.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoot My Travel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), nonprofits (</span><a href="https://www.vidaysalud.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vida y Salud </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://www.refreshmiami.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refresh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and political groups (</span><a href="https://odaction.com/newsletters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OD Action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) as customers, as well as local news publishers, of course (</span><a href="https://vtdigger.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VTDigger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.choose954.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Choose954</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://santacruzlocal.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz Local</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span> Letterhead is also a partner in <a href="https://newspack.pub/">WordPress’ News Pack program</a>, which is a collection of plug-ins for publishers on that CMS.</p>
<p>“We’re always going to have an affinity to media publishing… but there is a broader need than just that industry,” he explains. “And we’re also seeing this moment where a lot of other organizations are participating in [publishing]. You name a topic, there will be professional reporters out there doing great work. But it’s also pretty likely that there is a brand, an agency, a nonprofit or some other organization creating interesting and useful content, and building a community around it — that would not raise its hand and say that it is part of the news industry.”</p>
<p>Sopher also notes that the product is designed to be modular, so that companies can just use parts of it and integrate its features with other email service providers and most any tech stack.</p>
<p>“What we’re seeing is that smaller customers are coming on for the simplicity of having it all in one place without sacrificing monetization,” he adds, “but larger customers are choosing us as one part of their stack as they build a multifaceted business or grow out of tools geared more to individual or independent creators.”</p>
<p>With the revenue options in place, Sopher says analytics and additional ESP options are coming next.</p>
<p>Over the course of its history, WhereBy.Us has raised $5 million from across tech and media. Backers include the Knight Foundation, Jason Calacanis&#8217; LAUNCH fund, Band of Angels, McClatchy, hundreds of smaller investors via Republic and SeedInvest and, most recently, a round led by Brick Capital.</p>
