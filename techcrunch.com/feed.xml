<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week’s biggest tech happenings. It was yet another busy week, but that just means we had a great time putting the show together and recording it. Honestly we have a lot of fun this week, and we hope that you crack a smile while we dig through the latest as a team.</p>
<p>Ready? Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Coinbase direct listing! Here&#8217;s our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">notes on its S-1</a>, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/coinbase-sets-direct-listing-reference-price-at-250-share-valuing-the-company-at-as-much-as-65b/">direct listing reference price</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/coinbase-opens-at-381-per-share-valuing-the-crypto-exchange-at-nearly-100b/">its results</a>. And we even wrote about the impact that it might have on other startup verticals!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/5-questions-about-grabs-epic-spac-investor-deck/">Grab&#8217;s impending SPAC</a>! As it turns out Natasha loves SPACs now, and even Danny and Alex had very little to say that was rude about this one.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1381995585591513088">Degreed became a unicorn,</a> proving yet again that education for the enterprise is a booming sub-sector.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/outschool-series-c-unicorn/">Outschool also became an edtech unicorn</a>, thanks to a new round led by Coatue and everyone&#8217;s rich cousin, Tiger Global. The conversation soon devolved into how Tiger Global is impacting the broader VC ecosystem, thanks to a fantastic analysis piece that you have to read<a href="https://randle.substack.com/p/playing-different-games"> here. </a></li>
<li>Papa <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/2137375/">raised $60 million</a>, also from Tiger Global. What do you call tech aimed at old folks? Don&#8217;t call it elder tech, we have a brand new phrase in store. Let&#8217;s see if it catches on.</li>
<li>AI chips! Danny talks the team <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2021/04/14/ai-chip-startup-groq-founded-by-ex-googlers-raises-300-million-to-power-autonomous-vehicles-and-data-centers/?sh=10fc9bbd65e3">through grokking Groq</a>, so that we can talk about TPUs without losing our minds. He&#8217;s a good egg.</li>
<li>And, finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/slice-series-d/">Slice raised more money</a>. Not from Tiger Global. We have good things to say about it.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google&#8217;s historical collection of location data has got it into hot water in Australia where a case brought by the country&#8217;s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has led to a federal court ruling that the tech giant misled consumers by operating a confusing dual-layer of location settings in what the regulator describes as a &#8220;world-first enforcement action&#8221;.</p>
<p>The case relates to personal location data collected by Google through Android mobile devices between January 2017 and December 2018.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/google-misled-consumers-about-the-collection-and-use-of-location-data">ACCC</a>, the court ruled that &#8220;when consumers created a new Google Account during the initial set-up process of their Android device, Google misrepresented that the ‘Location History’ setting was the only Google Account setting that affected whether Google collected, kept or used personally identifiable data about their location&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In fact, another Google Account setting titled ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ also enabled Google to collect, store and use personally identifiable location data when it was turned on, and that setting was turned on by default,&#8221; it wrote.</p>
<p>The Court also ruled that Google misled consumers when they later accessed the ‘Location History’ setting on their Android device during the same time period to turn that setting off because it did not inform them that by leaving the ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ setting switched on, Google would continue to collect, store and use their personally identifiable location data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Similarly, between 9 March 2017 and 29 November 2018, when consumers later accessed the ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ setting on their Android device, they were misled because Google did not inform them that the setting was relevant to the collection of personal location data,&#8221; the ACCC added.</p>
<p>Similar complaints about Google&#8217;s location data processing being deceptive &#8212; and allegations that it uses manipulative tactics in order to keep tracking web users’ locations for ad-targeting purposes &#8212; have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/google-faces-gdpr-complaint-over-deceptive-location-tracking/">raised by consumer agencies in Europe</a> for years. And in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/googles-location-tracking-finally-under-formal-probe-in-europe/">February 2020</a> the company&#8217;s lead data regulator in the region finally opened an investigation. However that probe remains ongoing.</p>
<p>Whereas the ACCC said today that it will be seeking &#8220;declarations, pecuniary penalties, publications orders, and compliance orders&#8221; following the federal court ruling. Although it added that the specifics of its enforcement action will be determined &#8220;at a later date&#8221;. So it&#8217;s not clear exactly when Google will be hit with an order &#8212; nor how large a fine it might face.</p>
<p>The tech giant may also seek to appeal the court ruling.</p>
<p>Google said today it&#8217;s reviewing its legal options and considering a &#8220;possible appeal&#8221; &#8212; highlighting the fact the Court did not agree wholesale with the ACCC&#8217;s case because it dismissed some of the allegations (related to certain statements Google made about the methods by which consumers could prevent it from collecting and using their location data, and the purposes for which personal location data was being used by Google).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Google&#8217;s statement in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The court rejected many of the ACCC’s broad claims. We disagree with the remaining findings and are currently reviewing our options, including a possible appeal. We provide robust controls for location data and are always looking to do more &#8212; for example we recently introduced auto delete options for Location History, making it even easier to control your data.”</p></blockquote>
<p>While Mountain View denies doing anything wrong in how it configures location settings &#8212; while simultaneously claiming it&#8217;s always looking to improve the controls it offers its users &#8212; Google&#8217;s settings and defaults have, nonetheless, got it into hot water with regulators before.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/">Back in 2019</a> France&#8217;s data watchdog, the CNIL, fined it $57M over a number of transparency and consent failures under the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation. That remains the largest GDPR penalty issued to a tech giant since the regulation came into force a little under three years ago &#8212; although France has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">more recently</a> sanctioned Google $120M under different EU laws for dropping tracking cookies without consent.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Australia, meanwhile, has forged ahead with passing legislation this year that directly targets the market power of Google (and Facebook) &#8212; passing a mandatory news media bargaining code in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">February</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> which aims to address the power imbalance between platform giants and publishers around the reuse of journalism content.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has made telemedicine video visits in the U.S. almost commonplace, but in Latin America, where broadband isn’t widely available, 1Doc3 is using text and chat to provide access to care. Today, the Colombia-based company announced a $3 million pre-Series A led by MatterScale Ventures and Kayyak Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m on a nice MacBook for this interview, but that’s not the case of most people in LatAm,” said Javier Cardona, co-founder and CEO of 1Doc3. The company’s name is a play on the phonetics of 1, 2, 3 in Spanish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reaching your primary care doctor when you’re not feeling well is getting harder and harder, and 1Doc3 aims to solve that problem in LatAm by offering a telemedicine platform powered by AI that does symptom assessment, triage and pre-diagnosis before connecting the patient to a doctor.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 97% of our consultations, you’re connected to a doctor in a matter of minutes,” Cardona said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the doctor, the patient can also get their prescriptions delivered to their home through 1Doc3. The startup, like others in the space, is trying to close the loop so patients can get care quickly without having to leave their homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Colombia, the company already has operations in Mexico and plans to use part of the funding to expand further in the region as well as building out a marketing and sales team, which it hasn’t had thus far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1Doc3 reaches customers directly and by establishing corporate partnerships where the companies themselves pay for their employees’ medical care through the startup. One of Cardona’s goals is to bring the unit economics down so that smaller businesses can also afford 1Doc3, which for corporates, now charges between $3-4 a month/employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For big companies, the money isn’t an issue, but our region is comprised of small to medium-sized businesses,” Cardona said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which was founded in 2013 and was a finalist in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/1doc3-at-the-finals-of-startup-battlefield-latin-america-2018/">TechCrunch’s Latin American Battlefield</a> in 2018, experienced massive growth in 2020, going from 2,500 to 35,000 consultations per month from February to December 2020, respectively, which led the company to be cashflow positive last year. In March of 2021, the company had $120,000 in MRR.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many startups, the jolt to found 1Doc3 came from a personal experience faced by the founder.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I was in Tanzania I had a medical need and I was definitely not going to go to a doctor in Tanzania, and I couldn’t reach any doctor online, not even in the U.S., and I became a little obsessed with this problem,” said Cardona, who was working in the Middle East and Africa at the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round brings the total raised by 1Doc3 to $5 million. Other investors that participated in the round include Swanhill Capital, Simma Capital and existing investors The Venture City, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EWA capital (previously Mountain Nazca Colombia) and Startup Health.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think cyberattacks are scary, what if those attacks were directed at your cardiac pacemaker? Medtronic, a medical device company, has been in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/medical-device-maker-medtronic-finally-fixes-its-hackable-pacemaker/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hot water over the last couple of years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because its pacemakers were getting hacked through their internet-based software updating systems. But in a new partnership with </span><a href="https://www.sternumiot.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sternum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an IoT cybersecurity startup based in Israel, Medtronic has focused on resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem was not with the medical devices themselves, but with the remote systems used to update the devices. Medtronic’s previous solution was to disconnect the devices from the internet, which in and of itself can cause other issues to arise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Medtronic was looking for a long-term solution that can help them with future developments,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natali Tshuva, Sternum’s founder and CEO. The company has already secured about 100,000 Medtronic devices.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sternum’s solution allows medical devices to protect themselves in real-time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s this endless race against vulnerability, so when a company discovers a vulnerability, they need to issue an update, but updating can be very difficult in the medical space, and until the update happens, the devices are vulnerable,&#8221; Tshuva told TechCrunch. &#8220;Therefore, we created an autonomous security that operates from within the device that can protect it without the need to update and patch vulnerabilities,” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is easier to protect new devices than to go back and protect legacy devices. Over the years hackers have gotten more and more sophisticated, so medical device companies have had to figure out how to protect the devices that are already out there.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to potentially doing harm to an individual, hackers have been taking advantage of device vulnerability as the gateway of choice into a hospital’s network, possibly causing a breach that can affect many more people. Tshuva explained that hospital networks are secured from the inside out, but devices that connect to the networks but are not protected can create a way in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, health systems have been known to experience the most data breaches out of any sector, accounting for 79% of all reported breaches in 2020. And in the first 10 months of last year, we saw a 45% increase in cyberattacks on health systems, according to data by </span><a href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/healthcare-accounts-for-79-of-all-reported-breaches-attacks-rise-45"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health IT Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Sternum’s partnership with Medtronic, the company also launched this week an IoT platform that allows, “devices to protect themselves, even when they are not connected to the internet,” Tshuva said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sternum, which raised about $10 million to date, also offers cybersecurity for IoT devices outside of healthcare, and according to Tshuva, the company focuses on areas that are “mission-critical.” Examples include railroad infrastructure sensors and management systems, and power grids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tshuva, who grew up in Israel, holds a master’s in computer science and worked for the Israeli Defense Force&#8217;s 8200 unit — similar to the U.S.’s National Security Alliance — said she always wanted to make an impact in the medical field. “I looked to combine the medical space with my life, and I realized I could have an impact on remote care devices,” she said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is to be sued in Europe over the major leak of user data that dates back to 2019 but which only<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/answers-being-sought-from-facebook-over-latest-data-breach/"> came to light recently</a> after information on 533M+ accounts was found posted for free download on a hacker forum.</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://www.digitalrights.ie/facebook/">Digital Rights Ireland</a> (DRI) announced it&#8217;s commencing a &#8220;mass action&#8221; to sue Facebook, citing the right to monetary compensation for breaches of personal data that&#8217;s set out in the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>Article 82 of the GDPR provides for a &#8216;right to compensation and liability&#8217; for those affected by violations of the law. Since the regulation came into force, in May 2018, related civil litigation has been on the rise in the region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Ireland-based digital rights group is urging Facebook users who live in the European Union or European Economic Area to check whether their data was breach &#8212; via the <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">haveibeenpwned</a> website (which lets you check by email address or mobile number) &#8212; and sign up to join the case if so.</p>
<p>Information leaked via the breach includes Facebook IDs, location, mobile phone numbers, email address, relationship status and employer.</p>
<p>Facebook has been contacted for comment on the litigation. <strong>Update:</strong> A Facebook spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>“</b>We understand people&#8217;s concerns, which is why we continue to strengthen our systems to make scraping from Facebook without our permission more difficult and go after the people behind it. As LinkedIn and Clubhouse have shown, no company can completely eliminate scraping or prevent data sets like these from appearing. That&#8217;s why we devote substantial resources to combat it and will continue to build out our capabilities to help stay ahead of this challenge.”<b> </b></p></blockquote>
<p>The tech giant&#8217;s European headquarters is located in Ireland &#8212; and earlier this week the national data watchdog <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/ireland-opens-gdpr-investigation-into-facebook-leak/">opened an investigation</a>, under EU and Irish data protection laws.</p>
<p>A mechanism in the GDPR for simplifying investigation of cross-border cases means Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) is Facebook&#8217;s lead data regulator in the EU. However it has been criticized over its handling of and approach to GDPR complaints and investigations &#8212; including the length of time it&#8217;s taking to issue decisions on major cross-border cases. And this is particularly true for Facebook.</p>
<p>With the three-year anniversary of the GDPR fast approaching, the DPC has multiple open investigations into various aspects of Facebook&#8217;s business but has yet to issue a single decision against the company.</p>
<p>(The closest it&#8217;s come is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">preliminary suspension order</a> issued last year, in relation to Facebook&#8217;s EU to US data transfers. However that complaint long predates GDPR; and Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/facebook-seeks-fresh-legal-delay-to-block-order-to-suspend-its-transatlantic-data-transfers/">immediately filed to block the order</a> via the courts. A resolution <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">is expected later this year</a> after the litigant filed his own judicial review of the DPC&#8217;s processes).</p>
<p>Since May 2018 the EU&#8217;s data protection regime has &#8212; at least on paper &#8212; baked in fines of up to 4% of a company&#8217;s global annual turnover for the most serious violations.</p>
<p>Again, though, the sole GDPR fine issued to date by the DPC against a tech giant (Twitter) is very far off that theoretical maximum. Last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">December</a> the regulator announced a €450k (~$547k) sanction against Twitter &#8212; which works out to around just 0.1% of the company&#8217;s full-year revenue.</p>
<p>That penalty was also for a data breach &#8212; but one which, unlike the Facebook leak, <em>had</em> been publicly disclosed when Twitter found it in 2019. So Facebook&#8217;s failure to disclose the vulnerability it discovered and claims it fixed by September 2019, which led to the leak of 533M accounts now, suggests it <em>should</em> face a higher sanction from the DPC than Twitter received.</p>
<p>However even if Facebook ends up with a more substantial GDPR penalty for this breach the watchdog&#8217;s caseload backlog and plodding procedural pace makes it hard to envisage a swift resolution to an investigation that&#8217;s only a few days old.</p>
<p>Judging by past performance it&#8217;ll be years before the DPC decides on this 2019 Facebook leak &#8212; which likely explains why the DRI sees value in instigating class-action style litigation in parallel to the regulatory investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Compensation is not the only thing that makes this mass action worth joining. It is important to send a message to large data controllers that they must comply with the law and that there is a cost to them if they do not,&#8221; DRI writes on its <a href="https://www.digitalrights.ie/facebook/">website</a>.</p>
<p>It also submitted a complaint about the Facebook breach to the DPC <a href="https://www.digitalrights.ie/complaint-to-dpc-in-relation-to-facebook-data-dump-breach/">earlier this month</a>, writing then that it was &#8220;also consulting with its legal advisors on other options including a mass action for damages in the Irish Courts&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that the GDPR enforcement gap is creating a growing opportunity for litigation funders to step in in Europe and take a punt on suing for data-related compensation damages &#8212; with a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/oracle-and-salesforce-hit-with-gdpr-class-action-lawsuits-over-cookie-tracking-consent/">other mass actions announced last year</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of DRI its focus is evidently on seeking to ensure that digital rights are upheld. But it told <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/2021/0416/1210188-facebook-data-case/">RTE</a> that it believes compensation claims which force tech giants to pay money to users whose privacy rights have been violated is the best way to make them legally compliant.</p>
<p>Facebook, meanwhile, has sought to play down the breach it failed to disclose in 2019 &#8212; claiming it&#8217;s &#8216;old data&#8217; &#8212; a deflection that ignores the fact that people&#8217;s dates of birth don&#8217;t change (nor do most people routinely change their mobile number or email address).</p>
<p>Plenty of the &#8216;old&#8217; data exposed in this latest massive Facebook leak will be very handy for spammers and fraudsters to target Facebook users &#8212; and also now for litigators to target Facebook for data-related damages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pakistan has temporarily blocked several social media services in the South Asian nation, according to users and a government-issued notice reviewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In an order titled “Complete Blocking of Social Media Platforms,” the Pakistani government ordered Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to block social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Telegram from 11am to 3pm local time (06.00am to 10.00am GMT) Friday.</p>
<p>The move comes as Pakistan looks to crackdown against a violent terrorist group and prevent troublemakers from disrupting Friday prayers congregations following <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-deploys-paramilitary-forces-quell-deadly-islamist-protests-2021-04-14/">days of violent protests</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this week Pakistan banned the Islamist group Tehrik-i-Labaik Pakistan after arresting its leader, which prompted protests, according to local media reports.</p>
<p>An entrepreneur based in Pakistan told TechCrunch that even though the order is supposed to expire at 3pm local time, similar past moves by the government suggests that the disruption will likely last for longer.</p>
<p>Though Pakistan, like its neighbor India, has temporarily cut phone calls access in the nation in the past, this is the first time Islamabad has issued a blanket ban on social media in the country.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/pakistan-blocks-tiktok-again-over-immoral-and-objectionable-videos/">explored ways to assume more control</a> over content on digital services operating in the country in recent years. Some activists said the country was taking extreme measures without much explanations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">What kind of national emergency we are dealing with that govt banned entire social media temporarily? These arbitrary decisions of blocking and banning have never done any good instead opened ways to blanket bans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ocado</a>, the UK online grocer that has been making strides reselling its technology to other grocery companies to help them build and run their own online ordering-and-delivery operations, is making an investment today into what it believes will be the next chapter of how that business will grow: it is <a href="https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/OCDO/ocado-invests-in-oxbotica-iw123prduuvbh2j.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taking a £10 million ($13.8 million) stake in Oxbotica</a>, a UK startup that develops autonomous driving systems.</p>
<p>Ocado is treating this as a strategic investment to develop AI-powered, self-driving systems that will work across its operations, from vehicles within and around its packing warehouses through to the last-mile vehicles that deliver grocery orders to people&#8217;s homes. It says it expects the first products to come out of this deal &#8212; most likely in closed environments like warehouses rather the less structured prospect of open streets &#8212; to be online in two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not constraining ourselves to work in any one use case,&#8221; said Alex Harvey, chief of advanced technology at Ocado, in an interview. But to roll out auotonomous systems everwhere, he added, &#8220;we realize there are areas where we will need regulatory compliance,&#8221; among other factors. The deal is non-exclusive, and both can work with other partners if they choose, the companies confirmed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investment is coming as an extension to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/oxbotica-raises-47m-to-deploy-its-autonomous-vehicle-software-in-industrial-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxbotica&#8217;s Series B</a> that it announced in January, bringing the total size of the round &#8212; which was led by bp ventures, the investing arm of oil and gas giant <a href="http://bp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bp</a>, and also included BGF, safety equipment maker Halma, pension fund HostPlus, IP Group, Tencent, Venture Science and funds advised by Doxa Partners &#8212; to over $60 million. Oxbotica has not disclosed valuation but Paul Newman, co-founder and CTO of Oxbotica, confirmed in an interview that the valuation went up with this latest investment.</p>
<p>The timing of the news is very interesting. It comes just one day (less than 24 hours in fact) after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/walmart-helps-push-cruises-latest-investment-round-to-2-75b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart in the US took a stake in Cruise</a>, another autonomous tech company, as part of recent $2.75B monster round.</p>
<p>Walmart, <a href="https://corporate.asda.com/newsroom/2021/02/16/completion-of-acquisition-of-asda-by-the-issa-brothers-and-tdr-capital-ltd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until February</a>, owned one of Ocado&#8217;s big competitors in the UK, ASDA; and Ocado has made its first forays into the US, by way of its deal to power <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/kroger-launches-its-first-ocado-powered-shed-a-massive-robot-filled-fulfillment-center-in-ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kroger&#8217;s online grocery business</a>, which went live this week, too. So it seems that competition between these two is heating up on the food front.</p>
<p>More generally, there has been a huge surge in the world of online grocery order and delivery services in the last year. Earlier movers like online-only Ocado, Tesco in the UK (which owns both physical stores and online networks), and Instacart in the US have seen record demand, but they have also been joined by a lot of competition from well-capitalized newer entrants also keen to seize that opportunity, and bringing different approaches (next-hour delivery, smaller baskets, specific products) to do so.</p>
<p>In Ocado&#8217;s home patch of Europe, other big names looking to extend outside of their home turfs include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/norways-kolonial-rebrands-as-oda-bags-265m-on-a-900m-valuation-to-grow-its-online-grocery-delivery-business-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oda</a> (formerly Kolonial); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/czech-on-demand-grocery-delivery-startup-rohlik-bags-230m-to-expand-across-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rohlik</a> out of the Czech Republic (which in March bagged $230 million in funding); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/everli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everli</a> out of Italy (formerly called Supermercato24, it raised $100 million); <a href="https://ecommercenews.eu/picnic-doubles-revenue-eyes-expansion-to-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Picnic</a> out of the Netherlands (which has yet to announce any recent funding but it feels like it’s only a matter of time given it too has <a href="https://ecommercenews.eu/picnic-doubles-revenue-eyes-expansion-to-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly laid out international ambitions</a>). Even Ocado has <a href="http://techmeme.com/200612/p23#a200612p23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised huge amounts of money</a> to pursue its own international ambitions. And that&#8217;s before you consider the nearly dozens of next-hour, smaller bag grocery delivery plays.</p>
<p>A lot of these companies will have had a big year last year, not least because of the pandemic and how it drove many people to stay at home, and stay away from places where they might catch and spread the Covid-19 virus.</p>
<p>But now, the big question will be how that market will look in the future as peoples go back to &#8220;normal&#8221; life.</p>
<p>As we pointed out earlier this week, Ocado has already laid out how demand is lower, although still higher than pre-pandemic times. And indeed, the new-new normal (if we can call it that) may well see the competitive landscape tighten some more.</p>
<p>That  could also be one reason why companies like Ocado are putting more money into working on what might be the next generation of services: one more efficient and run purely (or at least mostly) on technology.</p>
<p>The rationale of forking out big for autonomous tech, which is still largely untested and very, very expensive technology, to save money is a long-term play. Logistics today accounts for some 10% of the total cost of a grocery delivery operation. But that figure goes up when there is peak demand or anything that disrupts regularly scheduled services.</p>
<p>My guess is also that with all of the subsidized services that are flying about right now, where you see free deliveries or discounts on groceries to encourage new business &#8212; a result of the market getting so competitive &#8212; those logistics have bled into being an even bigger cost.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s no surprise to see the biggest players in this space looking at ways that it might leverage advances in technology to cut those costs and speed up how those operations work, even if it&#8217;s just a promise of discounts in years, not weeks. Of course investors might see it otherwise if that doesn&#8217;t go to plan.</p>
<p>In addition to this collaboration with Oxbotica, Ocado said it will be looking to make more investments and/or partnerships as it grows and develops its autonomous vehicle capabilities. While this is the company&#8217;s first investment into Oxbotica, it has made a number of investments into other startups, and collaborated to work on the next stage of technology. This has included research to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/ocado-is-developing-robot-hands-that-wont-bruise-bananas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build a robotic arm</a> &#8212; which robotic pickers is something it will be introducing soon &#8212; as well as the <a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/investors/ocado-acquires-kindred-systems-and-haddington-dynamics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent acquisition of two robotics companies</a>, Kindred and Haddington, for $262 million; and investments in robotics startups <a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/media/press-releases/year/2019/ocado-acquires-minority-stake-robotics-start-karakuri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karakuri</a> and <a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/media/press-releases/year/2020/ocado-group-acquires-minority-stake-robotics-start-myrmex-inc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Myrmex</a>, and more,</p>
<p>Notably, Oxbotica and Ocado are not strangers. They started to work together on a delivery pilot back in 2017. You can see a video of how that delivery service looks here:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JklP055_lFs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an excellent opportunity for Oxbotica and Ocado to strengthen our partnership, sharing our vision for the future of autonomy,&#8221; said Newman, in a statement. &#8220;By combining both companies&#8217; cutting-edge knowledge and resources, we hope to bring our Universal Autonomy vision to life and continue to solve some of the world&#8217;s most complex autonomy challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as with all self-driving technology &#8212; incredibly complex and full of regulatory and safety hurdles &#8212; we are still fairly far from full commercial systems that actually remove people from the equation completely.</p>
<p>&#8220;For both regulatory and complexity reasons, Ocado expects that the development of vehicles that operate in low-speed urban areas or in restricted access areas, such as inside its CFC buildings or within its CFC yards, may become a reality sooner than fully-autonomous deliveries to consumers&#8217; homes,&#8221; Ocado notes in its statement on the deal. &#8220;However, all aspects of autonomous vehicle development will be within the scope of this collaboration. Ocado expects to see the first prototypes of some early use cases for autonomous vehicles within two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newman noted that while on-street self-driving might still be some years away, it&#8217;s less of a moonshot concept today than it used to be, and that Oxbotica is on the road to it already. &#8220;You can get to the moon in stages,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><em>Updated with interviews with both companies, and to correct that Walmart closed its deal to sell ASDA in February.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mercedes-Benz lifted the final veil Thursday on its flagship EQS sedan after weeks of teasers, announcements and even a pre-production drive in which TechCrunch participated. The company peeled off the camouflage of the EQS — the electric counterpart to the Mercedes S Class — and revealed an ultra-luxury and tech-centric sedan.</p>
<p>The exterior is getting much of the attention today; but it&#8217;s all of the tech that got ours, from the microsleep warning system and 56-inch hyperscreen to the monster HEPA air filter and the software that intuitively learns the driver&#8217;s wants and needs. There is even a new fragrance called No.6 MOOD Linen and is described as &#8220;carried by the green note of a fig and linen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not one thing because this car is 100 things,&#8221; Ola Källenius, the chairman of the board of management of Daimler AG and head of Mercedes-Benz, told TechCrunch in an interview the morning of the EQS launch. &#8220;And it&#8217;s those 100 little things that make the difference and that makes a Mercedes a Mercedes.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mercedes is betting that the tech, coupled with performance and design, will attract buyers. This is a high-stakes game for Mercedes. The German automaker is banking on a successful rollout of the EQS in North America that will erase any memory of its troubled — and now nixed — launch of the EQC crossover in the United States.</p>
<h2>Quick nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>Before diving into the all the techy bells and whistles, here are the basics. The EQS is the first all-electric luxury sedan under the automaker&#8217;s new EQ brand. The first models being introduced to the U.S. market will be the EQS 450+ with 329 hp and the EQS 580 4MATIC with 516 hp. Mercedes didn&#8217;t share the price of these models. It did provide a bevy of other details on its performance, design and range.</p>
<p>The EQS that will be available in the U.S. has a length that is a skosh over 17 feet, precisely 205.4 inches long, which is the Goldilocks equivalent to the Mercedes S Class variants.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139556" style="width: 4971px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2020-11-21_Image_20C0714-072.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139556" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2139556 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2020-11-21_Image_20C0714-072.jpg" alt="Mercedes-EQS" width="4961" height="2983" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2020-11-21_Image_20C0714-072.jpg 4961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2020-11-21_Image_20C0714-072.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2020-11-21_Image_20C0714-072.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2020-11-21_Image_20C0714-072.jpg?resize=768,462 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2020-11-21_Image_20C0714-072.jpg?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2020-11-21_Image_20C0714-072.jpg?resize=1536,924 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2020-11-21_Image_20C0714-072.jpg?resize=2048,1231 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2020-11-21_Image_20C0714-072.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4961px) 100vw, 4961px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2139556" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes EQS 580 4MATIC</p></div></p>
<p>The vehicle has a co-efficient drag of 0.202, which sneaks below Tesla&#8217;s Model S and the upcoming Lucid Motors Air, making its the most aerodynamic production car in the world. All EQS models have an electric powertrain at the rear axle. The EQS 580 4MATIC also has an electric powertrain at the front axle, giving it that all-wheel drive capability. The EQS generates between 329 hp and 516 hp, depending on the variant. Mercedes said a performance version is being planned that will have up to 630 hp. Both the EQS 450+ and the EQS 580 4MATIC have a top speed of 130 miles per hour. The EQS 450+ will have a 0 to 60 mph acceleration time of 5.5 seconds, while its more powerful sibling will be able to achieve that speed in 4.1 seconds.</p>
<p>The EQS will have two possible batteries to choose from, although Mercedes has only released details of one. The heftiest configuration of the EQS has a battery with 107.8 kWh of usable energy content that can travel up 478 miles on a single charge under the European WLTP estimates. The EPA estimates, which tend to be stricter, will likely fall below that figure.</p>
<p>The vehicle can be charged with up to 200 kW at fast charging stations with direct current, according to Mercedes. At home or at public charging stations, the EQS can be charged with AC using the on-board charger.</p>
<p>Now on to some of the technological highlights within the vehicle.</p>
<h2>ADAS</h2>
<p>There are loads of driver assistance features in the EQS, which are supported by a variety of sensors such as ultrasound, camera, radar and lidar that are integrated into the vehicle. Adaptive cruise, the ability to adjust the acceleration behavior, lane detection and automatic lane changes as well as steering assist helps the driver follow the driving lane at speeds up to 130 mph are some of the ADAS features. The system also recognizes signposted speed limits, overhead frameworks and signs at construction zones, and includes warnings about running a stop sign or a red light.</p>
<p>Another new feature is the microsleep warning function, which becomes active once the vehicle reaches speeds over 12 mph. This feature works by analyzing the driver&#8217;s eyelid movements through a camera on the driver&#8217;s display, which is only available with MBUX Hyperscreen.</p>
<p>There are several active assist features that will intervene if needed. An active blind spot assist can give a visual warning of potential lateral collisions in a speed range from around 6 mph to 124 mph. However, if the driver ignores the warnings and still initiates a lane change, the system can take corrective action by one-sided braking intervention at the last moment if the speed exceeds 19 mph, Mercedes said. The feature remains active even while parked and will warn against exiting if a vehicle or cyclist is passing nearby.</p>
<p>There is also an active emergency stop assist feature that will brake the vehicle to a standstill in its own lane if the sensors and software recognizes that the driver is no longer responding to the traffic situation for a longer period. The brakes are not suddenly applied. If the driver is unresponsive, it begins with an acoustic warning and a visual warning appears in the instrument cluster. Those warnings continue as the vehicle starts to slowly decelerate. Hazard lights are activated and the driver&#8217;s seatbelt is briefly tensioned as a haptic warning. The final step is what Mercedes describes as a &#8220;short, strong brake jolt&#8221; as an additional warning followed by the car decelerating to a standstill, with an optional single lane change if necessary.</p>
<p>Mercedes is also offering the option of DRIVE PILOT, which is an SAE Level 3 conditional automated driving system feature. This would allow hands-free driving. Regulations in Europe prevent that level of automation to be deployed in production vehicles on public roads. However, Källenius told media in Germany on Thursday that the company is on &#8220;on the verge of trying to certify the first volume production car Level 3 system in Germany in the second half of this year,&#8221; <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/mercedes-eqs-offer-hands-self-driving-tech">Automotive News Europe reported</a>.</p>

<h2>The car that learns</h2>
<p>Many of the technological gee-whiz doodads in the EQS tie back to an underlying AI that is designed to learn the driver&#8217;s behavior. That is achieved through software and a dizzying number of sensors. Mercedes said that depending on the equipment, the EQS will have up to 350 sensors that are used to record distances, speeds and accelerations, lighting conditions, precipitation and temperatures, the occupancy of seats as well as the driver&#8217;s blink of an eye or the passengers&#8217; speech.</p>
<p>The sensors capture information, which is then processed by electronic control units (computers) and software algorithms then take over to make decisions. TechCrunch automotive reviewer Tamara Warren noticed the vehicle&#8217;s ability to learn her preference during a half day with the EQS.</p>
<p>Mercedes ran through a number of examples of how these sensors and software might work together, including an optional driving sound that is interactive and reacts to different parameters, such as position of the accelerator pedal, speed or recuperation.</p>
<p>The intuitive learning is mostly apparent through interactions with the MBUX infotainment system, which will proactively show the right functions for the user at the right time. Sensors pick up on change in the surroundings and user behavior and will react accordingly. Mercedes learned from data collected from the first-generation MBUX, which debuted in the 2019 Mercedes A Class, and found most of the use cases fall in the Navigation, Radio/Media and Telephone categories.</p>
<p>That user data informed how the second-generation MBUZ, and specifically the one in the EQS, is laid out. For instance, the navigation app is always in the center of the visual display unit.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139542" style="width: 6585px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__79.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139542" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2139542 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__79.jpg" alt="2022_Mercedes_EQS__79" width="6575" height="4383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__79.jpg 6575w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__79.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__79.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__79.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__79.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__79.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__79.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__79.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6575px) 100vw, 6575px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2139542" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mercedes-Benz</p></div></p>
<p>The MBUX uses natural language processing and so drivers can always use their voice to launch a radio station or control the climate. But Mercedes is really pushing the EQS&#8217; intuitive learning capabilities. This means that as a driver uses the vehicle, items that might be typically buried in the menu will appear up front, or offered up depending on the time or even location of the vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;The car gets to know you as a person and your preferences and what you do,&#8221; said Källenius. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost like it serves up the option that you want to do next, before you even think about it you get.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You get a pizza delivered before you even get hungry,&#8221; Källenius said, jokingly. &#8220;That&#8217;s phenomenal in terms of intuition.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Mercedes there are more than 20 other functions such as birthday reminders that are automatically offered with the help of artificial intelligence when they are relevant to the customer. These suggestion modules, which are displayed on the zero-layer interface, are called &#8220;Magic Modules.&#8221; Here is how it might work: if the driver always calls a particular friend or relative on the way home on certain evenings, the vehicle will deliver a suggestion regarding this particular call on this day of the week and at this time. A business card will appear with their contact information and &#8212; if this is stored &#8212; their photo, Mercedes said. All the suggestions from MBUX are coupled with the logged-in profile of the user. This means that if someone else drives the EQS on that same evening, with their own profile logged-in, this recommendation is not displayed.</p>
<p>If a driver always listens to a specific radio program on their commute home, this suggestion will be displayed, or if they regularly use the hot-stone massage, the system will automatically suggest the comfort function in colder temperatures.</p>
<p>This also applies to the vehicle&#8217;s driving functions. For example, the MBUX will remember if the driver has a steep driveway or passes over the same set of speed bumps entering their neighborhood. If the vehicle approaches that GPS position, the MBUX will suggest raising the chassis to offer more ground clearance.</p>
<h2>Health and wellness</h2>
<p>Remember those sensors? There&#8217;s a way for drivers to take it a step further and link their smartwatch — Mercedes-Benz vivoactive 3, the Mercedes-Benz Venu or another compatible Garmin — to the vehicle&#8217;s so-called energizing coach. This coach responds to the user&#8217;s behavior and will offer up one of several programs such as &#8220;freshness,&#8221; &#8220;warmth,&#8221; &#8220;vitality&#8221; or &#8220;joy&#8221; depending on the individual. Via the Mercedes me app, the smartwatch sends vital data of the wearer to the coach, including pulse rate, stress level and sleep quality. The pulse rate recorded by the integrated Garmin wearable is shown in the central display.</p>
<p>What does this all mean in practice? Depending on the user&#8217;s wants and the AI system&#8217;s understanding of what he or she wants, the lighting, climate, sound and seating might change. This is, of course, all integrated with the voice assistant &#8220;Hey Mercedes&#8221; so drivers can simply make a statement to trigger the program they want.</p>
<p>If the driver says &#8220;I am stressed,&#8221; the Joy program will be launched. If the driver says &#8220;I&#8217;m tired,&#8221; they are then prompted to take a break the Vitality program.</p>
<p>Mercedes S Class owners might already be familiar with these options, although the automaker notes that EQS builds on the system. There are now three new energizing nature programs called forest glade, sounds of the sea and summer rain, as well as training and tips options. Each program launches different and immersive sounds, created in consultation with the acoustic ecologist Gordon Hempton. For instance, &#8220;forest glade&#8221; will deliver a combination of birdsong, rustling leaves and a gentle breeze. The program is rounded off by warm music soundscapes and subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Sounds of the sea will produce soft music soundscapes, wave sounds and seagull sounds. Blasts of air from the air conditioning system completes the effect. Meanwhile &#8220;summer rain&#8221; offers up sounds of raindrops on leafy canopies, distant thunder, pattering rain and ambient music soundscapes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139541" style="width: 6585px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139541" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2139541 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg" alt="2022_Mercedes_EQS__64" width="6575" height="4383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg 6575w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6575px) 100vw, 6575px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2139541" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mercedes-Benz</p></div></p>
<p>For those long drives that require a break, Mercedes added a power nap feature. Once power nap is selected (and no, never when driving), the program runs through three phases: falling asleep, sleeping and waking up. The driver&#8217;s seat moves into a rest position, the side windows and panorama roof sunshade are closed and the air ionization is activated. Soothing sounds and the depiction of a starry sky on the central display support falling asleep, according to Mercedes. Once it is time to wake up, a soundscape is activated, a fragrance is deployed and a brief active massage and seat ventilation begins. The seat raises and the sunshade in the roof liner opens.</p>
<h2>Voice</h2>
<p>As mentioned, the &#8220;Hey Mercedes&#8221; voice assistant uses natural language processing and can handle an array of requests. Mercedes said the assistant can now do more, and certain actions such as accepting a phone call can be made without the activation keyword &#8220;Hey Mercedes.&#8221; The assistant can now explain vehicle functions.</p>
<p>The assistant can also recognize vehicle occupants by their voices. There is in fact individual microphones placed at each seating area within the vehicle. Once they have been learned, the assistant can access personal data and functions for that specific user.</p>
<p>The voice assistant in the EQS can also be operated from the rear, according to Mercedes.</p>
<p>These personal profiles are stored in the cloud as part of &#8220;Mercedes me.&#8221; That means the profiles can also be used in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles with the new MBUX generation. Security is built in and includes a PIN and then combines face and voice recognition to authenticate. This allows access to individual settings or verification of digital payment processes from the vehicle, the automaker said.</p>
<h2>Screens and entertainment</h2>
<p>Finally, yes the screens. All of the screens. The 56-inch hyperscreen gets the most attention, but there are screens throughout the EQS. What is important about them is how they communicate with each other.</p>
<p>The hyperscreen is actually three screens that sit under a common bonded glass cover and visually merge into one display. The driver display is 12.3 inches, the central display is 17.7 inches and front passenger display is 12.3 inches. The MBUX Hyperscreen is a touchscreen and also throws in haptic feedback and force feedback.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes when I think about the first design and what we&#8217;ve actually done here, it&#8217;s like, &#8216;Are we mad to try to create a one meter 41 centimeters curved bonded glass, one piece in the car,&#8221; said Källenius. &#8220;The physical piece in its own right — it&#8217;s a piece of technological art.&#8221;</p>

<p>A lot of attention was paid to the backseat because the EQS, like its S Class counterpart, is often used to chauffeur the owner. Mercedes won&#8217;t call this a rear-seat entertainment system and instead refers to it as a multi-seat entertainment system because everything is connected.</p>
<p>Källenius explained that if a driver wants the two rear passengers to watch a different movie, a simple drag and swipe motion on the main screen will throw that new programming back to the rear. The passengers can also throw movies from left to right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) has <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-releases-draft-legislation-to-protect-americans-personal-data-from-hostile-foreign-governments">proposed a draft bill</a> that would limit the types of information that could be bought and sold by tech companies abroad, and the countries it could be legally sold in. The legislation is imaginative and not highly specific, but it indicates growing concern at the federal level over the international data trade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shady data brokers shouldn’t get rich selling Americans’ private data to foreign countries that could use it to threaten our national security,&#8221; said Sen. Wyden in a statement accompanying the bill. They probably shouldn&#8217;t get rich selling Americans&#8217; private data at all, but national security is a good way to grease the wheels.</p>
<p>The Protecting Americans&#8217; Data From Foreign Surveillance Act would be a first step toward categorizing and protecting consumer data as a commodity that&#8217;s traded on the global market. Right now there are few if any controls over what data specific to a person — buying habits, movements, political party — can be sold abroad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This means that, for instance, an American data broker could sell the preferred brands and home addresses of millions of Americans to, say, a Chinese bank doing investment research. Some of this trade is perfectly innocuous, even desirable in order to promote global commerce, but at what point does it become dangerous or exploitative?</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t any official definition of what should and shouldn&#8217;t be sold to whom, the way we limit sales of certain intellectual property or weapons. The proposed law would first direct the secretary of Commerce to identify the data we should be protecting and to whom it should be protected against.</p>
<p>The general shape of protected data would be that which &#8220;if exported by third parties, could harm U.S. national security.&#8221; The countries that would be barred from receiving it would be those with inadequate data protection and export controls, recent intelligence operations against the U.S. or laws that allow the government to compel such information to be handed over to them. Obviously this is aimed at the likes of China and Russia, though ironically the U.S. fits the bill pretty well itself.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VKULcBPjwC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/gilliband-law-data-agency/">A new Senate bill would create a US data protection agency</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A new Senate bill would create a US data protection agency&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/gilliband-law-data-agency/embed/#?secret=VKULcBPjwC" data-secret="VKULcBPjwC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There would be exceptions for journalism and First Amendment-protected speech, and for encrypted data — for example storing encrypted messages on servers in one of the targeted countries. The law would also create penalties for executives &#8220;who knew or should have known&#8221; that their company was illegally exporting data, and creates pathways for people harmed or detained in a foreign country owing to illegally exported data. That might be if, say, another country used an American facial recognition service to spot, stop and arrest someone before they left.</p>
<p>If this all sounds a little woolly, it is — but that&#8217;s more or less on purpose. It is not for Congress to invent such definitions as are necessary for a law like this one; that duty falls to expert agencies, which must conduct studies and produce reports that Congress can refer to. This law represents the first handful of steps along those lines: getting the general shape of things straight and giving fair warning that certain classes of undesirable data commerce will soon be illegal — with an emphasis on executive responsibility, something that should make tech companies take notice.</p>
<p>The legislation would need to be sensitive to existing arrangements by which companies spread out data storage and processing for various economic and legal reasons. Free movement of data is to a certain extent necessary for globe-spanning businesses that must interact with one another constantly, and to hobble those established processes with red tape or fees might be disastrous to certain locales or businesses. Presumably this would all come up during the studies, but it serves to demonstrate that this is a very complex, not to say delicate, digital ecosystem the law would attempt to modify.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in the early stages of this type of regulation, and this bill is just getting started in the legislative process, so expect a few months at the very least before we hear anything more on this one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has banned right-wing provocateur James O&#8217;Keefe, creator of political gotcha video producer Project Veritas, for violating its &#8220;platform manipulation and spam policy,&#8221; suggesting he was operating multiple accounts in an unsanctioned way. O&#8217;Keefe has already announced that he will sue the company for defamation.</p>
<p>The ban, or &#8220;permanent suspension&#8221; as Twitter calls it, occurred Thursday afternoon. A Twitter representative said the action followed the violation of rules prohibiting &#8220;operating fake accounts&#8221; and attempting to &#8220;artificially amplify or disrupt conversations through the use of multiple accounts,&#8221; as noted <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation">here</a>.</p>
<p>This suggests O&#8217;Keefe was banned for operating multiple accounts, outside the laissez-faire policy that lets people have a professional and a personal account, and that sort of thing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ssharp-eyed users noticed that O&#8217;Keefe&#8217;s last tweet unironically accused reporter Jesse Hicks of impersonation, including an image showing a partly redacted phone number supposedly belonging to Hicks. This too may have run afoul of Twitter&#8217;s rules about posting personal information, but Twitter declined to comment on this when I asked. (<strong>Update</strong>: The image was in fact redacted, I thought it was done by the person who took the screenshot but the first digits were removed in the original tweet.)</p>
<p>Supporters of O&#8217;Keefe say that the company removed his account as retribution for his most recent &#8220;exposé&#8221; involving surreptitious recordings of a CNN employee admitting the news organization has a political bias. (The person he was talking to had, impersonating a nurse, matched with him on Tinder.)</p>
<p>For his part O&#8217;Keefe said he would be suing Twitter for defamation over the allegation that he operated fake accounts. Chief Legal Officer Jered T. Ede told TechCrunch that &#8220;James O’Keefe has only one account. He does not have fake accounts. Twitter’s statement is simply false.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/">Dell announced it was spinning out VMware</a> yesterday, the move <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/dells-debt-hangover-from-67b-emc-deal-could-put-vmware-stock-in-play/">itself wasn&#8217;t surprising;</a> there had been public speculation for some time. But Dell could have gone a number of ways in this deal, despite its choice to spin VMware out as a separate company with a constituent dividend instead of an outright sale.</p>
<p>The dividend route, which involves a payment to shareholders between $11.5 billion and $12 billion, has the advantage of being tax-free (or at least that&#8217;s what Dell hopes as it petitions the IRS). For Dell, which owns 81% of VMware, the dividend translates to somewhere between $9.3 billion and $9.7 billion in cash, which the company plans to use to pay down a portion of the huge debt it still holds from<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/67-billion-dell-emc-deal-becomes-official-today/"> its $58 billion EMC purchase in 2016</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Dell hopes to have its cake and eat it too with this deal: It generates a large slug of cash to use for personal debt relief while securing a five-year commercial deal that should keep the two companies closely aligned.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>VMware was the crown jewel in that transaction, giving Dell an inroad to the cloud it had lacked prior to the deal. For context, VMware popularized the notion of the virtual machine, a concept that led to the development of cloud computing as we know it today. It has since expanded much more broadly beyond that, giving Dell a solid foothold in cloud native computing.</p>
<p>Dell hopes to have its cake and eat it too with this deal: It generates a large slug of cash to use for personal debt relief while securing a five-year commercial deal that should keep the two companies closely aligned. Dell CEO Michael Dell will remain chairman of the VMware board, which should help smooth the post-spinout relationship.</p>
<p>But could Dell have extracted more cash out of the deal?</p>
<h2>Doing what&#8217;s best for everyone</h2>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategies, says that beyond the cash transaction, the deal provides a way for the companies to continue working closely together with the least amount of disruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the end, this move is more about maximizing the Dell and VMware stock price [in a way that] doesn&#8217;t impact customers, ISVs or the channel. Wall Street wasn&#8217;t valuing the two companies together nearly as [strongly] as I believe it will as separate entities,&#8221; Moorhead said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It might be strange to hear this from a firm that just raised a $55 million equity fund, but the team at <a href="https://www.upper90.io">Upper90</a> would like to remind you that equity isn&#8217;t the only funding that&#8217;s available.</p>
<p>Upper90 is led by CEO Billy Libby (former head of quantitative education sales at Goldman Sachs) and Chairman Jason Finger (co-founder of Seamless), and it was the first investor in both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/">Thrasio</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/startup-loan/">Clearbanc</a>. The firm offers debt and equity funding, and it <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/upper90-closes-195-million-fund-from-more-than-300-business-builders-301190139.html">just closed a $195 million fund</a> in December — but the fund announced today is Upper90&#8217;s first to be devoted purely to equity financing.</p>
<p>Finger said he and Libby have taken this combined approach because there are often predictable parts of an online business, where (for example) &#8220;if I&#8217;m doing some marketing, I know that $1 on Facebook will generate $8 of revenue.&#8221; In those cases, &#8220;equity is the most expensive way you can finance growth,&#8221; and he said it &#8220;really fundamentally bothered me that the founders and early investors who took a lot of the risks, dedicating their life on a 24/7 basis&#8221; would often end up owning a small percentage of the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean debt is the only solution, but in Finger&#8217;s words, founders should stop seeing big equity rounds as &#8220;a badge of honor.&#8221; Instead, they can work with Upper90 to find the &#8220;optimal capital structure&#8221; combining both elements.</p>
<p>&#8220;Life isn&#8217;t binary,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Part of the reason we launched an equity fund in the [e-commerce] rollup sector is that equity is an important piece for you to get the highest quality lender — they’re going to want to know that there’s equity protection underneath their credit facility.&#8221;</p>

<p>He also suggested that making an equity investment turns Upper90 into a &#8220;long-term partner&#8221; for the companies it backs, freeing the team from being &#8220;purely focused on the returns related to our credit.&#8221;</p>
<p>As alluded to earlier, Libby and Finger see the e-commerce aggregation market as one that&#8217;s particularly well suited to their approach. (Thrasio is perhaps the best-known startup rolling up Amazon sellers, while Clearbanc offers its own revenue-based financing to e-commerce and SaaS companies.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I always say: What’s new is old,&#8221; Libby told me. &#8220;If we had this conversation 15 years ago, we&#8217;d be talking about rolling up gyms and dry cleaners and smoothie shops [ … ] The infrastructure that Amazon has developed allows people to be entrepreneurs in a week, so I think that we’re still extremely early in this trend. There are going to be so many more people starting their own store on Amazon.&#8221;</p>
<p>And eventually, he suggested Upper90 could take a similar approach in other industries: &#8220;A content creator who starts a YouTube channel is not that different than the Amazon store owner. Five years from now, we could be talk about, what&#8217;s the value of a subscriber on YouTube, what&#8217;s the value of an influencer&#8217;s following on Instagram, how can we bring some of that revenue forward?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Good news, Bay Area! Apple Pay now works with Clipper cards.</p>
<p>That means you can now use an iPhone or Apple Watch to pay for BART. Or Muni. Or Caltrain. Or the ferry! Or (almost) any other transit-related thing you&#8217;d otherwise use the plastic Clipper card for.</p>
<p>Clipper has a page <a href="https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/apple-pay">outlining the Apple Pay setup process right here</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2><strong>A few quick but important things to note:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Adding an existing Clipper card to an Apple Wallet apparently <em>transfers</em> the funds off that card. At that point, says Clipper, &#8220;your plastic card has been deactivated&#8221; — so it sounds like it won&#8217;t work as a physical backup card.</li>
<li>Some people will want to hang on to the plastic cards, regardless: Clipper notes that Bay Area bike share users and anyone using an RTC Discount Card will need to keep the plastic card, even after it&#8217;s deactivated for transit use.</li>
<li>Clipper has previously confirmed that support is coming for Google Pay (Android) &#8220;this spring,&#8221; but today&#8217;s rollout seems to support Apple Pay only.</li>
</ul>
<p>As noted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/apple-pay-will-soon-work-on-bart-and-muni/">back in February</a> when this was first confirmed as on the way, Clipper works with Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Express Transit&#8221; feature. That&#8217;s just a fancy way to say that you can tap to pay with the digital Clipper card without first needing to punch in your phone&#8217;s PIN or using FaceID. On <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/models-support-express-cards-power-reserve-iph820e69e53/ios">certain newer iPhones</a>, it also lets you keep using the Clipper card for a few hours after your battery has died; a wonderful thing in a pinch, but probably not something you want to rely on regularly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A cross-party group of 40 MEPs in the European parliament has called on the Commission to strengthen an incoming legislative proposal on artificial intelligence to include an outright ban on the use of facial recognition and other forms of biometric surveillance in public places.</p>
<p>They have also urged EU lawmakers to outlaw automated recognition of people’s sensitive characteristics (such as gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, health status and disability) &#8212; warning that such AI-fuelled practices pose too great a rights risk and can fuel discrimination.</p>
<p>The Commission is expected to presented its proposal for a framework to regulate &#8216;high risk&#8217; applications of AI next week &#8212; but a copy of the draft leaked this week (via <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/european-commission-high-risk-ai-ban-tech">Politico</a>). And, as we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/eu-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-set-fines-as-high-as-4-of-global-turnover-per-leaked-draft/">reported earlier</a>, this leaked draft does not include a ban on the use of facial recognition or similar biometric remote identification technologies in public places, despite acknowledging the strength of public concern over the issue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Biometric mass surveillance technology in publicly accessible spaces is widely being criticised for wrongfully reporting large numbers of innocent citizens, systematically discriminating against under-represented groups and having a chilling effect on a free and diverse society. This is why a ban is needed,&#8221; the MEPs write now in a <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MEP-Letter-to-the-Commission-on-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Biometric-Surveillance.pdf">letter</a> to the Commission which they&#8217;ve also made public.</p>
<p>They go on to warn over the risks of discrimination through automated inference of people&#8217;s sensitive characteristics &#8212; such as in applications like predictive policing or the indiscriminate monitoring and tracking of populations via their biometric characteristics.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="f8vkJ0wXYJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/26/europe-should-ban-ai-for-mass-surveillance-and-social-credit-scoring-says-advisory-group/">Europe should ban AI for mass surveillance and social credit scoring, says advisory group</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe should ban AI for mass surveillance and social credit scoring, says advisory group&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/26/europe-should-ban-ai-for-mass-surveillance-and-social-credit-scoring-says-advisory-group/embed/#?secret=f8vkJ0wXYJ" data-secret="f8vkJ0wXYJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This can lead to harms including violating rights to privacy and data protection; suppressing free speech; making it harder to expose corruption; and have a chilling effect on everyone’s autonomy, dignity and self-expression – which in particular can seriously harm LGBTQI+ communities, people of colour, and other discriminated-against groups,&#8221; the MEPs write, calling on the Commission to amend the AI proposal to outlaw the practice in order to protect EU citizens&#8217; rights and the rights of communities who faced a heightened risk of discrimination (and therefore heightened risk from discriminatory tools supercharged with AI).</p>
<p>&#8220;The AI proposal offers a welcome opportunity to prohibit the automated recognition of gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, disability and any other sensitive and protected characteristics,&#8221; they add.</p>
<p>The leaked draft of the Commission&#8217;s proposal does tackle indiscriminate mass surveillance &#8212; proposing to prohibit this practice, as well as outlawing general purpose social credit scoring systems.</p>
<p>However the MEPs want lawmakers to go further &#8212; warning over weaknesses in the wording of the leaked draft and suggesting changes to ensure that the proposed ban covers &#8220;all untargeted and indiscriminate mass surveillance, no matter how many people are exposed to the system&#8221;.</p>
<p>They also express alarm at the proposal having an exemption on the prohibition on mass surveillance for public authorities (or commercial entities working for them) &#8212; warning that this risks deviating from existing EU legislation and from interpretations by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">the bloc&#8217;s top court in this area</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We strongly protest the proposed second paragraph of this Article 4 which would exempt public authorities and even private actors acting on their behalf &#8216;in order to safeguard public security&#8217;,&#8221; they write. &#8220;Public security is precisely what mass surveillance is being justified with, it is where it is practically relevant, and it is where the courts have consistently annulled legislation on indiscriminate bulk processing of personal data (e.g. the Data Retention Directive). This carve-out needs to be deleted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This second paragraph could even be interpreted to deviate from other secondary legislation which the Court of Justice has so far interpreted to ban mass surveillance,&#8221; they continue. &#8220;The proposed AI regulation needs to make it very clear that its requirements apply in addition to those resulting from the data protection acquis and do not replace it. There is no such clarity in the leaked draft.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission has been contacted for comment on the MEPs&#8217; calls but is unlikely to do so ahead of the official reveal of the draft AI regulation &#8212; which is expected around the middle of next week.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the AI proposal will undergo any significant amendments between now and then. But MEPs have fired a swift warning shot that fundamental rights must and will be a key feature of the co-legislative debate &#8212; and that lawmakers&#8217; claims of a framework to ensure &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; AI won&#8217;t look credible if the rules don&#8217;t tackle unethical technologies head on.</p>

		<a href="https://www.aparavi.com/author/beth/">Beth Winters, JD/MBA</a>, is the solutions marketing manager of <a href="https://www.aparavi.com/">Aparavi</a>, a data intelligence and automation software and services company that helps companies find and unlock the value of data.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Data is the most valuable asset for any business in 2021. If your business is online and collecting customer personal information, your business is dealing in data, which means data privacy compliance regulations will apply to everyone &#8212; no matter the company’s size.</p>
<p>Small startups might not think the world’s strictest data privacy laws &#8212; the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; apply to them, but it’s important to enact best data management practices before a legal situation arises.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Data compliance is not only critical to a company’s daily functions; if done wrong or not done at all, it can be quite costly for companies of all sizes.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For example, failing to comply with the GDPR can result in legal fines of €20 million or 4% of annual revenue. Under the CCPA, fines can also escalate quickly, to the tune of $2,500 to $7,500 <em>per person</em> whose data is exposed during a data breach.</p>
<p>If the data of 1,000 customers is compromised in a cybersecurity incident, that would add up to $7.5 million. The company can also be sued in class action claims or suffer reputational damage, resulting in lost business costs.</p>
<p>It is also important to recognize some benefits of good data management. If a company takes a proactive approach to data privacy, it may mitigate the impact of a data breach, which the government can take into consideration when assessing legal fines. In addition, companies can benefit from business insights, reduced storage costs and increased employee productivity, which can all make a big impact on the company’s bottom line.</p>
<h2>Challenges of data compliance for startups</h2>
<p>Data compliance is not only critical to a company’s daily functions; if done wrong or not done at all, it can be quite costly for companies of all sizes. For example, Vodafone Spain was recently fined <a href="https://www.complianceweek.com/regulatory-enforcement/vodafone-spain-fined-record-972m-for-data-protection-failures/30162.article">$9.72 million</a> under GDPR data protection failures, and <a href="https://www.enforcementtracker.com/">enforcement trackers</a> show schools, associations, municipalities, homeowners associations and more are also receiving fines.</p>
<p>GDPR regulators have issued <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-protection/european-regulators-have-imposed-245-3-million-in-gdpr-fines-to-date-39-more-issued-in-2020/">$332.4 million in fines</a> since the law was enacted almost two years ago and are being more aggressive with enforcement. While California’s attorney general started CCPA enforcement on July 1, 2020, the newly passed California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) only recently created a state agency to more effectively enforce compliance for any company storing information of residents in California, a major hub of U.S. startups.</p>
<p>That is why in this age, data privacy compliance is key to a successful business. Unfortunately, many startups are at a disadvantage for many reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fewer resources and smaller teams </strong>— This means there are no designated data privacy officers, privacy attorneys or legal counsel dedicated to data privacy issues.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of planning </strong>— This might be characterized by being unable to handle data privacy information requests (DSARs, or “data subject access requests”) to help fulfill the customer’s data rights or not having an overall program in place to deal with major data breaches, forcing a reactive instead of a proactive response, which can be time-consuming, slow and expensive.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric truck startup Rivian released Thursday details of its in-house Rivian Insurance program, which it says will be integrated into its digital ordering process.</p>
<p>The insurance will initially be available in 40 states. Keeping in line with the company’s marketing as an “adventure vehicle” company, customers will also have the option to cover their home and recreational equipment, such as boats, dirt bikes and campers. Rivian&#8217;s plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/rivian-is-building-an-in-house-insurance-agency/">start an insurance program</a> first leaked more than a year ago after a job posting was spotted.</p>
<p>What makes the insurance offering stand out, however, is its integration with the Rivian vehicle platform and Driver+ safety suite, which the company said in a <a href="https://stories.rivian.com/rivian-insurance">blog post</a> will help deliver “tailored, data-driven coverage.” Customers who choose Rivian Insurance will get Driver+ rate reductions, with more details to come. Drivers can additionally opt in to a separate program that offers savings for using Rivian’s Active Driver Assistance software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s a clever move for the company, which plans to bring its first electric pickup to market later this year. Like Tesla, Rivian intends to have Rivian Collision Centers and Service Centers performing the work — and by keeping everything in-house, the company is likely thinking customers will be attracted to a seamless insurance program. Rivian Insurance is another instance of the newer entrant following in the veteran’s lead, but with one big advantage: Tesla Insurance is only available to owners in California.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Subscription pricing is landing on Facebook&#8217;s Oculus Store, giving VR developers another way to monetize content on Facebook&#8217;s Oculus Quest headset.</p>
<p>Developers will be allowed to add premium subscriptions to paid or free apps, with Facebook assumedly dragging in their standard percentage fee at the same time. Oculus and the developers on its platform have been riding the success of the company&#8217;s recent Quest 2 headset, which Facebook hasn&#8217;t detailed sales numbers on but has noted that the months-old $299 headset has already outsold every other Oculus headset sold to date.</p>
<p>Subscription pricing is an unsurprising development but signals that some developers believe they have a loyal enough group of subscribers to bring in sizable bits of recurring revenue. Facebook shipped the first Oculus Rift just over five years ago, and it&#8217;s been a zig-zagging path to finding early consumer success during that time. A big challenge for them has been building a dynamic developer ecosystem that offer something engaging to users while ensuring that VR devs can operate sustainably.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At launch, there are already a <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/discover-premium-content-with-subscriptions-on-the-oculus-quest-platform/">few developers</a> debuting subscriptions for a number of different app types, spanning exercise, meditation, social, productivity and DJing. In addition to subscriptions, the new monetization path also allows developers to let users try out paid apps on a free trial basis.</p>
<p>The central question is how many Quest users there are that utilize their devices enough to justify a number of monthly subscriptions, but for developers looking to monetize their hardcore users, this is another utility that they likely felt was missing from the Oculus Store.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">More than half a decade ago, my Battery Ventures partner Neeraj Agrawal penned a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/01/the-saas-travel-adventure/">widely read post</a> offering advice for enterprise-software companies hoping to reach $100 million in annual recurring revenue.</p>
<p>His playbook, dubbed “T2D3” — for “triple, triple, double, double, double,” referring to the stages at which a software company’s revenue should multiply — helped many high-growth startups index their growth. It also highlighted the broader explosion in industry value creation stemming from the transition of on-premise software to the cloud.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and many of T2D3’s insights are still relevant. But now it’s time to update T2D3 to account for some of the tectonic changes shaping a broader universe of B2B tech — and pushing companies to grow at rates we’ve never seen before.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			One of the biggest factors driving billion-dollar B2Bs is a simple but important shift in how organizations buy enterprise technology today.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I call this new paradigm “billion-dollar B2B.” It refers to the forces shaping a new class of cloud-first, enterprise-tech behemoths with the potential to reach <em>$1 billion</em> in ARR — and achieve market capitalizations in excess of $50 billion or even $100 billion.</p>
<p>In the past several years, we’ve seen a pioneering group of B2B standouts &#8212; Twilio, Shopify, Atlassian, Okta, Coupa*, MongoDB and Zscaler, for example &#8212; approach or exceed the $1 billion revenue mark <em>and</em> see their market capitalizations surge 10 times or more from their IPOs to the present day (as of March 31), according to CapIQ data.</p>
<p>More recently, iconic companies like data giant Snowflake and video-conferencing mainstay Zoom came out of the IPO gate at even higher valuations. Zoom, with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zoom-earnings-roared-to-nearly-1-billion-in-2020-and-the-stock-is-rising-again-11614633824">2020 revenue of just under $883 million</a>, is now worth close to $100 billion, per CapIQ data.</p>

<p>In the wings are other B2B super-unicorns like Databricks* and UiPath, which have each raised private financing rounds at valuations of more than $20 billion, per public reports, which is unprecedented in the software industry.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
